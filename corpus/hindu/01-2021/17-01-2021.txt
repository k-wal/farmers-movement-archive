17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccines safe, ignore rumours, says PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the countrywide COVID-19 vaccination drive. He said India-made vaccines were safe and asked people not to believe rumours. He congratulated all Indians and the country’s scientists. He noted that the world had not seen a vaccination drive of this scale, and India’s response to the pandemic had been acknowledged globally. “The vaccines have come about in the shortest time span and this is an achievement for India and its contribution towards the battle against COVID-19. There are 100 countries which do not have a population of three crore but India in the first phase will inoculate three crore healthcare and frontline workers, and in the next step, we will take this number to 30 crore. There are only three countries in the world with more than 30 crore population: India, the U.S. and China. Hence, this is going to be the biggest vaccination drive,” Mr. Modi observed. On the first day, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) medical director Dr. Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr. V.K. Paul were among the first to be vaccinated, along with a sanitation worker at AIIMS. Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla also took the vaccination. “Indian vaccines are much cheaper than foreign ones and easier and more conducive to India’s conditions. There are vaccines abroad whose single dose costs up to Rs. 5,000 and have to be kept in freezers at minus 70 degrees temperature. India-manufactured vaccines are best suited for us,” Mr. Modi said. Mr. Modi said around 60% children of the world would get vaccines manufactured in India. The world put its trust on India’s vaccine science and research. The Prime Minister cautioned the beneficiaries against lowering the guard after getting the vaccine shot. People should remember that the vaccines comprised two shots and had a gap of close to a month between them. “The vaccine starts working 14 days after the complete round is finished. But don’t lower your guard during or after vaccination. The mantra ‘Dawai Bhi, Kadaai Bhi’ should be followed, and the use of mask and social distancing norms is essential,” he stated. The vaccines had been introduced after trials and dry runs. People should safeguard against rumours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccines-safe-ignore-rumours-says-pm/article33591445.ece
17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Vaccine drive launched in Telangana||A 42-year-old woman, S Kishtamma, a sanitation worker at Gandhi Hospital, Hyderabad, was one among the first beneficiaries of COVID-19 vaccination programme launched across 140 government health facilities in Telangana on Saturday morning. Around 321 days after the first COVID-19 case was detected in the State on March 2, 2020, vaccines against the infectious disease are being administered. From March 2 to January 15, a total of 2,91,367 people in the State were detected with coronavirus; 2,85,519 have recovered and 1575 patients have died. On the first day of the immunisation drive, around 4,200 health staff across the State were listed as beneficiaries. There were 30 beneficiaries in each of the 140 session sites. The number of session sites would increase in a phased manner. In the first phase, priority is given to healthcare workers who have been in the forefront of the COVID-19 management. They will be followed by front line workers in other departments such as municipality, police. Thereafter, people above 50 years, and those below 50 with co-morbidities will be given priority. The vaccine will be given in two doses with a gap of 28-days. The State Health department has received 3.64 lakh doses of Covishield, and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. Both the vaccines will be used in the State. Of all the session sites, focus was on Gandhi Hospital where the State Health Minister Eatala Rajender, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy, chief secretary Somesh Kumar, principal secretary of the State Health department Syed Ali Murataza Rizvi, and other officials were present. They attended the virtual inaugural address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Gandhi Hospital was the main COVID Care Centre in the State. From March 2020, the hospital’s healthcare workers at all levels were involved in management of the infectious disease. Large number of police personnel guarded the hospital’s main entrance, restricting entry. While on Friday Mr Rajender said that he would take the vaccine as a confidence building measure, he said on Saturday that the vaccination was limited to COVID warriors based on the Prime Minister’s directions. Mr Rajender said that Covishield vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India was given on Saturday. During a video conference with Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday evening, Mr Rajender said that Co-WIN software is not working in all vaccination centres. “There are many problems in the software,” the Health Minister said requesting some more doses of vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccine-drive-launched-in-telangana/article33592056.ece
17 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||CMD’s remarks spark protest from unions in KSRTC||Within hours of Biju Prabhakar, Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of the KSRTC, alleging that a section of the employees are corrupt and are pushing the transport undertaking into further debt, recognised unions came out against the CMD, demanding withdrawal of the remarks. The CMD, addressing a press conference at the Transport Bhavan on Saturday on the proposed company KSRTC-SWIFT, said a section of the staff was involved in diesel pilferage, diversion of ticket fare collection, and purchase of low quality spare parts in the 94 depots and five regional workshops. “Permanent employees who draw huge salaries have other jobs. Many are cultivating ginger and coffee. In many depots, empanelled employees run the buses. A section of the employees are helping private long-distance buses,” the CMD said. He said disciplinary action would be initiated against Executive Director K.M. Sreekumar for the Rs. 100 crore that went ‘missing’ during 2012-2015 when he was the Accounts Manager. Action would be taken against the Executive Director, Vigilance, P.M. Sheraf Mohammed for reinstating an employee involved in a POCSO case. Termination notices had been issued to the Executive Engineer (Civil), DGM Operations and CA already, he said. “There is no teamwork among the top officials of the KSRTC.” Top leadership of the KSRTC would be changed and those who did not perform would be shown the door. Professionals would be roped in to replace them. A section of employees had been opposing migration from the fossil fuel-driven buses for long, Mr. Prabhakar said. Those who opposed KSRTC-SWIFT would be shifted from the Chief Office first and later removed if the opposition continued. Unions’ protest The INTUC-affiliated Transport Democratic Federation (TDF) took out a march to the Chief Office within hours of the statement demanding that the CMD withdraw the remarks. Other recognised unions of the CITU and BMS are also up in arms against the CMD. CITU State general secretary and MP Elamaram Kareem said the employees were not responsible for KSRTC’s current financial crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cmds-remarks-spark-protest-from-unions-in-ksrtc/article33591606.ece
17 January 2021||CHITTOOR,||Jumbo trio giving sleepless nights to officials, farmers||A three-member herd of wild elephants, which crossed into Chittoor district from Tamil Nadu three weeks ago, is now lingering at a denuded forest stretch between Vadamalapeta and Tirupati, giving sleepless nights to farmers and forest officials. The elephant herd, known in local circles as the ‘Bachelor’s Group’, is now over 150 km away from its habitat in Tamil Nadu. Forest officials tried in vain to drive the herd back into the forests when it entered the outskirts of Chittoor municipality. The herd continued to advance towards the eastern mandals with poor forest cover, scattered amidst agriculture fields and villages. For the last one week, the herd continues to stay put at Karveti Nagaram range. As the possibility of driving the pachyderms back into their forests towards Koundinya wildlife sanctuary is now remote, as the herd has covered a distance of over 150 km, officials are of the view that the herd can now be diverted into the nearby Seshachalam hill range, 30 km from Vadamalapeta mandal, which is where the herd is currently located. The herd’s movement towards the Seshachalam ranges would pose a high risk as the terrain is a sparse jungle, interspersed with a number of villages and vast stretches of agriculture lands. Forest Range Officer (Karveti Nagaram) Sivanna said that on Saturday evening, the herd was temporarily driven into a jungle, adjoining the Gulluru waterbody, near Puttur. As the presence of wild elephants in the plains of Puttur and Vadamalapeta region was never heard of before, it led to tension among farmers engaged in farm activity post rains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jumbo-trio-give-sleepless-nights-to-officials-farmers/article33591370.ece
17 January 2021||KURNOOL,||Orvakal airport cleared for takeoff by DGCA||The Orvakal airport on the outskirts of Kurnool city has got the approval of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) after completion of all the mandatory safety inspections and creation of infrastructure. District Collector G. Veerapandian, in a release on Saturday, said the DGCA approval was granted through a certificate on Friday. “With all the efforts and budgetary support of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath, the Kurnool / Orvakal airport got the DGCA approval after completion of works as per its specifications,” the District Collector said. Airport Director Kailash Mandal thanked all the district officials and public representatives in helping the people’s dream come true. The airport though located at Orvakal will be called Kurnool Airport, Kurnool. The licence has been given to the Andhra Pradesh Airports Development Corporation Limited to operate flights with the airport coordinates notified as Latitude: 15 Deg 42’ 53.120”N, and Longitude 078 Deg 09’ 46.749”E. The licence approves it as Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) category of aerodrome and it needs to follow all the rules as per the Aerodrome Manual, the certificate signed by the DGCA on January 15 said.  Vijayawada Staff Reporter adds: Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy said airlines would start operating flights from March itself, adding that it was the first airport in South India to be entirely developed by a State government. ‘Govt. spent Rs. 150 cr.’ In a release, Mr. Goutham Reddy said the government had spent Rs. 150 crore on the fledgeling airport in 2020 and that it would give a fillip to industrial development in the backward region. The State government was getting facilities like night landing system and a pilot training centre at the airport at a brisk pace to put it on the country’s civil aviation map at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dgca-nod-for-orvakal-airport-in-kurnool/article33591376.ece
17 January 2021||Kolkata,||TMC faces another dissent||Less than 24 hours after Trinamool Congress managed to pacify Satabdi Roy, MP from Birbhum, who had given clear hints of meeting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership, the party on Saturday faced another challenge when Forest Minister Rajib Banerjee said he was going through a test of patience. Mr. Banerjee had expressed dissent in the past but on Saturday he took to social media and questioned why action was not being taken against those who are targeting him after he had raised relevant issue. “I have still not lost patience,” said the Minister and MLA from Domjur in Howrah. He also said that Trinamool Congress workers are unhappy and the gap between the people and the party is widening. Ms. Roy on the other hand took to social media expressing confidence in the leadership of TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee. The actor-turned-politician said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will head the new government again in 2021. The BJP leadership including State unit president Dilip Ghosh urged Mr. Rajib Banerjee to not waste precious time and join the BJP. “The Trinamool Congress has turned into a private company and those who don’t want to work like employees should leave the party immediately,” said BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari who left TMC last month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tmc-faces-another-dissent/article33591637.ece
17 January 2021||Mangaluru,||Low turnout for vaccination in Udupi||Ganapati Hegde, 33, an anaesthetist who worked as an in charge at the isolation ward, Udupi District Government Hospital was the first healthcare professional to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the hospital at Ajjarakadu on Saturday. Though the Udupi district administration had made preparations to vaccinate 538 frontline health care professionals and workers at six centres on the inaugural day, only 286 persons were vaccinated. The district average achievement stood at 53%. According to the health department officials, the drive at TMA Pai Hospital, which was one of the centres, was at 83 %. It was low in other five centres. The officials said that as many feared to get themselves vaccinated the target could not be achieved. Udupi Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha said that it has been planned to vaccinate 22,230 health care workers in the first phase for which 12,000 doses of vaccine have arrived. The government has imparted training to 139 vaccinators. Dr. Hegde said that he got an alert message on his phone at 7.30 a.m. on Saturday which mentioned about the time and location where he had to report to get vaccinated. “All of us had been waiting for this occasion since long to fight against the COVID-19. Hence there is no reason to miss this happy day,” he said. As the vaccination drive will continue to cover all, individuals may receive the alert message about the time and place well in advance, maybe a day or two, he added. A Group D employee at the district hospital Basavaraj Dalawai was the second person to get vaccinated. He said that the procedure for enrolling to get vaccinated was simple and it was hassle free. Another Group ‘D’ employee Ramesh said that he did not have any fear as the vaccination had been approved after enough clinical trials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/low-turnout-for-vaccination-in-udupi/article33592134.ece
17 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Govt. to expand Kudumbashree’s role||The Kudumbashree has an important role to play in achieving the target of complete eradication of poverty that was announced in the Budget, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was interacting with Kudumbashree community development society chairpersons from all districts to receive suggestions about a new Kerala (‘Nava Kerala’) through video conference here on Saturday. Mr. Vijayan said the government saw the Kudumbashree as a catalyst for building a new Kerala. It had provided strong support to the four missions announced by the government. Hence, it should look beyond the Destitute-free Kerala project and help eradicate absolute poverty. Uniquely placed The Kudumbashree also took the government’s welfare schemes to the people through its 45-lakh members. This in effect meant that Kudumbashree was connected to nearly half the families in the State. Hence, it was uniquely placed to understand the needs and problems of each family. Empowering role The Kudumbashree network was also in a position to look into the support and training required by women in each family who could work, but were unemployed. This would help design skill training programme suited to them and achieve the goal of skill development and training for lakhs of women. The State had faced disasters one after the other in recent years. The Kudumbashree had risen to the challenges posed by them. Even during the pandemic, the Kudumbashree’s community kitchens and Janakeeya hotels ensured no one went hungry, he said. Its activities to implement government schemes for the elderly and the differently abled, creation of 40,917 jobs as part of the 100-day programme, work in the areas of waste management, and construction of houses as part of the Life Mission by its construction teams also came in for praise. Budget scheme The Chief Minister urged them to implement the fish farming project announced in the Budget to increase their income. The success of the Kudumbashree’s activities was visible in the increase in Budget allocation for it from Rs. 75 crore in 2015-16 to Rs. 1,749 in this Budget, the Chief Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-to-expand-kudumbashrees-role/article33591601.ece
17 January 2021||Mumbai,||BMC halts vaccination||The Brihanmumbai Municpial Corporation (BMC) on Saturday said the vaccination drive in the city would be halted on Sunday and Monday due to a snag in the CoWIN application, which is being used by people to register for the vaccine.  The BMC said, “Glitches were observed in CoWIN app following which offline registration was allowed today. But the government has made digital registration mandatory. Vaccination will be suspended till the glitches are rectified.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bmc-halts-vaccination/article33592154.ece
17 January 2021||Mangaluru,||229 persons inoculated as against target of 508||As many as 229 healthcare workers were inoculated against COVID-19 while 62 refused to get vaccinated on the inaugural day of the vaccination drive in Dakshina Kannada district on Sunday. The administration had planned to inoculate 508 persons. This included 96 at District Government Wenlock Hospital, 75 at the Urban Primary Health Centre, Surathkal, 83 at taluk hospital, Bantwal, 84 at TH, Belthangady, 97 at TH Sullia, and 73 at TH, Puttur. As against the target, 20, 45, 40, 35, 45, and 44 healthcare workers respectively were inoculated at these centres by the end of the sessions. The first of the vaccines was administered to Robin Antony Monteiro, working at the medicine section, OPD, Wenlock. Inaugurating the programme at the Wenlock, district in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary said India was able to develop a vaccine to fight COVID-19 at a time when the country along with others had faced several problems. Mr. Poojary said India was able to prevent further spread of the pandemic by strictly following the guidelines. This was despite people and the economy suffering heavily due to the lockdowns, he noted. He congratulated the administrative machinery as well as general public for effectively facing the pandemic. Minister S. Angara said spread of the pandemic could be prevented if everyone followed the guidelines. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra, Mayor Divakar, MLAs D. Vedavyas Kamath and Y. Bharath Shetty, zilla panchayat president Meenakshi Shanghigodu and vice-president Kasturi Panja, CEO R. Selvamani, DHO Ramachandra Bairy, District RCH officer B.V. Rajesh, and others were present. Chairing the district disaster management committee meeting later in the day, Dr. Rajendra urged officials to take steps to prevent the second wave of COVID-19. While people were suffering from the second wave abroad, India still has not seen the second wave. Yet, there was no place for complacency, he said. He said those returning from abroad and those entering the district for education and profession should compulsorily undergo COVID-19 test. Educational institutions should compulsorily follow the protocol, he added. Social distancing and wearing of masks should be ensured at all public places and programmes at private places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/229-persons-inoculated-as-against-target-of-508/article33592132.ece
17 January 2021||New Delhi,||NIA summons farm leader, TV journalist||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has summoned around 40 persons to be examined as ‘witness’ in a fresh case registered against the Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a foreign-based group that advocates secessionist and pro-Khalistani activities in India. A senior government official said the summons were served to “ascertain details relating to the investigation”. Among those who were sent notices on January 15 were a farm leader, a TV journalist, a cable TV operator, a tourist bus owner, an actor, a sweet shop owner and other businessmen. They have been asked to appear at the NIA’s Delhi headquarters from January 18-21. Asked if any farmer leader engaged in the ongoing dialogue with the Centre had also received summons, the official said: “They need to be examined as witnesses to ascertain details of the investigation. A number of people have been called and we are not aware about their profession or if they are involved in the farmers’ agitation or engaged in dialogue with the government.” The notices have been issued under Section 160 Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)-Police officer’s power to require attendance of witnesses in FIR no 40/2020 under various Sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Last week, the Supreme Court had suspended the implementation of the three farm laws until further notice and appointed a committee to resolve the issue. The farmers’ unions have so far held nine rounds of discussions with two Union Ministers — Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal — that have remained inconclusive. The leaders raised the issue of various government agencies sending notices to people associated with the agitation with the Ministers.  The Hindu spoke to some of the persons summoned by the NIA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nia-summons-farm-leader-tv-journalist/article33591432.ece
17 January 2021||New Delhi,||4,319 health workers get vaccine shot in Delhi||The COVID-19 vaccination drive started in Delhi on Saturday, as part of the national roll-out, with 4,319 healthcare workers being vaccinated at 81 sites across the city. Both Covaxin and Covishield vaccines were used during the drive. Total 81 centres Each of the 81 centres had aimed to cover 100 workers on the first day, but many fell short of the target of 8,100 despite a hand-picked list of people. While a lot of healthcare workers adopted a wait-and-watch approach, many volunteered for the drive. Directions were issued to inoculate only those healthcare workers who were below 50 years of age to avoid any possible complications. Hence the people to be inoculated on the first day were not randomly selected, according to officials. Health Minister Satyendar Jain said the vaccination drive was “successfully” conducted on the first day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/4319-health-workers-get-vaccine-shot-in-delhi/article33591749.ece
17 January 2021||Furfura,||Furfura pilgrimage site is the epicentre of Muslim politics in West Bengal||Teeming with thousands of people who travel here in hundreds of vehicles, Furfura, a village in West Bengal’s Hooghly district, about 50 km from Kolkata, transforms every Friday morning into a major pilgrimage centre. Before the afternoon prayers, people queue up at the mazar (shrine) of Hazrat Abu Baqar Siddique (1846-1939), a prominent peer (holy person) of the town. While locals hesitate to say how old the tomb might be, they agree that this is the second most prominent mazar in the country after Ajmer Sharif in Rajasthan. On January 3, 2021 AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi visited Furfura Sharif and met Abbas Siddique, the peerzada and secretary of Furfura Sharif, at his office-cum-residence. The meeting generated a lot of attention in political circles. It became the first instance of the coming together of the minority Urdu-speaking and majority Bengali-speaking Muslims of the State. The AIMIM chief unequivocally announced his support for Mr. Siddique in the upcoming Assembly polls. “I realised that if I have to make the Majlis (AIMIM) flag strong, I have to pay obeisance to Furfura Sharif,” Mr. Owaisi said. On his meeting with Mr. Owaisi, Mr. Siddique said: “We are in the process of forming a Muslim tribal front in West Bengal and are in talks with several groups, including Left parties and the Congress. The meeting with Mr. Owaisi is also a part of a series of meetings we are having,” he said. The religious leader claimed that he would announce the front by the end of January, and that the front would put up candidates for about 100 seats. Asked whether this front would not split the Muslim votes and help the BJP, Mr. Siddique said: “It is only because of Mamata Banerjee that the BJP has been able to have a foothold in the State and the very existence of Muslims is at stake.” Toha Siddique, another representative of the family, however said: “Abbas Siddique is young, but we will not allow any development that will malign the image of the place and help communal forces.” The developments at Furfura have created ripples in Kolkata. Representatives of the Imam Association of Bengal issued a statement saying that Muslims in Bengal could not be divided.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/furfuras-medieval-shrine-is-epicentre-of-muslim-politics-in-west-bengal/article33591751.ece

Vaccination was held at 133 sites across the State. While the State had targeted to vaccinate 11,138 persons on launch day, at many session sites, 70-95 % of the target could be achieved as many healthcare workers who had registered earlier had to be dropped as they did not fit the criteria. Palakkad administered the maximum number of vaccination at 857. The State had received 4,33,500 doses of COVISHIELD vaccine, which is being administered only after reserving a second dose for the beneficiaries.

17 January 2021||CHENNAI,||In T.N., just 2,783 health workers get the jab||In Tamil Nadu, 16.8% of healthcare providers took the COVID-19 vaccine on the first day of immunisation on Saturday. The State has the capacity to vaccinate 16,600 people a day but only 2,783 got the shot on Saturday — the most in Chennai (348) and the least in Perambalur (2). Vaccination was launched at 166 centres — the Serum Institute of India’s Covishield at 160 centres and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin at six. Each centre has the capacity to vaccinate 100 persons a day. A total of 2,684 of the planned 16,000 persons took Covishield, while 99 of the 600 persons opted for Covaxin. In fact, two of the six centres that rolled out Covaxin — the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital and the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College Hospital, Tiruchi — had no takers. No adverse event after immunisation was reported. However, Health Department officials said this was not a target-approach, but the exercise was based on the willingness of healthcare providers. Several doctors, expressing apprehensions about the vaccines, chose to wait and watch before making a decision. Health officials and hospital authorities hoped for an improvement in the response from doctors in the coming days. Chennai and Salem had the most number of vaccination sites, with 12 each. In Chennai, 310 of the 1,200 healthcare providers/workers took Covishield. Salem followed with 288 of the 1,200 persons. At Tiruppur, the vaccine was administered to 195 persons, while in Madurai, where the programme was launched by the Chief Minister, 146 of the total 500 persons took the vaccine. There were 107 takers in Tiruvallur and 103 each in Cuddalore and Tiruvarur. Some of the districts that ended with the lowest figures were Perambalur-2/100, Nagapattinam-10/400, Ariyalur-14/300, Ranipet-15/300, Kallakurichi-21/200 and Pudukottai-23/400. Of the 99 persons who opted for Covaxin, 40 received it at the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, 38 at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai, 20 at the Chengalpattu Medical College Hospital and one at the Pudukottai Medical College Hospital. The vaccination took off across the State even as many doctors chose to wait and watch before making a decision. “Most of the doctors at my hospital are not willing to get vaccinated. The hesitancy is mainly due to the fear about safety and the fact that these vaccines came about at such a short span of time,” a hospital authority said. A senior government doctor in Chennai said authorities struggled to get willingness from doctors and staff members until a day before the vaccination. “Many staff moved away from the place when we asked whether they were willing to take the vaccine, while some others switched off their phones. We were struggling to get even 25 persons. But the response was good on the day of vaccination, and some want to come on Monday,” he said. A doctor at the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Government Estate, said he might take the vaccine after a week. “Everyone prefers to wait and watch. Not many are enthusiastic about volunteering,” he said. Another government doctor of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital questioned how they could take the vaccines when the results of the phase-3 trials were yet to be published. “Scientifically, this is a wrong move. I still do not know why the government is launching the vaccines in haste,” he said. Many doctors objected to taking Covaxin. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, one of the six centres that offered Covaxin, 38 doctors took the vaccine. Among them were the Dean, two directors, four professors and 20 staff members of two Indian Council of Medical Research institutes — the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis and the National Institute of Epidemiology. The screening and consent form for Covaxin said, “In phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, Covaxin has demonstrated the ability to produce antibodies against COVID-19. However, the clinical efficacy of Covaxin is yet to be established and it is still being studied in phase 3 clinical trial. Hence, it is important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to COVID-19 need not be followed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-tn-2783-healthcare-workers-get-the-jab/article33591481.ece
17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||WhatsApp pushes policy rollout to May 15||Following a severe backlash over the latest update to its privacy policy, Facebook-owned WhatsApp on Saturday said it has pushed back the policy rollout by three months to May 15. “We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand the facts,” the company said in a blog post. WhatsApp, for whom India is among the biggest markets with over 400 million users, said, “We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms. No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8.” The company said it will also do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp and “we’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15”. WhatsApp, it said, was built on a simple idea: what you share with your friends and family stays between you, while stressing that users’ personal conversations are end-to-end encrypted so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see these private messages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/whatsapp-pushes-policy-rollout-to-may-15/article33591431.ece

17 January 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Do not consume alcohol for 45 days after vaccination’||Those who get vaccinated for COVID-19 should not consume alcohol till 45 days after vaccination, said M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). He said consuming alcohol is not advisable after any vaccination. “Consumption of alcohol is known to affect the immune response. This has been seen in other vaccines. There is also a mention of this in the use of Sputnik V vaccine given in Russia,” he told The Hindu on Saturday after getting vaccinated for the virus. Stating that India has come out with two indigenous vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin – with great difficulty, he said, “We should ensure that the benefits of vaccination is maximised.” V. Ravi, who is also part of the TAC, explained that alcohol consumption may lead to impaired liver function in a person who has been vaccinated and the person’s immune response may be compromised. “In such a case, the person may not develop adequate immunogenicity and the purpose of vaccination is defeated,” he said. Sudarshan Ballal, chairman of Manipal Hospitals, who is a part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said binge drinking is not good at any time. “Alcohol decreases a person’s immunity in general. This was advised in Russia as alcohol consumption is a huge issue there. However, US scientists do not recommend abstinence from alcohol during vaccination. But, binge drinking is certainly a no-no,” he said. Continue precautions Calling upon people to continue following COVID-19 precautions even after vaccination, the doctor said, “I would like to warn that the vaccine does not mean you have to let your guard down and give up on a mask, washing hands and social distancing. These measures need to continue in spite of the vaccination.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/do-not-consume-alcohol-for-45-days-after-vaccination/article33591996.ece

Those receiving Covaxin have been asked to sign a consent form before being vaccinated as the vaccine “has been allowed by the government in clinical trial mode”. The form adds that compensation for serious adverse events will be paid by the company if it is proven to be causally related to the vaccine. “The clinical efficacy of Covaxin is yet to be established and it is still being studied in phase 3 clinical trials. Hence, it is important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to COVID-19 need not be followed. The Central Licensing Authority has granted permission for Covaxin for restricted use in emergency situations in public interest... in clinical trial mode,” the form says. The consent form, however, states that in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, COVAXINTM has demonstrated the ability to produce antibodies against COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/consent-form-mandatory-for-covaxin-shot/article33591446.ece

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Between public health and global politics||It is common knowledge that any international agency is only as powerful or important as its funding members want/allow it to be. The World Health Organization (WHO), catapulted to centre stage by the COVID-19 pandemic, is no different. Its funding comes from countries or member states paying their assessed contributions (countries’ membership dues), and voluntary contributions from member states and other partners. In its 72 years of existence, the WHO has seen a lot of ups and downs, and faced a lot of criticism, more so in the past year, but it has always been called on to anchor and guide member nations in times of a global health crisis. With its army of specialists and access to information and best practices across the world, it remains the world’s best bet — not only to write out prescriptions, but also maintain a vigil over inequities and access to health care services. Its avowed aim is “to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. Our goal is to ensure that a billion more people have universal health coverage, to protect a billion more people from health emergencies, and provide a further billion people with better health and well-being.” Universal health coverage and health emergencies continue to be its two-pronged focus areas. It was on April 7, 1948, that the WHO came into being with 61 members on board. It’s precursor was the Office of International Public Health that was formed in 1907 conceived with the idea of creating a pan-national outfit that would coordinate nations’ responses to public health crises. The WHO works through its country offices that report to six regional offices. Immunisation drive The seeds for the organisation’s arguably biggest success — the elimination of small pox — might have been sown with its efforts to intensify the immunisation campaign globally. Small pox, also caused by a virus, was one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity before it was eradicated. Edward Jenner had developed a vaccine way back in 1796, but vaccination received a boost with the WHO prioritising immunisation. It was in 1980 that the WHO declared that the disease had been eliminated from the world, through sheer human effort. If one is looking at reasons for the pre-eminent, compelling need for an organisation such as the WHO, technically one need look no further than small pox. Its work on malaria, and neglected tropical diseases, among others, also are recognised. It was as a result of the criticism that it failed to pick up rampaging Ebola in the 1990s, and delayed picking up HIV/AIDS early enough, that the WHO rolled out the Global Public Health Intelligence Network in 1997, to predict potential epidemics using information on the Internet, and function as an early warning alert. With the growing use of the Internet, such a system gains better traction, and in 2000, it was supplemented with the Global Outbreak Alert Response Network (GOARN). And yet, criticism was laid at the door of the WHO, because of its initial measured response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 23, 2020, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s Director General, said it was early to declare “a public health emergency of international concern”. And yet, a week later, the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alarm. At that time, there were 98 cases and no deaths in 18 countries outside China. Four countries had evidence (eight cases) of human-to-human transmission outside China. “For the moment,” Dr. Tedros said, “the WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade. We recommend exit screening at airports as part of a comprehensive set of containment measures.” The Director General’s lavish praise for China in handling the crisis also came in for criticism. “We would have seen many more cases outside China by now — and probably deaths — if it were not for the government’s efforts, and the progress they have made to protect their own people and the people of the world.” “The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. So is China’s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries.” Clearly, he had spoken too soon. Outgoing American President Donald Trump tore into the WHO with being a China acolyte, cut funding and pulled the U.S. out of the organisation. Changing statements Later, changing statements on the use of masks, hydroxychloroquine and even the mode of transmission, by the WHO, have raised eyebrows. But it is also necessary to understand the nature of the functioning of the WHO and the nature of the beast, or the virus, in this case. The WHO works with information shared with it by nations, China, in this case. It is bound by these limitations, as also its innate inability to police nations, or have them conform with recommendations. Representatives of the WHO also repeatedly mentioned, in their defence, that they were guided by scientific principles, backed by solid evidence, and in an evolving epidemic, instructions must necessarily be dynamic. Subsequently in March, the WHO issued a consolidated package of existing guidance covering the preparedness, readiness and response actions for four different transmission scenarios: no cases, sporadic cases, clusters of cases and community transmission. It unleashed its armamentarium to help the world handle its most unprecedented health crises of all time. SOLIDARITY trial The WHO and its partners launched the SOLIDARITY trial, an international clinical trial that aims to generate robust data from around the world to find the most effective treatments for COVID-19. It was designed to accelerate the process of conducting randomised clinical trials which normally take years to design, conduct, and see the results of. The organisation also worked with the European Commission and multiple partners to launch the ACT Accelerator, to ensure that once a vaccine is available, it’s available to everyone — especially those who are at the greatest risk. The battle against COVID-19 is far from over. While vaccines are now available, and the administration of the vaccine has begun, challenges continue in monitoring this massive immunisation exercise, and ensuring that every one has access to the recommended doses. The WHO also has a duty to counter the fatigue that has set in after prolonged efforts to test, quarantine and treat COVID-19. “This is a defining moment in the pandemic, health workers are stretched and we are seeing supplies of oxygen run dangerously low in some countries. We must act together as common humanity and roll out vaccines to health workers and those highest at risk,” Dr. Tedros said recently. The COVID-19 pandemic that has over 93 million cases and over 2 million deaths so far might just have sealed the WHO’s place in the UN firmament, it’s place in a world that lives in fear of pathogens, cemented its raison d’être and possibly, secured its funding component.  In Focus WHO came into being on April 7, 1948, with 61 members on board Its avowed aim is “to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable” In its early decades, the organisation played a critical role in eliminating small pox from the world.

17 January 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Farmers want legal guarantee for MSP, repeal of farm laws’||Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav on Saturday voiced his support to the farmers’ protest in Delhi and sought to know if the Union government was even listening to them. “From day one, protesting farmers have been demanding that all three laws be repealed and that legal guarantee be provided for minimum support price for farm products. But the Union government is not listening to them,” he said at a press conference on Saturday following an open consultation meeting on farm laws organised by the Aikya Horata Samiti, a coalition of farmers. Farmers’ leaders from States including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana took part in the meeting. Mr. Yadav said farmers had given an ultimatum to the government to meet their demands by January 26. If it fails to do so, then lakhs of farmers across the country would participate in a ‘Kisan Parade’ on January 26 in Delhi in a peaceful manner, he said. Karnataka farmers, who cannot come to Delhi on January 26, can participate in a tractor rally on the same day in Bengaluru. The rally will be conducted after the Republic Day parade. “We are in the middle of a truly historic farmers’ agitation of a kind that this country has never seen. Farmers have come from all over the country and their resolve is unmatched. They have been protesting for over 50 days in the cold. The government had thought that the numbers would dwindle after a few days, but they have only risen,” he added. He pointed out that protesters were getting support from people who have got nothing to do with farming. “This has become an iconic movement in the country,” he told the media. Mr. Yadav accused the Union government of resorting to “dirty tricks” by labelling the protest as a local uprising by rich farmers, Khalistanis, and so on. “Nothing has worked because in India one cannot villainise farmers,” he said. He accused the Centre of not being serious about demands of farmers and holding talks only to create an impression in the media that it is listening to them. “Nothing is happening in those meetings; the government is not willing to acknowledge what the farmers really want. That is why the farmers have had no option but to intensify the movement going forward,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-want-legal-guarantee-for-msp-repeal-of-farm-laws/article33591566.ece
17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||No case of hospitalisation so far: govt.||After a review of the first day of the COVID-19 vaccination drive, the Health Ministry on Saturday said a total of 1,91,181 beneficiaries were vaccinated. It said 16,755 personnel were involved in organising the immunisation session sites. “No case of post-vaccination hospitalisation has been reported so far,’’ the Ministry said in the evening. It said a few issues came up, including delay in uploading beneficiary lists, at some sites and healthcare workers were vaccinated though not scheduled. “Resolutions were provided for both the issues.’’ Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the launch of the world’s largest vaccination drive marked the culmination of five months’ hard work and that it has been a day of tremendous relief. ‘All areas covered’ “With our population and a history of Universal Immunization Program which involves targeted vaccination against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases, India stands at the cusp of recording history and shows the way to peers across the globe. After smallpox and polio, it is the turn of COVID-19. All the remote, hard to reach areas, urban slums, tribal belts are all covered in Saturday’s exercise,” he said. Dr. Vardhan said more than a lakh vaccinators were trained and multiple mock exercises and a pan-India national exercise were conducted to hammer out the slightest glitches. Use of technology “Technology was used to bolster performance as the eVIN platform was re-purposed to CoWIN, SMS sent to all beneficiaries since the last two days [for Saturday’s session] which would be repeated on schedule for their second dose and across all beneficiaries in all sessions.” The Minister said a pro-active, pre-emptive and graded approach with a meticulous monitoring of the trajectory of the disease, effective clinical management have enabled a valiant fight and saved Indian people to a very large extent. He noted that India has the highest recovery — more than 96% — and the lowest fatality rate below 1.5%. ‘Route to victory’ Calling the vaccines the “route to victory”, he said: “The vaccine will be remembered like a Sanjeevani for clinching the victory over COVID-19.” “We need to counter the rumours and myth mongering in relation to administering the vaccines. People should not be misguided by the misinformation campaigns and believe only credible and authentic information.’’ The Union Health Minister visited the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the Gangaram Hospital, where he interacted with the healthcare and frontline workers and saluted their spirit of serving the nation. “We have been safe because of your continued and selfless contribution for so many months,’’ Dr. Vardhan told them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-case-of-hospitalisation-so-far-govt/article33591388.ece
17 January 2021||Hassan,||We need to change the way we view police: Shah||Home Minister Amit Shah, who arrived on a two-day visit to Karnataka on Saturday, laid the foundation stone for establishing a unit of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) at Bhadravati in Shivamogga district. The RAF, the specialised wing of the Central Reserve Police Force, will be the first battalion of its kind in the State. The State government has provided the CRPF with 50.29 acres of land for the purpose. The unit at Bhadravati will cater to the needs of 39 districts spread over Karnataka, Kerala, and Goa. The RAF is specialised in handling riots and other major law and order situations. Mr. Shah said Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had written to him seeking an RAF unit in the State, promising suitable land. The unit would help ensure peace in Karnataka and neighbouring States, said Mr. Shah. Among government officials, the job of the police is the toughest. We need to change the way we look at the police. The police do not get a holiday even to celebrate festivals. They will be on the field to maintain law and order. Many have sacrificed their lives while on duty,” he said. The Centre, under the leadership of Narendra Modi, had taken many steps to modernise the police force. The government had allotted Rs. 800 crore for the purpose. “We have started Indian National Defence University and National Forensic Sciences University, the first of its kind in the world. I suggest the Chief Minister to set up colleges in Karnataka with affiliation to these universities,” he said. Stating that recognising the sacrifice of police personnel, the Centre had set up a national police memorial in Delhi, he appealed to the public to visit the memorial. “Your gesture to appreciate the police force and their sacrifice would boost the morale of the force,” he said. The establishment would involve officers’ quarters, a central school, a hospital, parade ground, playground, and other essential amenities. Mr. Shah lauded Mr. Yediyurappa’s leadership in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and said the government would complete its full term in office. Mr. Shah said the BJP government would complete the full term and the party would come to power again after the 2023 Assembly elections in the State. The Opposition Congress need not have doubts about the completion of the term by the BJP government, he said. After the virtual inauguration of the police quarters under Police Gruha-2020 scheme and Police Gruha-2025 in various parts of the city, the Home Minister said Karnataka’s fight against the pandemic was “very good” and appreciated the Bengaluru police’s role in maintaining the law and order during the lockdown. He also inaugurated Indian Reserve Battalion unit’s administrative office building at Tikota, Vijaypura district.

17 January 2021||New Delhi,||Gyawali presses for border resolution||India and Nepal have weathered the last year of a strain in ties over the boundary issue, said visiting Nepal Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali, but stressed that the dispute over Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyudhara areas should be resolved for the benefit of “future generations”. “Nepal wants to resolve this problem so we can have an undisputed, peaceful stable boundary. These are issues awaiting discussion and interaction from the leadership, so that we can focus on the future free from historical baggage for the future generations,” Mr. Gyawali told journalists during an interaction on Saturday morning, at the end of a three-day visit when he attended the 6th India Nepal Joint Commission meeting with External affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. Mr. Gyawali also met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and discussed bilateral ties on Saturday. This was the first Nepali ministerial visit since tensions over the boundary demarcation erupted in May 2020. “The Raksha Mantri (Defence Minister Singh) conveyed his personal connect, long association with leadership and special regard for the people of Nepal. Both the dignitaries expressed their satisfaction at the excellent military-to-military cooperation. Raksha Mantri stated that India is ready to provide Humanitarian assistance & Disaster Relief (HADR) training & capacity building of Nepal,” a Defence Ministry statement said. However, in a possible indicator that India is still displeased over the Nepal government’s decision to amend its map to include Indian territories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not have a meeting with Mr. Gyawali. Sources told The Hindu that the Nepali delegation had requested a meeting, and hoped it would be granted, given that Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli had granted meetings to Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla, Army Chief General Manoj Naravane, and R&AW chief Samant Goyal when they visited Kathmandu on separate occasions last year. Speaking to the media, Mr. Gyawali said he would inform them “later” about the possibility of meeting the Prime Minister, indicating he had expected the meeting would materialise. According to former Ambassador to Nepal Rakesh Sood, the Prime Minister’s decision was a signal that despite a thaw in ties, all is not well between New Delhi and Kathmandu yet. “I think the fact that there was no call on the Prime Minister [Modi] during Mr. Gyawali’s visit is a message to the Oli government that India is still looking for more signs of flexibility, and that it isn’t all hunky-dory,” Mr. Sood told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gyawali-presses-for-border-resolution/article33591413.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Boots on the ground||Given the ferocity of the pro-Donald Trump mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, and intelligence from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that further attacks may be planned, authorities in Washington are taking no chances and deploying close to 20,000 National Guard troops to secure proceedings for President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20. However, questions remain as to why the National Guard were not deployed in force on the day of the mob attack. Events of January 6 While the Guard in Washington was under the command of President Trump on the day of the Capitol attack, the orders to deploy are typically issued by the Secretary of the Army at the request of the Mayor. On that fateful day, other officials also weighed in on the use of the Guard, yet the details of how exactly that decision was made is the subject of debate. The most controversial aspect of the action taken on January 6 is that despite pleas to the Pentagon from Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, for National Guard boots on the ground, officials were quoted as saying that Director of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt said he could not recommend his boss, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, approve the request and that he did not like “the visual of a line of National Guard soldiers in front of the Capitol.” The manner in which these events played out warrants a closer look at the role of the National Guard as a protective force, the command-and-control structure that undergirds its operation, and the history of its deployment. State-level force Under U.S. statute, what is known as the ‘National Guard’ comprises both the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. The former, however, is colloquially what is referred to as National Guard in the context of ground deployment, as in the case of the U.S. Capitol building attack. In this regard, the ‘Army National Guard’ refers to that part of the organised militia of the States of the U.S. as well as the country’s Territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. This cohort includes active and inactive troops, which together make up a land force that is trained and has statutorily appointed officers. The force is organised, armed, and equipped wholly or partly at Federal expense, and it is federally recognised. Defined broadly, the purpose of the National Guard is to serve as a unique element of the U.S. military, for both “community and country.” It is, therefore, tasked with equal responsibility to respond to domestic emergencies as it is to overseas combat missions, anti-drug initiatives, rescue and reconstruction missions and beyond. Typically, the authority to mobilise the National Guard rests with the Governor of the State in question or, in the case of Washington, with the President of the U.S. The terms of service of the National Guard varies from that of Army enlistment because Guardsmen are permitted to hold civilian jobs or attend college while maintaining their military training as a part-time occupation. Guardsmen also primarily serve in their home States. History of deployment The first militia regiments in North America were organised in Massachusetts in 1636. At the time the intent was that the colony's militia would be organised into three permanent regiments to better defend the colony. In the modern day, the descendants of those three comprise the oldest units in the U.S. military. There have been 12 occasions since the enactment of the 1952 Armed Forces Reserve Act when the National Guard has been deployed under the control of the U.S. President, most of which were during the upheavals of the civil rights movement through the 1960s. Other than these incidents, the Guard was mobilised by the President for the New York City postal strike of 1970, the looting in the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo struck in 1989, and to quell the riots after the Rodney King verdict in 1992. Given the level of bitter polarisation in the U.S. and the periodic outbreak of violent attacks since Mr. Trump entered office, the possibility that Mr. Biden will have to deploy the National Guard during his term cannot be ruled out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/boots-on-the-ground/article33591415.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Collateral damage||On January 14, the U.S. Department of Defense released its latest list of what it called “Communist Chinese military companies” operating in the U.S., as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The aim was “to highlight and counter the People’s Republic of China’s Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernisation goals of the People’s Liberation Army by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities.” Since the first such list was released in June last year, the U.S. has named some of China’s most well-known state-run firms, such as the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) that manufacture aircraft, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Corporation (CNEEC), and the telecommunications giant Huawei. The latest list, however, included a surprising name — Xiaomi, a 10-year-old smartphone and smart appliances manufacturer that has made a name for itself, both in China and abroad, for its cutting edge consumer products. The company immediately issued a statement, saying it “is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military”. The listing of Xiaomi sheds a spotlight on the unique space it occupies in China’s private sector, as well as the broader challenge that firms in China that have sought to differentiate themselves from state-backed entities increasingly face overseas. Founded in 2010, Xiaomi (pronounced ‘sheow-me’) was a start-up that entered an already highly competitive smartphone market. Their initial modus operandi was to sell phones close to manufacturing cost, while making money off accessories and other smart devices from smart bands to air purifiers and smart rice cookers, and avoiding investment into brick and mortar retail stores. They relied on the Internet and in creating a buzz about their young brand. One such method was to create its own MIUI platform, an Android-based operating system that differentiated its products. This model allowed the company to make rapid inroads into its competitors’ markets both at home and abroad. As of August last year, Huawei still enjoyed a dominating 45% smartphone market share, according to a report from market intelligence firm IDC, greater than its next three rivals, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, whose share is a little over 10%. Overseas success Xiaomi’s great success has been overseas. Last year, the company said it ranks in the top five in 50 global smartphone markets, and with the largest market share in India and Spain, second in France and Russia, fourth in China, Germany, Indonesia and South Korea, and fifth in Brazil, Malaysia and Singapore. For Xiaomi, the listing in the U.S. could hurt its carefully built reputation as an upstart Chinese start-up. If Huawei was the all-powerful telecom firm that was loved by the state as a national champion even if it was a private company, Xiaomi has positioned itself as an outsider rival, a message conveyed even in its name, which means “millet”. Its founder Lei Jun once said he was inspired by the humble crop and a Chinese saying that the Buddha, even in one grain of rice, could see a mountain. The U.S. listing also highlights the broader global debate about how “private” Chinese companies can truly be, at a time when the Communist Party has increasingly made it clear entrepreneurs should be patriots first and serve the state, as underlined in recent actions against e-commerce giant Alibaba. On the spectrum of Chinese private firms, Xiaomi has sought to position itself as far as it can from hardware manufacturing telecom firms such as Huawei, cultivating the image of a company that relies more on individual consumers than state contracts. If the U.S. description of Xiaomi as a “Communist Chinese military company” might appear a stretch, that will matter little for President Donald Trump, as he leaves behind a parting gift for China. The greater concern for Xiaomi is how much it will matter to its customers, from India and Indonesia to Brazil and beyond.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/collateral-damage/article33591419.ece
17 January 2021||Ahmedabad,||Gujarat rivers remain highly polluted||The unchecked flow of untreated industrial effluent into rivers in Gujarat has led to increasing pollution in the Sabarmati, Mahisagar, Narmada, Vishwamitri and Bhadar. According to data from the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), the Sabarmati is among the most polluted rivers in the country. Gujarat ranks fourth among the top five States with highly polluted rivers, with as many as 20 rivers in the critically polluted category. Recently, a thick froth on the Mahisagar, along a stretch of several kilometres, raised serious concern, prompting the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to constitute a high-level committee to study the rising level of pollution in the river. “Pollution in rivers has emerged as a major threat in the last few years because the lackadaisical approach of the authorities has emboldened the industries to discharge untreated effluents into flowing rivers,” said Vadodara-based environmental activist Rohit Prajapati. He said that both treated and untreated effluent is released into the estuary of the Mahisagar and Gulf of Cambay, flouting the guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). As per the official parameters, if the chemical oxygen demand (COD), which indicates organic pollutant load, is higher than 250 mg per litre, then it should not be released into the rivers. “Most of the Gujarat rivers where the effluents are dumped into, the COD level is in the range of 700 to 1000 mg per litre. While Dissolved Oxygen (DO) level [indicating the health of a river] in perennial rivers like Mahisgar should be in the range of 6 to 8 mg per litre, it is actually below 2.9 mg per litre,” he added. In December 2020, Mr. Prajapati and a few others wrote a letter to the State authorities providing evidence, including videos and photographs, of how toxic effluents were being dumped into the Mahisagar and other rivers by industries. “The Vadodara Enviro Channel Ltd, which runs a 55-km-long pipeline to discharge treated effluents into the deep sea, releases the effluents into the river. The effluents are not getting discharged into the deep sea as required,” a former official of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board told The Hindu . Now, the State government has proposed a Rs. 2,300 crore project for a deep sea effluent disposal pipeline to cater to nearly 4,500 industrial units. The project will serve four highly industrialised districts (Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Kheda and Rajkot), which are the main sources of pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gujarat-rivers-remain-highly-polluted/article33591401.ece
17 January 2021||Furfura,||Furfura pilgrimage site is the epicentre of Muslim politics in West Bengal||Teeming with thousands of people who travel here in hundreds of vehicles, Furfura, a village in West Bengal’s Hooghly district, about 50 km from Kolkata, transforms every Friday morning into a major pilgrimage centre. Before the afternoon prayers, people queue up at the mazar (shrine) of Hazrat Abu Baqar Siddique (1846-1939), a prominent peer (holy person) of the town. While locals hesitate to say how old the tomb in a light green shrine with golden domes might be, they agree that this is the second most prominent mazar in the country after Ajmer Sharif in Rajasthan. Over the past several elections, politicians have been visiting Furfura Sharif to offer prayers, and meet the family members of the peer to seek their blessing and support. On January 3, 2021 All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi visited Furfura Sharif and met Abbas Siddique, the peerzada and secretary of Furfura Sharif at his office-cum-residence a few hundred metres away from the shrine. Furfura Sharif was the first stop Mr. Owaisi made during his visit to Bengal earlier this month, and the meeting generated a lot of attention in political circles. It became the first instance of the coming together of the minority Urdu-speaking and majority Bengali-speaking Muslims of the State. The AIMIM chief unequivocally announced his support for Abbas Siddique in the upcoming Assembly polls. “I realised that if I have to make the Majlis (AIMIM) flag strong, I have to pay obeisance to Furfura Sharif,” Mr. Owaisi had said. Fridays are also the days when Mr. Siddique, a young peer , is not addressing rallies in the nearby districts of south Bengal, and meets people and followers in and around Furfura. “We are in the process of forming a Muslim tribal front in West Bengal and are in talks with several groups, including Left parties and the Congress. The meeting with Mr. Owasi is also a part of a series of meetings we are having,” he said. The religious leader claimed that he would announce the front by the end of January, and that the front would put up candidates for about 100 seats. Asked whether this front would not split the Muslim votes and help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mr. Siddique said there was a not a single flag of the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) in West Bengal before 2011. “It is only because of Mamata Banerjee that the BJP has been able to have a foothold in the State and the very existence of Muslims is at stake,” the religious leader, surrounded by his supporters, said. Almost a kilometre before the entry to the village, a bright and towering structure is hard to miss. Toha Siddique, another representative of the family, is holding his daily durbar . Scores of people, including a few youths, who will join a madrassa run by institutions of Furfura, are waiting for his blessing. “Furfura is not a place for political activity, it is a place of religion. Abbas Siddique is young, but we will not allow any development that will malign the image of the place and help communal forces,” Toha Siddque said. The middle-aged religious leader straightaway makes a point on the meeting between Abbas Siddique and Asaduddin Owaisi. “Owaisi is an agent of the BJP, the whole country knows about it. You are all aware of what role he played in Bihar,” he said. The developments at Furfura have created ripples in Kolkata. Representatives of the Imam Association of Bengal issued a statement saying that Muslims in Bengal could not be divided. Md Yahya, the president of the Imam Association, targeted Mr. Owaisi and said that some sections were trying to create a divide among Muslims, which the people of the State would never allow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/furfuras-medieval-shrine-is-the-epicentre-of-muslim-politics-in-west-bengal/article33591404.ece
17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Jal Shakti Minister writes to CMs of A.P., Telangana||Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has asked the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to take the initiative to submit the detailed projects reports (DPRs) of all new projects taken up by the two governments, as agreed at the Apex Council meeting held on October 6, last. In separate letters addressed to the Chief Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, respectively, Mr. Shekhawat reminded them of the decision taken at the Apex Council meeting, wherein they had agreed to submit the DPRs of all new projects to the Krishna and Godavari River Management Boards (KRMB and GRMB, respectively) constituted under the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Just one DPR The Union Minister said that while Andhra Pradesh had submitted only one DPR out of 19 new projects taken up after the bifurcation of the combined Andhra Pradesh, including 15 in the Krishna basin and four in the Godavari basin, Telangana had not given the DPR for any of the 15 projects taken up, including seven in the Krishna basin and eight in Godavari basin. Andhra Pradesh had submitted the DPR of the Purushottapatnam lift irrigation scheme, he noted. Statutory approvals Not only the submission of DPRs to the river boards for their appraisal, but the two State governments were also required to secure other statutory approvals and clearances for going ahead with new projects, and the Union Minister said in his letter to the two CMs. Submission of DPRs was necessary to resolve lingering disputes, the Minister felt. Mr. Shekhawat reiterated the Ministry’s earlier directions to AP for submission of DPR on the controversial Rayalaseema Lift Scheme aimed at diverting over 8 tmc ft of Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir every day by taking up new project at Sangameshwaram and enhancing the water drawal capacity of the existing Pothireddypadu Head Regulator to 80,000 cusecs. Kaleshwaram project Similarly, he pointed out the need to submit the DPR of lifting the third tmc ft of water as part of Kaleshwaram project. In spite of the two river boards’ repeated letters and reminders to the two States for submission of the DPRs of all new projects and the Ministry’s directions to get the appraisal done for the new projects by submitting the DPRs, the two State Governments had been arguing that several projects termed as new ones by the MoJS were in fact old ones and contending that there was no necessity to submit their DPRs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jal-shakti-minister-writes-to-cms-of-ap-telangana/article33591365.ece

A decision on party structure, political alliance, and strategy for the Assembly elections will be taken at a State committee meeting of the KVVES in Ernakulam on Sunday. KVVES functionaries say they have the support of over 10 lakh members and 3,000 units across the State for the new political mission. They also indicate that the new party will work for the success of the United Democratic Front. The formation of a political party has been a long pending declaration of the State’s biggest merchant forum. Though there had been declarations to field own candidates during Assembly elections, the plans were dropped on promises made by political parties to address their issues. State secretary K. Sethumadhavan said the new party would enlist the support of farmers and traders to emerge as a powerful political force. In support of the merchant forum’s move, local leaders of the KVVES had taken up a number of protests in solidarity with the support of the agitation of farmers in New Delhi.  There were also candidates backed by the KVVES in the recent local body elections to test the response of voters. According to the KVVES leaders, their nominees had won 28 seats in the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/keralas-top-traders-body-to-launch-political-party/article33591372.ece
17 January 2021||New Delhi,||Arnab hinted at military strikes in chats||Three days before the Balakot strike by the Indian Air Force, Republic TV Editor Arnab Goswami told former Broadcast Audience Research Council (Barc) CEO Partho Dasgupta “something big will happen”, indicating that he knew about the confidential military action, alleged WhatsApp conversations between the two reveal. The transcript of the WhatsApp messages is part of the supplementary chargesheet filed by the Mumbai police in the Target Rating Point (TRP) tampering case. On February 26, 2019, the IAF hit a Jaish-e-Mohammad training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot town. The government claimed that this was in response to the February 14 terrorist attack in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. According to the transcript, at 10 p.m. on February 23,the conversation began with Mr. Goswami boasting about Republic TV bagging then Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s first-ever interview after the Pulwama incident. He then told Mr. Dasgupta, “On another note something big will happen.” To which Mr. Dasgupta asked, “Dawood?”. Mr. Goswami responded: “No sir Pakistan. Something major will be done this time.” Mr. Dasgupta, in response, said, “It’s good for big man in this season.” “He will sweep polls then.” The 2019 general election was just a few months away. Mr. Dasgupta pressed for further clarity, asking Mr. Goswami, “Strike? Or bigger.” Mr. Goswami responded, saying that it would be “bigger than a normal strike”. Then he went on to add, “And also at the same time something major on Kashmir. On Pakistan the government is confident of striking in a way that people will be elated. Exact words used.” ‘Leaking info’ The Congress party, did not hold an official press conference on the issue, but a few senior leaders raised questions on the conversations. Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “Arnab’s chats dated 23.02.2019 refer to sharing of Intel reaction along the Pak. border. It means someone very senior in govt. is leaking highly confidential info which may endanger the lives of our soldiers and so that mercenary considerations can add to TRPs.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/arnab-hinted-at-military-strikes-in-chats/article33591391.ece
17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Report on vulnerable groups’ access to public goods released||A report highlighting the experience of vulnerable groups in accessing citizenship, early childhood care and education, public employment and protected wages in 2019 and 2020, till the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, was released on Saturday. The India Exclusion Report 2019-2020 of the Centre for Equity Studies, with chapters authored by economists Jayati Ghosh and Prabhat Patnaik, among others, was released during a webinar. CES director and editor of the report Harsh Mander wrote that there was “brazen class bias” in the government’s policies, including imposing a harsh lockdown at short notice, that affected the lives of the poor, while the middle class supported the measure. “This should be a moment of civilisational introspection. A recognition of the abject collapse of our moral centre and our collective culpability in the social crime of the radical dispossession of our people,” he wrote. The report found that the condition of migrant workers from Odisha’s Ganjam district in the textile industry in Surat had been desperate even before the pandemic. The experience of sex workers in Delhi, Kolkata and Hyderabad was highlighted through a survey of 600 sex workers conducted by the All-India Network of Sex Workers. In her chapter, Prof. Ghosh argued that public employment was necessary for securing social goods, including security, justice, health, sanitation and education. “Public employment can be a major way of improving the quality of life for all citizens by providing essential public services. While this has been evident for a while it has become starkly clear during the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of public workers to ensure essential health services, to monitor labour rights and assist workers and to provide a range of other essential services is now apparent to all,” she wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/report-finds-brazen-class-bias-in-govt-policies-during-pandemic/article33592045.ece
17 January 2021||MANGALURU,||Seer writes to Amit Shah on A.P. temples’ desecration||Udupi Pejawar Mutt Seer and Trustee of Sri Ram Janm Bhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust Sri Vishwa Prasanna Tirtha Swami on Saturday urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah to intervene in the alleged desecration of Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh as the State government was not taking any decisive action to bring the culprits to book. He wrote the letter after visiting ancient Sita Lakshmana Kodandarama Temple on the Bodikonda Hillock in Ramatheertham of Vizianagaram district where the Rama idol was recently desecrated. Miscreants’ action of breaking open the historical temple and desecrating the 400-year-old idol has enraged the Hindu community. The severed portion of the idol was later retrieved from the nearby temple pond, the seer said. The incident took place about 20 days ago, but the Andhra Pradesh government has done little to apprehend the miscreants and its indifference was quite evident. Sri Vishwa Prasanna further said the attack on the Ramatheertham temple was not a stray incident. Andhra Pradesh has been witnessing a series spiteful incidents of temple vandalism for one-and-a-half-years now. The gutting of temple chariots at Bitragunta (Nellore) in February, Antarvedi (East Godavari) in September, and desecration of several Hindu idols at Pithapuram in January were some of the prominent malicious acts reported recently. As many as 120 attacks have taken place in the last one-and-a-half years, which appear to be premeditated ones, he said. He said miscreants were resorting to the evil acts because of inaction of the State government as no serious action was taken to apprehend people behind such barbaric acts of temple vandalism. The government was unresponsive to the call and appeal of the Hindu community to protect the temples. Such attacks were sensitive issues affecting the whole Hindu community. Since the State government has not acted, intervention of the Union Home Ministry was essential, the swami said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/temple-desecration-pejawar-seer-seeks-amit-shahs-intervention/article33592143.ece
17 January 2021||New Delhi,||‘Volunteered to get first shot as colleagues were scared’||Manish Kumar, a 34-year-old sanitation worker at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences who became the first person in Delhi to get the COVID-19 vaccine, said he himself asked the hospital authorities to give him the shot as his colleagues who were chosen for the exercise were “scared”. Mr. Kumar, whose mother Laxmi Rani also works at the hospital, said he was was “proud of getting the vaccine”. He was administered the vaccine during the launch of the nationwide vaccination programme at AIIMS in the presence of Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday. “I did not know that I am the first person to receive the vaccine. I had a good sleep last night, came here (hospital) in the morning and talked to the other staff who were to get the shot,” he said. “Many of them were scared. So, I went to my seniors and said I should be given the vaccine first. I wanted to prove to my colleagues that there is no need to be scared,” Mr. Kumar said. A resident of Najafgarh, Mr. Kumar has been working at the hospital for the past eight years. He said his wife was very nervous as well. “She even asked me not to take the vaccine. I told her it is just an injection. After taking the dose, I asked my mother to tell my wife that I am safe,” he said. ‘No discomfort’ “I would like to tell everyone that the fear about the vaccine is unwarranted. I have not noticed any reactions so far. There is no pain, or trouble breathing or difficulty in moving my limbs,” he said. Laxmi Rani said she was scared and kept praying for her husband. “The almighty gave him the chance to get the vaccine and the courage to face the fears,” she said. Shaukat Ali, Mr. Kumar’s colleague, said he was “very scared” before he got the jab in the morning. “I have undergone three surgeries for kidney stones. So, I was obviously scared, but Manish gave me confidence. I am not worried now, I am happy,” the 37-year-old said.  Many of them were scared.

17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Traders’ body moves SC over WhatsApp’s new privacy policy||The Confederation of All India Traders on Saturday moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the government to stop online instant messaging platform WhatsApp from sharing user data with “any entity”, including Facebook or its other “family companies”, in furtherance of its new and controversial privacy policy. “The Union of India has granted permission to run Whatsapp in India but has failed to play the role of a guardian to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, in as much as Whatsapp, which is rendering essential public services by enabling citizens to communicate. It has recently imposed unconstitutional privacy conditions, which are not only violative of the law but can impact the security of the country,” the Confederation, represented by advocate Vivek Narayan Sharma, said in its petition. On January 4, WhatsApp introduced a privacy policy through which it scrapped users’ ‘opt-out policy’. The user would have to compulsorily consent to share data with Facebook and its group. The petition pointed out that Ministers, Members of Parliament, judges, senior bureaucrats, defence personnel and crores of traders and well-known businessmen used WhatsApp for sharing confidential and personal information.  Where the Centre failed to restrict WhatsApp, the European Union’s Antitrust Authority had imposed serious restrictions and a fine of 110 million euros in 2017, the petition noted. As an interim prayer, the petition sought a rollback of the proposed privacy policy. Besides the Centre, the PIL has made California-based WhatsApp Inc and Facebook Inc parties along with the Hyderabad-located Facebook India Online Services Pvt. Ltd.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/traders-body-moves-sc-over-whatsapps-new-privacy-policy/article33591389.ece

17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||NITI Aayog denies RTI request on CMs’ panel on agriculture||NITI Aayog’s Committee of Chief Ministers for the Transformation of Indian Agriculture held its last meeting in September 2019. More than a year later, its report has yet to be made public, although its mandate was to suggest structural reforms in agriculture. A Right to Information request by activist Anjali Bhardwaj, seeking details of the panel’s meetings and report, has now been denied on the grounds that the report is yet to be presented to Niti Aayog’s governing council. The Centre has cited this panel as proof that Chief Ministers of key States were consulted on the contentious new farm reform laws, although Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh says the new laws were never proposed in the panel’s meetings. Three meetings were held, in July, August and September 2019, according to the response to Ms. Bhardwaj’s RTI request. The report was also submitted, but NITI Aayog refused to provide it. “It will be first placed before the 6th Governing Council meeting of NITI Aayog as and when it is held, for appraisal of State Chief Ministers and Governors of UTs who are the constituent members of the Governing Council. Hence, at this stage constrained with the sharing of the report,” said the response, dated January 13. NITI Aayog also refused to provide the names of those who attended the three meetings, or the copies of the minutes of those meetings, saying such information also constituted part of the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/niti-aayog-denies-rti-request-on-cms-panel-on-agriculture/article33591409.ece
17 January 2021||Hyderabad,||‘Despite aberrations Indian democracy remained strong’||Right to Liberty and Freedom of Expression has come under strain in the recent times while criminal defamation law and power of the Courts to punish for contempt have also acted to shrink the space for free speech, opined N. Ravi, Chairman of Kasturi and Sons Ltd, that publishes The Hindu group of publications. The use of sedition laws have curtailed the freedom despite the Supreme Court pronouncing that criticism would not amount to sedition unless it openly advocates violence, Mr. Ravi felt and yet at the same time argued that despite some aberrations Indian democracy remained strong and personal liberty is largely intact. He expressed these views while speaking at a webinar on “Celebrating Democracy” organised by the S. Jaipal Reddy Foundation marking the 79th birth anniversary of former Union Minister and “Outstanding parliamentarian” awardee S. Jaipal Reddy. Referring to the contempt of court case against Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Mr. Ravi said even certain cartoonists and comedians have been held for contempt of court by the over-sensitive judiciary.The record of the judiciary is patchy in some cases, he noted. While courts admit that personal liberty is most valuable bail applications are routinely delayed, he said. Former Chief Election Commissioner, S.Y. Qureshi called for greater reforms in the constitution of Election Commission of India while recalling how Indian democracy and the functioning of Election Commission command respect world over. Mr. Qureshi suggested that Election Commissioners should be appointed through a collegium. Former Information Commissioner of Andhra Pradesh R. Dileep Reddy also spoke. Professor Pushpa Kumar Lakshmanan of the University of Delhi moderated. S. Anand Reddy of the Japial Reddy Foundation presented a vote of thanks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/despite-aberrations-indian-democracy-remained-strong/article33592064.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||HC notice to Karnataka government on road project||The Karnataka High Court has ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition which has alleged that ‘Bengaluru surrounding roads’ project executed at a cost of nearly Rs. 2,000 crore by the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL), is being implemented without obtaining mandatory environmental clearances. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the order on the petition filed by Jathakaa.org, a trust engaged in campaigning to engage citizen in the decision-making process, and two others. No clearances The petitioner has alleged that the project of developing around 155 km of roads around the city is being executed in the absence of clearance as per the Environment Impact Assessment notification of 2006, and the forest clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Claiming that the project is not a mere amalgamation of major district roads, State Highways, National Highways as termed by the government, the petitioners has said that it includes construction of new rail over bridges, under bridges, grade separators, elevated corridors and ‘threatens to cause widespread destruction and environmental degradation within the city’. As the project requires felling around 8,500 trees within the city and surrounding areas, it will impact carbon sequestration in the region. It will create a urban heat zone accelerating the effect of global warming as even 14 fresh water lakes are being impacted, the petitioners contended. Within national park Pointing out that the project involves development of a road through Bannerghatta National Park, the petitioners have contended that taking up the project within the national park and its eco-sensitive zone would impact the environment and wildlife as work has been taken up without clearance under provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. While seeking a direction to the government to stop work on the project, the petitioners have sought direction to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to initiate action against the State authorities for violation of environmental laws. Make info public The petitioners have sought a direction to the government and the KRDCL to make public complete information, including minutes of meetings and documents, clearances secured as per the law by uploading them online. The High Court, in another PIL petition filed by Bangalore Environment Trust, had already directed a committee of experts, which is monitoring pleas for felling trees for a metro project, to examine whether it is necessary to fell the trees identified by the KRDCL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-notice-to-karnataka-government-on-road-project/article33591992.ece
17 January 2021||New Delhi,||Rahul demands strategy rather than ‘laundry list of diplomacy’||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, at a meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee on External Affairs held on Saturday, said a “laundry list of diplomacy” would not work and that India needed strategy. This was the first meeting of the committee since the Galwan valley incident and realignment of Chinese troops at the LAC (Line of Actual Control) in Ladakh. The agenda of the meeting was “India Global Strategy” and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla made a presentation on the occasion. Mr. Gandhi, it is learnt, said the presentation at best was a “laundry list” of the things that the government was doing in diplomacy but not a “global strategy”. Pointing out the recent measure by the Chinese to remap the ancient silk route, explicitly “beheading” India out of it, Mr. Gandhi said the Chinese strategy was to move from the maritime to the terrestrial, to change the old silk road into a land route linking China to Europe and to bypass the old centrality of India, making it irrelevant. According to sources, Mr. Jaishankar responded that he didn’t believe that China would become dominant enough. He asserted that it was unlikely that the world would return to a bi-polar situation with two powers holding the ends of the spectrum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-demands-strategy-rather-than-laundry-list-of-diplomacy/article33591411.ece
17 January 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan BJP puts up brave front amid internal feuds||Confronted with internal feuds after an outfit in support of former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje was launched here recently, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Rajasthan unit has put up a brave front and denied factionalism as rumours. The BJP leaders have insisted that there were “no divisions” in the party. Though the formation of Vasundhara Raje Samarthak Rajasthan Manch created ripples in the political circles here, the BJP leaders were quick to dismiss it as insignificant and pointed towards factionalism in the ruling Congress. Ms. Raje has avoided making public appearances and her name is generally missing in the posters of the party’s regular events. Senior leaders Gulab Chand Kataria, Satish Poonia, Rajendra Rathore, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Arjun Ram Meghwal are said to be nursing chief ministerial ambitions. According to the political observers, the Manch has been floated at Ms. Raje’s behest after her marginalisation by the party’s top leadership. Signals of internal feud came from the remarks of Ms. Raje’s former ministerial colleague and Chhabra MLA, Pratap Singh Singhvi, earlier this week. Mr. Singhvi asked the BJP to announce Ms. Raje as the party’s chief ministerial candidate for the 2023 Assembly election, saying she was the “most popular face” of the BJP in the State. Significantly, the BJP has been giving importance to Ms. Raje’s detractors for the last several months and has even appointed some of them to important organisational posts. Former Minister Ghanshyam Tiwari, who had left the party over differences with Ms. Raje, was also inducted back into the party last month. BJP State president Satish Poonia said here that the party’s parliamentary board would take a decision on projecting an individual as the chief ministerial candidate. ‘PM only face’ “No one is bigger than the party. The BJP has only one face, that of [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi,” he said at a press conference. Mr. Poonia also distanced himself from some social media groups created for supporting him and said the messages being made viral should be “dismissed as someone’s mischief”. He said the upcoming urban local body elections in 20 districts later this month were more important, for which the BJP had started making preparations. The BJP has tried to shift focus on factionalism in Congress in the aftermath of rebellion by the then Deputy CM Sachin Pilot and the MLAs supporting him in July last year. “The Congress is using Rajasthan to save its credibility. Its support to the agitating farmers amounts to political hypocrisy,” Mr. Poonia said. The Congress has picked holes in the BJP’s claims of having confronted the ruling party in a united manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajasthan-bjp-puts-up-brave-front-amid-feuds/article33591648.ece
17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Science behind jabs is resolute: Vardhan||The science behind the COVID-19 vaccines is resolute, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted on Saturday, responding to Congress MP Manish Tewari’s post questioning their safety. “Concerns that I have articulated are real and not imagined. It is not fear-mongering. Look what is happening in Norway. It may be a different vaccine but do not hide behind vaccine nationalism, Mr. Tewari tweeted. The Minister responded: “Our scientists have worked at lightning speed to expedite functions that contribute to the development of a vaccine but not a single function has been circumvented. Safety above all else has been the guiding principle!’’ He accused the Congress of spreading distrust and rumours. “Manish Tewari and Congress are only passionate about spreading distrust and rumours. Open your eyes, sharing photos of eminent doctors and government functionaries getting inoculated.” Dr. Vardhan quoted writer Charles Caleb Colton: “So blinded are we by our passions that we suffer more to be damned than to be saved.” Virtual sparring The virtual sparring came after Mr. Tewari said, “If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and efficacy is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/science-behind-jabs-is-resolute-vardhan/article33591386.ece

WhatsApp, it said, was built on a simple idea: what you share with your friends and family stays between you, while stressing that users’ personal conversations are end-to-end encrypted so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see these private messages. “It’s why we don’t keep logs of who everyone’s messaging or calling. We also can’t see your shared location and we don’t share your contacts with Facebook,” it said, adding that with the recent update, this will not change. Instead, the update will include new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how the platform collects and uses data. “While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services.

There are vaccines abroad whose single dose costs up to Rs. 5,000 and have to be kept in freezers at minus 70 degrees temperature. India-manufactured vaccines are best suited for us,” Mr. Modi said. Mr. Modi said around 60% children of the world would get vaccines manufactured in India. The Prime Minister cautioned the beneficiaries against lowering the guard after getting the vaccine shot. People should remember that the vaccines comprised two shots and had a gap of close to a month between them. “The vaccine starts working 14 days after the complete round is finished. But don’t lower your guard during or after vaccination. The mantra ‘ Dawai Bhi, Kadaai Bhi ’ should be followed, and the use of mask and distancing norms is essential,” he stated. “They fought for every single life. During the pandemic, they stayed away from their families and many never returned. India has so far fought COVID-19 with self-confidence and self-reliance and we have to keep up this spirit even during the vaccination programme. Today, by vaccinating this vulnerable population first, we are recognising their service,” he said. “The whole world is today accepting the manner in which India has dealt with the pandemic.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||NIA summons farm leader, TV journalist||The notices have been issued under Section 160 Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC)-Police officer’s power to require attendance of witnesses in FIR no 40/2020 under various Sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Last week, the Supreme Court had suspended the implementation of the three farm laws until further notice and appointed a committee to resolve the issue. The farmers’ unions have so far held nine rounds of discussions with two Union Ministers — Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal — that have remained inconclusive. The leaders raised the issue of various government agencies sending notices to people associated with the agitation with the Ministers.  The Hindu spoke to some of the persons summoned by the NIA. Jasveer Singh Muktsar, a journalist with the U.K.-based TV channel KTV who has been covering the protests at Delhi border, said, “I have been asked to appear before the NIA on January 18. I shall be going there with my legal team. I do not know why I have been summoned. I am a journalist covering the protest.” Nobeljit Singh, a clothes shop owner from Hoshiarpur who has also been asked to appear on January 18, said. “I have been at the forefront to protest against the three black laws — whether it was staging a sit-in at toll plazas or protesting against BJP leaders. I have also been to Singhu border and the NIA notice reflects the Centre’s oppressive policies.” Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu, who campaigned for BJP’s Sunny Deol in the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency during the 2019 general elections has been summoned to appear on Sunday. Ranjit Singh of the Damdami Taksal, Amritsar, said he and his friends have organised several langars (food stalls) at Tikri and Singhu border and also distributed books and other items there. “I and 16-17 other young leaders have also received notices. We have no connection with the SFJ. This is a ploy to implicate us in a false case. I agree that we accept donations to organise langars but that is from friends and known people. We returned from Delhi only last week,” he said. Pardeep Singh, a dairy farm owner from Ludhiana, said he was among the first lot to reach Delhi’s border on November 26 and stayed there for a month. “I paid from my own pocket to participate in the protest. In Punjab all villages have families living in foreign countries and they might be sending money. Is it a crime? While no action is taken against BJP leaders for giving hate speeches, minority communities are targeted. We have a right to protest peacefully. Our actions did not lead to any violence. Then why summons under UAPA?” He said he received the summons on WhatsApp and will appear before the agency on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-summons-farm-leader-tv-journalist/article33591381.ece

17 January 2021||Kolkata,||Merge Trinamool with Congress: Adhir Rajan||West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee president and Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to merge the Trinamool Congress with the Congress following the large number of defections from her party to the Bharatiya Janata Party. In 1998, a number of Congress leaders, including Mamata Banerjee, defected from the Congress and floated the Trinamool Congress. It came to power in 2011 by forging an alliance with the Congress and ending 34 years of Left Front rule. “With so many leaders quitting your party almost on a daily basis, it seems that your party does not have an ideological fulcrum to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party. Therefore, you should merge the Trinamool with the Congress, which will provide you the ideological platform to fight the BJP,” Mr. Chowdhury observed. The MP from Baharampur in Murshidabad district noted that the Trinamool Congress stood at a crucial juncture when its leaders were quitting the party and joining the BJP. “This calls for a moment of introspection as to what the party stands for,” he said. ‘Historical necessity’ Explaining his comments made at a public gathering, Mr. Chowdhury told The Hindu that the rise of the Trinamool Congress was out of a “historical necessity” to remove the Left Front from power, and after achieving the objective, the party had been rudderless. The TMC had often been seen adhering to policies bordering on populism and on certain occasions competing with the BJP and giving rise to competitive communalism, he stated. Mr. Chowdhury, who is one of the principal architects of forging a Left-Congress electoral understanding in the State, has been urging TMC leaders who cannot join the BJP for ideological reasons to return to the Congress. The Left parties and the Congress are to fight the 2021 elections as an alliance. A section of intellectuals feel that the Left-Congress alliance should fight the BJP along with the TMC instead of against it. ‘Pressured to defect’ Mr. Chowdhury, a five-time Congress MP, said the Trinamool Congress was being paid back in their own coin. After coming to power, it tried to engineer defections in every party. “Not only MLAs of Opposition parties, but even elected members of civic bodies and gram panchayats, were pressured to defect to it,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/merge-trinamool-with-congress-adhir-rajan/article33591405.ece

17 January 2021||New Delhi,||Left to seek repeal of farm laws in Budget session||Opposition parties will move for a repeal of the three contentious farm reform laws during the Budget session of Parliament, according to Communist Party of India (CPI) general secretary Sitaram Yechury. Speaking on the sidelines of a convention of Left political parties organised in support of the farmers’ movement, Mr. Yechury said that he expected parties like the Akali Dal, Shiv Sena, Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) to support the move for a repeal. “With all of these parties opposing them, the government would not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha on this issue,” he said. “In fact, the original passing of these laws in the Rajya Sabha in September was done through a fraud,” said Mr. Yechury, arguing that if a division, or recorded vote, had been taken in the Upper House as Opposition MPs had demanded, the government would not have won. The Bills were ultimately passed by a voice vote amid vociferous protest. Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) leader Brinda Karat argued that the way the laws were passed “shows the government’s contempt for democracy”. She decried the lack of consultations with State governments, and other stakeholders, and the government’s refusal to send the Bills to a Parliamentary Standing Committee. “In September, when there were 1 lakh COVID cases a day, the government called Parliament just to push through the ordinances. But in December, when there were only 30,000 cases a day, they used COVID as an excuse not to convene Parliament to discuss the crisis and the farmers’ demand for repeal,” she said. Ms. Karat urged all Opposition parties to come out openly in support of farmers, and support the call for repeal both within and outside Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/left-to-seek-repeal-of-farm-laws-in-budget-session/article33591402.ece

Pregnant women and those aged below 18 will not be covered by the drive,” Mr. Prakash said. “We can look forward to a safe 2021 after the immunisation. But we have to take precautions, including wearing masks and physical distancing, until the completion of the immunisation programme,” he said. The Corporation has created facilities for patients to be monitored for 30 minutes after the jab. Residents have been advised to get the second dose 28 days after the first. Urging all residents to get vaccinated at Corporation facilities free of cost, Mr. Prakash said, “Residents will get a message about the centres and date of immunisation after online registration. The data will be used for research. The COVID-19 vaccine is 100% safe.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-80-lakh-city-residents-will-get-vaccinated-in-four-months/article33592016.ece
17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A great duet recorded separately||Released almost six decades ago on the day of Pongal, the film Konjum Salangai marked another milestone for nagaswaram player Karukurichi P. Arunachalam, whose birth centenary begins this year. His rendition, along with playback singer S. Janaki, of the song Singaravelane Deva is celebrated as an example of the remarkable synchrony achieved between the nagaswaram and the human voice. However, Arunachalam, a student of T.N. Rajarathinam Pillai, and Janaki did not record the song together. In fact, Arunachalam played a different song, and the lyrics were rewritten later to suit the tune and were sung by Janaki. “Karukurichi Arunachalam actually rendered Manthiramavathu Neeru , the Thevaram song, to the tune set by T.A. Sambandamurthy Achari. He also played the swaras, and it was first recorded by music director S.M. Subbaiah Naidu,” says Vamanan, a historian of Tamil film music. The film was released on January 14, 1962. The thavil was played by Perumpallam P. Venkatesan, who had accompanied Arunachalam for 12 years. When the film crew wanted to create a duet scene, lyricist Ku. Ma. Balasubramanian penned a song to synchronise with the already rendered nagaswaram score. But the music director was not able to find a voice that could match the high pitch of the instrument. Many singers opted out. It was singer P. Leela who said Janaki could do justice to the song. “It will be surprising to know that we rendered the songs separately. I used a headphone and sang the song in tune with the sruthi and mellifluousnesses of the nagaswaram. People celebrate the duet but as the artistes of the song, we had not met each other,” Janaki had said in an interview to Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan in 1964, a copy of which was obtained by writer Lalitharam. In the interview done after Arunachalam’s death in 1964, Janaki said though she had sung a lot of other songs, it was Singaravelane Deva that secured for her unprecedented fame and recognition. “I first met him in Shanmugananda Hall in Bombay almost one-and-a-half years after the song was recorded. It was also our last meeting. When I told him of the recognition, he said it was Lord Muruga’s grace. He also invited me and my husband to Tiruchendur temple. But we did not get a chance to visit,” she had recalled.  Konjum Salangai also featured Vallalar’s Arutpa, Orumaiyudan Ninathu , by Soolamangalam Rajalakshmi in the raga Bilahari. It was followed by Arunachalam on the nagaswaram.  Janaki said that though she had sung a lot of other songs, it was Singaravelane Deva that brought her unprecedented fame||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-great-duet-recorded-separately/article33592241.ece
17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Rahul has genuine interest in jallikattu, visit not political’||Denying that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attended a jallikattu event on Pongal day only to gain political mileage, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K.S. Alagiri on Saturday said he had a genuine interest in the sport. In an interview, he was hopeful that the Congress ally, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, would not field former Union Minister S. Jagathratchagan as the chief ministerial candidate in Puducherry. Excerpts:  Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Madurai to witness jallikattu has evoked criticism as the bull-taming sport had encountered trouble during the UPA regime... Jallikattu took place until 2014 without hitch. There was a stay from the Supreme Court, and an appeal was filed. The UPA government also enacted legislation to pave the way for the conduct of the ancient Tamil sport. So long as the UPA was in power, it was not stopped. But Union Minister Jairam Ramesh had described it a barbaric sport... There could be many opinions in a government. Legislation seeking to prevent cruelties to animals was enacted as early as the 1960s. His opinion could have been shaped by those laws. But the Cabinet Committee did not accept the proposal to stop jallikattu. The pressure from the State and DMK leader M. Karunanidhi ensured that jallikattu took place without any problem. It was stopped when the BJP came to power. Had the BJP government argued in favour of jallikattu in the Supreme Court, it would not have been stopped. Because the BJP government had to listen to the RSS, it would have assumed that the game amounted to cruelty to cows. What is Mr. Gandhi’s stand on jallikattu? Did he attend the event to gain political mileage? He asked me whether bulls would be tortured or injured. I told him that as far as I knew bulls had not died and only the tamers got killed and injured. When a bull tossed a tamer into the air, he said, “You are right. Only men are injured.” He has a genuine interest in the sport, and his visit was not political. Will his visit help the Congress in Tamil Nadu? His visit has become viral. It has earned appreciation from the people. Even the commentators at jallikattu said that had Mr. Gandhi attended the event some years ago, it would have earned much-needed publicity and ensured its conduct without problem. There are reports that the DMK plans to field former Union Minister S. Jagathratchagan as the chief ministerial candidate in Puducherry... I have to get details of what has led to this speculation. I believe that nothing of that sort will happen. Are vested interests at work here? I do not think so. I read the news report. I have to speak to Congress and DMK leaders in Puducherry on this. What are the prospects of the DMK-Congress alliance in the Tamil Nadu Assembly election? We launched our campaign during the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Mr. Gandhi will tour the western districts on January 23, 24 and 25. What works in favour of our alliance is that we have already declared DMK president M.K. Stalin our chief ministerial candidate. But the AIADMK-led alliance is not able to say who will be its chief ministerial candidate. [Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has been named the AIADMK’s candidate for the top post.] The BJP and the PMK say they will announce their stand. AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam has not expressed his view on the subject [beyond endorsing Mr. Palaniswami at a party meeting]. How do you respond to the criticism that the DMK is anti-Hindu? When the issue was raised a long time ago, DMK founder C.N. Annadurai propounded the dictum, ‘One god and one race’. It ran counter to the ideology of the Dravidian Movement. His objective was to clarify that the DMK was only against certain teachings and not against the religion itself. The DMK has never campaigned against any religion. It is the BJP’s campaign to project the DMK as an anti-Hindu party.  UPA government enacted legislation to facilitate the conduct of jallikattu. So long as the UPA was in power, it was not stopped||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rahul-has-genuine-interest-in-jallikattu-visit-not-political/article33591517.ece
17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No adverse effect following vaccination: Health Minister||Terming the first day of COVID-19 vaccination as “successful”, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said there were no adverse effects following immunisation in the State. “Being the first day, there were a few challenges, including in the software. Despite this, the programme was successful. No one has experienced any adverse reaction till now... Full-fledged vaccination will be carried out from tomorrow,” he told reporters following a meeting with the Union Health Minister via videoconferencing on Saturday. Denying that there were apprehensions among health workers to take the vaccine, he said 10 prominent doctors, including the Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University, took the vaccine on the first day. He said healthcare providers came forward to take both the vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin. “If needed, we will increase the number of vaccine centres at major government hospitals and private facilities, if they request,” he added. “Tamil Nadu was part of the vaccine trial run. Both immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine were successful and no volunteer had side-effects,” he said. To a question on whether he would take the vaccine, he said, “We are ready to take the vaccine. We have applied for permission.” ‘Ensuring stocks’ The State government is taking abundant caution in ensuring that adequate stocks of the COVID-19 vaccine are there so that all beneficiaries can take their second dose, on the 28th day, as per protocol, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said in Madurai. The Centre has promised to increase the supply of vaccines, he added. The State government has 5,56,500 dosages as of now. “Taking the vaccine is purely voluntary, and we are not compelling anyone to take the shots,” he told journalists. Mr. Radhakrishnan said he had himself registered for vaccination. “But the priority now is being given only to doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers,” he added. K. Senthil, president of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctor’s Association, who took the first dose of the vaccine, said it was safe. J.A. Jayalal, national president of the Indian Medical Association, who also volunteered to get vaccinated at the GRH, said the vaccines were 100% safe and efficient.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-adverse-effect-following-vaccination-health-minister/article33591505.ece

17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 vaccination begins in two private hospitals in the State||The COVID-19 vaccination programme took off at the Apollo Vaccination Centre on Saturday. According to a press release, Prathap C. Reddy, chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group, received the first dose. “The vaccine marks the turning of the tide in the fight against the novel coronavirus that brought the world to its knees for almost a year. The launch of the vaccination programme is a critical event, as the last few months have seen a second wave of infections, sending many countries in Europe into a fresh series of lockdowns, and a vaccine is the need of the hour to prevent and reduce infections,” he said. He noted that this was a landmark moment for the country as vaccines were being manufactured in the country itself. During vaccination, infection control practices were followed. Work to strengthen the vaccine cold chain and to gear up, with facilities for efficient and fast administration by trained healthcare personnel, with safety standards, for up to one million doses a day, began in October at the hospital, the release said.

17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Indian Newspaper Society seeks relief from government||The Indian Newspaper Society President L. Adimoolam met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday and sought relief from the Government of India on a few issues faced by the print media industry in the upcoming budget. During the meeting, Mr. Adimoolam pointed out that most newspapers, despite ensuring that essential information reached millions of households every day during the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown, have stopped sending newspapers to rural areas to cut down on distribution costs resulting in rural populations to depend on fake news on social media. Stating that it would take two or three years for the industry to recover, Mr. Adimoolam requested the Union Finance Minister to provide relief for the print media in the upcoming budget and presented five demands. Mr. Adimoolam stressed on the need for the Government of India to look into the rising costs of newsprint and dependency on imported newsprint, domestic mills not holding newsprint stocks and increasing their prices sharply. He also requested abolition of customs duty on imported newsprint, extension of Directorate General of Trade Remedies for submitting anti-dumping, and extension of validity of RNI Circulation Verification Certificate to March 31, 2022. “Considering the quantum of import and the customs duty at 5%, it will utmost yield Rs. 200 crore to the government exchequer in the next fiscal. But in view of the grim situation, it would be a great relief for the print industry, if the government can consider abolishing the customs duty on import of newsprint,” Mr. Adimoolam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/indian-newspaper-society-seeks-relief-from-government/article33592128.ece

17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sasikala’s expected release kindles debate of AIADMK-AMMK coming together||The expected release V K Sasikala, former interim general secretary of AIADMK and aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, later this month has again kindled the debate within and outside the party whether the parent body and the three-year-old Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) will come together. The idea of rapprochement between the two parties is nothing new. Ahead of the last Lok Sabha polls, Union Minister and Republican Party of India (A) chief Ramdas Athawale, had given an open call for the union of the two parties. At that time, he clarified that the BJP had “no role” in his call. In his recent interview with this paper, Chief Minister and AIADMK co-coordinator, Edappadi K Palaniswami, had made it clear that ministers and party MLAs had chosen him to head the government in February 2017. Early this week, party organisation secretary, Gokula Indira, made an allusory positive reference to Sasikala, during a protest meant to criticise DMK’s youth wing secretary, Udhayanidhi Stalin for his reported observations against her and the Chief Minister. In an interview to a Tamil journal, Dairy Development Minister and party Virudhunagar (west) secretaryK.T.Rajenthra Bhalaji, referred to the possibility of the merger of the AMMK with the AIADMK and used a conciliatory language towards the AMMK cadres. However, later, Fisheries Minister, D. Jayakumar, widely regarded as the spokesperson of the Cabinet, expressed his disapproval of the remarks of the two AIADMK office bearers. He reiterated the party’s position, which, he said, was clear from 2017. “It has been our stand that we want to run affairs of the government and the party, independent of interference of her or her associates. There is no confusion on our part,” he explained, adding that there would be “no impact” of the political entry of Sasikala in Tamil Nadu. Yet, certain functionaries of the AIADMK, while speaking privately, do not rule out the possibility of “disgruntled elements” in the party rallying behind Sasikala, as and when she is out of jail. A veteran office bearer points out that that the party leadership has to ponder over whether it will be beneficial to the party to align itself with her, when the controversy regarding Jayalalithaa’s death has not yet been laid to rest. As far as the AMMK is concerned, the party’s propaganda secretary, C.R. Saraswathi, says decisions concerning the Assembly election including alliance will be taken by Sasikala and T.T.V. Dhinakaran, deputy general secretary of the party. “At present, we are all eagerly awaiting Chinnamma ’s [Sasikala’s] release. We are planning to give her a warm welcome,” she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sasikalas-expected-release-kindles-debate-on-union/article33591524.ece
17 January 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Vijay Sethupathi lands in another controversy||Actor Vijay Sethupathi has landed in another controversy after a photograph where he is seen cutting his birthday cake with a machete recently to celebrate his 43rd birthday went viral. Mr. Vijay Sethupathi received widespread criticism for posing with a machete as law enforcement officials have been regularly clamping down on and discouraging youth from using machetes in public. Couple of years ago, a gangster named Binu Pappachan was caught celebrating his birthday along with hundreds of gangsters in the city and was photographed cutting his birthday similarly with a machete and the photograph went viral. Since then, the police have been cracking down on youngsters using machetes in public. The actor responded to criticism stating that he cut the cake using the ‘Patta Kathi’ (machete) as it plays an important role in the film directed by filmmaker Ponram. “The picture was clicked three days ago in my office during my birthday celebrations. The photograph is being debated as I had cut the cake using a ‘Patta Kathi’. I am acting in a film being directed by Ponram and the ‘Patta Kathi’ plays an important part in the film. This is the reason why I cut the cake with the ‘Patta Kathi’ since I was celebrating my birthday with the same film crew. Many have said that I have set a wrong example. I will refrain from doing something like this and be more careful in future,” he said. Only a few days ago, Naam Tamilar Katchi took offense to the trailer of his film Tughlaq Darbar for taking potshots at NTK co-ordinator Seeman. Actor Vijay Sethupathi played the antagonist opposite actor Vijay in Master and he is also reportedly starring in the Hindi remake of filmmaker Lokesh Kanagaraj’s Maanagaram. The actor is also awaiting the release of SP Jhananathan’s Laabam among other films.  I am acting in a film being directed by Ponram and the ‘Patta Kathi’ plays an important part in the film.

The offender, identified as Ganesh alias Lovely Ganesh, 21, of Bharathi Nagar, befriended a 20-year-old girl from Kolathur on social media. The girl fell in love with him and married him on December 5. Her parents lodged a complaint alleging that she went missing. Subsequently, the couple appeared before the police and said they were married and living as per their wishes. The police said Ganesh brought a 17-year-old girl into the house as a domestic aid. He sexually assaulted the girl in the presence of his wife. When she questioned it, he physically tortured her repeatedly, the police said. He forced them to pose for videos, circulated them to his friends and invited them to the house, police added. His wife finally managed to escape with the help of the landlord and complained to her parents and the police. The All-Women police arrested Ganesh and rescued the 17-year-old girl who was under his illegal custody. During interrogation, he confessed to similar offences against girls he befriended on social media, they said. He was booked for offences, including raping minor girl, physical torture of his wife, voyuerism and cheating, under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), the IPC, and the Information Technology Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/youth-held-for-torturing-wife-raping-minor-girl/article33592014.ece
17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Petrol prices touch an all-time high||On Pongal when fuel prices changed, nobody noticed that the city had touched an all-time high in petrol prices. It now stands at Rs. 87.4 a litre. The previous all-time high was Rs. 87.33, which climbed to Rs. 87.39 a litre for just one day in October and then slid down. This rate is for fuel outlets inside the core city area and as the distance increases, the prices increase and are over Rs. 87.5 a litre. Consumers like G. Ramakrishnan, of Besant Nagar, are questioning the hike and demanding that the Centre and the State reduce their income from fuel. “At a time when the government must help the people and restart the economy, such a move amounts to overburdening the public. Most homes are already suffering from pay cuts and lay-offs. In such a situation, this will lead to increase in transportation costs, which is unfair,” he said. T. Sadagopan, consumer activist, said such an increase would lead to a further rise in prices of vegetables and provisions. “These are already becoming very costly. People are buying only what is absolutely necessary. Cooking gas rates are also increasing every month. In fact, it went up twice last month,” he said. Chennai Perunagar Amaipu Sara Auto Ottunar Paadhugappu Nala Sangam’s T. Venkatesan said nearly 30% of autorickshaw drivers had already moved on to other jobs during the lockdown. “After the pandemic, people are opting for own vehicles and not using autorickshaws. We do not know how or when business will pick up. We are just managing with bare minimum trips,” he said, adding that an app that would get trips started by the government would help. “It will provide jobs for autorickshaw drivers and those in the IT field and generate income for the government. It can compete with app-based aggregators,” he said. Oil industry sources said the prices were set to increase further. “We expect it to go up to Rs. 90 a litre and then may be drop by Rs. 5 a litre. But reduction part is only a guess. What the government is doing is unfair to customers. Fuel outlets are yet to see their business to pre-COVID-19 sales due to the increasing fuel prices. Only those who have to go out on work are using vehicles,” an industry source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/petrol-prices-touch-an-all-time-high-in-city/article33592022.ece
17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin demands Rs. 30,000 per acre as relief||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday demanded relief for farmers and the general public affected by the margazhi rain in the State. In a statement in Chennai, he said farmers should be given Rs. 30,000 per acre as crop damage. “The crop was ready for harvest but was completely destroyed in the rain. It has proved to be a double whammy for farmers, who had already borne the brunt of Cyclone Nivar,” he said. “The failure of the AIADMK government to desilt the drains resulted in flooding,” Mr. Stalin alleged. The DMK leader said the government’s announcement that it would release Rs. 20,000 per hectare had disappointed farmers. “They are angry that the amount already announced to provide relief from Cyclone Nivar has not reached them. They are also not able to get crop insurance,” he said Wondering what happened to the Rs. 600 crore allotted for cyclone relief, Mr. Stalin wanted to know about the status of the request for Rs. 3,758 crore sought from the BJP government at the Centre. “Instead of saying that the government will take a survey of the damage, the Chief Minister should release the relief,” he said. Offensive posters DMK organisation secretary R.S. Bharathi has demanded action against those who put up posters with offensive content against party youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin and women members of his family. In a complaint to the Chennai Police Commissioner on Saturday, Mr. Bharathi said that the ruling AIADMK had been targeting the actor-politician since he had earned the goodwill of the people through his State-wide tour. “On January 14, posters were put up in the name of south Chennai, north Chennai (East) across the city,” he said. “The posters have featured his family members who have nothing to do with politics,” Mr. Bharathi said. The party leader said Mr. Udhayanidhi was ready to face any criticism politically, but targeting his family members had caused them agony. “Under the Indian Press Act, the name of the printer and publisher should be on posters. But the details are missing on these posters,” Mr. Bharathi added.  The rain has proved to be a double whammy for farmers, who had already borne the brunt of Cyclone Nivar M.K.

The judges listened to 463 entries in the Carnatic vocal category, 16 in Hindustani, 129 in percussions category and 126 in instrumental music category. Double entries There were many double entries since parents had sent in video recordings of their wards under two categories or two entries for the same category. There were also some who had sent in songs penned by their children and a few who had sent in film numbers, which were rejected. Special prizes The judges whittled down the total number of prizes to 119, out of which 16 are special prizes. The judges panel included musician, dance scholar and writer Sujatha Vijayaraghavan, violinists L.N. Sisters M. Lalitha and M. Nandhini, mridangist Erode Nagaraj and Hindustani vocalist Lalitha Sharma. It also included The Hindu’s Sri Lanka correspondent Meera Srinivasan, also a student of Lalgudi Jayaraman. As the senior member of the judges panel, Ms. Vijayaraghavan said, “A song rendered perfectly may fail to create an impact unless it is fully experienced and relished by the singer. If the singer perceives the beauty of the raga and the song, and highlights them, it would create a vibe in the listener. This comes with learning, listening and assimilation. Thanks to The Hindu for giving me an opportunity to listen to a good number of talented young singers.” The prizes and certificates for the competition are being sponsored by the Indian oil Corporation Ltd. A company spokesperson said, “We are extremely happy to be encouraging young talent and partnering on an initiative by The Hindu , which combines tradition and contemporary trends.” The complete list of winners are available onhttp://bit.ly/3nPNF0band the winners will be notified via email.

17 January 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||INS seeks relief in Budget||The Indian Newspaper Society (INS) President L. Adimoolam met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday and sought relief from the Government of India on a few issues faced by the print media industry in the upcoming Budget. During the meeting, Mr. Adimoolam pointed out that most newspapers, despite ensuring that essential information reached millions of households every day during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown, have stopped sending newspapers to rural areas to cut down on distribution costs resulting in rural populations to depend on fake news on social media. Stating that it would take two or three years for the industry to recover, Mr. Adimoolam requested the Minister to provide relief for the print media and presented five demands. He stressed on the need for the Government of India to look into the rising costs of newsprint and dependency on imported newsprint, domestic mills not holding newsprint stocks and increasing their prices sharply. He also requested abolition of customs duty on imported newsprint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ins-seeks-relief-in-budget/article33591556.ece
17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Beaches, parks deserted||Marina, the world’s second largest beach, other beaches and parks, including Guindy and Vandalur, wore a deserted look on the day of Kaanum Pongal on Saturday as the government had banned public entry in view of the pandemic. The State government had banned public entry into the Vandalur Arignar Anna Zoological Park, tourist destinations in Mamallapuram, the national park in Guindy, Marina and other beaches from Friday to Sunday. The decision was taken since the crowds that usually gather on the occasion of Kaanum Pongal could lead to the spread of COVID-19. The police made elaborate security arrangements. Barricades were erected all along Beach Road and personnel were deployed in large numbers. Joint Commissioner of Police, East, R. Sudhakar said, “We deployed our personnel at every point. Personnel from the mounted horse unit also patrolled the beach.We took every effort to keep people away and they cooperated.” Service roads and the Loop Road off Marina beach were blocked with iron barricades. Similar arrangements were put in place on Elliot’s beach, Neelangarai, Thiruvanmiyur, Palavakkam and Kanathur areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beaches-parks-deserted-on-kaanum-pongal/article33592010.ece
17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Deans, senior professors take vaccine||As a confidence-building measure, deans of a number of government medical college hospitals, along with several senior professors, took the COVID-19 vaccine on the first day of its launch on Saturday. In the first phase, healthcare providers are being vaccinated. On the first day, 52 persons registered for Covaxin and 30 for Covishield. In Chennai, the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) set up separate facilities to administer Covishield and Covaxin shots. It is one among the six centres in the State that has received doses of Covaxin. The hospital has received 6,400 of its doses. RGGGH dean E. Theranirajan, who opted for Covaxin, said 38 persons, including directors, professors, associate professors and staff nurses, had taken Covaxin shots. “This will build confidence among healthcare personnel. Our aim is to reach 100% immunisation among healthcare staff,” he said. At the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, Dean R. Jayanthi took the Covishield vaccine. “To lead by example, I took the first dose,” she said. Similarly, at the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, the vaccine was administered to a total of 100 persons, including to Dean P. Balaji and professors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/deans-senior-professors-take-vaccine/article33591496.ece
17 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Offences cannot be compounded based on ‘unholy’ compromises: HC||In cases involving charges of impersonation and forgery of records, the offences can neither be compounded nor quashed if the accused and the victim had entered into a “unholy” compromise and decided to settle the matter among themselves, the Madras High Court has said. Impersonating sisters Justice P.N. Prakash observed so while dismissing a petition filed by a person to quash a criminal case booked against him for having allegedly made two women impersonate his sisters to sell one of the many immovable properties inherited by the siblings after their parents’ death. Though petitioner’s counsel contended that the property in question was actually allotted to his client in a family settlement and that one of his sisters had unnecessarily lodged a police complaint due to her greed for money, the judge said the lawyer was not seeing the wood for the trees. The court pointed out that the issue in question was not whether the petitioner, R. Amudhan, was entitled to sell the property or not, but whether he had two women Savitri and Suseela impersonate his sisters K. Sangeetha and Uma Balaji at the time of registration of the sale deed or not. Referring to overwhelming evidence collected by Vellore town police to prove that the impersonators had signed the sale deed and also affixed their thumb impressions at a Sub Registrar’s office in 2004, the court said: “The report of the finger print expert is available in black and white on record along with the chargesheet.” It went on to state that though both the sisters of the petitioner had been impersonated, only one, Ms. Balaji, residing in the United States, had chosen to lodge a police complaint after the offence came to her knowledge. “Somewhere down the line, Sangeetha and Amudhan had entered into a deal and settled the matter between themselves.” “In the opinion of this court, in a case of this nature where there has been impersonation and forgery of records, even if the accused and the victim enter into an unholy compromise, the offences can neither be compounded nor quashed on the ground that the siblings have settled the matter amongst themselves,” he concluded. Since the present quash petition had been pending in the High Court since 2017 when a stay had been granted for the trial court proceedings, the judge directed the petitioner to participate in the trial and not adopt any dilatory tactics. The petitioner was also warned of being remanded to judicial custody if he delayed the trial. The investigators were also given liberty to register a fresh First Information Report under Section 229A (failure by person released on bail or bond to appear in court whenever he/she is called upon to do so) of the Indian Penal Code if the petitioner absconds during the course of trial.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/offences-cannot-be-compounded-based-on-unholy-compromises-hc/article33592242.ece

17 January 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||57,004 frontline workers register online for vaccination, says Minister||A total of 57,004 COVID-19 frontline workers from government hospitals, primary health centres and private hospitals in Coimbatore district have been registered on the CoWIN online portal for vaccine administration, said Minister for Municipal Administration S.P. Velumani here on Saturday. Speaking to reporters after inaugurating the COVID-19 vaccination drive at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH), he said that the vaccination drive was carried out at CMCH, Mettupalayam Government Hospital, Pollachi Government Hospital and Nallattipalayam Primary Health Centre, where a maximum of 100 beneficiaries per centre were administered the vaccine. At CMCH, the beneficiaries included 34 doctors, 37 medical college students, conservancy workers and Dean P. Kalidas, Mr. Velumani said. The vaccines will not be administered to those under the age of 18, pregnant and lactating women in the State, he said. V. Booma, Head of the Department of Paediatrics and Vaccination Nodal Officer at CMCH, became the first beneficiary of the Covishield vaccine at CMCH. She told mediapersons that it was a proud moment for her when the vaccine was administered. “There was no panic, because I was mentally prepared,” she said. Dr. Kalidas, who was the second beneficiary to be vaccinated, said that a rapid response team was ready at the observation room to attend to the beneficiaries if they experience any adverse side effects following the vaccination. However, there were no reports of adverse side effects among the beneficiaries, he said. S. Kannammal, one of the contract conservancy workers at CMCH who was vaccinated, said that she worked for eight months as part of the housekeeping staff at the hospital’s COVID-19 ward. “I hope this [pandemic] will come to an end soon,” she said prior to the vaccination. District Collector K. Rajamani, Deputy Director of Health Services (Coimbatore) G. Ramesh Kumar, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (officer on special duty) P. Vadivelan and Commissioner of Coimbatore Corporation P. Kumaravel Pandian were among the officials who were present at CMCH during the inauguration of the vaccination drive. The Health Department said that only 72 out of the 400 beneficiaries were vaccinated across Coimbatore district as of 5.30 p.m. on Saturday. This included 40 beneficiaries at CMCH, 24 at Pollachi Government Hospital, two at Mettupalayam Government Hospital and six at Nallattipalayam PHC. Sources in the Department claimed that a section of frontline workers was hesitant to participate in the vaccination drive. The officials also experienced technical difficulties while registering the names of the beneficiaries in the CoWIN portal, according to the sources. In Tirupur, Minister for Animal Husbandry Udumalai K. Radhakrishnan inaugurated the vaccination drive at the Government Hospital in Udumalpet. The vaccination drive was carried out at Tiruppur Government Medical College Hospital, Government Hospital at Dharapuram and Primary Health Centre at Perumanallur apart from the Udumalpet Government Hospital. Tiruppur district saw a relatively higher number of frontline workers getting vaccinated, as the vaccines were administered to 195 out of 400 beneficiaries in the four vaccination centres across the district. A total of 16,640 frontline workers from the district have been registered for vaccination in the CoWIN portal, a press release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/57004-frontline-workers-register-online-for-vaccination-says-minister/article33592029.ece
17 January 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘Exempt building completion certificate for small units’||Consumer organisation, Coimbatore Consumer Cause (CCC), has written to Chief Minister seeking exemption from building completion certificate for small commercial establishments and local bodies in a few cases for drawing power connection. In a representation, the CCC’s secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said the State government responding to a Madras High Court order on unauthorised and unsafe buildings by framing the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019 was to be welcomed. For, the Rules made building completion certificate from local body or authority concerned mandatory for obtaining power, water and sewer connection. And, as no structure built without parking space, set back area or fire safety measures would be eligible for the certificate, the Rules would check violations. In framing the Rules, the State government had exempted residential buildings upto 12m in height with not more than three dwelling units or 750 sq.m. and industrial buildings. The absence of exemption from building completion certificate for small commercial establishments had resulted in a situation where petty shops, those with temporary roof, thatched roof shops, could not have power connection under Tangedco’s commercial tariff. And, the peculiar situation was that such small structures with temporary walls or roofs were not getting plan approval, Mr. Kathirmathiyon pointed out and added that local bodies gave plan approval only for construction of buildings. Or, when there was no construction involved how could local bodies issue building completion certificate? And, the irony was that without such certificate the Tangedco would not give power connection, he intoned and said people who wanted to draw power for their small commercial establishments were facing difficult. This lack of exemption had also hit hard the local bodies themselves as they were unable to obtain power connection for parks, borewells, street lights. Farmers seeking power connection were also affected, he added. Drawing the Chief Minister’s attention, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said in a few cases the Tangedco officials had reluctantly given power connection to parks after obtaining undertaking from local bodies that the latter would not carryout any construction. And, on the other hand, the local bodies did not bother to follow the Rules and continued to provide water and sewerage connection. Therefore, it would be prudent if the government were to amend the Rules to provide exemption to small commercial establishments – at least to those measuring not more than 1,000 sq.ft. - and a few other categories like parks, street lights, borewells, traffic signals, etc., he suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consumer-body-seeks-exemption-from-building-completion-certificate-for-small-commercial-establishments/article33592036.ece

The V.O.C. Park and the Children’s Park in the city, Kodiveri Anicut and the park attached to the Bhavani Sagar Reservoir are the places where people gather in large numbers along with friends, relatives to celebrate Kaanum Pongal. As part of COVID-19 precautionary measure, the State government had ordered closure of all tourism spots in the district for three days. Police personnel were posted in front of the parks in the city to prevent people from ga thering in large numbers. Regular visitors to the parks said that the parks were closed to public in April 2019 for maintenance works. “Even establishing a park may not take two years, but development works are being carried out for two years now,” said Saraswathi, a resident of Kallukadaimedu, here. She said that when cinemas were allowed to operate, closing tourism spots was not a right decision. Similarly, the anicut and park that sees a large number of visitors during Pongal holidays remained out of bounds for the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/closure-of-tourism-spots-on-kaanum-pongal-leaves-people-disappointed/article33591548.ece

Police said that farmers Periasamy (45) of Athiyur, and Sadayappan (50) had raised tapioca in their lands at Attanai village in Kempanaickenpalayam.

17 January 2021||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||Injured elephant treated by SOS team, critical||A 40-year-old male elephant that was hit by a container truck near Sanamavu Reserve forest on Hosur-Krishnagiri national highway was moved to Aiyyur forest camp for treatment. The elephant’s hind body was incapacitated with fractures and is feared to have suffered internal injuries, according to the forest department. A wildlife SOS team from Karnataka had arrived to Aiyyur forest to attend to the grievously injured elephant. According to the District Forest Office Prabhu, bone fracture in the right hind foot was confirmed through X ray by the SOS team. On Friday night, a Chennai bound container truck from Bengaluru was speeding through the Hosur-Krishnagiri highway near Sanamavu forest range, when it hit the elephant that was crossing the highway. A Tuticorin man driving the truck was also injured in the accident and was admitted to Hosur government hospital with injuries. The man has been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The Hosur-Krishnagiri national highway running through the reserve forests that lie on the migratory route of elephants was yet to be equipped with speed monitors and floodlights that could help prevent such accidents. Absence of flood lights to light up the otherwise mist-filled dark nights on the highway, which is also the inter-state container corridor, has caused many accidents killing elephants. The NHAI also does not have speed monitors to regulate the speed of trucks, which take to the highway at nights, which is also the time when elephants cross the highway. In 2015, an elephant calf was killed by a speeding car near Perandapalli on the highway. In 2016, an adult elephant was hit by a bus near Shoolagiri. In 2017, an elephant was injured in an accident and its tusks were broken after being hit by a lorry on the same highway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/injured-elephant-treated-by-sos-team-critical/article33591553.ece
17 January 2021||KARUR,TAMIL NADU||65-year-old man dies during rooster fight in Karur||A 65-year-old man was killed after he was injured by a rooster, which had a sharp blade tied to its legs, at Poolamvalasu on the outskirts of Aravakurichi near here on Saturday. The police identified the victim as P. Thangavelu of Usilampatti near Vedasanthur in Dindigul district. He was the owner of one of the roosters that were engaged in the cockfight. Being the owner of the bird, the victim was standing near the two fighting birds and cheering. Suddenly one of the birds flew out of the arena and hit him. The sharp blade had apparently cut an artery on his right thigh and he started bleeding profusely. Onlookers rushed to the Primary Health Centre in an ambulance, stationed at the venue. After first aid, Thangavelu was admitted to a private hospital in Karur, where he succumbed to the injury. “With a deep cut on his thigh, he lost blood extensively. Though the ambulance was parked at the venue, he could not be transported quick enough due to the swarming crowds gathered at the venue,” a police officer, who present at the venue, told The Hindu . The event was brought to an end abruptly as news of his death reached the venue. According to a rough estimate, a whopping 7,000 roosters fought on the last day of the event on Saturday. Trained roosters from Karur, Erode, Coimbatore, Dindigul, Madurai, Theni, and Tirunelveli were brought to the event. There were participants from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telengana too. It was alleged that most of the cocks were let into the fight arena with knives tied to their legs in violation of rules. The three-day annual event began on Wednesday. Friday was the last day of the event. Since the second-day event was cancelled due to heavy rain the organisers chose to extend it to Saturday. According to the police, 60 persons were injured in the three-day event. While 34 persons sustained injuries on the first day, the birds that were tied with knives to their legs illegally inflicted injuries on nine persons on the second day. Twenty-seven persons suffered injuries on Saturday. The Aravakurichi police have so far registered 15 cases and arrested 20 persons for violating the rules during the event. In 2014, two bystanders had died of blood injuries after being inflicted by a sharp knife tied to the leg of the cocks. The cockfight was subsequently banned. It was resumed in 2019 after a gap of five years after an order was obtained from the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-dies-during-rooster-fight-in-karur/article33591527.ece

17 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Centre to set up export hub for jasmine, says MP||Central Government has included jasmine in the list of products with export potential, identified under the ‘Districts as Exports Hubs.” Talking to reporters here on Saturday, Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore said that Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal had sent him a letter in response to the issue raised by him in the Lok Sabha in September 2020. Mr. Tagore had sought to make Tirumangalam and Tirupparankundram export hubs for jasmine industry. “As importance of jasmine flowers in Madurai is well perceived in international markets, the Government of Tamil Nadu has planned to promote Jasmine cluster in Madurai district,” the Union Minister said in his letter. Drop in cultivation  Mr. Tagore said that the cultivation area of jasmine has been shrinking in the blocks of Tirupparankundram, Tirumangalam, Sedapatti and Usilampatti as the seasonal flower often does not fetch them good profit. “Export of jasmine has been with the private players as of now. Not everyone can make use of the export opportunities. If the Government sets up its own export hub, the farmers will get more facilities like cold storage, that will help them preserve their goods,” Mr. Tagore said. Mr. Goyal said that Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority has constituted a Floriculture Export Promotion Forum to constantly monitor, identify and anticipate opportunities for export of flowers. This is inclusive of jasmine, he said. The letter said that the forum would monitor developments in international market and disseminate relevant information to all stakeholders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-to-set-up-export-hub-for-jasmine-says-mp/article33591526.ece

17 January 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Officials issue third flood warning at Vaigai dam||With the storage level at the Vaigai dam reaching 69 feet, the officials gave the third warning of a possible flood along the riverbed here on Saturday. The dam's maximum storage level stands at 71 feet. A few days ago, the first and second flood warning was issued when the storage level crossed the 66-feet mark. With copious inflow to the dam following widespread rain along the western ghats and in the catchment areas of the dam, the storage level rose steadily. Normally, PWD engineers would discharge the entire inflow when the level crossed 69 feet. However, as many of the tanks and rivers downstream were experiencing sufficient water, it had been decided to retain the inflow until it reached the full storage level of 71 feet, officials said. Though the rainfall in the catchment areas had subsided on Saturday, the officials were hopeful of the dam getting its full capacity in the next 48 hours or so, following which the surplus would be released. Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam released water for irrigation in the 58-canal on Saturday in the presence of Collector M. Pallavi Baldev and MP O.P. Raveendranath.

Though there was no fresh spell of rain on Saturday, stagnant rainwater has made life miserable for residents of Chidambara Nagar, Bryant Nagar, Boltonpuram, Masilamanipuram, Housing Board Quarters, Anna Nagar, Tooveypuram, Muthammal Colony, State Bank Colony, KTC Nagar, Selvanayagapuram, Kurinji Nagar, Athiparasakthi Nagar, P and T Colony, Chinnakannupuram, Fatima Nagar, Muthiahpuram, Lourdhammalpuram, Poobalarayarpuram and St. Mary’s Colony. Vehicular movement near Kamaraj College and Sivanthaakulam has been hit due to knee-deep stagnant water. A group of BJP cadres staged a protest by planting plantain saplings in the stagnant water near Agsar Paints Junction. Residents of State Bank Colony, Muththammal Colony, Rahmath Nagar and Housing Board Quarters staged a road roko on the Ettaiyapuram Highway demanding proper draining of stagnant water while residents of Bryant Nagar 12th street also staged a similar agitation. The protests were withdrawn after the police and the Corporation officials promised to drain the rainwater at the earliest. The Corporation personnel continue to pump out the stagnant rainwater even as the raised groundwater level due to the recent rains made their job tough. “Since the groundwater level has come up after the rains in November and December, water stagnation was reported in more than 100 places where the Corporation fitted pumps to drain the water. Even as this work was completed and these slushy points started drying up, the unexpected rainfall has made our job tough. So we’ve deployed 144 pumps, 15 tanker lorries and eight heavy equipments to drain the stagnant rainwater at the earliest,” said V. P. Jayaseelan, Corporation Commissioner. After the Korampallam tank overflowed, paddy and plantain cultivated in Aththimarappatti, Mullakkadu and Muthiahpuram area have been submerged. As rainfall has almost stopped in Tirunelveli district, discharge of water from the dams has been reduced drastically. The Tamirabharani, which was carrying over 65,000 cusecs of water on Wednesday, received only 8,387 cusecs of water from the dams on Saturday. A total of 21 houses have been fully damaged in the recent rains while 42 houses partly damaged. The relief centres now have 205 persons, including 76 women. In Surandai area of Tenkasi district, three houses collapsed at Sivagurunathapuram,, Idaiyarthavanai and Duraisamypuram following recent rains.

17 January 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 vaccination drive begins in southern districts||The Department of Public Health commenced vaccination of front line health workers on Saturday. With Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital Dean M. Ravichandran receiving the first shot in the presence of Collector V. Vishnu and Deputy Director of Public Health M. Varadharajan, the vaccination drive was kicked off with doctors, nurses and staff cheering. After the dry run on January 2 and 8, the vaccination commenced to cover 100 beneficiaries. The district received 15,100 vaccines and 66,000 disposable syringes. “We don’t compel any health worker to get vaccinated as it is being done only with their consent so as to shield them against the virus. The second vaccination will be done on the 28th day at the same centre where the first dose was given. During this period, he or she should ensure physical distancing, wash hands frequently, wear gloves and sanitise the hands,” said Mr. Vishnu. Details of about 20,963 beneficiary health workers have been uploaded in the CoWIN App. Collector K. Senthil Raj and Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar inaugurated the vaccination at Tiruchendur Government Hospital in Thoothukudi district. In Tenkasi district, Collector G. S. Sameeran inaugurated the drive at Government Hospital. Only one turns up In Kanniyakumari, Collector M. Aravind inaugurated the drive at Government Medical College Hospital in the presence of Dean Suganthi. Most of the health workers, who were asked to come to the Padmanabhapuram GH, did not turn up. “Though the Union Government has chosen Covishield and Covaccine as vaccines for COVID-19, the latter is yet to complete its phase 3 trial and hence the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association has asked doctors, nurses and other health workers to insist for Covishield. Hence, our people are hesitant,” said a health worker, who had to receive the first shot at Padmanabhapuram Government Hospital. Deputy Director of Public Health Bosco Raj, while admitting that there was hesitation among some of the beneficiaries, said no one was being compelled. “One person received the shot in the afternoon at Padmanabhapuram Government Hospital and we’ve informed some of those who have been listed for tomorrow (Sunday) to receive the vaccine today (Saturday),” sources said. Virudhunagar The vaccination drive got under way at seven vaccination centres in Virudhunagar district. Out of the 180 health workers who had given willingness for getting the injection, 141 of them, including doctors, nurses and health workers, were administered the shots. Joint Director of Medical Services R. Manoharan said that there could have been hesitation among some of them since it was the first day. “With all doctors, nurses and health workers having started to take the doses, there will not be any hesitation from tomorrow,” he said. Among those who were the first to get vaccinated are Chief Civil Surgeon N. Anbuvel and Virudhunagar GH Superintendent N. Aravind Babu. “We are getting the similar vaccine that has been administered to several thousands of people in the UK. It is very safe,” said Dr. Aravind Babu. Stating that there was no pain and other complications to the beneficiaries, he said people need not have any fear to get vaccinated. A senior staff nurse S. Kala (52), who took the dose, said it will help her prevent from getting infected with the COVID-19 infection. Virudhunagar district has got 9,720 dosages of Covishield vaccine. Virudhunagar Health unit district — Virudhunagar Medical College hospital, Aruppukottai GH and M. Reddiyapatti Primary Health Centre — has been allotted 3,320 dosages. Sivakasi health unit district – Sivakasi and Rajapalayam GHs, Cunnoor and M. Pudupatti PHCs — will get 6,420 dosages. “Since the availability of dosages is very limited, health workers would be given the shots on first-come-first-served bases. A five-member medical team would monitor the beneficiaries for 30 minutes after the vaccination is done. Deputy Director of Health Palanisamy was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-drive-begins-with-health-workers/article33592120.ece
17 January 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Health workers get vaccinated with Covishield on first day||The COVID-19 vaccination programme was conducted in Vellore, Tirupathur, Ranipet and Tiruvannamalai districts on Saturday. According to data released by the Health Department, a total of 154 health workers got vaccinated with the Covishield vaccine on the first day and all of them got a provisional certificate for the vaccination (1st dose). The vaccine was administered in three centres in Ranipet, three in Cheyyar, five in Tirupathur, four in Vellore and six in Tiruvannamalai district respectively. The vaccination programme began at 11.30 a.m in the districts. The capacity of the day, in all the four districts together, was 1,800. In Vellore, out of the 400 beneficiaries allotted for the day, a total of 55 got vaccinated. In Ranipet, the planned number was 300, and 15 of them got the vaccine shot. In Tiruvannamalai, the numbers were 600 and 36, and in Tirupathur 500 and 48. While 18,600 doses have been allocated for Vellore, 4,400 have been set aside for health workers in Ranipet. The number stands at 4,700 in Tirupathur, 10,000 for Tiruvannamalai and 4,400 in Cheyyar. "We received a total of 42,100 doses totally and on the first day, 100 beneficiaries per centre are supposed to get vaccinated in every district," said a senior official from the Health Department. S. Thilipan, Chief Medical Officer, Tirupathur Government Hospital, said he took the vaccine first in the district. “I did not have any adverse effect. In fact, after 30 minutes of observation, I went back to work. There will be some hesitation on the first day as it is a new vaccine. All the health workers will be vaccinated in a phased manner," he added. A provisional certificate for COVID-19 vaccination (1st dose) with the name of the beneficiary, Aadhar ID, name of the vaccine, and the next due date for vaccination was also provided to the beneficiaries. C. Inbraraj, Resident Medical Officer, Government Vellore Medical college, took the first shot of the vaccine in Vellore district. “I was ready to get vaccinated first as I wanted to allay fears about the after-effects of vaccination and hesitancy among other health workers. This is less painful than the Tetanus vaccine and I am perfectly fine now,” he said. T. Manivannan, Deputy Director of Health Services, Vellore, said that the health workers in the district were already educated about the vaccine. “The dry run helped in the smooth implementation of the programme,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/health-workers-get-vaccinated-with-covishield-on-first-day/article33592185.ece

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Back to school: doing things differently in a pandemic||After a gap of nearly 10 months, school campuses in Tamil Nadu will finally throw open their doors to a section of students from Tuesday. Schools in the State were asked to shut their campuses when the first national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic was announced on March 24, 2020. For the students, staff and school managements, the wait has been one filled with doubts, challenges, uncertainties and new lessons. The Tamil Nadu government had in November 2020 mooted the reopening of schools for students of Classes 9 to 12. But this did not materialise following concerns from both schools and parents on the health and safety aspects involved. The number of COVID-19 cases has significantly decreased since then and with growing concerns surrounding the future course of action for students of Classes 10 and 12, who will have to take their board examinations in March, the State government once again proposed the reopening of schools for these students alone. While official orders to this effect had been passed by the Tamil Nadu government, based on positive feedback from parents and schools, there is a lot to consider and implement in order to secure the health and safety of both the staff and students on campus. Tamil Nadu is not the first State to take a decision to reopen schools for senior students. Schools and PU colleges reopened for Classes 10 and 12 in Karnataka from January 1, with several precautionary measures in place. Many private schools in the State were, however, reported to have continued with online classes instead of calling students back to campus. This was attributed to both safety concerns as well as being unable to afford the cost of implementing all the guidelines mandated in the standard operating procedures (SOPs) laid down by the State. Guidelines ready The Tamil Nadu government released a detailed set of guidelines and has been holding meetings with school heads in every district to brief them. With the board examinations approaching fast, many schools are expecting a majority of students to return to campus. “Our first priority will be to get the campus ready, keeping the SOPs in mind, for the students and the staff. While we are planning to call teachers to the school from January 19, students will be called a week later. We are also planning to invite parents to the campus to see the measures we have implemented,” P.G. Subramanian, principal, Bhavan’s Rajaji Vidyashram, Chennai, said. M. Aruna Kumari, principal, The TVS School, Madurai, said they have planned to open multiple gates for the entry and exit of students. “We are allowing only 50% of our students to attend classes everyday. We have also planned to have half-day shifts for students,” she said. “We will also have to ensure that students do not exchange food, handkerchiefs or face masks amongst themselves. Stickers on tables will indicate where students should sit,” said R. Murugeswari, headmistress of Kasturbai Gandhi Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School. Schools have further been asked not to conduct assemblies or mass gatherings of any kind. But the major challenge for teachers is to ensure physical distancing norms during lunch breaks and other short breaks in between classes. The headmaster of a school in Virudhunagar said they should be allowed to take a decision on school timings. “The best solution would be to have students come in two shifts in a day. If students work in different sessions — morning and afternoon — they need not bring lunch to school,” he added. In Vellore district, officials said a major challenge would be to allay fears among parents about sending their children to school. “We will be taking written consent from them before we allow children to come to class,” said K. Gunasekaran, Chief Educational Officer (CEO), Vellore. Officials from the Education Department in Coimbatore district, too, said parents would not be forced to send their children to schools. “Schools have been instructed to continue online classes for those students whose parents are not willing to send them,” the official added. With the State government mandating that not more than 25 students can be seated in a classroom at a time, most schools are planning to simultaneously stream the lessons online, especially for classes with huge numbers. “Schools will utilise the classrooms that are vacant to split students into smaller batches,” said R. Visalakshi, president, Tamil Nadu Private Schools Association. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has already announced that the board examinations would begin from May 4 for Classes 10 and 12, and that schools have been given the flexibility to start conducting practical examinations on campuses from March 1. With campuses having remained shut throughout the academic year, no laboratory work has happened. Once schools reopen, this was -one aspect that teachers would be focusing on. “For State board students, and especially students from government schools who have not had any online classes, we will initiate laboratory and practical work only when we are given some clarity about the reduced syllabus. Teachers are expecting some reduction in the number of experiments and the record work that needs to be completed,” said Patric Raymond, a chemistry teacher and the general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation. Meanwhile, students in residential schools from Classes 10 and 12 have been allowed to come back and the State government has issued guidelines. “Apart from following guidelines, including compulsory mask-wearing at all times and the strict enforcement of physical distancing norms, the main focus for residential schools will be the dormitories and the dining halls,” said C. Satish, director, Paavai Group of Institutions. Mr. Satish said while students were usually allowed to eat breakfast in their hostel mess between 7.30 a.m. to 8.30 a.m., they would now be allotted staggered timings to ensure that there was no crowding. “Since it is just going to be students of Classes 10 and 12 for now, we can ensure that they are spread across dormitories as well,” he said. All the washrooms in the hostel, too, would be opened up for students so that there is no crowding. “After schools reopen for Class 10 and 12, we will have to chalk out a plan as to how we can enforce these guidelines when more students come back, and how we should make infrastructural changes to accommodate this,” Mr. Satish added. Ganesh Moorthy, CEO, Salem district, which is home to several residential schools, also said schools were being instructed to prevent crowding in study halls, apart from washrooms and dining halls. “Schools have been advised to permit two students in four-sharing rooms and one in two-sharing rooms in the hostels. A thorough disinfection of the hostel premises will have to be carried out when students are out attending classes,” he said. Access to online classes While several private schools were able to easily make the switch to online learning, the same was not true for students from economically backward sections as well as from rural areas, who have had to grapple with both access and connectivity issues. “Most of our students have not watched the televised lessons aired on Kalvi TV. We will have to start teaching them from scratch after reopening the schools,” said K. Balamurugan, a Tamil teacher at the Government Higher Secondary School in Sholavandan. Many government students had taken up odd jobs to financially support their families when the schools were closed, he added. “We will now have to call the students individually and ensure that they attend the classes after schools reopen,” he said. S. Kannappan, Director of School Education, said guiding students and ensuring that they were in the right frame of mind took precedence over rushing to complete the portions. “Our focus is on two aspects — that the students and the staff are aware about the safety measures to be followed and to ensure that students get the right guidance and psychological support since many of them are coming back to school after a long break,” he said.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Vaccine drive begins||Vaccination against COVID-19 got off to a slow start in the central region with frontline healthcare workers administered the vaccines on Saturday. The first phase of the vaccine roll-out seeks to cover doctors, nurses and paramedical and support staff. In Tiruchi, the vaccination drive started with only four doctors receiving the validation message from CoWin (application developed to manage the drive) at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). Doctors at the GH attributed the glitches to server overload and said it would be rectified soon. The District Immunisation Officer must give approval to 100 beneficiaries per centre, per day, following which an SMS would be sent alerting the beneficiaries of the date and site of administration. “We were only able to give approval to a few doctors on Saturday. Soon, the system will all be streamlined," a senior health official said. As the day progressed, 20 beneficiaries were administered the vaccine. “Professors in various departments at MGMGH, doctors from a few nearby primary healthcare centres and the dean’s driver were among those who received the vaccination,” a hospital source said. Meanwhile, 47 persons were vaccinated at Lalgudi Government Hospital, 25 at Srirangam Government Hospital, eight at Puthanatham Primary Healthcare Centre, and four at Inamkulathur Primary Healthcare Centre. All beneficiaries were administered with Covishield vaccines in Tiruchi on Saturday, according to K. Vanitha, Dean. While 100 people were supposed to be vaccinated at each centre, the numbers were much less in most centres across districts in the region. While many reported that they were yet to get accustomed to CoWin application, causing delays in confirmation and acknowledgement messages, a few doctors said it was anxiety and inhibition on the part of beneficiaries, which would be overcome in a few days. Pudukottai Collector P. Uma Maheshwari, who inaugurated the vaccination drive in the district, told reporters that a total of 10,119 beneficiaries were registered for the first phase of vaccination in the district. Pudukottai Government Medical College Hospital, Alangudi Government Hospital, Aranthangi Government Hospital and Tiruvarankulam Primary Healthcare Centre were the vaccination centres in the district. A total of 65 beneficiaries, including PMCH Dean M. Poovathi, received their first dose in Pudukottai. One beneficiary was given a dose of Covaxin. A total of 5,100 doses of COVID-19 vaccines were received in Perambalur district where the roll-out was inaugurated by Collector P. Sri Venkata Priya. Deputy Director of Health Services R. Geetha Rani was the first to be administered the vaccine at Perambalur District Headquarters Hospital, the only special centre for vaccination in the district. Only two received the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-drive-begins/article33591490.ece

Due to BHEL’s policy to do away with the clause, ancillary units face a huge setback after the cost of steel increased by nearly 40%. BHELSIA’s position is that the Golden Railway Workshop and the Integral Coach Factory should deviate from L1 tender system where the lowest quotation is prioritised. A threshold must be fixed for ensuring better quality, BHELSIA president Rajappa Rajkumar said. The association has been invited for a vendor meet of Golden Railways Workshop later this month and, subsequently, with Integral Coach Factory. BHELSIA is confident that the railways will recognise the superiority of the eco-system for heavy machinery fabrication in Tiruchi region. Under the L1 system, welding deficiencies in railway coaches are quite visible, Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar said in the wake of media reports published earlier this month that the new Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches manufactured by ICF has developed leaks. Water seepage through weld joints was noticeable during the rains.  Industrialists say the scope for expansion of thermal power generation appears bleak with the shift towards renewable energy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bhelsia-to-insist-on-price-variation-clause/article33591515.ece

A section of progressive farmers has begun to prevail upon the government machinery to consider deployment of portable paddy driers at direct purchase centres to help farmers sell their paddy with moisture content of 17% to 20%. Harvested paddy and the standing crop have been badly affected by the unseasonal rain. Several thousand of acres of paddy crop are lodged due to heavy rain and inundation in the district and in neighbouring delta areas. Progressive farmers such as G. Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam have urged officials to deploy PPD machines to help them meet the moisture content limit for sale of paddy at DPCs. Though the State government has announced that paddy with a moisture content of up to 20% will be procured at DPCs in view of the unexpected inclement weather over the past few weeks, the harvested paddy stored in the open near the centres in areas such as Ponnappur near Uloor in Pattukottai region has started to sprout, farmer say. With weathermen predicting normalcy in the days to come, paddy crop ready for harvest but lodged on the fields may also face a similar situation. Hence, portable paddy driers at direct purchase centres will be of immense help to them to salvage some quantity of paddy grain during the current season, the farmers point out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-for-portable-paddy-driers-at-dpcs-in-thanjavur-district/article33591522.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||In T.N., just 2,783 health workers get the jab||In fact, two of the six centres that rolled out Covaxin — the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital and the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College Hospital, Tiruchi — had no takers. No adverse event after immunisation was reported. However, Health Department officials said this was not a target-approach, but the exercise was based on the willingness of healthcare providers. Several doctors, expressing apprehensions about the vaccines, chose to wait and watch before making a decision. Health officials and hospital authorities hoped for an improvement in the response from doctors in the coming days. Chennai and Salem had the most number of vaccination sites, with 12 each. In Chennai, 310 of the 1,200 healthcare providers/workers took Covishield. Salem followed with 288 of the 1,200 persons. At Tiruppur, the vaccine was administered to 195 persons, while in Madurai, where the programme was launched by the Chief Minister, 146 of the total 500 persons took the vaccine. There were 107 takers in Tiruvallur and 103 each in Cuddalore and Tiruvarur. Some of the districts that ended with the lowest figures were Perambalur 2/100, Nagapattinam 10/400, Ariyalur 14/300, Ranipet 15/300, Kallakurichi 21/200 and Pudukottai 23/400. Of the 99 persons who opted for Covaxin, 40 received it at the Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, 38 at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai, 20 at the Chengalpattu Medical College Hospital and one at the Pudukottai Medical College Hospital. The vaccination took off across the State even as many doctors chose to wait and watch before making a decision. “Most of the doctors at my hospital are not willing to get vaccinated. The hesitancy is mainly due to the fear about safety and the fact that these vaccines came about in such a short span of time,” a hospital authority said. A senior government doctor in Chennai said the authorities struggled to get a nod from doctors and staff members until a day before the vaccination. A doctor at the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Government Estate, said he might take the vaccine after a week.  Doctors object Many doctors objected to taking Covaxin. At RGGGH, one of the six centres that offered Covaxin, 38 doctors took the vaccine. Among them were the dean, two directors, four professors and 20 staff members of two ICMR institutes. The screening and consent form for Covaxin said, “In phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, Covaxin has demonstrated the ability to produce antibodies against COVID-19. However, the clinical efficacy of Covaxin is yet to be established and it is still being studied in phase 3 clinical trial. Hence, it is important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to COVID-19 need not be followed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/in-tn-just-2783-health-workers-get-the-jab/article33591499.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Despite loss, grape grower keen on organic farming||A farmer who became popular for his organic paneer grapes variety at Esanai here says intermittent rain in the region have wreaked havoc on his crop. Despite incurring losses, R. Perumal alias Surulirajan is determined to grow fruits and vegetables with organic farming techniques. While 2019 was a good year for cultivation of grapes, the rain this year have ruined at least two acres of shallots and reduced yield of grapes by at least one-fourth, Mr. Perumal told The Hindu . He has incurred at least two lakhs worth of losses this year alone, he says. While his first stint with grape cultivation was in 1999, he took up organic farming only in 2019. “I find that we put all sorts of chemicals in our food, which reflects on our health. We are unable to carry out our day-to-day activities after a certain age. Through healthy organic food that can be changed,” the 47-year-old farmer points out. A major quantity of the grapes is sold to visitors to the vineyard located on Perambalur-Athur road. “We do not sell to wholesalers as they are selective and will ignore some fruits, causing us to incur losses,” he says. While in 2019, he harvested nearly three tonnes of grapes, Mr. Perumal expects a yield of only around 700-900 kg this year. The size of the grapes too have significantly reduced. Contrary to a possible notion that grapes cannot grow in a dry area like Perambalur, Mr. Perumal says it is the least water-hungry of all orchard crops. Despite a financial blow this year, he has begun work on cultivation of grapes in another two cents of his two-acre area. “The pillars and other supporting wires are ready.

17 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Co-WIN app develops glitches on Day 1||Several among the 243 vaccine session sites faced difficulties in operating the COVID-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) application, resulting in the State achieving lesser than the targeted numbers. Only 61.64% (13,352) of the targeted 21,658 healthcare workers took the jab till 4 p.m. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar attributed the low numbers to several reasons, including technical glitches. “On the first day, many who had co-morbidities and were on the list have not been inoculated. Besides, the vaccination started around 11 a.m. instead of 9 a.m. and closed by 5 p.m. We are hoping the numbers will go up from Monday.” On technical glitches, the Minister told The Hindu , “There were just some teething problems and will be resolved from Monday onwards. Achieving nearly 62% on Day 1 for a new vaccine is definitely a good start.” Health workers in various vaccine sites said they faced problems while uploading data on the app about beneficiaries receiving the vaccine, as the application had slowed down. Due to these glitches, the beneficiary verification process and OTP generation got delayed making it inevitable for the staff at several sites to take up offline verification. The application has been developed by the Centre to monitor and track the inoculation process. “The app had slowed down since Friday. Not all messages were going to health workers who were supposed to receive the vaccine on Saturday morning. The beneficiaries were individually called up and informed over the phone,” said B.R. Venkateshaiah, Medical Superintendent of K.C. General hospital. He said the entire verification was done offline on Saturday. PMSSY Special Officer P.G. Girish said, “This could be probably because the application was being used across the country at the same time.” A senior Bengaluru civic official said that almost all vaccination centres reported issues with online real-time verification. Later in the evening, updates on who all were vaccinated were uploaded to the portal, the official said. “On Saturday, only 3 lakh beneficiaries were targeted to be vaccinated across the country. If Co-WIN portal cannot handle this load, it will multiply manifold from Monday, and it is unlikely that the portal will be helpful for verification of beneficiary credentials. We have decided to take it offline, do it manually and later update it on the portal,” the official pointed out. Inoculation began at the vaccine sites as soon as Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the vaccination drive nationally through video conferencing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/co-win-app-develops-glitches-on-day-1/article33591998.ece
17 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||City achieves 65% of vaccination target||Vaccination centres in the city wore a festive look, their walls decorated with flowers and balloons, for the launch of the COVID-19 vaccination drive on Saturday. Most of the healthcare workers in Yelahanka General Hospital and other vaccination centres in the city were visibly relieved to have an extra layer of protection. Bengaluru Urban district, including the corporation limits, achieved nearly 65% of the vaccination target set on Day 1. However, authorities were quick to add this was due to administrative issues and there was not a single case of ‘vaccine resistance’ among people. “It feels great to be part of this historic drive that is the beginning of winning the battle against this virus, which has wrecked lives across the world. There is a sense of relief and excitement,” Dr. Asma Tabassum, administrative medical officer at Yelahanka General Hospital, shortly after being inoculated. She added that she experienced neither pain nor side-effects. The drive was conducted in 11 centres in Bengaluru Urban district: six Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) hospitals and five other hospitals under the district administration. Though 942 healthcare workers were slated to get the shot, 610 were inoculated (64.7%). The city corporation hospitals met 65.1% of their target having inoculated 351 of 539 people. Hospitals under the district administration achieved a target of 64.4%: 259 of 402 healthcare workers were administered the vaccine. BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said the reasons for the lower targets achieved were two-fold. “The vaccination process, which includes half-an-hour of observation, takes time. If we do it from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., as scheduled, we can inoculate a hundred people, the daily target for each vaccination centre. But as Saturday was the first day, there were some teething problems, and the process began only by noon after the Prime Minister’s inauguration,” he said. The other reason was the malfunctioning of the Co-WIN portal. “Registered beneficiaries were to be sent an SMS scheduling their inoculation. However, in many cases, that did not happen. So some of those scheduled to be inoculated on Saturday as per our records may have not known about it. From Monday, we have asked medical facilities to manually inform beneficiaries registered with them the previous day,” Mr. Prasad added. Additional centres He added that they will launch 300 vaccination centres, including 145 Primary Healthcare Centres from Monday, and gradually increase it to 760 centres that have now been identified. “We have set a target of inoculating 1.5 lakh healthcare workers in the first phase. We have now received 1.05 lakh vaccines, and the rest are expected in the coming week. We aim to inoculate all 1.5 lakh registered healthcare workers over the next 10 days,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/city-achieves-65-of-vaccination-target/article33592007.ece
17 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC rejects govt. plea seeking transfer of PIL on lakes to NGT||The High Court of Karnataka on Saturday rejected the State government’s plea for transferring to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) a PIL petition, through which the court is monitoring measures taken by the government and its authorities to protect, rejuvenate and maintain lakes in the State. A Division Bench passed the order while observing that the NGT is only dealing with the issue of restoration of waterbodies whereas the High Court has been considering not only restoration but also removal of encroachments, rejuvenation, etc., of lakes, and maintenance of stormwater drains. “Nothing on record to show that the NGT is dealing with the same issues...,” the Bench said. The government’s plea for transferring the PIL comes after the High Court since the last one year had issued a series of orders, which include staying of handing over of lakes to private corporate entities under the Corporation Social Responsibility (CSR) scheme for rejuvenation and maintenance of lakes. The PIL before the High Court was filed by Citizen Action Group in 2014 and the proceedings before the NGT commenced in 2015. Meanwhile, the Bench directed the government to respond to allegations that recommendations, made in the 2011 report of Justice N.K. Patil Committee and accepted by the High Court in 2012, were violated by the government while entrusting six lakes to private corporates for rejuvenation and maintenance. In his application, Leo F. Saldanha of Environment Support Group, an NGO, alleged that visit to six lakes revealed that in some lakes, Sewerage Treatment Plants were permitted in no-construction zones and several other constructions that were prohibited as per the committee’s recommendations were allowed to be undertaken by the corporate entities. Hebbal lake in Mysuru was handed over to Infosys Foundation in 2016 for rejuvenation through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The government had signed similar MoUs between 2017 and 2020 with Bharat Electronics Ltd., Biocon Foundation, Titan Company Ltd., Say Trees Environmental Trust, and CMR University for rejuvenating and maintaining Doddabommasandra, Hebbagodi, Veerasandra, Nallurahalli, and Chagalatti lakes in Bengaluru city, respectively. The government, in its response to the court’s earlier query said that it had conducted workshops inviting private corporate entities to look after lakes through CSR schemes by making a provision in the Karnataka Tank Conservation & Development Authority Act, 2014, in this regard after CSR scheme was made a norm under the Companies Act, 2013. However, the Bench noted that the response submitted by the government did not state that a transparent process was adopted to select private corporate entities to rejuvenate and maintain lakes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-rejects-govt-plea-seeking-transfer-of-pil-on-lakes-to-ngt/article33591594.ece

Yediyurappa’s leadership in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and said the BJP government in State would complete its full term in office. Mr. Shah said the BJP government would complete the full term and the party would come to power again after the 2023 Assembly elections in the State. The Opposition Congress need not have doubts about the completion of the term by the BJP government, he said. Police quarters After the virtual inauguration of the police quarters under Police Gruha-2020 scheme and Police Gruha-2025 in various parts of the city, the Home Minister said Karnataka’s fight against the pandemic was “very good” and appreciated the Bengaluru police’s role in maintaining the law and order during the lockdown. He also inaugurated Indian Reserve Battalion unit’s administrative office building at Tikota, Vijaypura district. He recalled support given by the people to the ‘Janata Curfew’. India’s health infrastructure, which was considered as poor, improved a lot and the country had been exporting vaccines, ventilators, and PPE kits, Mr. Shah said. The Central government has supported the State government in all sectors and both the governments had been working for the welfare of people and development of the State, he said. Earlier, Mr. Shah flagged off 150 Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) vehicles, a nationwide unified emergency system to attend to emergencies of citizens in the country, from the grand steps of the Vidhana Soudha. With this, the number of ERSS vehicles increased to 734 in the State. People in distress can avail of the service of the ERSS by dialling the number 112. The ERSS is designed to address all emergency signals received from citizens through voice calls, SMS, email, panic SOS signal, and ERSS web portal. The exact location of a person in distress is forwarded to the control room and the location of the victim is displayed on the GIS map of the call receiver. The ERSS team would respond in 15 seconds and the team members would reach the spot in 15 minutes, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/our-govt-will-complete-its-term-party-will-come-back-to-power-in-2023-shah/article33591590.ece

17 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘State-owned corporations cannot entrust inquiries against staff to Lokayukta’||A State-owned corporation cannot entrust inquiries against its employees to the Lokayukta or Upalokayukta without specially adopting the Karnataka Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeals) Rules, 1957, through its Board of Directors, the Karnataka High Court has held. The court passed the order while quashing an order passed by the Managing Director of Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd. (KRIDL) in October 2018 entrusting an inquiry against three engineers to the Lokayukta. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while allowing petitions filed by G.B. Devaraj, an executive engineer, and two others. Noticing that the Board of KRIDL had adopted conduct and service rules of the State, the Bench said that Conduct Rules would mean Karnataka Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1966, and Service Rules is a vague term as the service conditions of a government servant is determined under various service rules. Pointing out that the power of entrusting an inquiry to the Lokayuka is dealt under the provisions of the KCS(CCA) Rules, 1957, which not only contains provision for entrusting the Lokayukta but also deals with elaborate procedure for conduct of disciplinary proceedings against government servant, the Bench held that KRIDL’s Board had not specifically adopted the 1957 rules when inquiry against the petitioners were entrusted to the Lokayukta. However, the court made it clear that quashing of entrusting of inquiry to Lokayukta would not preclude KRIDL to proceed against the petitioners as per its own cadre and recruitment rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-owned-corporations-cannot-entrust-inquiries-against-staff-to-lokayukta/article33591592.ece

17 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||A cooperative society in Karkala promotes local brand of rice||A cooperative society in Karkala in Udupi district has taken the lead to conserve a local variety of rice by promoting its paddy cultivation among local farmers and launch its marketing from Monday. The Parampara Multipurpose Cooperative Society Ltd. will market the boiled rice under its own brand name ‘Kaarla Kaje’. The president of the cooperative society Naveenchandra Jain told The Hindu that the rice is being promoted under ‘vocal4local’ initiative. He said that the particular ‘kaje’ variety of rice was once being cultivated in Karkala and its neighbourhood on a vast scale. As its cultivation came down gradually the cooperative society, which is full of farmers, thought of conserving it from fading from the fields. As some farmers who had its seeds were cultivating its paddy on a small scale the cooperative society gave its seeds to about 100 farmers to promote its cultivation. “As a first crop under the cooperative society’s initiative between 250 and 300 farmers cultivated it on about 200 hectares (900 acres) last year. We got about 3,000 quintals of rice from about 5,000 quintals of paddy cultivated. The same rice is ready for sale now,” he said, adding that preparations have been made to cultivate its second crop whose harvesting is expected in late February or in March. Mr. Jain said that the ‘Kaarla Kaje’ will be sold in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts in 5, 10 and 25 kg bags. The president, who himself cultivates it on about 35 acres to 40 acres, said that the particular variety yielded 15 quintals of paddy per an acre of land. Its rice can be stored up to three to five months. He said that if the paddy after drying is stored up to three months and then made as rice it tasted better. As the society now had only 3,000 quintals of rice with it, it can not be marketed outside the twin districts, which consumed boiled rice, even if demand grew, Mr. Jain, who is also the vice-president of Udupi District Krishika Samaja and president of Udupi District Bharatiya Kisan Sangha, said. The rice will be promoted as the brand of Karkala. Minister for Agriculture B.C. Patil will release the rice to market at Kukkanduru Gram Panchayat in Karkala on January 18, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-cooperative-society-in-karkala-promotes-local-brand-of-rice/article33592146.ece

17 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Withdraw COTPA Amendment Bill’||The proposed Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) Amendment Bill, 2020 has drawn flak from the Federation of All India Farmers’ Associations (FAIFA) on the grounds that the amendments would adversely impact legal cigarette trade while giving a huge boost to the ‘ever-growing illicit cigarette business in India’. FAIFA, a non-profit organisation representing the cause of farmers and farm workersof commercial crops across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Gujarat etc., termed the Bill a death knell for Indian Flue-Cured Virginia tobacco growers. Foreseeing an adverse impact on legal cigarette trade in India due to the proposed amendment bill, FAIFA’s national spokesperson Yashwanth Chidipothu, in a statement, said there would be a drastic drop in tobacco grown by Indian farmers, who would lose their only source of livelihood. FAIFA president Javare Gowda told The Hindu that the Government of India’s Health and Family Welfare Department recently circulated the proposed amendment Bill and sought the opinion of various stakeholders in the tobacco industry in an online interaction. Among other things, the Bill seeks to increase the minimum age for sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products from 18 years to 21, besides enhancing the penalty for offences under various sections of COTPA. “These harsh amendments that have been proposed will terrorise retailers and traders and they would not want to engage in the sale of cigarettes. As a result, criminal syndicates that have been pushing illegal tobacco will grain ground and will flood the Indian market with illicit cigarettes,” Mr. Gowda said. Since these illicit or smuggled cigarettes do not use domestically grown tobacco produced by Indian farmers, the result will be a loss of earnings and livelihood of millions of tobacco farmers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/withdraw-cotpa-amendment-bill-faifa/article33591574.ece

17 January 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Farmers to step up stir against dam work||Farmers under the aegis of the Action Council Against Thondar Dam, a coordination committee of 10 farmer groups in Thondarnadu, Edavaka and Vellamunda grama panchayats, are gearing up to intensify their agitation against the construction of a dam across the Thondar rivulet, a tributary of the Kabini river at Moolithodu in the district. Speaking to the media, S. Sherafudheen, coordinator of the organisation, said the farmers would hold a ‘Samara Sangamam’ (agitation meet) at the Government Lower Primary School at Moolithodu on Sunday. Environmentalist K. Sahadevan will inaugurate the meet at 2 p.m. The project envisages collecting 0.3 tmcft of water after constructing an earthen dam across the rivulet to irrigate 1,411 hectares in the three grama panchayats. Mr. Sherafudheen said the project would adversely affect hundreds of families in the three panchayats, and more than 150 families, including 50 tribal families, would face eviction for the first phase of construction of the reservoir. Feasibility study “According to a feasibility study, the reservoir will be constructed at a height of 13.5 metre, and we suspect that as much as 1,500 acres will be used for it. The project will adversely affect close to 650 families, including 150 tribal families, in seven wards under the three civic bodies,” Mr. Sharafudheen said. “We will not allow officials to enter our land to conduct survey for the project, as the public is against it,” said V. Abdulla, chairman of the organisation. The villagers had detained officials who had reached the area for the survey nearly a month ago, and the Thondarnadu grama panchayat board had passed a resolution against the project two months ago, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farmers-to-step-up-stir-against-dam-construction/article33591620.ece

Shylaja has said that the COVID-19 vaccine will be given to all according to its availability. Addressing the media here after assessing preparations for vaccination at the district hospital, the Minister said the vaccine would be made available to all as soon as more doses were available. Ms. Shylaja said once the vaccine was available, it would be made available at all health centres. The minister said immunisation was key to controlling epidemics. Smallpox, polio, and diphtheria were prevented through mass vaccination. She hoped that COVID-19 could also be controlled in the same way. She observed that with limited facilities in Kerala, the disease had been effectively prevented, and that the mortality rate had been kept at 0.4%. “It was possible because of systematic work by the government and cooperation from the people,” the Minister said. She appreciated the role of health workers, police, and local bodies in handling the pandemic. The Minister, however, warned that the virus was not something that ends abruptly with a vaccine. She said disease resistance could only be acquired slowly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vaccine-will-be-given-as-per-availability-minister/article33591609.ece

17 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||711 health workers vaccinated in Ernakulam||On the day the COVID-19 vaccination drive was rolled out, 711 health workers were inoculated in Ernakulam on Saturday. Senior cardiothoracic surgeon Jose Chacko Periappuram was the first to receive the Covishield vaccine at the Ernakulam General Hospital. Addressing the media after walking out of the vaccination booth, Dr. Periappuram said the jab was merely a prick that was hardly felt and he did not experience any immediate side effects. “When more people get vaccinated, we will be able to resist the spread of the infection better,” he said, adding that there was no need to fear the shot. The staff at the hospital, including superintendent Dr. A. Anitha, a few health officials in the district, and District Medical Officer N.K. Kuttappan received the shot in the morning at the palliative care block of the hospital where the vaccination booth has been set up. Health officials said no adverse effects were reported in the district. In two cases, there had been some mild giddiness that passed quickly, but that was chalked up to the anxiety of receiving the vaccine, health officials said. Most health workers who were on duty on the day returned to work right after receiving the vaccine. Around 1,022 health workers were assigned to the 12 centres to take the shot on Saturday. Some health workers might not have turned up for it, since a few people were not on duty or were out of town, said Dr. M.G. Sivadas, Reproductive and Child Health Officer for the district, who is also the nodal officer for the vaccination and was among the first to receive the dose at the Ernakulam General Hospital. “Besides, since this is a new vacccine, some amount of hesitation is expected. Some people might have chosen to wait for a little longer before getting it,” he added. Technical glitches on the Co-WIN platform, meant that messages did not go out to some recipients on Saturday informing them of the time and place of vaccination. Health workers at some centres contacted recipients directly. It was a nation-wide issue and was fixed post noon, Dr. Sivadas said. Ernakulam had the maximum number centres (12) in the State on Saturday. Additional centres will be begin functioning from Monday onwards, said District Collector S. Suhas, who was at the General Hospital when the vaccination drive kicked off. The vaccination booth at the Urban Primary Health Centre at Kadavanthra is staffed by health workers from Amrita Institute of Medical Science, in an effort to handle staff limitations at the PHC. A total of 225 centres have been inspected and readied so far. Responses were mixed among health workers who received the shot or were waiting to receive it. Rajeev, a guard at the General Hospital, who was to get the shot around noon, was nonchalant about it and said he considered it to be similar to a tetanus shot. Alphonsa, an ASHA worker who received the dose at the Urban Primary Health Centre, Kadavanthra, said she had been nervous initially, but later realised that the jab was no different from any other injection and did not warrant any anxiety.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/711-health-workers-vaccinated-in-ernakulam/article33592115.ece
17 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Omission of key road projects in budget draws flak||The omission of a couple of overdue but futuristic road projects in Friday’s State Budget has invited flak from residents’ associations and people’s representatives. Prominent among them was the access-controlled four-lane stretch proposed between Chakkaraparambu and Seaport-Airport Road by RBDCK in 2013, as an eastward extension of M.G. Road-Thammanam-Pullepady-Chakkaraparambu Road. A year later, the Kerala State Construction Corporation (KSCC) was entrusted with the task of executing the 4-km road project. The much-awaited road corridor would have considerably decongested the city by augmenting east-west connectivity, thus catalysing the eastward growth of the city. Being access-controlled, it could well be a model road in the city, said Rangadasa Prabhu, president of EDRAAC. The road was to have a 30-metre width for 1.5 km from Chakkaraparambu on the Palarivattom-Vyttila NH Bypass up to Vennala-Eroor Road, while the rest of the alignment was to have 45-metre width, since most of the area comprised paddy fields. The corridor which could later be extended up to Infopark, would considerably decongest the busy Vyttila-Thripunithura and Civil Line Road that links the city with Kakkanad. As per 2014 figures, the new road was estimated to cost Rs. 413 crore, including Rs. 270 crore for land acquisition. Funds for the seaport extension of Seaport-Airport Road that runs parallel to the NH Bypass and to clear bottlenecks at Thykoodam on Chilavannoor Bund Road owned by the GCDA, too were prominent omissions in the budget. Development of Bund Road would lessen traffic chaos at Vyttila, he added. ‘To raise in Assembly’ “I will take up in the Legislative Assembly the coming week the omission of Chakkaraparambu-Infopark Road in the budget. This corridor is crucial for Kochiites to get the full benefit of M.G. Road-Thammanam-Chakkaraparambu Road,” said P.T. Thomas, Thrikkakara MLA. “There was no mention of the waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram either. These omissions are conspicuous, since Kochi contributes a bulk of the revenue for the government,” Mr. Thomas said. GCDA Chairman V. Salim said he hoped to overcome land acquisition hurdles at Thykoodam on Chilavannoor Bund Road with the help of the Kochi Corporation. “A handful of land owners are unwilling to surrender their land, although the GCDA offered them alternative land,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/omission-of-key-road-projects-in-budget-draws-flak/article33592097.ece

The lab is expected to promote collaboration among the various departments in niche and cutting-edge areas of study. “We are hoping that the facility will be a major boost to the ongoing efforts to step up research in areas like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning etc.,” said K.N. Madhusoodanan, Vice Chancellor. The Rs. 249-crore plan had found mention in the budget speech by Finance Minister Dr. T.M. Thomas Isaac on Friday. Tender proceedings for the purchase of high-end equipment for the lab have started, and the authorities plan to complete the formalities as per the schedule. “The multi-storey academic complex on the Marine Science campus of the university is ready. We plan to inaugurate the new building in two weeks,” said Prof. Madhusoodanan. The detailed project report (DPR) prepared by the university has earmarked Rs. 136.36 crore for setting up a laboratory of international standards, while the money required for improving the infrastructure is Rs. 106.56 crore. It had envisaged Rs. 63.68 crore for setting up infrastructure to enhance teaching and learning processes in the university departments. A project to ensure supply of reliable and sustainable power to support research and development on the campus is expected to cost Rs. 15.12 crore. The DPR said Rs. 27.26 crore had been earmarked for enhancing the quality of campus life. The main campus of the university at Thrikkakara will get a new academic complex as part of the proposed infrastructure development plan. Other plans include a swimming pool, sustainable power generation, improvement of roads, and renovation of the open air auditorium. A campus development plan will be implemented as part of the first phase of funding under KIIFB. The focus will be on avoiding overlapping of academic and residential areas. Pedestrian paths and cycle tracks will come up on the main campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kiifb-aided-projects-get-under-way-at-cusat/article33592103.ece
17 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Plea to PM to allow deep-sea fishing||The All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators’ Association has asked the Union government to enable Indian fishers to venture into deep sea so as to make the most of Indian fisheries resources and counter attempts by Chinese fishing boats to exploit resources in Indian waters. In an appeal to the Prime Minister, the boat operators said Indian fishers are capable of going out into the deep waters where Chinese boats, numbering around 800, are engaged in exploiting maritime resources. The boat operators said that around three lakh people depended on fishing for a living in Kerala. A lot of people who had returned from abroad were turning to fishing as a means of livelihood. ‘All through the year’ Under these circumstances, the operators demanded that the Centre direct the State government to allow fishers to engage in deep-sea fishing as well as to make it a round-the-year activity. The appeal said that in 2020, the sector suffered a major setback because of the COVID-19-induced lockdown and the restrictions placed on fishing on the basis of inclement weather reports. However, foreign vessels were exploiting Indian resources during these times, the boat operators said. The government should consider providing subsidised diesel to the fishing industry, they said.

The growth story of the institution has been led by Debashis Chatterjee, Director of IIM-K. He has been credited with admitting more than 50% women in its flagship postgraduate programme. “From less than 10%, the institute touched a high of 54% women in the postgraduate programme (PGP) batch. It repeated the feat in the current academic year (2020-2022) for PGP 24 batch, which has again close to 54% women,” according to an official release. Seamless shift to online IIM-K is the first institution to conceive and create a technology-enabled and interactive online executive education programme, which is running continuously since 2001. It was one of the first movers to completely switch to a virtual set-up after the pandemic outbreak and was able to complete the onboarding of students of current academic year seamlessly, it said. Taking a cue from the emphasis on multi-disciplinary approach of the National Education Policy 2020, IIM-K launched full-time PG programmes in Finance and Liberal Studies and Management last year. The release said the institute was among the top five IIMs in the country as per NIRF India Rankings 2020. IIM-K recently contributed close to Rs. 1 crore towards COVID-19 relief activities, especially catering to the needs of the local community. The institute’s start-up incubator LIVE has contributed to the fight by developing a CovidFYI App, Covid19 swab collection robot and a wearable Veli band to ensure social distancing norms, according to the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/innovation-in-academics-for-25-years/article33591717.ece

17 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Corpn. yet to get a full-time secretary||Since August last year, the Kochi Corporation has not had a full-time secretary appointed exclusively for the post. When an official who held the post for a few months till August, went into quarantine and was not posted back, other officials at the corporation or from the Local Self Government Department had been appointed to the post. Briefly, it was held by the Regional Joint Director, Urban Affairs. Now, the Deputy Secretary has been given additional charge of the post of secretary. “The secretary at the corporation is supposed to be an IAS officer. But temporary postings are made for the position instead of appointing an official of that rank,” said Antony Kureethara, Opposition Leader in the corporation council. But both the ruling and Opposition fronts are confident that a new secretary is likely to be appointed soon by the State government. Mayor M. Anilkumar said an appointment was likely to made soon. M.G. Aristottil, UDF councillor, said, “A posting is likely to be made soon, since there has been a change of guard at the corporation. Refusal to post a properly qualified official in that position had been a political move,” he alleged. For a civic body that receives large funds for projects like those under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, it was crucial to have an official appointed to the position full-time, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-yet-to-get-a-full-time-secretary/article33592105.ece
17 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fire Dept. modernisation plan gets a shot in the arm||The Fire and Rescue Services Department is elated over the retention of the same budgetary allocation of Rs. 69 crore for its modernisation as in the previous budget. It is being perceived as largesse on the part of the government to be considerate to the needs of the department despite financial constrains in the wake of the pandemic. Department sources said the allocation would go a long way in going ahead with modernisation proposals like replacement of the old fleet of vehicles with technically advanced ones. “We have prioritised our proposals like purchase of turntable ladders for firefighting in high-rises. First response vehicles, the first to rush to the scene in the event of an emergency, and new water tenders and water lorries are also on the priority list,” sources said. The budget, however, made a “confusing” announcement on the formulation of a scheme called ‘Civil Defence’ in 2021-22, though a 6,500-strong Civil Defence Force (CDF) made up of volunteers is already functional. However, a senior official said it was probably meant as a reinforcement of the CDF by enlisting more volunteers and buying new equipment for which Central funding is also available. The Excise Department is also satisfied with the allocation of Rs. 18 crore, including Rs. 7crore for ‘Vimukthi,’ its de-addiction mission. A senior official said the outlay might come in handy for its proposal to set up de-addiction centres in the three zones of Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, and Kozhikode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fire-dept-modernisation-plan-gets-a-shot-in-the-arm/article33592099.ece

17 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Poor budgetary allocation for Beypore port draws criticism||The poor allocation of funds and lack of new development projects for the Beypore port in the latest Kerala Budget have created huge disappointment among various stakeholders who have been campaigning for the growth of the destination for years. While the Azhikkal and Vizhinjam ports got due consideration in the budget, the Beypore port was totally ignored, they claimed. Functionaries of the Beypore Port Sub Committee under the Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the State government did not earmark anything from its own funds to accelerate the development activities at the port. Instead, the plan to use Central aid under the Sagarmala project was declared, which would never be a satisfactory solution, they added. A leader of the sub committee said Beypore would not get anything from the already allocated Rs. 80 crore for ports in Kerala. “The plan to construct a new port in Azhikkal itself is an indication that the government is planning to downplay the development of Beypore,” he said. According to leading exporters and importers who depend on the service of the port, the cold response in the form of poor budgetary allocation came at a time when about five international shipping container lines were eagerly waiting to start services linking Beypore. The disheartening response from the government would naturally dampen the investors’ spirits, they said. A Ports Department official said there were proposals aplenty from people’s representatives and the port authorities to sanction additional funds to complete the pending dredging work in the area. “There were also promises that funds would be allotted in the latest budget for addressing the requirement. However, the latest plan is to make use of the Sagarmala project fund for the work completion,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poor-budgetary-allocation-for-beypore-port-draws-criticism/article33591617.ece

District Medical Officer K.P. Reeta said that nine centres were chosen in the first phase out of the 129 centres identified for vaccination. Apart from the district hospital, which has been the designated COVID-19 hospital in Palakkad, the vaccination was done at District Ayurveda Hospital; Community Health Centre (CHC), Nemmara; CHC, Agali; Primary Health Centre, Kottupadam; CHC, Koppam; CHC, Nanniyode; and CHC, Ambalappara. Healthcare workers were given the vaccine in the initial phase. As many as 25,260 healthcare workers have registered online for vaccination in Palakkad. Half of them will be given the vaccination in the current phase. As many as 857 of them were vaccinated on the inaugural day. Dr. Reetha said Palakkad could achieve the highest number of vaccination in the State because it had short-listed those who were almost sure to take the vaccine on the first day. According to Dr. Reetha, the district has got 30,870 vaccine doses. Each person will have to be given two doses at an interval of 28 days. “As the same vaccine should be administered in the second dose, we will not be able to vaccinate all the healthcare workers who have registered. Half of them will have to wait,” said Dr. Reetha. Time and place of vaccination were informed through mobile phones. Those given the vaccine were made to wait for 30 minutes in an observation room. About 100 healthcare workers received the vaccine in each centre. The vaccine administration will continue from Monday. She said the use of masks, sanitiser, and handwash was needed even after taking the vaccine. Thrissur Vaccination drive started in Thrissur, where the first COVID-19 case was reported in the country, on Saturday. The first dose was administered to Thrissur District Medical Officer K.J. Reena. Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar inaugurated the vaccination drive at Thrissur General Hospital. Government Chief Whip K. Rajan, T.N. Prathapan, MP, Mayor M.K. Varghese, district panchayat president P.K. Davis, and District Collector S. Shanavas were present. “Though I was confident about taking the vaccination, my family members were a bit worried,” said Dr. Reena, who is a microbiologist. “Receiving the first dose of vaccine was a message to the public and part of my duty,” she said. There was not much pain and absolutely no health issues after it, said Akshaya Anand, Junior Public Health Nurse of the Public Health Centre, Kaipamangalam, who received the first dose of vaccine at the Community Health Centre, Perinjanam. Anu Baby, Medical Officer of the same PHC, also shared the same experience. Though there are around 35,000 health workers in the government and private sectors in the district, 16,938 workers, who are more in contact with the public, will be given vaccination in the first phase. Vaccination is being given in nine centres such as Medical College Hospital; General Hospital, Thrissur; General Hospital, Irinjalakuda; Amala Medical College; Vaidyaratnam Ayurveda College, Ollur; Primary Health Centre, Velur; Community Health Centre, Perinjanam; Taluk Hospital, Kodungallur, and Taluk Hospital, Chalakudy in the district.

17 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||No need for app to buy liquor||The Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco), the State-owned liquor retail monopoly, has allowed customers to purchase liquor without booking their slots in advance via the dedicated mobile phone application (BevQ). On March 25, the Kerala government had enforced total prohibition as part of the Centrally mandated COVID-19 lockdown regulation. A few weeks later, the State government reviewed the situation. It found an upsurge in the sale of bootleg liquor and home-made brews. Moreover, at least two persons had committed suicide and several diagnosed with physical and mental illness due to alcohol deprivation. The government soon allowed the limited sale of liquor to persons who produced a medical testimonial that they could not do without their daily alcohol fix. In May, the Centre relaxed the total ban on the sale of liquor. The Kerala government resumed the legal sale of alcohol. However, it insisted that liquor outlets serve only customers who have booked their slots in advance via the BevQ app. The mobile phone application assigned individual buyers a specific time to collect the liquor as takeaways from the nearest liquor store, bar, or beer and wine parlour. The obligatory condition helped the government prevent long lines and the usual hustle and bustle in front of liquor stores during the contagion’s early days. However, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) said the government had selected an inexperienced startup to develop and profit from the BevQ application. It demanded a Vigilance inquiry into the “opaque” tendering and selection process. The company stood to gain less than 50 paise for every liquor purchase executed via the application. Without app too As the “unlock” process began, Bevco outlets and bars focussed on increasing sale. Soon, customers could purchase liquor from several outlets even without a BevQ slot. The government realised that the application had served its purpose and became redundant. Moreover, the electronic hurdle had impacted liquor sale. Kerala has, arguably, the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of legal liquor is a significant source of State revenue. In the pre-pandemic fiscal, Bevco raked in Rs. 14,504.67 crore from the sale of branded liquor, beer and wine, a raise of Rs. 1,567.8 crore from the previous financial year.  From ban to BevQ State enforced prohibition as part of the COVID-19 lockdown on March 25 Later limited sale was allowed to persons with a medical testimonial In May, the Centre relaxed the total ban on the sale of liquor  State resumes legal sale of alcohol, but only to those who have booked their slots via BevQ app||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-need-for-app-to-buy-liquor/article33591706.ece
17 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Bottled water plant operational||After almost two years of delays, the bottled water plant at Aruvikkara became operational on Saturday. Run by the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation (KIIDC), the Rs. 16-crore facility has launched 20-litre jars that cost Rs. 60 under the familiar ‘Hilly Aqua’ brand of KIIDC. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the plant via videoconference. K. Sabarinadhan, MLA, made the first sale. Of the three production lines, only the 20-litre one is operational at present. This production line can churn out 2,720 twenty-litre jars. The other two production lines — for one and two litres, 750 ml, and 500 ml bottles with a capacity of 3,600 litres per hour each — are expected to be operational soon, KIIDC officials said.  Kudumbashree team The marketing and distribution of the ‘Hilly Aqua’ bottled water produced at the Aruvikkara unit has been entrusted with Kudumbashree Mission. The mission has formed a six-member team, christened ‘Santhwanam,’ under its Thiruvananthapuram unit for the purpose, KIIDC officials said. The plant was originally established by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) on its land near the Aruvikkara reservoir as part of its diversification programmes. The KWA had also decided on ‘Thelineer’ as the brand name. Construction was completed by February 2019, but the project languished with the KWA failing to obtain the required clearances from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). With delays plaguing the project, the Water Resources Department decided to transfer the plant to KIIDC, the Irrigation Department agency that markets the ‘Hilly Aqua’ bottled water brand. The decision triggered stiff opposition from KWA unions. Nevertheless, the government went ahead and issued orders in February, 2020, formalising the transfer. The rationale was that it would be imprudent to divert KWA personnel and resources to a “niche market like bottled water” when KWA is responsible for implementing water supply projects worth Rs. 9,000-crore under Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Jal Jeevan Mission, and the State Plan. On May 5, 2020, KIIDC and KWA inked an MoU. Subsequently, the government had sanctioned an additional Rs. 2 crore for rectifying technical glitches at the plant. The water supplied by the KWA to the plant undergoes multiple filtration processes and ozonisation before being bottled for the market, KIIDC said. Nedumangad block panchayat president V. Ambili, Aruvikkara panchayat president Kalathara Madhu, Kudumbashree district mission coordinator Shyju, KIIDC managing director N. Prasanth, and chief engineer Terrence Antony were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bottled-water-plant-operational/article33592213.ece

The hospital was among the 11 centres in the district where the vaccination drive was carried out. The first vaccine was administered at the hospital after the Prime Minister flagged off the nationwide vaccination drive at 10.30 a.m. A hundred people are to be administered the vaccine at each centre in the district from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. At the Thycaud hospital, which has 450-odd staff, 97 health workers, including doctors and nurses, were registered to receive the vaccine on the first day, with Dr. Sarita, Kerala Government Nurses Association State secretary Nisha Hameed, and Indian Medical Association State unit secretary P. Gopikumar bringing the number to 100. Stepping out after completing the half-an-hour observation period without any adverse events, Dr. Sarita said she was happy and relieved to be vaccinated. A vaccine was an effective weapon against any communicable disease, she said, urging everyone to take it. Detailed and precise Arrangements made by the government for the vaccination were detailed and precise, right from the awareness session at the outset to the administration of the jab and the observation period, she said. Vaccinations would resume on Monday, and the number of days it would be administered in a week would be decided by the district task force. Vaccination for health workers would continue till all those who had registered got the shots, she said. Preethi James, hospital superintendent, said they had allotted time slots for receiving the vaccine on Day One as the software for informing applicants of the vaccination centre and timings through SMS would go live only during the day. After identity checks, those receiving the vaccine would be herded into a waiting room, and they enter the vaccination room one at a time. Then, the software would be updated, and the beneficiaries kept under observation are allowed to return. Ms. Hameed who was among the first to receive the jab said the vaccine would help the nurses on the frontline of the fight against the pandemic to do their job with confidence. She said she had been able to remove the apprehensions of her friends who are not in the medical profession about the vaccine, though those prone to allergic reactions were a bit concerned about it. Dr. Gopikumar said as a health worker, he had taken the vaccine in a bid to inspire others to do the same. It was important to receive the vaccination as developing immunity to COVID-19 alone could bring down the infection rate and the severity of the symptoms. The health network of the State was equipped to deal with the remote possibility of someone developing any adverse reaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-19-vaccination-drive-begins-on-an-optimistic-note/article33592217.ece
17 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Praise for higher education plans in Budget||While praising the State Budget for providing an impetus to the higher education sector, academics wonder if the allocations are adequate. Many have also called for efforts to ensure that the projects are not entangled in bureaucratic hurdles. P.M. Rajan Gurukkal, Vice Chairman, Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC), applauded the Budget, terming it one that invested in knowledge and human capital for growth in the long run. He said it could be the first time in the country that a Budget recognised new knowledge and the need to democratise its benefits as the key drivers to productivity, growth and equitable social development. It envisaged various schemes for boosting accumulation of knowledge-based capital by generating non-physical assets like intellectual property, patents, software and expertise in advanced science-tech research.  It also provided for the growth of high-tech industries, innovative start-ups, expansion of the service sector and opening up of avenues of self-employment. ‘Centre can emulate’ “A sustainable response to the fast developing global knowledge economy with potentially greater demand for innovative expertise and rare workspace skill in science-tech hybrid fields, the Budget is a seamless model worth emulating for the Union government,” he said. Amruth G. Kumar, Head of the Department of Education, Central University of Kerala, praised the proposal to establish inter-university centres, a first-of-its-kind move in the State. But, he wondered whether the allocations were sufficient to realise the ambitious project, since they would require several high-end research facilities. While the Budget lays stress on creating a knowledge economy by ensuring availability of digital tools among all sections, the academic called for steps to propagate digital literacy particularly among the backward communities. ‘Ignoring humanities’ He also questioned the propriety behind pinpointing areas of research under the Nava Kerala post-doctoral fellowship scheme in the Budget. “The KSHEC or any other panel of academic experts must ideally be entrusted with the task. Moreover, there is an overt slant towards scientific disciplines, ignoring social science and humanities,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/praise-for-higher-education-plans-in-budget/article33591708.ece

17 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Prem Nazir is unstoppable in these digital times too||A short documentary on Malayalam cinema’s evergreen star Prem Nazir, which surfaced online a couple of days ago, has garnered thousands of views, in testimony to the actor’s enduring popularity, thirty-two years after his passing away. On his death anniversary on Saturday, the video, which was made for Doordarshan back then, was shared across social media platforms, providing a glimpse of the actor to many from the younger generation too. The documentary titled Nithyavasantham Nithyavismayam , converted from an old VHS tape, was uploaded on Facebook by Orbit Videovision. It was directed by Baiju Chandran, presently head of programmes, Doordarshan, Thiruvananthapuram. The film has interviews with actors, filmmakers, and producers who have worked with him, recollecting their memories. Actor Mammootty speaks of how he, as a youngster unaware of the technicalities of filmmaking, assumed that Nazir was the same larger-than-life persona in real life as he was shown on screen. Poignant memories One of the poignant recollections is made by veteran script-writer Sarangapani about the special relationship the actor shared with Udaya studio, having starred in many a film produced under the banner. “He was not just a cinematic hero for the employees here. He used to enquire after each of the employees here, including the sweepers and the light boys and financially helped them out during difficulties,” he says. Actor Jose Prakash echoes these sentiments and says that Nazir was particular that whatever he is doing to help others should not be known to anyone else. The documentary looks at how he became the romantic hero of the masses, how he was sometimes limited in his experimentation owing to that image, and of the instances when he successfully broke out of that mould and stunned everyone.  Rare camaradarie His camaradarie with actor Sathyan, with whom he acted in several films, also becomes a point of discussion. Actors Saradha and Kaviyoor Ponnamma speak of how he was gracious enough to make everyone around comfortable, and treated everyone equally. There are rare interviews with his family members too. The documentary ends with some rare visuals of his last journey, and of the multitudes waiting on both sides of the road, to catch a last glimpse of the star.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/evergreen-hero-prem-nazir-is-unstoppable-in-digital-age-too/article33591693.ece

It called it a progressive and inclusive Budget touching the entire strata of society. “The Budget has given priority to revive the economy in the post-pandemic world focussing on new avenues to generate non-tax revenue,” says Thomas John Muthoot, Chairman, CII Kerala. The ‘Skill mission’ under the K-DISC as part of which 50 lakh educated youth will be imparted training on a war footing will help MSMEs. The CII feels that rubber procurement price increase is a good move. However, the government should also consider intercropping of rubber plantation for vegetables, coffee, which will be beneficial for farmers. Real estate sector The CII has said the allocation of Rs. 75 crore for coconut farming is not adequate, value addition in coconut products should be considered. The lowering of stamp duty and registration charges will give a boost to the real estate sector. Making KIIFB responsible for rooting infrastructure development is a good decision. The reduction in tax on CNG and LPG from 14.5% to 5% will help in bringing down the cost of essential items, the CII said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cii-terms-state-budget-progressive-inclusive/article33591712.ece

He was speaking after dedicating the Rs. 20-crore first phase of Kerala Arts and Crafts Village (KACV) at Vellar near Kovalam here. “By lending a unique appeal to arts and crafts, we have to raise them to global standards. It is also important to explore the opportunity of online marketing of our handicraft products,” said Mr. Vijayan, while inaugurating the facility through videoconference. Noting that it was a proud moment for tourism sector, the Chief Minister said the KACV would be firmly marked on the global tourism map.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, who presided over the function, said the government’s approach was to promote tourism as an activity for the economic benefit of common people. “In that sense, KACV will definitely elevate the position of Kerala, especially Kovalam and the capital city, on the global tourism map to the golden status.” Book on Kalari academy He launched the KACV Kalari Academy Concept book by handing it over to Kalarippayattu practitioner Padma Shri Meenakshi Amma.

17 January 2021||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||Don’t neglect wearing masks, say experts||The steep decline in COVID-19 cases seems to have developed a sense of complacency among people. One can find people moving in public places without masks, without any care for their own safety as also that of others. They seem to be under the impression that the pandemic threat has gone. Medical experts, however, warn that the threat is far from over and advise wearing masks, observing social distance and other COVID-19 protocols for at least three more months. “I have seen about 75% of visitors on Beach Road are not wearing masks, while 15% are wearing it improperly on their necks and only 10% are wearing them correctly,” says P.V. Sudhakar, Principal, Andhra Medical College. The drop in the sales of masks and personal protective equipment is also an indication of the discontinuation of the usage of masks. Cloth masks used to be sold at most street corners and beside the National Highway in the city but they seem to be hardly any such street vendors now. “The sale of masks, sanitisers and hand gloves has dropped drastically during the last two months. We used to sell over 1,000 surgical masks and over 200 N 95 masks, a month till November, but the sale dropped drastically,” says Yuvraj of Think Safe, a personal protective equipment dealer, at Sheelanagar. “Those going to the airport to travel abroad make it a point to buy masks as they will be denied entry without masks. Only a few local students and residents of Sheelanagar continue to come to us to buy masks,” he says. “There are hardly any sales of masks during the past few months. We depend only on orders from hospitals,” says K. Subba Rao, proprietor of Kiran Surgicals, located at Collectorate junction. “The wearing of masks should be continued for at least three to four months. This is because even after administration of vaccine, one should be careful for 42 days and even after that a booster dose may be required. It is therefore inevitable to wear masks even after taking the vaccine, for some more time,” says K. Rambabu, State COVID-19 coordinator.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dont-neglect-wearing-masks-say-experts/article33592253.ece

17 January 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP speaking in two voices on Divi’s: CPI||Communist Part of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) State secretary P. Madhu on Saturday stated that the government’s denial of bail to 36 persons arrested for protesting the establishment of a unit of Divi’s Laboratories on the Kakinada coast would lead to an escalation in tension in the area. Thirty-six people were arrested last month in connection with the December 18 protest at the proposed pharma unit site, and they are yet to get bail till date despite the claims made by the State government that all of them had been granted bail, Mr. Madhu alleged. Speaking to The Hindu on Saturday, Mr. Madhu said: “The 36 protesters did not get bail for over 25 days. Our party is preparing for ‘Tuni Muttadi’ on January 21, condemning the denial of bail to the protesters.” ‘Dual stand’ “The BJP is taking a dual stand on the proposed pharma unit in Thondangi mandal of East Godavari district. At the Centre, the BJP is putting pressure on Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to allow the project to move forward, while on the other hand, it is opposing the project at the State level,” Mr. Madhu alleged. “The Jana Sena Party did not take part in the protests against the pharma project during TDP rule. Even Mr. Jagan who vehemently opposed the project in the run-up to the 2019 elections now seems to be heeding directions from the BJP at the Centre,” Mr. Madhu said. “The BJP-JSP’s idea is to mislead people including those who are going to be affected by the project. We will intensify the protests until the project is dropped,” Mr. Madhu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-calls-for-tuni-muttadi-on-jan-21/article33592165.ece

17 January 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rationalists bat for ‘Nehruvian secularism’||The A.P. Rationalists’ Association State conference began here on Saturday with the secularists calling for following the ‘Nehruvian secularism’ for the multi-religious, multi-ethnic nation to flourish. Former Assembly Deputy Speaker Mandali Buddha Prasad set the ball rolling by exhorting the Union and State governments to uphold the secular Constitution and develop scientific temper. Chairing the conference, APRA State president N. Venkata Subbaiah recalled that the country’s first Prime Minister did not perform any puja when dedicating the Nagarjunasagar project to the nation. “It is unfortunate that the present set of rulers have been in the forefront in taking part in religious events, which they should keep away from as heads of governments,” he said. “Secularism is followed more in breach than in observance by those who took oath to uphold the Constitution,” he opined while objecting to payment of salaries to priests from the State exchequer. Conference reception committee honorary president N. Venkateswarlu, popularly known as ‘Andhra’s E.V.R. Periyar’ in the rationalists’ circle, decried the performance of ‘Gopuja’ by those in power and projecting everything associated with the cow as sacred. ‘Promote spirit of enquiry’ Those occupying constitutional posts had a responsibility to promote the much-needed spirit of enquiry among the youth to forge ahead in every walk of life, said noted rationalist from Vijayawada P.

17 January 2021||SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Young carpet maker revamps sector with unique sales idea||A young carpet maker from Varanasi, Mohammed Nasim, has ensured a new lease of life for his struggling fellow artisans by revamping their traditional sales model. Mr. Nasim (29), whose family owns a carpet factory in Varanasi, travels regularly to north-coastal Andhra Pradesh with his family members to ply their wares. However, ensuring decent sales was an uphill task despite their products being of superior quality, he said. A few years ago, Mr. Nasim said he observed that shops and establishments which were procuring carpets from him at throwaway prices were selling the same products to customers at an exorbitant mark-up. This prompted him to consider taking the direct route by selling directly to customers instead of selling to retail outlets. Thus began a series of handicraft expos at popular tourist spots across north-coastal A.P., where other carpet artisans like him also converged to sell their wares directly to customers. Mr. Nasim said he has organised nearly 170 exhibitions in the last five years. He takes the necessary permissions from municipal authorities and property owners to organise the exhibitions, in which stalls are given to artisans at a nominal charge which is used for maintenance, electricity charges and rent. The artisans need not pay any deposit amount to set up their stall but need to pay around Rs. 100 to Rs. 150 per day, which is low compared to the Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,000 charged by business houses. “Due to the impact of the lockdown, customers are keen on getting a good deal. That is why they are now going to exhibitions instead of big showrooms where prices are steep as the latter have to also cover their overhead costs,” Mr. Nasim told The Hindu at the Craft Bazaar established near the Forest Office of Srikakulam. Mr. Nasim, who is also the founder president of Visakha Artisans Development Society, is able to ensure a livelihood for artisans of Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and several other States. The artisans are selling Bengal Cotton saris, Kalankari dress material, Rajasthani bedsheets, Warangal towels, Etikoppaka toys and Hyderabadi pearls among others. Local women put up food and pickle stalls at the exhibition which will continue up to January 26. Mohammed Saleem, who also oversees the maintenance of Indian Craft Bazar in Srikakulam, expressed happiness at the good response to the exhibition. K.A. Bala, a Kashmiri artisan who sells saris, says that the exhibition has helped him get back on his feet. “Due to COVID-19, there were no sales between March and August in 2020. But we managed to recoup all losses and earn decent profits thanks to the brisk business in the last two months,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/young-carpet-maker-revamps-sector-with-unique-sales-idea/article33592197.ece

The cow festival was an opportunity for us to decorate and worship them,” said H. Asha of Nagaram. She had come with her family and friends to her native place of Nagarampalli village in Vajrapukotturu mandal, where she told The Hindu that the cow festival helped her friends learn the important role played by cows in villages. “Even during the period of Rigveda, the importance of cows was explained very well. The continuation of the festival even in the current times is a good sign for future generations,” said G.V. Swami Naidu, founder of Gurajada Educational Society. “We constructed a Goshala (cow shelter) on our college premises to make children know the importance of cows in society,” he said. Mangalampalem village of Kothavalasa mandal in Vizianagaram district also wore a festive look. Villagers involved local college students in the cow festival. “Such festivals help make children know the importance of respecting animals,” said Raparthi Jagadish Babu, founder of Sri Gurudeva Charitable Trust.

17 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||APSRTC hopeful of operating more buses to Telangana post-March||Faced with mounting revenue losses, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation was forced to give in to the demands of its Telangana State counterparts while signing an agreement on inter-State bus operations during the post-lockdown period. However, Corporation officials are now hopeful that the situation will improve post-March when they intend to review the agreement. “We have already written to them and hope to improve our financial position once we overcome the COVID-19 pandemic situation,” said K. Brahmananda Reddy, Executive Director (Operations), APSRTC. Besides a huge revenue loss suffered by the public sector transport giant on account of the lockdown, the terms and conditions put forth by the TSRTC in the new agreement on the parity issue shrunk the APSRTC’s operational area in Telangana state by 1.1 lakh km and added 10,000 km for Telangana buses in Andhra Pradesh. In a major climbdown, Andhra Pradesh has agreed to scale down operation of its buses in Telangana from 2.25 lakh km to 1.6 lakh km by running fewer buses (from 1,009 in the past to 638 now). APSRTC officials, who maintain that the purpose of the State Road Transport Corporations should be to cater to the transport needs of the common man, are upset about the ‘adamant’ approach of their Telangana counterparts but are confident that they would soon be able to enhance their operations by reviewing the agreement. ‘Paying back in the same coin’ A few days ago, citing a ‘permit’ issue, the Tamil Nadu State Transport officials seized five buses belonging to the APSRTC (three from Tirupati depot and two from Chittoor depot). Since it was a long weekend and any friction, if escalated, could lead to travel problems for people, Transport Minister Perni Venkataramaiah and Principal Secretary, Transport Department, M.T. Krishna Babu, asked officials to talk to their Tamil Nadu counterparts and resolve the issue. Though there is an agreement between the two States, the incident occurred due to a minor issue. Meanwhile, sensing that the private travel operators of Tamil Nadu were behind the move, AP Transport officials conducted inspections and seized 24 private travel buses of Tamil Nadu here, citing the same permit issue. “There is an increasing patronage for APSRTC buses operating on routes like Vellore to Chittoor. Private bus operators of Tamil Nadu influenced their local Motor Vehicle Inspectors to seize our buses operating on these routes. But the issue has been resolved,” said Mr. Brahmananda Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apsrtc-hopeful-of-operating-more-buses-to-telangana/article33591562.ece

17 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Amaravati JAC plans yagam from tomorrow||After a series of protests for more than a year to persuade the YSRCP government in the State to drop its plan to shift the capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam, the farmers in the Amaravati region are now seeking divine intervention. As part of the Amaravati movement, the JAC leaders, in collaboration with the Shaiva Kshetra temple authorities at Tallayapalem of Guntur district, are gearing up to perform ‘Srividya Maha Yagam’ from January 18 to 26 at the place where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new capital at Uddandarayunipalem village. “The unrest among the farmers is growing. They gave away their valuable lands to become partners in the capital development activity, but have been left in the lurch by the YSRCP government,” said Puvvada Sudhakar, JAC convener. The G.O. calling for merger of villages such as Penumaka, Vaddeswaram, Ippatam, Undavalli, Gundmeda, Chirravuru and Mallempudi with the Tadepalli Municipality and a few others with the Mangalagiri Municipality was causing concern among the farmers, Mr. Sudhakar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/amaravati-jac-plans-yagam-from-tomorrow/article33591378.ece
17 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu making unnecessary noise: Anil Kumar||Water Resources Minister P. Anil Kumar questioned whether the TDP and BJP could openly declare that some of those involved in the attacks on nine temples and named by the police during their investigation, were not their activists. He alleged that the TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu’s agenda was to preach communal amity for the sake of public consumption and hatch conspiracies behind the curtains. Addressing media persons at the YSR Congress Party central office here on Saturday, Mr. Anil Kumar said the Director General of Police did not entirely hold the TDP responsible for the attacks but Mr. Naidu and his son Lokesh were unnecessarily making a lot of noise. In fact, their intention appeared to be to somehow prevent the sordid details from coming out lest their party should suffer politically. Mr. Anil Kumar said it was common knowledge that the TDP would benefit from communal disturbances. It was in a desperate situation to try all tricks up its sleeve to destabilise the government. He said that the police statement that TDP and BJP workers were suspected to be involved in the temples was based on investigation done by them so far. Before more details emerged, the opposition parties began attacking the government in their bid to draw political mileage. People would, however, not forget the demolition of several temples in Vijayawada and many other acts of desecration that took place during the TDP term, he added. Ambati flays Naidu Staff Reporter in Guntur adds: Speaking at a press conference, MLA Ambati Rambabu said that the YSRCP had no religion and caste and didn’t have the need to incite communal disputes across the State. He alleged that TDP and BJP leaders were trying to create religious rift in society for the sake of political gains. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s rule is beyond caste and religious politics, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-making-unnecessary-noise-anil-kumar/article33592174.ece
17 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. constitutes Architectural Board||The government issued G.O. Ms No. 2 on Saturday for the constitution of ‘Andhra Pradesh State Architectural Board’ for standardisation of architectural designs, plans, elevation, cost estimates etc. It was stated in the G.O. that the government was making substantial investments on improving civic infrastructure by creating new assets, while revamping / retrofitting existing assets such as schools, hospitals and government office buildings, sports complexes, cultural centres, public utility buildings etc. for better service delivery and providing convenience to the public. The investments were being made through schemes funded by the Central and the State governments for both greenfield and brownfield assets, the G.O. said. The works relating to public buildings were being executed by multiple government departments through their engineering wings, and it was observed that there was lack of standardisation across departments in terms of architectural designs, plans, elevations, estimation of costs etc. due to disparities in availability of architectural expertise, sanctioned budget, execution timelines and other factors. This was leading to sub-optimal outcomes in terms of utility of space and resources. “The need for a mechanism for standardisation of designs has therefore been felt,” the G.O. said. The Finance Minister will be its Chairman and Secretary - Finance (in-charge of Works Department) the member-convener.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-constitutes-architectural-board/article33592249.ece

Gautam Sawang, has said that his party will be forced to take “appropriate action” for his prosecution under criminal law and file a defamation suit against him if he does not give a clarification on his statement that BJP activists are involved in the attacks on a few temples. Mr. Veerraju said the DGP’s statement gave a wrong impression that the BJP workers were among those who desecrated the Hindu temples. “Being a constitutional functionary, the DGP is not supposed to issue confusing statements and create false impression in the minds of the people,” Mr. Veerraju said, and alleged that under Mr. Sawang’s leadership the police had failed in protecting the temples and idols. “The DGP’s statement is defamatory,” Mr. Veerraju said, while maintaining that posts in the social media were different from desecration of idols. “The DGP cannot support any political party, or speak against a particular party,” Mr. Veerraju observed, and denied the involvement of the BJP workers in the recent attacks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/attack-on-temples-somu-seeks-dgps-clarification/article33592176.ece

17 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police step up vigil on ghat road in G.K Veedhi mandal||The district police are on alert after a series of robberies were reported on the ghat road in G.K Veedhi mandal. Teams were formed by the police to nab the culprits, apart from strengthening vigil at a few vulnerable stretches. It may be noted that on January 13 late in the night, two robberies had occurred on ghat road near Daralamma temple region in G.K Veedhi mandal. In one case, robbers allegedly stopped a vehicle by placing huge stones on road and attacked the commuters. In another incident, a few persons were looted about three-and-half-tolas of gold ornaments. In both the cases, the commuters were allegedly threatened with knives and countrymade guns. According to the police, the ghat road runs through dense forest for about 30 km from G.K Veedhi mandal headquarters. The roads connect Visakhapatnam with East Godavari and also Odisha. Vehicle movement in the area after evening is also said to be very minimal, being a Maoist-affected region. The area is also not connected to any form of telephonic connections. All these have allegedly helped unidentified miscreants to commit the offences. “We have formed special teams and strengthened the vigil. The police teams are working hard to nab the culprits at the earliest,” said Sileru Sub Inspector Ranjith, who along with his team inspected the spot recently. Meanwhile after coming to know about the series of robberies in the region, locals of Darakonda, Dharalagundi and a few others have mobilised volunteers to patrol the area. Locals themselves have formed teams and are patrolling the region during the nights to keep a watch on such incidents, said the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-step-up-vigil-on-ghat-road-in-gk-veedhi-mandal/article33592257.ece
17 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Direct civic bodies to carry out water sample analysis, CM urged||Forum for Better Visakha (FBV) convener and former IAS officer E.A.S. Sarma has appealed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to direct all municipalities to carry out water sample analysis at the consumer-end on a periodical basis and subject the process of analysis by an independent expert evaluation. Quoting the analysis carried out by the Quality Council of India (QCI), he noted that 33% of the water samples taken in 26 cities in India have indicated high levels of lead. Lead-coated PVC pipes used extensively in urban drinking water systems seem to be the major contributor to lead poisoning of water. The water samples thus analysed indicated lead levels to be in excess of the Indian norm of 50 parts per billion, which is in itself a questionable one compared to the WHO norm of 10 parts per billion. Excess lead in the human body can cause neurological problems of the kind observed in Eluru. The impact of lead poisoning of water is far more deleterious on children. Lead in excess of 10 micrograms per decilitre causes serious learning problems in children. More than 70 different body ailments are attributable to excess lead present in the human body. While appreciating the Chief Minister for visiting Eluru following the water poisoning, which had triggered a detailed investigation into the issue. He also sought that the Municipal Administration and Urban Development and the Panchayat Raj and Rural departments should be directed to constitute independent bodies of experts to inspect the catchment areas of all water reservoirs in the State that provide drinking water to the people and take such urgent measures that will minimise pollution. The other suggestions by Mr. Sarma include examining the extent to which PVC pipes could be replaced by a more benign water conveyance piping system to minimise the likelihood of lead contamination of water, direct the departments concerned also to investigate how vehicle batteries containing lead were being disposed off and empowerment of the AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB) to rein in unsafe and polluting industries, which are flourishing in the State.  The Municipal Administration and Urban Development and the Panchayat Raj and Rural departments should be directed to constitute independent bodies of experts to inspect the catchment areas of all water reservoirs in the State||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/direct-civic-bodies-to-carry-out-water-sample-analysis-cm-urged/article33592255.ece

17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No MMTS phase II sans State govt.’s share: Kishan to KCR||Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy has written a letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao ruling out movement of local trains under Phase II multi-modal transport system (MMTS) for Hyderabad if the State government failed to release its share of cost for the project. Mr. Reddy reminded Mr. Rao that the works under Phase II had stopped as the State government had not released its balance share of Rs. 414.14 crore so far. It had paid only Rs. 129 crore of its total estimated share of Rs. 544.36 crore. In addition, there was a cost escalation for the project as it dragged on over the past six years. The revised cost of the project went up from Rs. 816.55 crore to Rs. 951 crore. At this cost, the State government’s share worked out to Rs. 634 crore while the liability of railways was Rs. 317 crore. However, the railways had so far spent double its share amounting to Rs. 789.28 crore. As a result, there was no way the project could make further headway unless the State government released its balance share. In this background, Mr. Reddy urged the Chief Minister to take the initiative for completion of works by releasing funds. Mr. Reddy also urged Mr. Rao to take the initiative for commencement of MMTS works linking Ghatkesar with Raigir railway station as part of extension of the project up to Laxminarasimha Swamy temple at Yadadri. The railways had approved the proposal in 2016-17 with an estimated budget of Rs. 412 crore as per an agreement with the State government. The railways had asked the government to release an initial amount of Rs. 75 crore but it was not done. Therefore, the work did not commence. The Union Minister dwelt on the significance of MMTS extension project in view of works on temple construction nearing completion. He offered his cooperation for any kind of support from the Centre to overcome all issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-mmts-phase-ii-sans-state-govts-share-kishan-to-kcr/article33592091.ece
17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TSEC notifies GHMC newly-elected members||The Telangana State Election Commission (TSEC) has notified the newly-elected ward members (corporators) to the council of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) by issuing the gazette notification on Saturday. The notification would pave the way for holding the first meeting of the newly-elected members as also the election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor by them. The term of the existing council of GHMC expires on February 10 and the election of new Mayor and Deputy Mayor could be held before that date only by dissolving the existing council. However, holding both the first meeting of the new council of members and the election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor would become mandatory by February 15 as the newly-elected members have been notified on January 16. “Under Section 90(1) of the GHMC Act, the first meeting of the newly-elected members after ordinary elections, including indirect election to offices of Mayor and Deputy Mayor, shall be held within a month of publication of the newly-elected members’ names in the gazette,” a senior official of the TSEC said. Although the TSEC has notified the names of newly-elected members to all the 150 wards of the GHMC, the effective strength is only 149 due to the death of a BJP member elected from Lingojiguda, Akula Ramesh Goud, due to COVID-19 on December 31. Of the 150 wards, TRS has won 56 -- followed by BJP - 48 (effective 47), AIMIM - 44 and Congress-2. Results of the election held on December 1 were declared on December 4 (149 wards) and December 9 (1 ward - Neredmet). Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been demanding the issuance of gazette notification of the newly-elected members immediately after the results were declared. However, notifying the newly-elected members was not take up immediately after the declaration of results citing the provisions of the GHMC Act and Article 243-U(1) of the Constitution. The latter stipulates continuation of the elected body of an urban local body (ULB) for its full term of five years. A letter containing the names of the newly-elected ward members was sent to the TSEC on January 5 by the Election Authority and Commissioner of GHMC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tsec-notifies-ghmc-newly-elected-members/article33592079.ece
17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ministers, elected representatives launch vaccination drive at various places||The vaccination drive against COVID-19 was launched across Telangana on Saturday by administering the first dose to frontline health workers, to start with, marking the beginning of the possible end to the pandemic that has affected every walk of life since its outbreak. Ministers, other elected representatives and officials launched the drive in different parts of the State. In Hyderabad, Minister for Industries, IT and Municipal Administration K.T. Rama Rao said people, particularly those undergoing the inoculation in the first phase, need not have any apprehensions, whatsoever, about the safety and side-effects of the COVID vaccine. All elected representatives were ready to get the vaccine, but following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestion they had stepped back as there was a need to cover the frontline warriors on priority basis. He hoped that the elected representatives would also have their turn soon, Mr. Rama Rao said after inaugurating the vaccination drive at Tilaknagar community health centre. A few health officials, including Director of Government Medical College at Mahabubnagar Putta Srinivas and District Medical and Health Officer of Kamareddy Chandrasekhar were among those who volunteered to get the vaccine in the first phase as a measure to build confidence among the frontline warriors. According to the reports reaching here, 3,962 out of the target 4,296 health workers were inoculated on Saturday and more health workers would be given the first dose of the vaccine on January 18. Speaking at different places, the Ministers appealed to people not to believe in misinformation being spread about the vaccine on social media. They warned against those spreading misinformation of serious action. Along with Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy and Health Minister Eatala Rajender launched the drive in Gandhi Hospital here. Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Errabelli Dayakar Rao inaugurated the drive at MGM Hospital, Warangal. Later, he also launched the drive at Torrur in Mahabubabad district and Palakurthy in Jangaon district. Besides, Ministers Satyavathi Rathod (Mahabubabad), A. Indrakaran Reddy (Nirmal), V. Prashanth Reddy (Nizamabad), G. Jagadish Reddy (Nalgonda), V. Srinivas Goud (Mahabubnagar), Vice-Chairman of State Planning Board B. Vinod Kumar, Government Chief Whip D. Vinay Bhaskar, several other elected representatives and officials launched the drive at different places. Adverse reaction In erstwhile Medak district, the vaccination programme was launched by Zilla Parishad chairperson V. Roja Sharma at Siddipet, Lok Sabha member K. Prabhakar Reddy at Sangareddy and MLA M. Padma Devender Reddy at Medak. R. Sukanya, staff nurse, Urban Primary Health Centre at Indiranagar in Sangareddy district headquarters, was administered the first vaccine in the presence of Collector M. Hanumantha Rao and District Medical and Health Officer Ramoji Rathod. Following high blood pressure and vomiting, she was shifted to government hospital and later discharged after her condition normalised. In Khammam district, the vaccination drive got off to a smooth start at six centres and four centres in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district. Transport Minister P. Ajay Kumar launched the drive at district headquarters hospital in Khammam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ministers-elected-representatives-launch-vaccination-drive-at-various-places/article33592066.ece
17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Minister: State not taking up rabi procurement this time||Agriculture Minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy asked agricultural marketing officials to prepare a plan to regulate the arrivals of rabi produce into market yards, although the State government is not taking up procurement. In a meeting with officials held here on Saturday, he made it clear that there was no possibility of government taking up procurement of the farm produce as part of minimum support price (MSP) operations since the new farm laws have no provision of MSP. Stating that it was the Centre that had to decide on the matter of MSP, he suggested the officials to explain to the farming community about the State government’s inability to take up procurement this season. He, however, stated that the government would regulate the arrivals into market yards to prevent glut, which could lead to artificial slump in the price of commodities, besides creating shortage of storage facilities. He asked the officials to provide opportunity of trading in all the 191 market yards and 72 sub-market yards in State. As per current estimates, paddy is likely to be cultivated in about 50 lakh acres and the production is likely to be about 1.13 crore tonnes. He instructed the agriculture extension officers to ensure 100% crop booking so as to regulate the arrivals into market yards and to help the department issue coupons to farmers to bring their produce to markets in a scheduled manner. Stating that delay in harvest of rabi crop could result in losses due to untimely rains, the Minister told the officials to educate farmers about the necessity to complete harvesting before March-end. Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy, Director of Marketing G. Lakshmi Bai, Director of Horticulture L. Venkatrami Reddy, Managing Director of TS-Markfed V. Bhaskara Chary, all District Agricultural Officers and marketing officers participated in the meet held at Bowenpally market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/minister-state-not-taking-up-rabi-procurement-this-time/article33592087.ece
17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Vaccine joy for some, anticipation for others||When the family of S. Kishtamma found out she would be taking COVID-19 vaccine on day 1 of the immunisation drive on January 16, they raised objection. The 42-year-old has been working as a sanitation worker at Gandhi Hospital, a COVID care centre, but has managed to stay safe so far. However, she came forward to take the vaccine. At a meeting held on Friday, she told the hospital administration that she and her colleagues would take the vaccine on the first day after doctors and nurses get inoculated. However, Ms Kishtamma learnt on Saturday morning that she will be the first vaccine recipient at the hospital. She went ahead and got the first dose. On Saturday, she was the centre of attention at the hospital as mediapersons eargerly waited to speak to her. After about two-and-half-hours of taking the jab, and taking calls from family members and speaking to the media in between, Ms Kishtamma said she did not experience any discomfort post vaccination. Standing around her, her colleagues in the sanitation wing recalled how they spent several weeks at the hospital during the COVID-induced lockdown as their neighbours did not allow them to enter their homes. Working in COVID wards was held against them. Anaesthetist Ch. Nagarjuna was among the 30 healthcare workers at Gandhi Hospital to take the vaccine. The doctor said that he used to attend COVID-19 patients in the ICU. Junior doctor A. Lohith Reddy also took the vaccine. A post graduate student specialising in pediatrics, he continues to attend children under 12 years with COVID-19. He too has managed not to contract COVID-19. However, he is waiting for the day where he can move around without a mask and maintaining other precautions. Mr Lohith said he was eager to take the vaccine since vaccines have been successfully used to control other diseases. Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy and director of Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences Vimala Thomas also got immunised. Dr Ramesh Reddy said he took the vaccine as a measure to build confidence among masses. Apart from the staff, Superintendent of Osmania General Hospital B. Nagender, Government General and Chest Hospital superintendent Mahaboob Khan, nodal officer for COVID-19 at the hospital M. Narender, and heads of other hospitals took the jab. Dr Nagender and Dr Narender both contracted and recovered from COVID-19 a few months ago. The latter said that when he got checked, antibodies levels in him against coronavirus were zero. The COVID nodal officer hoped that the antibodies will develop after the vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/vaccine-joy-for-some-anticipation-for-others/article33592069.ece
17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Conquering fear to beat virus||A phalanx of police officers stands guard at the door of Area Hospital, Nampally, where 30 health workers are scheduled to receive the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. A sub-inspector of police has a list of beneficiaries, and barring doctors of the hospital, staff, and a small number of mediapersons, entry is not permitted to anyone else. The vaccine recipients here are largely ASHA workers and nurses of the hospital. Kaushalya, head nurse at the hospital, was among the first to get the vaccine. Sitting on a bed even as she was being observed under the watchful eye of Superintendent P. Sunitha, post administering the vaccine, she says, “During the pandemic, even when the cases were rising, I was not afraid. After taking the vaccine, I feel safe.” A staff nurse of the same hospital, B. Jyothi, tries to allay fears with regard to safety of the vaccine. “There is no need to be afraid. All of us have taken the vaccine. I have not had any side effects. After taking the vaccine, I feel I can work with more confidence,” she says. Mohammed Jahangir, who is part of the housekeeping staff at the hospital, says his family was supportive about him getting the vaccine. “They were happy about it. I didn’t feel anything before or after taking the vaccine,” he says. Dr Sunitha said there have been no issues related to the Co-WIN app. Similar scenes were witnessed at the District Hospital, King Koti. A group of ASHA workers from the Urban Primary Health Centre in Boggulkunta – Vasantha, G Swathi, Parveen Begum and Masooma Fatima – flashed their thumbs after taking the vaccine. “I was hesitant initially, but there is nothing to worry about,” she says. Parveen Begum asserts the vaccine will enable them to work without any worries of being infected with the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/conquering-fear-to-beat-virus/article33592073.ece
17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Top priority accorded to 28 FOBs||Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration & Urban Development, Arvind Kumar has issued instructions for completion of a total of 28 foot-over-bridges (FOBs) at various locations on top priority. These are part of 36 FOBs which are in various stages of completion under the GHMC’s purview. Of the structures accorded top priority by the Principal Secretary, nine are in Serilingampally, five each in L.B. Nagar and Secunderabad zones, four in Khairatabad, three in Charminar, and two in Kukatpally zone. In Serilingampally, the bridges are planned at ESI Hospital, Botanical Garden, IDBI (Gachibowli), near NIA office (Madhapur), Khajaguda Junction, Telecom Nagar (Gachibowli), Chennai Shopping Mall, Madinaguda, Vijetha Supermarket, Chandanagar, and near Yashoda Pearl Complex, Miyapur. In L.B. Nagar, they are located at Chakripuram crossroads, Nagaram village, Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur, Dilsukhnagar bus stop, Kothapet Fruit Market, and Saroornagar Stadium. In Charminar, the locations are Swapna Theatre, Rajendranagar, Rakshapuram crossroads, and Chandrayangutta. Khairatabad zone will have them at Are Mysamma Temple, Langar Houz, Passport Office, Shaikpet, GVK One mall, Banjara Hills, and Hyderabad Central. In Secunderabad, they are planned at Narayanguda, Neredmet, near old HMDA building, and St. Ann’s School in Tarnaka, and St. Ann’s school, Secunderabad, and in Kukatpally, Balanagar and Shapur Nagar. The FOBs will be close to the Metro Rail stations at more than a couple of locations, which might end up rendering them redundant, as the stations with flight of stairs and escalators towards their two ends double up as FOBs. Besides, officials say that construction of FOBs on the Metro Rail route is proving to be a challenging task, due to issues of ground clearance for vehicles to pass. For example, an FOB is planned near Dilsukhnagar bus terminus, where the Metro station covers the stretch from end to end. “We tried to choose the site which falls mid way between Dilsukhnagar and Chaitanyapuri stations, but the lower height of the Metro Rail track did not permit any structure there. There should be at least 5.5 metres ground clearance allowing passage for heavy vehicles. The point where such height is available is too close to the Dilsukhnagar station,” a GHMC official informed. FOBs near Kothapet fruit market, and Punjagutta too will be close to the Metro Rail stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/priority-accorded-to-28-fobs/article33592092.ece

17 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘COVID is a result of destruction of nature’||The present COVID-19 crisis is a result of indiscriminate destruction of nature which disrupted activity in almost all spheres of life, remarked Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan. Virtually inaugurating the month-long Samrakshana-Kshamata Mahotsav (SAKSHAM 2021) organised by State-level Coordinator for Oil Industry in Telangana, Ms. Soundararajan said indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources and burning of fossil fuels were resulting in high levels of pollution causing global warming. She called for promotion of clean and green energy to protect the plant earth and ensure survival of life on earth. It was time to promote clean, green and renewable energy at all levels to reduce pollution levels in the country, which is the third largest energy consumer in the world. She insisted on India emerging as the global powerhouse of green energy in the days to come. As per Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, the country must become self-reliant in energy sector. The country could not afford to continue to import oil and gas from other countries as they drained out valuable foreign exchange of India. The Governor said policy reforms and initiatives in energy sector of the country effectively addressed its issues like energy access, efficiency, affordability, sustainability and energy security. ‘Indian vaccines safe’ During her visit to Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) to launch the COVID-19 vaccination programme, Ms Soundararajan said vaccines made in India were “very safe” and that there should be not be any hesitation to take them. Dispelling myths about vaccines, she said even if it caused any allergic or minor complications, special arrangements were in place to deal with them. Many countries were looking at India for the supply of its vaccine to protect their people. Soon, India will start supplying COVID-19 vaccine to different countries, said the Governor. She visited the vaccination room at NIMS and observed the shots given to first three frontline warriors. She presented flowers to them and appreciation letters after the vaccination. As first citizen of the State, she said she would take the vaccine along with all citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-is-a-result-of-destruction-of-nature/article33591564.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao in 2017, has turned Telangana to a meat exporting State, Minister for Animal Husbandry Talasani Srinivas Yadav said on Saturday. “Not only is the population of sheep in Telangana, as per Livestock Census, ranked first in the country, but the scheme has also made many people dependent on this caste-based occupation successful businesspersons,” he said. Mr. Srinivas Yadav was in Nalgonda on Saturday to re-launch the distribution of pending sheep units from phase-I. He said that there were 28,335 beneficiaries in the State, who had paid their contribution and were awaiting sheep distribution.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Not quite ‘adhurs’||Despite an unsuccessful formula, some directors tread the same path. Director Santosh Srinivas does exactly that with Alludu Adurs. While in Class IX, Sai Sreenivas (Bellamkonda Sai Sreenivas) falls in love with his classmate Vasundhara (Anu Emmanuel) but she doesn’t reciprocate as she feels, “Love is magic for you but it is tragic for me. I like you but I don’t love you.” Thereafter, he develops an aversion towards women and vows never to fall in love. In some moments we see him stalk Vasundhara’s younger sister Kaumudi (Nabha Natesh). The girl’s father Jaipal Reddy (Prakash Raj) refuses the alliance and tells Sai Sreenivas that the latter is being stalked by death and Gaja (Sonu Sood) is death personified. Why is Gaja, just out of prison, baying for Sai’s blood and why is Sai extending him an olive branch without putting up a fight? The rest of the story also deals with the Jaipal Reddy-Gaja relationship. The writer has weaved multiple sub-plots to fill the 2.5-hour slot. The story appears tailor-made for the front-benchers and one feels a sense of deja vu at the comedy. There is an entire episode on the house being possessed by the ghost of Vasundhara, and it is a blunder to reveal in the beginning that she isn’t dead. While actor Anish Kuruvilla looks comfortable in his role, Hari Teja’s character as a stereotyped maid, lends no value to the script. The music manages to stand out despite the screenplay. Nabha Natesh gets to do an extension of the iSmart Shankar act. Sai Sreenivas shines through an otherwise lacklustre script. Monal Gajjar shines through her much-hyped item song and Sonu Sood steps in the second half and blends into the comic portrayal swiftly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/not-quite-adhurs/article33592075.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Far from an intriguing thriller, lacks consistency||Cinematic stories of lookalikes follow a few tried and tested tropes. Red , starring Ram Pothineni in a dual role and directed by Kishore Tirumala, uses some of these tropes until a point and then the game begins to shift, paving way for an investigative thriller. Red is a remake of the 2019 Tamil film Thadam , which was written by Magizh Tirumeni based on a few true but implausible real-life incidents. We think we know how such stories and characterisations go — one is suave with a respectable work profile while the other is rugged and gambles away. When there’s a crime and both end up as suspects, we think we know who may have done it; but wait, it isn’t that simple.  Thadam was built on an interesting premise and Red adheres to it largely. But it also puts forth a slightly ‘mass’ version of the original, in an effort to pander to the image that Ram has after iSmart Shankar . An item number is thrown in, every emotion is emphasised and everything is over explained. Ram handles the two roles effectively — civil engineer Siddharth and Aditya, who knows a thing or two about con jobs as well as matters of law! But the biggest dampener in both Thadam and Red is the time taken to establish the two characters, their respective romances and thereafter juxtapose the two men in a stiff whodunnit. Sure, the romances show us what sort of men they are — for instance, Aditya draws boundaries of whom and when he will con and that Siddharth lives up to the trust placed in him. But the romances aren’t interesting enough to keep us invested in the proceedings. Both Malvika Sharma and Amritha Aiyer have nothing much to do, and try to make their parts seem convincing enough. The film gathers momentum only at the pre-interval stage when police officers Nagendra Kumar (Sampath Raj) and Yamini (Nivetha Pethuraj) step in. The film’s high point is when Siddharth and Aditya clash in the police station and make it amply evident that there’s a past between them. Moments after this, someone underlines this point about them being at loggerheads owing to a past - as though viewers won’t interpret this much! There are moments of intrigue as every step the cops take to unravel the mystery ends up at a deadend. What happens in the present is interlaced with the past stories of Siddharth and Aditya through a long-drawn childhood flashback involving Sonia Agarwal. This backstory doesn’t evoke empathy to the characters. Mercifully there are no songs when the thriller mode is on. Nivetha makes her presence felt as the female cop who is desperate for answers. Had this character been better fleshed out, we might have been looking at a sharp thinking tough cop trying to cut through the clutter in front of her. Vennela Kishore and Satya appear in supportive parts and evoke a few sporadic laughs.  Red is intriguing in parts; it could have been a better thriller had it been more consistent and, of course, concise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/far-from-an-intriguing-thriller-lacks-consistency/article33592077.ece
17 January 2021||New Delhi,||4,319 health workers vaccinated on Day 1, initial target was 8,100||The COVID-19 vaccination drive started in Delhi on Saturday, as part of the national roll-out, with 4,319 healthcare workers being vaccinated at 81 sites across the city. Both Covaxin and Covishield vaccines were used during the drive. Each of the 81 centres had aimed to cover 100 workers on the first day, but many fell short of the target of 8,100 despite a hand-picked list of people. While a lot of healthcare workers adopted a wait-and-watch approach, many volunteered for the drive. Directions were issued to inoculate only those healthcare workers who were below 50 years of age to avoid any possible complications. Hence the people to be inoculated on the first day were not randomly selected, according to officials. Adverse effects There were 51 “minor” and one “severe” Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI) among the healthcare workers who took the vaccine till 5 p.m., said an official list — compilation of data sent by all 11 districts. “The one severe case was reported from AIIMS. As per information from the hospital, a male health worker developed some kind of allergy after the vaccination and had to be given medication. He is stable as per latest reports,” Ankita Chakravarty, District Magistrate (south Delhi) toldThe Hindu. Covaxin was administered to all healthcare workers in AIIMS. AEFI has been divided into “minor”, “severe”, and “serious” categories by the government. A Delhi government spokesperson, however, maintained there was no AEFI on Day 1. Health Minister Satyendar Jain said the vaccination drive was “successfully” conducted on the first day. Healthcare workers in many city hospitals said they did not get a message on their registered mobile numbers about the time and date of vaccination, as earlier stated by the government, but they got calls from the hospital informing them about the vaccination drive. Only 32 healthcare workers were vaccinated at Lok Nayak Hospital and 31 at the Central government-run Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said the spokespersons of the respective hospitals. A total of 100 healthcare workers were inoculated at Max Hospital in Saket, said the private hospital. The vaccination drive started soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the national roll-out. The Central government-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Delhi government’s Lok Nayak Hospital remained in the focus with AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria getting a shot of Covaxin and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal inspecting Lok Nayak Hospital and reiterating that the “vaccine is safe” and “do not believe in rumours”. Rose and goodies Everyone who was vaccinated at Lok Nayak, the largest COVID-19 hospital in the city, got a rose, while at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, the beneficiaries were presented with a basket of chocolates, juice and other eatables. Biji Tomy, 48, a nurse from Kerala who got the first shot of the vaccine at Lok Nayak Hospital, said she had volunteered for the drive. “I knew I would have to get inoculated at some point, so why not today,” she toldThe Hindu.  Around 2.30 p.m. at G.B. Pant Hospital, Lokesh Kumar Meena, 36, who got the vaccine shot in the morning was working. “I gave my name for the first day. I am completely fine and I have been working after taking rest for a while. There are no complications and everyone should take the vaccine,” he said. The vaccination drive will continue from Monday. The city aims to inoculate about 2.4 lakh healthcare workers in the first phase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/4319-health-workers-vaccinated-on-day-1-initial-target-was-8100/article33591745.ece
17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘I was slightly scared but someone had to do it’||A 39-year-old nursing officer who had gotten infected while on duty, a 50-year-old sanitation worker, and a 32-year-old senior resident doctor were among those who got vaccinated at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital on Saturday. Akhilesh Sharma, nursing officer at GTB Hospital for the last 10 years, who practically lived with COVID-19 patients while on duty since the outbreak, emphasised the importance of the vaccine and said that he has been at the forefront of the fight against the deadly virus and was now ready to be among the first ones to get vaccinated for others to see the results. “I was slightly scared but someone had to do it. I feel absolutely okay after getting the vaccine. They had asked me about my medical history and gave me the shot only after they found me fit to be vaccinated,” he said. Away from children Before getting vaccinated, Mr. Sharma recalled the difficult time his family had to face when he and wife – also a nursing officer here – were found to be infected two months ago. “Mine was a severe infection and I was hospitalised for six days while my wife had quarantined herself at home. We had sent our children to their grandparents’ house. They are four and eight years old and couldn’t even understand what was happening. It was a tough time,” he said, adding that his wife is more scared and he is trying to convince her that if the “Prime Minister is endorsing the vaccine then she shouldn’t worry”. Mr. Sharma said that after the second shot of vaccine followed by 14 days observation period, he’ll finally be able to hug his children “freely without a thought”. “We still maintain distance at home with our children. Hopefully, after the vaccine, there’ll be some ease even if we’ll still follow protocol”. An anxious Amravati Devi, a sanitation worker at a nursing college, brought her friend, a lift operator, much before she was given a call to come to the waiting room before getting vaccinated. “I am nervous but I want to get the vaccine shot to feel safe. My daughter cheered me up this morning before I left for work,” she said. The first to get the shot at GTB Hospital was Akansha Rathor, a senior resident, who had no idea that she would be the first one to get inoculated. “I had a very minor pain at the time of vaccine. I am feeling normal… just like before and I would like to tell everyone that there’s nothing to be scared of. Trials have happened before. We’ll see in the coming days if we feel okay,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/i-was-slightly-scared-but-someone-had-to-do-it/article33591741.ece
17 January 2021||New Delhi,||Sweeper backs out of getting a jab at Lok Nayak Hospital||A sweeper who was supposed to be the first person to be inoculated backed out on Saturday morning at Lok Nayak Hospital, while a doctor was moved to the AEFI (Adverse Effect Following Immunisation) management room after she felt some giddiness.  Phone calls Each centre had prepared a hand-picked list of 100 healthcare workers to be inoculated on the first day. Though the beneficiaries were supposed to get a message on their registered mobile numbers about the time and date of vaccination as per government guidelines, it did not happen. Many said they got phone calls from the hospital informing them about the vaccination. The first person backing out led to a quick decision to start the drive at Lok Nayak with a nurse, an official said. At the hospital, there was a round of applause when the first person to be inoculated completed her 30 minutes of observation time without developing any problems. A 28-year-old doctor, Sneha Harish, who was moved to the AEFI monitoring room in Lok Nayak Hospital after she was inoculated, told The Hindu that she was fine after resting for about 20 minutes. She said she had volunteered to get the shot on the first day. “Initially, I was a little anxious. After the vaccination, I was a little tired and also felt giddy. When I told them about it, they made me lie down in the AEFI management room for about 20 minutes. They gave me something to eat. After that, I felt better,” she said. Rani Devi, the sweeper who backed out, told the newspaper that she did not want to get inoculated on the first day. She said she had got multiple calls from the hospital. She said the hospital was even ready to send a vehicle to bring her to the venue. “I didn’t give my name. I don’t want to get the vaccine now. I had told them two days ago as well that I do not want to get vaccinated. I don’t know how my name got in the list,” she said. Ms. Devi said she was not forced by the authorities. Different date At G.B. Pant Hospital at 2.30 p.m., a group of five civil defence volunteers was busy calling everyone on a list of 100 people to be vaccinated on Saturday. But, only 29 people turned up. “Sir, no one on the list will be coming now. Many of them asked for a different date,” one of them told the officer-in-charge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sweeper-backs-out-of-getting-a-jab-at-lok-nayak-hospital/article33591747.ece
17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccine selection process irks sanitation workers at RGSSH||At Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, random selection of people to get vaccinated irked a few sanitation workers who were waiting since morning to get the shot on Saturday. Arun Kumar, who has been posted as a sanitation worker in the flu unit where people are tested for COVID-19, said he and his colleagues were waiting since 7 a.m. but due to some “issue” their names were not in the list on Saturday. “They had taken our names on Friday and told us that we’ll get vaccinated today. Our supervisor is looking into the matter to correct this. I am unable to understand as to how people have been selected,” he said, adding that he is, however, sure that they’ll all get vaccinated. Another sanitation worker, Shiv Kumar, 40, said that he got infected by COVID-19 in May and was admitted in the hospital as well. “We have been and continue to be closely in touch with COVID-19 patients. It’s important for us and our families. They are only safe if we are. When I got infected, I stayed away from my family for a month and a half. Even today, I stay away from them for two hours after I go home,” he said. While the sanitation workers waited, the first one to get the vaccine shot at RGSSH was Vikas Dogra, head of school of pulmonology and nodal officer for COVID-19 at the hospital, who doesn’t remember the number of times he got tested for COVID-19.  From a distance While getting vaccinated today, he recalled spending five and a half months away from his family at the onset of the outbreak. “I didn’t go home for that time. I remember going outside my apartment and looking at them from a distance. But finally I went home because it didn’t seem to end,” he said, adding that his daughter’s birthday was also witnessed by him from a distance. Among those who also got vaccinated was Ansar Ali, nursing orderly (NO), who stayed away from his family for seven months, living in the hospital accommodation and finally went home in November. He continues to stay away and goes only occasionally. “I hope I gather the courage to be near them again after the vaccine shot,” he said. Shaheen Riyazuddin was another NO who got vaccinated on Saturday. She said she had joined the hospital in April and 17 days later, she was infected by COVID-19. “I continued to work after recovering. Now, I am feeling okay about getting vaccinated. I was told by my seniors that I should feel safe,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/vaccine-selection-process-irks-sanitation-workers-at-rgssh/article33591742.ece

17 January 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Sanitation worker gets first shot in Odisha||A sanitation worker was given the first COVID-19 vaccine as the Odisha government began a mass vaccination drive at 161 centres across the State on Saturday. Biranchi Naik (51), who has been working at the Capital Hospital for the past 30 years, received a Covaxin jab. “I would be lying if I say I was not scared before taking the vaccine. However, when the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister have been giving assurances, no one should be worried,” he said. Mr. Naik, while interacting with Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, said he was feeling fine after getting the first dose. The Director of Capital Hospital, a senior doctor and AIIMS Bhubaneswar Director Gitanjali Batmanabane also received the vaccine. At 11.05 a.m., the first vaccine dose was administered. “It is a matter of great satisfaction that the vaccination has marked our entry in the critical last leg of our fight against COVID-19.

As many as 1.92 lakh out of 3.28 lakh will be vaccinated with the first lot of Covishield and Covaxin,” he added. Mr. Patnaik interacted and took feedback from those who were given the vaccination in different districts on the first day. Good news, says CM “This is good news for us. A long wait finally comes to end. We again seek the cooperation of doctors and health workers,” he said. Mr. Patnaik congratulated the vaccine makers for rising up to the occasion.

17 January 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata seeks adequate doses from Centre||Vaccination drive for COVID-19 started in West Bengal on Saturday, along with rest of the country, with about 20,000 health workers being administered the vaccine across 207 centres in the State. when 75 per cent of the targeted beneficiaries received the shot in the state, health department officials said. Health department officials said 75% of the targeted beneficiaries received the shot. Officials said that 25% of the beneficiaries did not turn up at designated centres probably because they were not sure about the efficacy of the vaccine. Only four people at various vaccination centres complained of minor discomfort after receiving the shots, they said. Addressing the health workers, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she had requested the Centre for adequate doses and added if required, the State is willing to bear financial burden. She mentioned that she has already requested the Government of India to supply adequate number of vaccines for not only frontline workers, but also for all the people of West Bengal. She said all the people of the State should get vaccines free of cost as early as possible. “If needed, the State will bear the financial burden,” a press statement issued by the government said. Meanwhile, a fresh controversy erupted with two Trinamool Congress leaders — Katwa MLA Rabindranath Chatterjee and Subhash Mondal — getting the first dose of vaccine. While the two leaders maintained they got the vaccine as frontline health workers, the Opposition parties, particularly the Bharatiya Janata Party, criticised the move. “I don’t know whether they have been vaccinated or not. If they have, it is not a good thing. The first stage of vaccination is for healthcare workers,” Minister for Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Firhad Hakim said. Deaths cross 10,000 Meanwhile, the State recorded 609 new cases of infection in the past 24 hours taking the total cases to 5,64,098. The State recorded 15 deaths taking the total deaths to 10,041.

17 January 2021||Mumbai,||COVID-19 vaccination drive a revolutionary step: Uddhav||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday termed the launch of the COVID-19 vaccination drive a “revolutionary step” and recalled the efforts of frontline workers who selflessly treated patients amid the pandemic. Mr. Thackeray said the Centre had certified the vaccines and there was no need to doubt their efficacy. “We are following the Centre’s guidelines on the vaccination drive. The Centre is supplying the vaccine after securing the clearance from competent authorities. There should be no doubt over the safety of these vaccines,” he said while inaugurating the State-wide drive at the COVID-19 Care Centre at Bandra Kurla Complex. Dietitian Dr. Madhura Patil was the first recipient of the vaccine at the centre. Asked when he would take the vaccine, Mr. Thackeray said frontline workers would be given priority. “We will do exactly what the Centre has instructed us to do,” the Chief Minister said. On the first day, when last reports came in, 1,926 people had received the vaccine, with the number likely to rise to 4,000. Of the 10 vaccine centres in Mumbai, nine are run by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and one by the State government. The BMC has secured 1.39 lakh doses of Covishield from the Serum Institute of India. Mr. Thackeray said the BKC centre now has no patients owing to the tireless efforts of healthcare workers. “Those early days still give me shivers. The situation was adverse. Hospitals were flooded with patients. How to proceed was a big question and no solution was in sight. Everyone was under pressure,” he said. “Wearing a face mask is the best vaccine available,” the Chief Minister said, appealing to people not to let down their guard though vaccines are now accessible. With COVID-19 cases resurfacing in some countries, we may face a similar situation, he said. “To avoid this, the protocol of wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing, and washing hands frequently has to be followed strictly,” he said.

17 January 2021||Mumbai,||RTI activist files plea in HC against Covaxin||A plea was filed before the Bombay High Court on Saturday stating that as per the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), Bharat Biotech’s vaccine, Covaxin, has not been granted a full approval. The vaccine was given a restricted use approval in clinical trial mode, while the company’s Phase 3 trials are ongoing. There is no data made available in the public domain by the DCGI for peer-review by independent scientists, the plea said. The petition, filed by Right to Information (RTI) activist Saket Gokhale, said, “On January 3, 2021, DCGI issued a press release stating, “COVID-19 vaccines of M/s Serum Institute of India (named “Covishield”) and M/s Bharat Biotech (named “Covaxin”) have been approved for restricted use in emergency situation. The approval was granted based on the recommendations of the Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), a division of DCGI.” “With reference to M/s Bharat Biotech’s vaccine “Covaxin”, the DCGI’s press release stated the company has generated safety and immunogenicity data in various animal species such as mice, rats, rabbits, Syrian hamster, and also conducted challenge studies on nonhuman primates (Rhesus macaques) and hamsters. All these data has been shared by the firm with CDSCO,” plea added. The plea said, “M/s Bharat Biotech have not published the findings and data of their Phase 2 and ongoing Phase 3 trials in any paper.” Mr. Gokhale had also filed a RTI query on “Copies of safety, efficacy, and all other relevant data submitted by company Bharat Biotech International for its COVID-19 vaccine “Covaxin” to the Drugs Controller General India for approval”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rti-activist-files-plea-in-hc-against-covaxin/article33591655.ece

17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||After months of rigour, a dose of hope for many||The first day of the vaccination drive on Saturday was welcomed by healthcare workers as the “beginning of the end” to an ordeal that has lasted for over 10 months. From long duty hours in stuffy Personal Protective Equipment kits at COVID-19 wards to not being able to see family for weeks at a time, healthcare workers on Saturday said there was finally some “hope” after months of tribulations. Romil Saini, a senior resident in the psychiatry department, said: “There were times when we had month-long duties. Trauma centre duty was the most difficult while wearing PPE kits. The burden was immense when the virus was at its peak. Now that the vaccine is available, one can say that it is the ‘beginning of the end’.” “I got to visit my family in December for the first time since the pandemic began. I am happy to receive the vaccine. Up till now, there has been no side effects,” said Dr. Saini, who lives in Haryana.  ‘Had no doubts’ Najafgarh resident Bijay Kumar Yadav, a member of the hospital administration, said: “I had no doubts about the vaccine. We have been working since the beginning without any breaks and at this point we cannot take a step back as it will not be good for the country.” While most doctors said that they had no apprehensions of taking the vaccine, some who got vaccinated cautioned that the efficacy would be determined only after the second dose. Roshan Mathew, a senior resident in the emergency medicine department, said: “There are some common side effects with every vaccine, so some minor ones might be there but serious adverse effects should be rare. We are required to take two doses, hence, after the first shot, one cannot be completely sure. However, I am feeling hopeful and will continue to take precautions that I have been taking all these months. Though there was slight apprehension in the beginning, after the vaccine, we are hopeful.” At Safdarjung Hospital, Poornima Tiwari, who works in the community medicine department, said: “As of now there have been no side effects and it feels fine. All these months we were distressed with the thought of carrying the infection back home. Once the second dose is administered, there will be some sort of assurance.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/after-months-of-rigour-a-dose-of-hope-for-many/article33591652.ece

RDA vice-president Nirmalya Mohapatra said that they did not announce any formal boycott of Covaxin and that they were yet to meet the MS of the hospital. ‘Defeat the purpose’ “We would like to bring to your notice that the residents [doctors] are a bit apprehensive about the lack of complete trial in case of Covaxin and might not participate in huge numbers, thus, defeating the purpose of vaccination. We request you to vaccinate us with Covishield which has completed all stages of all trials before its roll-out,” the letter said. Six Central hospitals of the total 81 sites were inoculating healthcare workers using Covaxin.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Cong. seeks probe into chats between Arnab, ex-BARC CEO||The Maharashtra unit of the Congress on Saturday demanded a probe into the revelations made in the alleged WhatsApp conversations between Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and recently arrested former Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) CEO Pratho Dasgupta. The transcript of the messages was a part of the supplementary chargesheet filed by the Mumbai Police in the Television Rating Points (TRP) case. “The chats, which are in public domain, are no longer limited to the scam. Mr. Goswami’s reference to the Balakot strike and that the Pathankot attack was breaking news on his channel 20 minutes in advance, makes it an issue of national security. We will be meeting State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh to demand a high-level probe,” said State Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant. He said the chats show former Union minister Rajvardhan Singh Rathore giving undue favours to Republic TV and the Congress has sought a reply on this from the BJP. “The chats show Mr. Goswami boasting about his closeness with the PMO, Information and Broadcasting Ministry, and a person identified as AS. Both Mr. Goswami and Mr. Dasgupta were manipulating TRP,” he said. Mr. Sawant said when Mr. Goswami was arrested, BJP leaders like Ram Kadam and Kirit Somaiya came out in his support. “The BJP must come clean and explain its role in the scam,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-seeks-probe-into-chats-between-arnab-ex-barc-ceo/article33591656.ece
17 January 2021||WILMINGTON,||Biden pledges to boost vaccine supplies||President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to boost supplies of coronavirus vaccine and set up new vaccination sites to meet his goal of 100 million shots in 100 days. It’s part of a broader COVID strategy that also seeks to straighten out snags in testing and ensure minority communities are not left out. “Some wonder if we are reaching too far,” Mr. Biden said on Friday. “Let me be clear, I’m convinced we can get it done.” The real payoff, Mr. Biden said, will come from uniting the nation in a new effort grounded in science. Mr. Biden said he is upgrading the White House Science Adviser position to Cabinet-level — a sharp break from predecessor Donald Trump as America grapples with the pandemic. Eric Lander, a geneticist who helped map the human genome, will head the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and advise Mr. Biden. “Science will always be at the forefront of my administration -- and these world-renowned scientists will ensure everything we do is grounded in science, facts, and the truth,” Mr. Biden said in a statement announcing the appointment of Mr. Lander and other experts. Mr. Biden spoke a day after unveiling a $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan” to confront the virus and provide temporary support for a shaky economy. About $400 billion of the plan is focused on measures aimed at controlling the virus. Those range from mass vaccination centers to more sophisticated scientific analysis of new strains and squads of local health workers to trace the contacts of infected people. “You have my word: We will manage the hell out of this operation,” Mr. Biden declared. He underscored a need for Congress to approve more money and for people to keep following basic precautions, such as wearing masks, avoiding gatherings and frequently washing their hands. Throughout the plan, there’s a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments. A key challenge for Mr. Biden and the nation: Vaccines are in too-short supply. Mr. Biden said he would use the Defense Production Act, a Cold War-era law, to boost vaccine supplies and work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up 100 vaccination centres around the country by the end of his first month in office. Rising toll “Almost a year later, we’re still far from back to normal. The honest truth is this: Things will get worse before they get better,” he said on Friday, as U.S. deaths climbed closer to 4,00,000. The global toll has now reached 2 million. Mr. Biden seconded the Trump administration’s call earlier this week for states to start vaccinating more seniors, reaching those 65 and older as well as younger people with certain health problems. Until now States have been focused on inoculating health care workers, and some are starting to vaccinate people 75 and older. Relatively few are providing shots to people between 65 and 75.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-pledges-to-boost-vaccine-supplies/article33591353.ece
17 January 2021||Berlin,||Merkel ally wins race to lead her party||Armin Laschet, the new head of Germany’s conservative CDU party, is a sworn European and defender of multiculturalism who has promised to continue the centrist course of Chancellor Angela Merkel. The affable 59-year-old was elected as head of the CDU on Saturday, beating corporate lawyer Friedrich Merz and foreign affairs expert Norbert Roettgen. Race for Chancellor The CDU chairman traditionally leads the party and its CSU Bavarian sister party to the polls, meaning Mr. Laschet is in with a fighting chance of becoming Germany’s next Chancellor. A soft-spoken political moderate with a reputation for pragmatism, Mr. Laschet is currently the leader of Germany’s most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia. He is a sworn Merkel loyalist who famously stuck by the Chancellor in 2015, when Germany left its borders open to hundreds of thousands of migrants from Syria and other hotspots. If anything, he is seen as even more pro-migration than Ms. Merkel, celebrating diversity as a economic and social boon to his state. During his campaign to head the CDU, he positioned himself as the Merkel continuity candidate, telling Stern magazine that “a break with Angela Merkel would send exactly the wrong signal”. Mr. Laschet emerged as an early favourite when the race to head the party was thrown open last year after the resignation of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. But his path to the top was anything but smooth, with critics accusing him of flip-flopping and poor leadership over his handling of the pandemic in North Rhine-Westphalia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/merkel-ally-wins-race-to-lead-her-party/article33591357.ece
17 January 2021||Hong Kong,||Five Hong Kong activists who fled the city seek asylum in U.S.||Five Hong Kong democracy protesters who reportedly fled to Taiwan have arrived in the United States intending to seek asylum, an activist group said on Saturday. Their escape follows the mass arrest of democracy figures in Hong Kong under a new national security law that is part of a mounting crackdown by China on the financial hub. The Hong Kong Democracy Council (HKDC), a U.S.-based group, said it had welcomed a group of young activists to America this week and their journey had been “arduous and perilous”. “The activists, all under the age of 30, took part in the ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, faced protest-related arrests and charges, and fled the city by boat last July,” Samuel Chu, founder of HKDC, told AFP. “I am relieved and overjoyed to welcome them to the United States and to assist them as they seek asylum and a new life,” Chu added. Through a statement issued by the HKDC, the five activists now in exile said their hearts have been “filled with anxiety and all kinds of emotions” from the moment they left Hong Kong. After massive democracy protests across Hong Kong in 2019 in which more than 11,000 people were arrested, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law late last June to silence dissent. In August, another group of 12 Hong Kong activists made an attempt to flee by speedboat to Taiwan but were arrested by Chinese coastguards. Last month, a Chinese court jailed 10 of these 12 fugitives for up to three years for “organising and participating in an illegal border crossing”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/five-hong-kong-activists-who-fled-the-city-seek-asylum-in-us/article33591354.ece
17 January 2021||Washington,||Pelosi tasks General with security review||U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday that retired General Russel Honore, who coordinated the Hurricane Katrina response, will oversee an immediate security review at the U.S. Capitol following last week’s deadly riot by a pro-Trump mob. She also said there was “strong interest” in Congress for a 9/11-style investigation of the unprecedented attack on the Capitol that has been described as an insurrection, and which led to the swift second impeachment Wednesday of President Donald Trump. “Justice is called for,” she said. But Ms. Pelosi declined to reveal when she will send the article of impeachment — for “incitement of insurrection” — over to the Senate, a process that would trigger a trial of the President. “You’ll be the first to know when we announce that we’re going over there,” she told reporters. Five people died in the violent unrest generated by Mr. Trump’s supporters, whom he urged to march on Congress and “fight like hell” to save the country and stop President-elect Joe Biden from taking office on January 20. “We must subject this whole complex to scrutiny in light of what happened, and the fact that the inauguration is coming,” the top Democrat told reporters, referring to Mr. Biden’s upcoming swearing-in on the steps of the very Capitol where rioters fought with police and plotted to kill lawmakers. “To that end, I have asked retired lieutenant general Russel Honore to lead an immediate review of security infrastructure, interagency processes, and command and control,” Ms. Pelosi said. She described Gen. Honore as “a respected leader with experience dealing with crises,” including the military relief response along the Gulf Coast when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005. The 80-year-old speaker said that while the entire Congress remained passionate in its reaction to the deadly Capitol violence, “we must be very dispassionate in how we make decisions to go forward for security, security, security.” A handful of House Republicans loyal to Mr. Trump are under scrutiny for their role in potentially coordinating with hardline activists who helped plan the action on the Capitol. “If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime,” Ms. Pelosi said, “there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecution.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pelosi-tasks-general-with-security-review/article33591359.ece
17 January 2021||Kampala,||Museveni wins 6th term, amid allegations of rigged election||Uganda’s Electoral Commission said on Saturday that President Yoweri Museveni won a sixth five-year term, extending his rule to four decades, while top opposition challenger Bobi Wine dismissed “cooked-up, fraudulent results” and officials struggled to explain how polling results were compiled amid an Internet blackout. In a generational clash watched across the African continent with a booming young population and a host of ageing leaders, the 38-year-old singer-turned-lawmaker Mr. Wine posed arguably Mr. Museveni's greatest challenge yet. The self-described “ghetto president” had strong support in urban centers where frustration with unemployment and corruption is high. He has claimed victory. In a phone interview from his home, which he said was surrounded by soldiers, Mr. Wine urged the international community to “please call Gen. Museveni to order” by withholding aid, imposing sanctions and using Magnitsky legislation to hold alleged human rights users accountable. Mr. Wine repeated that all legal options are being considered, including challenging the results in court and calling for peaceful protests. The Electoral Commission said Mr. Museveni received 58% of ballots and Mr. Wine 34%, and voter turnout was 52%, in a process that the top U.S. diplomat to Africa called “fundamentally flawed.” The vote followed the East African country’s worst pre-election violence since the 76-year-old Mr. Museveni took office in 1986.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/museveni-wins-6th-term-amid-allegations-of-rigged-election/article33591362.ece
17 January 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka’s Tamil parties seek mechanism to probe ‘war crimes’||Sri Lanka’s main Tamil political parties have sought an international probe, including at the International Criminal Court (ICC), into allegations of human rights abuses during the civil war, deeming there is “no scope” for a domestic process that can “genuinely” deal with accountability. In a joint letter — dated January 15, 2021 — addressed to members of the UN Human Rights Council they observed, “Leaders across the political spectrum in Sri Lanka including from both the major political parties have categorically and without exception stated thatthey will protect the Sri Lankan armed forces from prosecutions. It is now time for Member States to acknowledge that there is no scope for a domestic process that can genuinely deal with accountability in Sri Lanka.” Consensus reached Significantly, different Tamil political parties that were until now fiercely critical of each other’s strategies — political or regarding accountability — appear to have reached a consensus ahead of the 46th session of the Council (February 22 to March 19), going by the signatories to the letter, including Tamil National Alliance Leader R. Sampanthan, Tamil National People’s Front Leader G.G. Ponnambalam, and Tamil Makkal Tesiya Kootani Leader and former Chief Minister of the Northern Province C.V. Wigneswaran, apart from civil society organisations in the north and east. UN Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva usually evoke sharp and opposing views within Sri Lanka, with much of the Tamil polity pinning hopes on the Council for war-time accountability, while the southern Sinhala polity and its core electorate vehemently oppose any international interference in its affairs. In February last year, months after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected to office, Sri Lanka formally notified the Human Right Council that it was withdrawing from the2019 UN resolution on post-war accountability and reconciliation, scheduled to be taken up in the upcoming session. Citing Sri Lanka’s unfulfilled commitments to promote accountability and reconciliation, the Tamil leaders urged that UN organs, including the UN Security Council and General Assembly, to take “suitable action by reference to the International Criminal Court and any other appropriate and effective international accountability mechanisms to inquire into the crime of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.” They also sought an international evidence gathering mechanism such as the one set up for Syria. Burial rights Further, the Tamil parties said the persisting “militarisation and surveillance” in war-affected areas, and the denial of burial rights to Muslims —during Covid-19 pandemic — and the right to memory, underscored the urgency of addressing the “deteriorating situation.” Tamil people’s right to commemorate came under sharp focus recently, when authorities at the University of Jaffna demolished a memorial on campus, built to remember those who died in the final phase of the war in 2009. Following student protests and wide condemnation from within and outside Sri Lanka, the University Vice-Chancellor assured students that a new “peace memorial” would be built.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lankas-tamil-parties-seek-mechanism-to-probe-war-crimes/article33591350.ece

Dustin Higgs was convicted of ordering the killings of three women in a Maryland wildlife refuge in 1996. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department resumed federal executions last year following a 17-year hiatus. No President in more than 120 years had overseen as many federal executions. Mr. Higgs, 48, was pronounced dead at 1:23 a.m. Asked if he had any last words, Mr. Higgs said, “I’d like to say I am an innocent man... I am not responsible for the deaths,” he said softly. “I did not order the murders.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-carries-out-last-execution-of-trump-era/article33591360.ece

17 January 2021||MUMBAI,||HDFC Bank Q3 profit rises 14.4% on surge in net interest income||The country’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank on Saturday reported a 14.4% jump in consolidated net profit to Rs. 8,760 crore for the December quarter, driven by a surge in core income. Standalone net profit for the three-month period grew 18.1% to Rs. 8,758.29 crore, on the back of a 15.1% growth in net interest income to Rs. 16,317 crore. Deposits grew 19.1%. This is the maiden earnings declaration under new CEO and MD Sashidhar Jagdishan, who succeeded Aditya Puri as the head of the bank. The bank’s credit growth came at 15.6%, while net interest margin was 4.2%. Non-interest income grew 11% to Rs. 7,443 crore, largely on the back of a gain or revaluation in an investment at Rs. 1,109 crore, which stood at Rs. 676 crore in the year-ago period. The results showed an improvement in the asset quality with the gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio at 0.81% of total assets as against 1.42% a year earlier and 1.08% at the end of the preceding September quarter, the bank said. Stable, sans moratorium Even excluding the benefit of the Supreme Court order asking banks not to classify stress during the moratorium period in NPA computation, the GNPA ratio would have been at 1.38%, it added. Overall provisions and contingencies for the reporting quarter, which saw the economy trying to recover from the reverses of the pandemic, grew to Rs. 3,414 crore from Rs. 3,043 crore a year earlier. It said 0.5% of its Rs. 10.82 lakh crore in advances had been restructured under the special scheme announced by the RBI to handle COVID-related stress. The bank, which had detected malpractices in its auto lending vertical earlier, reported a reduction in overall auto loans outstanding to Rs. 81,880 crore from Rs. 83,552 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/hdfc-bank-q3-profit-rises-144-on-surge-in-net-interest-income/article33591335.ece
17 January 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Refine quality of expenditure to aid fiscal sustainability’||Maintaining and improving the quality of expenditure would help address the objectives of fiscal sustainability while supporting growth, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Saturday. “As per IMF’s calculations, the total fiscal support in response to COVID-19 amounted to about 12% of global GDP by mid-September 2020,” Mr. Das said while delivering the Nani Palkhivala Memorial Lecture online on the subject, ‘Towards a Stable Financial System’. “Global public debt is said to have reached 100% of GDP in 2020. As a result, most economies are expected to emerge from the pandemic with higher deficits and debt vulnerabilities.” He said although the scale of fiscal spending was expected to breach the quantitative targets of fiscal prudence across most economies in the short-run, it was crucial in the context of the pandemic from the perspective of the welfare aspect of public expenditure. ‘Multiplier effect’ “Expenditure on physical and social infrastructure including human capital, science and technology is not only welfare-enhancing, it also paves the way for higher growth through their higher multiplier effect and enhancement of both capital and labour productivity,” Mr. Das said. “Going forward, it becomes imperative that fiscal road maps are defined not only in terms of quantitative parameters like fiscal balance to GDP ratio or debt to GDP ratio, but also in terms of measurable parameters relating to quality of expenditure, both for the Centre and States.” While conventional parameters of fiscal discipline will ensure medium- and long-term sustainability of public finances, measurable parameters of quality of expenditure would ensure that welfarism carries significant productive outcomes and multiplier effects, Mr. Das added. He also said that the principal objective of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the pandemic was to support economic activity. “Looking back, it is evident that our policies have helped in easing the severity of the economic impact of the pandemic,” he said. He reiterated that the RBI “remains steadfast to take any further measures, as may be necessary, while at the same time remaining fully committed to maintaining financial stability.” Responding to a question, he said the RBI was open to examining any proposal for setting up a bad bank. “It is up to the government and the private sector to put up such a proposal,” the RBI Governor added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/refine-quality-of-expenditure-to-aid-fiscal-sustainability/article33591333.ece
17 January 2021||WASHINGTON,||Trump tells U.S. departments to pare purchases from China||In another action against China days before he leaves office, U.S. President Donald Trump directed government departments to look at ways to minimise procurement of Chinese goods and services to reduce the risks from espionage, his national security adviser said. In a statement on Friday, Robert O’Brien accused China of targeting the information systems of the U.S. government for personnel records, military plans, and other data through cyber and other means. “For this reason, the United States must take corresponding actions to protect American interests. We must adjust our regulations and policies and take other necessary actions to reduce the risk of PRC technical and human espionage activities directed at the Federal Government,” he said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. He said Mr. Trump had directed government bodies to conduct reviews “to minimise the procurement of People’s Republic of China (PRC) goods and services by the Federal Government.” Mr. O’Brien did not give examples of the procurement he referred to, but a senior administration official said a key aim was to push back against Chinese attempts to infiltrate U.S. IT networks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/trump-tells-us-departments-to-pare-purchases-from-china/article33591337.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Retail inventory has piled up’||The domestic footwear industry was among the earliest to be impacted by the pandemic as the COVID-19 lockdown restricted people’s movement. It is limping back to normalcy following a shift in marketing strategy, according to N. Mohan ,  MD  of British shoemaker Clarks India.  Edited excerpts from an interview:  Footwear was the among the earliest to be impacted by the pandemic. Are you back on track? COVID-19 severely affected the retail industry, more so the footwear industry because people did not step out of their homes for a very long time. As an industry, we witnessed a sharp drop in sales throughout the period. We are confident that the business will be back to previous year levels in 2021. How was your sales performance over the last nine months? With the announcement of lockdown towards the end of March, all malls and high streets were shut... closing down our stores in major metros and other cities for an uncertain period. There were ‘no sales’ till June, except for some States where the regulations were not so stringent. The business gradually started again with some sales coming from our e-commerce channel after the restrictions were eased but didn’t speed up due to consumer sentiment being at an all-time low. However, the major thrust to our business came from the pre-festival and festival season in September-November due to pent-up demand, helping us reach 70-75% of our previous year’s numbers. How did you address the situation? The pandemic led us to revisit our plans and pivot our strategy around three key areas — product, selling environment and communications. Growing ‘remote-working’ led us to retrieving more athleisure products from our archives, which would provide comfort while being fashionable. These products would suit western and traditional outfits, providing flexibility to our consumers. We shifted our focus from brick-and-mortar to ‘unified commerce’ and towards digital. New processes were introduced to activate our omni-channel and B2B businesses, which helped us reach 75% of last year’s actuals. What kind of losses did the industry suffer from April to December on account of cancellations by overseas buyers? Worldwide, due to frequent lockdowns, many brands and retailers are sitting on a huge inventory. Consequently, industry exports are down by 34.8% and imports by 50.3%. In India, many brands will end up with 55-60% of last year’s sales. Also, there is a huge change in the type of footwear now preferred due to the change in lifestyle and people adapting to the new normal. It may take at least two seasons more for inventories to normalise. From spring- summer 2022, things will rebound as by then, customer confidence will improve. I sincerely feel there will be a huge demand thanks to the ‘revenge shoppers’ that will help the industry bounce back.  Have you started getting orders for the forthcoming season? We have started placing orders for the next season, which are 20% lower than the previous spring-summer 21 season, but we feel our autumn-winter 21 season will be much stronger and with the advent of vaccines, customer confidence will go up. What are your expectations from the Union Budget? Conducive policies in terms of ease-of-doing business, increased focus on manufacturing by incentivising people creating jobs and limited restrictions on imports of finished leather goods will help. In fact, the Centre should introduce a floor price to stop cheap imports and under-invoicing. We also believe unless the Indian industry is exposed to competition, we will not be able to improve the quality of products. We must enhance India’s image as a preferred manufacturing hub in terms of quality and productivity.  From the spring- summer of 2022, things will rebound as customer confidence will improve||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retail-inventory-has-piled-up/article33591330.ece

In a decision issued on Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert Schroeder in Tyler, Texas rejected Apple’s request for a new trial and several other claims. These included that VirnetX’s award should not exceed $113.7 million, and that jurors should have been told the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had deemed VirnetX’s claims “unpatentable.” Jurors in October found that Apple infringed two VirnetX patents related to secure networks, known as virtual private networks, to which owners of various iPhones and iPads may connect. Schroeder also awarded royalties of 84 cents per unit for future infringements, mirroring the rate set by the jury. Apple had said future royalties should be zero, or else no more than 19 cents per unit. Apple and VirnetX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, and VirnetX, based in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, have battled in patent litigation for more than a decade. Last March, Apple paid VirnetX $454 million after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the iPhone maker’s appeal in an earlier patent case. In a December 18 court filing, Apple said the latest award could boost its payout in both cases to $1.116 billion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/apple-payout-on-virnetx-patent-may-exceed-11-bn/article33591331.ece

17 January 2021||Brisbane,||Test hangs in the balance as rain ends play early||The deciding fourth Test between Australia and India hung in the balance on Saturday after a massive thunderstorm caused play to be abandoned after tea on the second day. Too wet The Gabba was saturated during the storm, which began during the tea break, and while the ground drained quickly, the umpires decided the outfield was too wet for play to continue. India will resume on Sunday at 62 for two.  Australia had earlier claimed the vital wicket of Rohit Sharma 20 minutes before tea to seize the momentum. Rohit had been in full flow, striking 44 stylish runs off 74 balls with six 4s. But, with the score on 60 for the loss of opener Shubman Gill (7), Rohit threw his wicket away when he charged off-spinner Nathan Lyon, only managing a skier to Mitchell Starc at deep mid-on. The Australian off-spinner is playing his 100th Test and is closing in on 400 wickets — Rohit was his 397th.  Resuming at 274 for five, Tim Paine and Cameron Green looked to push the score beyond 400.  But, shortly after reaching his half-century, Paine chased a wide ball from Shardul Thakur (three for 94) and edged to Rohit at third slip. Green survived a sharp chance on 45 off Washington Sundar but two runs later, the off-spinner got his revenge when he bowled the Australia No. 6 for 47. Shardul, playing only his second Test, took his third wicket when he trapped Cummins leg-before for two to leave the hosts struggling at 315 for seven. However, Lyon and Starc went on the attack and the score raced to 354 before Washington bowled Lyon around his legs after his quickfire 24 off 22 deliveries. When T. Natarajan bowled Josh Hazlewood to end the innings, the inexperienced Indian attack had completed an impressive comeback.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/test-hangs-in-the-balance-as-rain-ends-play-early/article33591465.ece
17 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Parag show helps Assam stun Bengal||Newly-crowned captain Riyan Parag’s excellent allround performance and medium-pacer Pritam Das’ three-wicket haul propelled Assam to record a 13-run upset win over Bengal in an Elite group-B match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament at the Eden Gardens here on Saturday. Put in, Assam posted a challenging 157 for five and restricted Bengal to 144 for eight for its second win. Assam lost Rishav Das and Pallav Das to Ishan Porel inside three overs. Riyang Parag (77 n.o., 54b, 5x4, 5x6) and Denish Das (34, 36b, 2x4, 1x6) combined well to add 76 runs. Parag played some power-packed shots to the boundary on either side. He also ran well with Denish to take Assam to a decent position. Later, Parag joined forces with Erik Roy (19 n.o., 12b, 3x4) as 57 runs came off the last five overs. In reply, Bengal had another brisk start thanks to the attacking approach of its openers Vivek Singh (21, 14b, 3x4, 1x6) and Shreevats Goswami (16, 10b, 3x4). Goswami was caught behind while trying a late cut off Mukhtar Hussain and Vivek was held at long-off off Parag in successive overs inside the PowerPlay. The seasoned duo of captain Anustup Majumdar (48 n.o., 47b, 4x4) and Manoj Tiwary (33, 22b, 3x4, 2x6) rotated the strike and punished the loose deliveries to add 64 runs at a good pace. Parag broke the stand as Tiwary, who hit two lovely sixes down the ground, skied one to point in the 13th over. The dismissals of Shahbaz Ahmed (13) and Suvankar Bal to Pritam Das in the 18th over turned the game around for Assam. Writtick Chatterjee and Akash Deep fell in the 19th over and Prayas Ray Barman was dismissed by Pritam in the 20th as the home team wilted under pressure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/parag-show-helps-assam-stun-bengal/article33591740.ece
17 January 2021||BENGALURU,||Another blow to Karnataka’s chances||Karnataka’s hopes of qualifying for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy quarterfinals took another beating on Saturday. The defending champion defeated Railways at the Alur Grounds, but the two-wicket victory that came with two balls to spare left its net run rate (+0.259) way below Elite Group-A leader Punjab’s (+2.814) and significantly lower than four other teams from groups-B and C with which it is tied on points (12) and wins (3) after four matches. Five Elite group winners and the Plate group topper will qualify directly, while the remaining spots will be filled by the two best teams from across the Elite groups, decided on the basis of points, wins, head-to-head and net run rate, in that order. BIg win needed Karnataka will need a massive win against Uttar Pradesh in its last match on Monday and other results to go its way to stay in the hunt. After choosing to bat, Railways rode on a 94-run second-wicket partnership between Pratham Singh (41, 43b, 4x4, 1x6) and Shivam Chaudhary (48, 39b, 3x4, 3x6) and a late blitz by Harsh Tyagi (33 n.o., 16b, 4x4, 1x6) to make 152 for five. Karnataka chased down the target with Anirudha Joshi (64 n.o., 40b, 3x4, 4x6) and Devdutt Padikkal 37 (32b, 3x4, 2x6) coming good. Even as opener Padikkal held one end up and was at the crease for half the chase, he didn’t find much support. Rohan Kadam was out for 14 (8b) while skipper Karun Nair’s wretched form continued as he was dismissed for 15. First ball ducks K.L. Shrijith and Pravin Dubey were both out for first ball ducks as Karnataka was reduced to 75 for five with T. Pradeep (3/19) — formerly of Karnataka — and Shivendra Singh (2/33) doing the damage. Dhrushant Soni then scalped three lower-order wickets of Shreyas Gopal, K. Gowtham and A. Mithun to leave Karnataka at 134 for eight, still needing 19 off 13. Joshi clubbed three sixes, the second of which was to level scores and the final one to win the match. But even his best efforts may not salvage things for Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/another-blow-to-karnatakas-chances/article33591724.ece
17 January 2021||KOZHIKODE,||When a new Azhar took centrestage!||When Mohammed Azharuddeen was batting on 92 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Wednesday night, his captain and partner Sanju Samson went up to him and said: “Look for singles or twos and get your hundred.” The very next ball, Azharuddeen danced down the track and lofted the Mumbai left-arm spinner Shams Mulani over long-off for a six. Maybe, as if to please the skipper, the 26-year-old opener got to his hundred with a two. It was one of the few balls that he did not dismiss from his presence in imperious fashion during that astonishing knock of 137 not out off 54 balls (9x4, 11x6). By the time he took Kerala home to its first ever win over the mighty Mumbai in any form of cricket at the senior level, cricket fans across the country had begun to wonder who this new Azhar was. For those following Kerala cricket, his sweetly timed shots weren't a revelation, though his temperament was. Azharuddeen, named after former India captain and supreme stylist Mohammad Azharuddin, has always been a delight to watch, but he hasn’t had too many big scores. His only hundred for Kerala (across formats) since making his debut in 2015-16, had come against Punjab in the Ranji Trophy at Mohali two years ago. The innings at Wankhede could be a turning point in his career. “During the lockdown I had worked hard on facing pace bowlers; I knew that was something I had to do in order to progress to the next stage of my career,” he told The Hindu over phone from Mumbai on Friday. “I owe it to my coaches Shadaf Khan and N. Bijumon for working with me during the lockdown. “And I am grateful to (my fellow-opener) Robin Uthappa and Sanju for egging me on while I was batting against Mumbai.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/when-a-new-azhar-took-centrestage/article33591661.ece
17 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Jagadeesan’s dream run continues||Opener N. Jagadeesan continued his dream run to score his third successive half-century as Tamil Nadu defeated Hyderabad by seven wickets in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament at the Jadavpur University ground here on Saturday. It was Tamil Nadu’s fourth consecutive victory. Electing to bat in the Elite Group B contest, Hyderabad made 152 for seven which Tamil Nadu overhauled with three balls to spare. Hyderabad had a good start thanks to Pragnay Reddy’s breezy 30 (23b, 3x4, 2x6). Tamil Nadu wrested momentum as Pragnay was caught by Shahrukh Khan off Sandeep Warrier in the last delivery of the fifth over. Tanmay Agarwal, the other opener, was held by Aswin Crist off B. Aparajith off the first ball of the sixth over. Warrier then removed Thakur Tilak Varma and Aparajith dismissed Himalay Agarwal as Hyderabad was reduced to 54 for four in the eighth over. B. Sandeep (41, 36b, 2x4, 2x6) took Hyderabad to a respectable total. Tanay Thygarajan (16 n.o., 6b, 2x4, 1x6) and C.V. Milind (24 n.o., 11b, 3x6) swung their bats to good effect and helped their team cross the 150-mark. Early jolt In reply, Tamil Nadu received an early jolt as C. Hari Nishaanth (8) was bowled by Milind in the third over. Nevertheless, a focused Jagadeesan (78 n.o., 51b, 4x4, 5x6) added 39 with K.B. Arun Karthick (16) before the latter was run out in the eighth over. Tamil Nadu was at 86 for three in 11.1 overs after Aparajith’s departure. Jagadeesan, who hit four of his sixes and two of his fours to the sight screen, and captain Dinesh Karthik (40 n.o., 30b, 2x4, 2x6), who played all his big shots on the leg side, accomplished the task in a clinical fashion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jagadeesans-dream-run-continues/article33591477.ece
17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kavi overcomes conditions, gets the better of champions||Sailing past Elavenil Valarivan, the World No. 1 in air rifle, and topping the trials when the Olympic quota winners Apurvi Chandela and Anjum Moudgil had failed to make the final, was a personal triumph for Kavi Rakshna from Madurai. Coached by Purushottaman Ramachandran, the second year MBBS student of the Government Sivangangai Medical College, Kavi had to overcome the cold conditions of Delhi and the disappointment of not having performed well in the first event. “This match was very special for me as it was held after about a year’s break. The excitement drove my spirits higher. One more reason was the frustrating end of my first trial a day earlier. It was difficult to handle the intense cold. I was tired both physically and mentally,” recalled the 20-year-old Kavi, a bright student who had secured her medical seat with a high score. With her mother Rani Chakravarthi, a psychologist, playing a significant role, Kavi handled the tricky situation with poise. “Together with my mom, we found ways to deal with the cold. We had hot packs, and I had woollen gloves to warm my hands. I even cut down on coffee as it helps in dealing with the cold,” said Kavi, recalling her drill to deal with the conditions and emerge on top in a classy field. Coach Ramachandran, who trains shooters in Madurai, Dindigul, Puducherry and Bengaluru, said that Kavi was able to use the pandemic period in improving her technique. “The quarantine was tough. I started working on my stability and fitness. Off-range practices such as holding and dry training helped me scrutinise my skill. Mental training was a domain that my mom and I did jointly. As a psychologist, my mom made me feel at ease all the time,” said Kavi, back home and busy with her studies. Quite grateful to coach Ramachandran, a multi-faceted technician, Kavi stressed that it was his “technical soundness” that helped in her progress. On his part, Ramachandran assured that there were many shooters from Tamil Nadu, biding their time to strike it big.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kavi-overcomes-conditions-gets-the-better-of-champions/article33591474.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Gritty Hyderabad shares the honours with Mumbai City FC||Hyderabad FC shut out table-topper Mumbai City FC in an enthralling goalless draw in the ISL at Bambolim on Saturday. The Nizams managed their first clean sheet in nine outings and also stopped Mumbai’s run of having scored a goal in its last nine matches. Despite having 59% possession in the opening 45 minutes, Mumbai, which rested Hugo Boumous, struggled to create many chances as Hyderabad denied it space to work with. Its best opportunity came in the 11th minute when Bipin Singh was played through on goal, but his extra touch allowed right-back Asish Rai to make a crucial tackle. Hyderabad had more chances in the first half, but failed to score on four occasions. Liston Colaco was released down the right and with two HFC attackers in better goal-scoring positions, the winger preferred to take a shot and hit straight to Amrinder Singh from a narrow angle. After the water break, Chianese beat the offside line to race on to Mohammed Yasir’s lobbed ball, but Amrinder denied the forward with an outstretched foot. Mumbai’s only shot of the half came in the 45th minute when Adam le Fondre curled a shot from distance but Laxmikant Kattimani proved equal to the task. On resumption, a tired Mumbai’s frustrations were compounded by Hyderabad’s disciplined approach. And even when the latter made an error, it went unpunished. Raynier Fernandes, plucking the ball away from centre-back Chinglensana Singh, hurtled towards goal, but Odei Onaindia dispossessed him with a sliding tackle. Mumbai (26 from 11) widened its lead at the top to six points. Hyderabad stayed fourth with 16 from 11.  The result: Mumbai City FC 0 drew with Hyderabad FC 0.   Sunday’s matches: Jamshedpur FC vs NEUFC (5 p.m.); FC Goa vs ATK Mohun Bagan (7.30 p.m.).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hyderabad-shares-the-honours-with-mumbai-city/article33591464.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Rohit defends decision to go after the bowlers||Rohit Sharma defended his shot selection that led to his dismissal for a well-made 44 — trying to take on Nathan Lyon and being caught in the deep. Role in team “It is a shot that I play and have played very well in the past as well. So it is something that I back myself to do all the time,” said Rohit on Saturday. “That is the kind of role that I play in this team.” He admitted it looked bad, but didn’t want to think too much about it. “I want to make it big, but having said that, there is a process I like to follow and the process is to make sure that once I am in, I'm on top of the bowlers. I am trying to keep the pressure on the bowling unit of the opposition,” he said. Rohit revealed he had started working on tackling the Australian bowlers the day he landed and while he was in quarantine during the first two Tests.  Commenting on the state of the match, Rohit complimented the inexperienced bowling attack for restricting Australia to less than 400, though, he said, 30-40 runs fewer would have been better. “We have solid batters to come, and two of the most experienced players are still out there in the middle. The pitch is good and, I don’t see any reason why we can’t get to ‘that’ score,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohit-defends-decision-to-go-after-the-bowlers/article33591468.ece
17 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sarabjot, Rhythm make it to the top||The champions of air pistol Saurabh Chaudhary and Manu Baker wavered a bit and that led to the Sarabjot Singh and Rhythm Sangwan seizing the opportunity to climb to the top in the National shooting selection trials at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Saturday. Quite significantly, both Saurabh and Manu topped qualification with 587 and 583 in the men’s and women’s events respectively. Sarabjot topped with 242.6 in the final after having qualified in the second place with an impressive 586. World Cup gold medallist Shahzar Rizvi rose to the second place ahead of Amanpreet Singh and the Olympic quota winner Abhishek Verma. Saurabh slipped to the sixth spot. The qualification of pistol ace Jitu Rai (579) for the final gave a hint of the recovery of the Asian Games gold medallist, Olympic finalist and World Championship silver medallist. While Saurabh missed progress by 0.2 point, Manu lost the chance to climb further than the third place after being tied with Neha. Rhythm beat Neha by 0.5 point for the top honour. She had done well to shoot 581 in qualification, the second best after Manu. In men’s trap, Asian Games silver medallist Lakshay Sheoran topped once again as he beat Prithviraj Tondaiman 43-40, after topping qualification with a commendable 122 out of 125.   The results:   Men: 10m air rifle: 1. Sarabjot Singh 242.6 (586); 2. Shahzar Rizvi 240.2 (572); 3. Amanpreet Singh 218.8 (580). Trap: 1. Lakshay Sheoran 43 (122); 2. Prithviraj Tondaiman 40 (118); 3.

17 January 2021||Karachi,||SA arrives in Pakistan after 14 years||The South African cricket team arrived here on Saturday to play two Tests and three T20Is on its first tour of Pakistan in 14 years. The team, led by wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock, was whisked away from the airport under State-head level security by the PCB.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||At the end of the chain||9 a.m.; January 16, 2021. Dr. T.R. John has reason to remember this date and time. The Chief of Medical Service, Aster Medcity, Kochi, was readying to oversee the first jab of the COVID-19 vaccine at the hospital and sensed the beginning of the end of a battle. An Indian Army veteran who served in Jammu & Kashmir for eight years before taking premature retirement, he says, “It felt like just before the launch of an assault on the enemy. This has been a battle after all.” For most of humanity, the fight against the novel coronavirus has also been a question of marking time. After scientists doubled up their efforts to find a solution, the world has waited with bated breath. Finally, as the weapon to tackle the virus began to roll out globally, and in India on Saturday, hope and relief, despite the scepticism, binds us all.  On the frontline  “A specialised duty; a service to the nation,” is how Kunal Agarwal, co-founder of Koolex Cold Chain, describes his role. On January 12, Agarwal stood at his depot in Pune  at 4 a.m. to supervise the despatch of cold chain trucks carrying Covishield (the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University, U.K., and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India) to the airport. “It was a proud moment for our organisation. Our fleet of 400 GPS-enabled trucks ferry highly sensitive medicines and vaccines across the country routinely, but this time was different.” Since the pandemic began, India has confirmed more than 10.3 million cases and over 1,50,000 deaths. The first phase of inoculation will immunise 30 crore individuals that comprise one crore health workers, two crore frontline workers, and 27 crore people above the age of 50 with medical comorbidities. Latha Raju, an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) worker, has been doing field work with palliative care for the last 10 years and was deputed to track 500 households in two divisions of Cochin Corporation during the pandemic. She reported 78 positive COVID-19 cases and four deaths from her area. “Our prayers have been answered. We have fought with courage. The vaccine brings hope,” says Latha. This is a line that is echoed by ambulance driver Yadhu Krishna. Admitting to being afraid in the initial stages, Yadhu, who worked with 11 COVID-19 First Line Treatment Centres in Kochi, says he will now work to dispel panic and fear among people.  Heart and mind  On the other side of the world, in the U.S., Dr. Suzana Alex John, Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Rheumatology Specialist at Emory University School of Medicine, felt a sense of awe and was “humbled and blessed at receiving the vaccine”. The doctor, who hails from Kochi and studied medicine at Puducherry, was among the first batch to be inoculated with the mRNA Pfizer vaccine. She describes the entire operation as “history in the making. I have been following the development of the vaccine. It is because of the dedicated hard work of researchers and scientists that we have it ready in record time. People worry about it being under tested, fast forwarded, but actually it has been in the making for nearly three decades. It is a robust vaccine,” says Dr. Suzana, sharing a picture of a smiling nurse giving her the jab. With the conclusion of hectic preparations and dry runs for the vaccination programme, Dr. M.G. Shivadas, Ernakulam District Nodal Office for COVID-19, is finally breathing easy. “We have done everything as per the government’s guidelines. There’s no anxiety, but there is lot of enthusiasm. This is for the sake of humanity,” says the doctor who wants grassroot-level frontline workers to be immunised first. As mass vaccination gets under way, “hope springs eternal in the human heart,” says Dr. Vasudevan, recollecting the small pox vaccine, which he used to take as a child. “That was medieval torture. This is just a jab on the upper arm. We have come a long way indeed,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/at-the-end-of-the-chain/article33591627.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||How to Squat?||A squat is the act of crouching — of folding the knees with feet flat on the ground, glutes almost down to the floor. A squat can be performed to different depths, ranging from the deep (where your glutes are below your knees) to shallow (where you bend knees only slightly). It can either be done with our body weight or with added weights like a Kettlebell or a barbell. “One can begin with the former and can move on to adding extra weights to increase the intensity. Doing three rounds of 15 squats each will work for a day. But it depends on the individual. It is always best to start it under supervision from a licensed fitness trainer,” says Reshma L., Centre Head of Pink Fitness, Coimbatore. The exercise targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and the glute muscles. “It not only strengthens the lower body but also helps burn calories, improves posture, and increases flexibility, mobility and balance,” she adds. To get these results, the right technique is crucial. “Wrong methods can put excess pressure on the joints, causing pain, even injury,” she explains. The amount of time required to get the technique right varies from person to person. “Our mobility, endurance and muscle strength are all different. Some people need only a week to perfect it, while others might need more time,” says Arvind Ashok, co-founder, The Quad, Chennai. While it is a safe exercise for everyone, people with back or knee issues and pregnant women are advised to do it only after consultation with a doctor.  Do it  Position feet shoulder width, at a 20 degree angle, knees in line with the toes. Keep your back straight. Squat down by bending your hips backwards while allowing your knees to bend forward, though they should not come more than a little over the toes. Distribute your weight through your entire body. Descend until the thighs are parallel to the floor. To come up, extend the knees and hips to straighten your legs. Use assistance for upper body support if necessary. “It can be a doorknob, a pole or a chair. This is helpful especially for the elderly,” says Arvind.  Do remember  Keep your hands either at the back of the head or extended in front. “This helps to open up the chest,” explains Arvind. Make sure that your heel is touching the floor through the entire process. Aravind suggests doing this exercise barefooted. “The best is to work on a flat surface. The heels of the shoes tend to be higher than the rest of the sole and so it won’t give a flat area to work out on,” he adds.   Split squat Stand with your hands on your hips, feet shoulder width apart. Position one foot forward and the other behind. Squat down by flexing the knee and hip of the front leg. Allow the heel of the rear foot to rise while its knee bends until it almost touches the floor. Return to the standing position by extending the hip and knee of the forward leg. Repeat and continue with the other leg. Single leg split squat Stand facing away from a raised platform like a bench, feet shoulder width apart. Extend one leg back and place it on the bench. Squat down by flexing the knee and hip of your front leg until the knee of your rear leg almost touches the floor. Return to the original standing position by extending the hip and knee of the forward leg and repeat. Continue with the other leg. Weighted front squat Stand with feet shoulder width apart. Hold a weight plate close to your chest with both hands. Squat down until thighs are parallel to the floor and ascend. Return to position and repeat.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||‘This is a wonderful time to work on black holes’||Parameswaran Ajith, 40, a Bengaluru-based astrophysicist who specialises in the study of detecting gravitational waves, was chosen as the first recipient of The World Academy of Sciences-Chinese Academy of Sciences (TWAS-CAS) Young Scientist award for Frontier Science. He talks about his prize, the excitement of black holes, and about how he chose to become a scientist. Excerpts:  The award citation says you have “...pioneered a method to model the expected gravitational-wave signals from colliding binary black holes.” In layman’s terms, could you explain the principle of this method? Is it the only method for detecting wave signals or is it part of an algorithm of detection? Detecting weak gravitational-wavesignals buried in the detector noise is a quintessential “needle in a haystack” problem. The best way to find such signals is to compare the data with theoretical models of the expected signals, using a technique called “matched filtering”. Indian scientists, led by Sanjeev Dhurandhar, have done pioneering work in adapting this technique to gravitational-wave data analysis. Calculating these theoretical signal models requires modelling their astrophysical source (for example, two black holes orbiting each other due to their gravity and finally colliding). This involves solving the “Einstein equations” (the equations of Einstein’s theory of gravity, the General Theory of Relativity) which are an extremely difficult set of equations to handle. There are approximation methods to solve these equations analytically. Contributions from Indian scientists such as Bala Iyer were seminal in this. Unfortunately, these methods break down as the black holes come close to each other during their final collision. Luckily, by around 2005, researchers managed to solve this “binary black-hole problem” using large supercomputers. The “phenomenological method” that we developed provides a simple way of marrying the analytical calculations with supercomputer simulations. This can be used to produce accurate models of the expected gravitational-wave signals. Indeed, this is not the only method for creating such theoretical models — the “effective-one body” framework developed by Alessandra Buonanno and Thibault Damour also offers a theoretically elegant way of achieving the same. How did you get into astrophysics and black holes? I grew up in rural Kerala; I don’t think I ever met a scientist before I went to college. However, almost everyone in my family was a teacher. There was also an active village library and a vital presence of people’s science organisations like the Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad. These must have instilled a culture of books. Also, the pressure of the (public) education system was not so large and one could still pursue one’s interests. I ended up in my career through a series of accidents. While I liked physics, I had other interests too. In college, I had almost made up my mind to study cinematography. It didn’t work out, and I ended up joining Mahatma Gandhi University for my master’s. There I had some wonderful teachers and peers who exposed me to the world of academic research. I was supposed to work on a summer project in another field, which didn’t work out. My teacher Prof. Indulekha then recommended my name to Prof. Dhurandhar, a doyen in the field of gravitational wave research in India. After this exposure, I guess I never seriously considered another career option! Is this the best time to be an astrophysicist, and how do you see your field evolving? My favourite quote on this is by Caltech’s Rana Adhikari: “When I was a student, my advisors used to tell me that this is the right time to work in this field. I tell this to my students too. But this time, I mean it.” Jokes apart, this is a fantastic time to work in astrophysics. Astronomical observations in the last two decades have uncovered major gaps in our understanding of the universe, such as the presence of the enigmatic “dark energy” that constitutes 70% of the energy budget of the universe. The age-old puzzle of “dark matter” remains unsolved. These are just two examples of the fundamental questions that modern astrophysics seeks to address. A wealth of upcoming observational data and sophisticated computer modelling has the potential to address these. Gravitational-wave observations will play a major role in this enterprise, along with electromagnetic and neutrino observations. I read that one of your post-doctoral advisers was Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who made a huge cultural impact as scientific consultant for the movieInterstellar. Have you worked alongside him? What was it like? Kip Thorne’s research group was a wonderful ecosystem, involving researchers from a variety of expertise and age groups. His group meetings were fun and intellectually stimulating. He would start by writing everyone’s names on the blackboard. My surname is difficult — but never once did he make a mistake! There were all kinds of rumours about “the movie Kip was making,” but he was quite good at keeping it to himself. I remember one of the earlier storylines involved LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) detecting gravitational waves from extra dimensions.  Since the 2016 detection of the colliding black holes, several other such mergers have been detected. How has this changed our ideas about black hole formation, or the history of the early universe? To start with, these observations provided the first direct evidence of binary black hole collisions. They have also uncovered a new population of “heavy” black holes. Over the last few decades, X-ray observations have identified several “small” black holes in our own galaxy — most of them weighing less than 10 times the mass of the Sun. However, most of the black holes detected are much more massive — about 30 to 100 solar masses. This was a big surprise to most astronomers. It is still not entirely clear how nature is producing these heavy black holes. Most astrophysicists believe they are produced by the ‘death’ (gravitational collapse) of really massive stars. But some cosmologists argue that these could be the much-speculated “primordial black holes” — black holes produced by the collapse of extremely dense regions in the early universe. If the latter is true, it would be a ground-breaking discovery. However, the jury is still out. We need many more observations to decide one way or the other.  We also had images of a real black hole broadcast globally in 2019. Do you think these have significantly heightened public interest in black holes? Are they drawing in more students, Ph.Ds, in India for research? Oh, yes! Black holes have always captured the public imagination; but the breakthroughs by LIGO and the Event Horizon Telescope have definitely enhanced this. So did the recent Nobel prize. Apart from this general excitement, this is actually a wonderful time to work on black holes. Black holes have come out of their historical isolation, as objects of only mathematical interest, and are now taking centre stage in modern astrophysics. Finally, theoretical calculations, astronomical observations and supercomputer simulations are going hand-in hand in the exploration of black holes. Young students are surprisingly perceptive of these opportunities. In India, the upcoming LIGO-India project has added to this excitement.    How did you decide to set up a lab in India? Are there advantages and disadvantages to working here? Returning to India was a personal preference. Although I love to travel, I’ve never felt I “belonged” anywhere abroad. Working in India has its disadvantages — the “red-tapism,” for instance. The whole bureaucratic system is designed to promote mediocrity. However, it also presents its share of opportunities. Since we are a developing society with high aspirations, given the right support, one is able to be part of change — sometimes even be part of its driving force.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The rainbow brew||Madhurjya Gogoi would have been selling umbrellas or insurance policies today, had it not been for an accident in the kitchen. Some mushroom paste fell out of the blender into a bin of tea leaves on the counter and dried in it. And so was concocted a pale and delectable blend of green tea and oyster mushroom. “I would have thrown the mix away but my father, the experimental optimist, decided to try it out,” says Gogoi, who now runs Assam Teehaus, which produces handmade tea “of all kinds” sourced on demand from the family garden. Gogoi Senior believed the accidental mix was no more extreme than the bitter green brew he had been drinking after undergoing treatment for colon cancer in 1997. He was also aware of the health benefits of the tea and mushrooms that grew in his backyard in Dabohibil village in Assam’s Charaideo district. “We got a creamy broth from the mushroom-infused tea. It tasted pretty cool, without the bitterness of green tea,” says Gogoi. In 2006, he acquired an exporting license and gave some samples to the Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship in Guwahati. Both the mushroom blend and his handmade green tea found Gogoi a place in the contingent that the institute took to Japan in 2007. A month later, he received a call from a Japanese buyer who said he liked his tea and wanted him to supply 60 kilos. Gogoi could hardly manage 6 kilos, but even more challenging was the added caveat: the tea had to be organic. “We knew nothing about organic farming, just as my father did not know tea could be in colours other than laal (red)  or ochre gaakhir cha (milk tea) until his doctor in Vellore prescribed green tea. The inability to accept the order was a setback that made me take up a job,” Gogoi says. In 2014 Gogoi travelled to Europe to study marketing. The handmade green and orthodox teas he took along fuelled his specialty tea dream. A sommelier course in China two years later and a visit to Taiwan, where he bought some specialised machines, also spurred him on. Today, Gogoi and his wife Puspanjali work in the garden during the day and at the home factory at night to churn out an array of specialty teas. “Green, yellow, golden, white, oolong, orthodox — we make them all but only on order. We learnt early that given our small garden, we cannot supply to the general market, which demands the cheap granular black tea,” says Gogoi.  Canadian hand  For over a century since 1837, when the first plantation was established in eastern Assam’s Chabua region, tea companies have sworn by the orthodox (withered, rolled and dried) tea. This was before most estates switched to the granular crush, tear and curl or CTC tea in the 1960s as mass production became the byword. In the 1950s, an amendment to the Tea Marketing (Control) Order paved the way for small farmers to take up tea cultivation. Assam today has some 1.72 lakh small tea growers, who the Tea Board of India defines as persons with tea cultivation of up to 25 acres. Spread across 89,948 hectares, these small tea gardens produced 1,023.23 million kilos of green tea leaves in 2019, which was 51.04% of Assam’s tea output that year. “The main objective of the small farmers was to sell green leaves to big tea estates and bought-leaf factories. So they chose high-yielding plants and whatever was available in nearby estates. Tocklai (Tea Research Association in eastern Assam’s Jorhat) develops clones for the industry that vary in terms of yield, flavour, different soil conditions and pest attack,” said Upamanyu Borkakoty of The Tea Leaf Theory , a research-based tea sourcing platform for small organic farmers. A series of setbacks since the 1990s affected Assam’s tea industry, which relied heavily on mass-produced CTC tea. Apart from extortions by extremist groups, the estates suffered due to chemical content in their consignments. A few estates such as Halmari bucked the trend by setting plucking standards — 11 kilos of two-leaves-and-a-bud per day per person as opposed to the normal 21 kilos per day — to ensure quality, flavour and colour. Some small tea farmers saw in the downturn a message: return to what Assam tea started with — a specialty beverage — or perish. Two decades ago, they found a mentor in the award-winning Canadian farm specialist Peggy Carswell, who transformed the lives of many tea farmers by inspiring them to use organic and sustainable farming techniques. One of the beneficiaries is Gobin Hazarika, whose plantation in Lakhimpur district became the first organic small tea garden to celebrate its silver jubilee last year. “Peggy catalysed the organic small tea movement that began specialising in hand-crafted green and orthodox black teas. We learnt that quality, colour and flavour of tea matters more than the volume of production,” says Hazarika. “Specialty tea, in fact, has been driving the small tea growers, but there’s a long way to go,” says Borkakoty, whose project has yielded Truedips, a patent-pending technology that compresses whole leaves that unfurl to their original shape when dipped in boiling water. Hue and chai Along with the organic base, tea growers have added colour to keep their hold on the specialty tea market. Some others upgraded to boutique gardens with special care for bushes, with an eye on the type of tea to be produced. And as the popularity of tea as a health drink rose, boutique blenders began offering a range of regular and experimental blends. One of the first off the block was Rakhi Dutta Saikia, who owns a 99-hectare organic tea garden in Golaghat district. In 2017, she added a new colour, yellow, to Assam’s tea repository. “I rummaged through Chinese literature to produce the yellow tea, one of the rarest, highly-prized brews also known as royal tea because more than 1,000 years ago only the royalty of the Chinese Tang dynasty drank it,” she says. Designer concoctions Before her, some planters went back to the 10th-century Song dynasty in China to churn out white tea made from the buds of the tea plant. White tea yields a pale yellow colour when brewed. Donyi Polo Tea Estate in Arunachal Pradesh also began producing yellow tea and followed it up with purple tea, known better as a Kenyan variety. In October 2018, a small consignment of purple tea — rich in the anthocyanins that lend blueberries their purplish colour — sold for Rs. 24,501 a kilo at the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre. “The purple tea plants were found in a forested area in the East Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh a few years ago. It is mild and there is no astringency. Around 10,000 purple tea leaves are needed to make a kilo of purple tea,” says the estate’s senior manager Manoj Kumar. Blenders took specialty teas to the next level with designer concoctions. Among the wackiest is Guwahati-based Ranjit Baruah’s Aromica Tea, which has come up with 32 packaged blends and twice as many variations served at Just Tea, a tea cafe in Guwahati. “I started off with five blends from the regular ones such as green tea with peppermint and spearmint and lemongrass ginger green tea. Specialties such as Blue Tea and Blooming Tea were later added,” he says. Blue Tea, yielding a blue beverage, is a blend of organic green tea, butterfly pea flower and some Indian herbs and spices. Blooming Tea — a ball of white tea, jasmine, lily and globe amaranth — lifts the mood with a beautiful floral display in hot water, says Baruah. With the demand for tea as an immunity booster increasing post-pandemic, blenders have also been catering to a new craze for designer or customised teas, where tea lovers set their own rules for a cup according to the taste, aroma and colour they want. “Designer tea is customised to the customer’s palate,” says Baruah. One such is the Chocolate Orange Tea, a blend of orthodox golden-tipped leaves, orange peels, chocolate chips and rose. “Designer teas will each have a customised label and will be exclusive to one client,” he says. Indeed, these exotic teas may well become the future of the brew that started life as the common chai.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||America’s role in the world||“The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults,” wrote the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville in the mid-19th century, in words that have acquired a new resonance this month after the brazen assault on the Capitol, the seat of American power. What are the principles that have guided America’s foreign policy over the last two centuries, including its phases of intervention and isolation? America in the World , Robert Zoellick’s account of U.S. foreign policy, sets out to answer this question. The book is ambitious in scope. It sets out to tell the story of American diplomacy over two hundred years, from the birth of the republic, when Benjamin Franklin was sent as envoy to establish relations with France and England, to the presidency of George H.W. Bush and the First Gulf War. Being pragmatist Zoellick begins with an observation by Henry Kissinger that “America is the only country where being called ‘a realist’ is viewed as a criticism.” As an alternative to Kissinger’s dark ‘realism’, Zoellick invokes William James and John Dewey to conceptualise what he describes as “a distinctive American philosophy” of pragmatism: “Pragmatists recognize the powerful roles of chance and contingency, and they appreciate how processes shape practical choices. They account for the dynamism of the world and pluralist perspectives. Pragmatic American philosophers and statesmen share an optimistic belief in progress.” The five Zoellick argues that five themes, in his view, have underpinned U.S. diplomacy: the centrality of the United States in the North American continent; the interrelationship of trade, innovation, technology, and foreign policy; the role of stable international alliances; the support of the American public and Congress; and finally, but not the least, America’s belief in itself and its exceptionalism, as an ongoing experiment in democracy. Zoellick’s very broad umbrella of pragmatism includes figures such as Thomas Jefferson, Woodrow Wilson, and Richard Nixon. He also writes about arbitration and international law, for which Elihu Root was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; about Cordell Hull’s trade diplomacy and reciprocal trade agreements; and about Vannevar Bush’s work on science, innovation and technology in foreign policy. What makes the book interesting is the rich detail. It begins with Benjamin Franklin’s momentous visit to France to sign two treaties that would recognise the new republic of the United States. Franklin wore “a worn blue coat of Manchester velvet” to the meeting with the French foreign minister. It was the same suit that the “first diplomat” of the United States had worn when he had been humiliated four years earlier by the Privy Council in Britain. “Diplomacy includes settling scores,” notes Zoellick. In 1861, during domestic debates on slavery, there was friction between Spain and the Dominicans. When Secretary of State William Henry Seward wanted to engage, Abraham Lincoln told him a story. A preacher warns his parishioner about two roads before him: one which goes “straight to hell”, and the other which goes “right to damnation”. The poor man replies that in that case, “I shall go through the woods.” Lincoln told Seward that with a domestic crisis on their hands, this was not the time for them to take on further challenges. Rather, they would “take to the woods” and stay neutral.    War and peace In the course of Theodore Roosevelt’s long mediation between Japan and Russia over Manchuria, Roosevelt goes off on a six-week hunting trip at one point, writing in exasperation: “The Czar is a preposterous little creature as the absolute autocrat of 150,000,000 people. He has been unable to make war, and he is now unable to make peace.” A long chapter on Woodrow Wilson, the first President elected from the American South after the Civil War, reflects on his 1917 call for going to war: “The world must be made safe for democracy.” The sentence was carefully phrased in the passive voice. Who would have to ‘make’ the world safe, and how would they do it? “Wilson’s eight-word explanation would reverberate across American diplomacy for the next century, and I expect for even longer,” notes Zoellick. Nevertheless, rather than a comprehensive history, the book is a set of glimpses and perspectives of various phases of American foreign policy. Having worked as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Trade Representative, and President of the World Bank, Zoellick stresses the importance of maintaining alliances, rather than transactional diplomacy for one-off gains. Pragmatically, he chooses not to address certain questions, such as why some moments (and some parts of the world) have merited the rhetoric of idealism, while others have been given a hard dose of realism.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||From page to pan||I was in my early 20s when I bade a tearful goodbye to my parents in Hyderabad and took the long train journey to Lucknow. Straight out of college, I did not have the wherewithal to walk into ‘my man’s heart through his stomach,’ particularly when I found my ‘man’ swearing by his mother’s cooking! My mother-in-law’s cooking prowess was known to twitch many a nose and tingle many a palate. She could have patented her brand of rasam. Being thrust into the role of her assistant, I was like one of those headless chickens running from grating board to grinding unit. At the end of any meal, I felt I had been wrung dry in the washing machine. To make matters worse, our home always had hungry souls traipsing in, as my mother-in-law was ever ready to feed anyone and everyone who came by. Those were the days where it was not uncommon to hear the snarky, ‘Is this what your mother taught you?’ line. To avoid that, I would find out the menu planned for the following day, and then I would stealthily consult the grand old lady who had travelled with me, neatly packed in my suitcase. S. Meenakshi Ammal spoke to me, as she has to countless others across generations, from the pages of that most unimaginatively titled book, Samaithu Paar or Cook and See. She helped me stay one step ahead of my mother-in-law. I had the coconut grated and ready before the coriander seeds and bengal gram dal could be roasted to the reddish hue for the famous arachuvitta sambar. Soon, I was gratified to hear my mother-in-law proudly announce that she and I made a great team. Remarkable foresight When I moved to Indonesia, old Meenakshi Ammal even provided the monthly grocery list for my family of four, and considering Indian groceries were supplied only twice a month, this was a great boon. The remarkable woman had the foresight to include recipes that encompassed everything from brewing basic coffee decoction to complex pickle-making. Even young men carried the book when they went abroad to help them cook for the first time in their lives. More than 30 years on, I still consult it, despite the innumerable online platforms. Meenakshi Ammal’s mulagai podi is unsurpassed. She never fails to let me know what I should be making for festivals like Krishna Janmashtami and Diwali. The best part of the book are her handy tips. For example, she will tell you that polis can be fried the previous day and stored in an airtight container. Or if you are making Karthigai pori urundai (beaten rice balls), drop a bit of jaggery syrup into water; if it can be rolled into a ball, the syrup is ready. Festive dish Last month, Thiruvathirai (the day to remember Nataraja) came around and I looked forward to making the special kali. Nothing supports and enhances this mildly sweet dish made of broken rice and pulses as the ezhukari kuzhambu (stew of seven vegetables). Of course, seven is the minimum number of vegetables, but depending on availability, 11 or 13 (only odd numbers) can be thrown in. And Meenakshi Ammal had it all. From which veggies had to be scraped or cut or cooked in jackets or peeled, to which needed to be sautéed before adding. How the cut vegetables were to be cooked in tamarind water. And the quantity of spices to be roasted, and just when the cooked dal had to be added to bring it all together. A dash of seasoning completed the dish. Her language and the conversational tone make it sound as if my mother were standing at my shoulder giving me instructions as I cook. She repeats instructions, just like my mother. She caters to slow learners with footnotes at the end of certain recipes. My turmeric-stained, dog-eared copy carries with it the flavours of my kitchen. This old lady has been witness to the trials and discoveries I made during my journey from nervous young bride to seasoned cook. It’s little wonder that I haven’t replaced her with any of the snazzy recipes so readily available online. Needless to add, my kali and ezhukari did not go wrong this year either. The independent writer is based in Bengaluru.    Even young men carried the book when they went abroad to help them cook for the first time in their lives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/from-page-to-pan/article33591903.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||See no evil||Pakistani writer Moni Mohsin’s 2008 novel, The Diary of a Social Butterfly , which chronicled the musings of a society airhead whose life revolves around shopping, gossip and partying, was a fun read. In The Impeccable Integrity of Ruby R. , her latest offering, Mohsin attempts a serious subject — the venality of politics in Pakistan and a young girl’s hopes of being part of the change promised by a charismatic new leader. Sadly, Mohsin stumbles right from the word go and the book never manages to pick itself up from its wafer-thin plot and a protagonist who, although touted as bright and upright, comes across as equal parts unintelligent and morally compromised. Outraged? Nope Ruby Rauf is a studious, 23-year-old scholarship student in London, entirely focused on getting her degree in business and media, and finding a good job to pull herself and her mother out of the financial hardship they have fallen into after her father’s death. When she attends a speech by Saif Haq — a former moviestar turned politician who has set up a party called Integrity — she is mesmerised by his vision of a corruption-free Pakistan. Quite forgetting her initial scepticism about him, and her belief that his shot at political power is nothing but an ageing celebrity’s need to stay in the limelight, she begins to regard Haq as a saviour, the man who can clean up Pakistan’s politics and solve the country’s myriad problems. Soon after, Haq offers her a job as his party’s social media spearhead. And Ruby, after some hesitation, abandons her life plan, gives up her studies in London, and returns to Lahore to take up the offer, convinced that she will be part of the lofty enterprise of rebuilding Pakistan under the leadership of Saif Haq. Now, it’s not unusual for a young person to come under the spell of a magnetic, messianic leader. The problem is that from the outset, Mohsin portrays Saif Haq as an A-list douchebag — entitled, ill-mannered, amoral and sexist. Indeed, the various pointers to his douchebaggery are so liberally and insistently strewn that you wonder if the author’s express purpose is to present Ruby (who is also supposed to be a feminist) as a singularly dense young woman. Why else would she not wise up to Saif Haq’s obvious lack of, er, integrity? Ruby finds out that her dear leader is happy to let his party be funded by human traffickers and other big-wig criminals. Does that bring on disillusionment? Does that outrage her so-called values of probity? Nope. On the contrary, she throws herself into the job of becoming the party’s social media whiz and soon turns Haq into a huge phenomenon online. Meme queen While at it, she joyfully lets the 60-something Haq seduce her. To prep herself for the much-anticipated event, she even gets herself a bikini wax. As their hurried trysts on the office sofa continue, the reader is treated to ample evidence of Haq’s debauchery and the fact that when he is not talking about saving the poor, he is busy cavorting with his cronies and enjoying his life of wealth, privilege and vice. But Ruby remains in her see-no-evil mode. She lets Haq fool her with his insincere words and revels in her position as a prized member of his party. She is the “meme queen”, the ruthless troll army mobiliser who goes after anyone who dares criticise Haq. Her corruption troubles her on occasion, but she doesn’t let that deflect her from the higher purpose of burnishing and defending the Saif Haq brand. When a friend asks if the youthful Haq dyes his chest hair, she hotly denies the vile speculation — no doubt because she has first-hand knowledge owing to her close encounters with his body hair. Sudden pivots Mohsin is in her element when she narrates high-society chit chat — rich, glossy women gossiping about other rich, glossy women who’ve had “work done” on their faces, or exchanging notes on the bottled water they use to wash their hair. Not Evian, one admits ruefully, “local only”. The same acuity and observation are missing, however, when Mohsin dwells on the political milieu in which her story is set. A coarse trafficker here, a wheeler-dealer there are about all that she musters by way of fleshing out the underbelly of politics in Pakistan. (If Haq’s character was inspired by a current political leader of that country, Mohsin muffs it by making him too one-dimensional to be of interest.) Besides, many of the characters undergo sudden, inexplicable pivots, which simply do not ring true. Nor does the belated attempt to cast Ruby’s affair with her boss as some sort of #MeToo event. As for Ruby, her long-lost integrity comes alive after Saif Haq gets married to a glamorous socialite. Clearly, the path to righteousness opens up when one is ditched by a lover.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Sorry I missed your call||December 1, 2020, 11.05:Hey, sorry I missed your call. Had dozed off while waiting for an attachment to download. Will call you soon.  Dec 1, 23.59 : Very busy day. Couldn’t find an appropriate time window to call you. Speak now?  Dec 2, 00.05 : Just tried your number, but someone rudely cut my call mid-ring. I know it couldn’t have been you because you are not a rude human being. It couldn’t have been your partner either, because you are unmarried, and to the best of my knowledge, you don’t have a girlfriend and will never have one. Anyway, no offence taken! Guess the mystery will be solved when we speak! Call at 10?  Dec 2, 10.05 : Sorry I missed your call again. We seem to be missing each other a lot (pun intended)!! Getting into another Zoom call now, will call at six if that’s okay with you.  Dec 5, 03.05 : Hey, just finished this horror film, One Missed Call — not the silly English remake but the original Japanese version directed by Takashi Miike. It’s brilliant. You shouldn’t miss it for anything — not even to take my call, haha. Anyway, while watching it I remembered that I’m supposed to call you back, and though 3 a.m. is a bit early, I thought, who knows — in case you have insomnia you might be grateful to have someone to talk to! But your phone kept ringing and ringing. My learned guess is you were asleep. No problemo! Feel free to call any time tomorrow evening between 5.55 and 5.57.  Dec 6, 17.58 : Sorry couldn’t take your call. Just remembered I have an important video-conference at 6 p.m. with the Chairman of the Managing Committee and the President of the Advisory Council which will also be attended by the Director-General of the Directorate General. Let me call you first thing after the meeting ends.  Dec 8, 14.10 : Hey, sorry I missed your call. Didn’t hear the phone ring as I was in a crowded place. Hard to believe, I know. It’s pandemic time and still we Indians behave like it’s party time, forming big-big crowds to facilitate mobility for the corona community. Call in an hour? Should be in a quiet place by then.  Dec 8, 19.50 : Hey, sorry I missed your call. Kattabomman had put it on silent, the little rascal. Yours was the first of 27 missed calls! I’m going to start returning these calls in reverse chronological order. So yours will be the last but not the least number I’ll be calling. Speak soon!  Dec 20, 11.45 : By now you must be thinking I’m trying to avoid you — not at all. Please understand: it’s not about you, it’s about me. I’m trying to give myself some space, you know? I don’t think I’m ready to face the high stress of a telephonic conversation with a live human being in real time, with no rehearsal, no scope for editing or revising what I say, and no algorithmic vetting of what I hear. So, give me a few days to prepare. Will call soon.  Dec 25, 10.40 : Still preparing. Merry Christmas!  Dec 31, 23.59: Many, many Happy New Years of the Day!  Jan 1, 00.02 : Terribly sorry that cutting your call is the first thing I did in 2021. In the middle of a wild (but socially distanced) New Year’s party. Let’s speak in the morning.  Jan 1, 14.06 : Sorry I missed your call. Was sleeping off a horrible hangover. Definitely calling you this year.  Jan 9, 10.45 : Apologies for missing your call again this morning. My uncle, once he starts talking, doesn’t stop. I am not saying you’re my uncle, but that’s the telephonic trauma I’m coming from. If you wanted to keep talking, and I wanted to end the call, I wouldn’t be able to. My chronic inability to end the call, and the reverse — my chronic inability to sense it when the other person wants to end the call, thereby making me seem clingy, and lose respect in their eyes, and the disastrous social fallout of such a misperception fills me with so much dread and anxiety that I keep postponing the inevitable — that is, make the inevitable evitable, as it were.  Jan. 12, 10.00 : Hey, sorry to hear that you’ve contracted COVID and may not survive. I’m given to understand that your oxygen levels are dipping quicker than our country’s collective IQ. I wish you’d worn masks, or at least waited for the vaccine — you could have then participated in the clinical trial, and died happy in the knowledge that you’ve made your own modest contribution to making India Atmanirbhar in corona vaccine.  Jan 13, 11.00 : Hey, I know this makes you sound like an airline, but I’m really sorry I missed your last and final call. You know, my dear amigo, that I will miss you as much as I missed your calls. My heartiest condolences to your family. Shall speak to them soon.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The past is a strange country||At first glance, Katayun Saklat is just another kindly, elderly lady with a thatch of grey hair. But she is much more than that. She is one of the most accomplished designers of stained glass in India, with her work included in several public and private collections. She is also a painter, working chiefly with oil and watercolour. At 83, Saklat is trying her hand at a new medium, creating decorative steel panels using glass, paint, even shells. An exhibition of her work was held recently at Debovasha, a gallery-cum-publishing house in Kolkata. Saklat’s paintings are deceptively simple, seemingly dipped in sweet nostalgia. They are gorgeously coloured — as one would expect from a stained glass designer — and often feature dreams, flowers, and Parsis, whom she calls the “endangered species”. Saklat is Parsi herself, with her father from Kashmir and mother from Lahore. They moved to Kolkata in 1928 and Saklat was born 10 years later. Their yellow-and-green painted house in Grant Lane in central Kolkata with its jalousied windows and terrace appears in Saklat’s early works. Phantom faces Even when Saklat paints her family, she catches them in elaborate formal wear, as if they were in an old-fashioned studio, holding their breath, waiting for the photographer’s signal to relax. In what seems to be a family group portrait, there are numinous ladies in gauzy saris and young men in dark blue jackets and caps — they could well be out of a Byzantine painting. The babes in arms here are anything but cute, more like phantom presences suspended in time. Time is a silent presence in her painting of an elderly woman captured from three different angles. Her wrinkled face is uncannily vacant as if she is caged in a world of her own from where there is no escape. Is she losing her memory, her sense of self? Her hands fumble, her eyes are unable to grasp what she is trying to unravel. The striking counterpoint is the floating visage of a younger woman, her dark, glowing eyes curious and penetrating. Trapped in memory Even when Saklat paints her parents one cannot miss the wry humour. In one of her paintings Mummy is very much the introverted young bride (“Mummy’s only friends were her cousins. She always wanted me to stay home,” says Saklat) while Daddy is a typical moustachioed paterfamilias. They are isolated, hemmed in by a barbed wire fence. Are they too trapped in the no-man’s land of memory? Hovering mid-air, right above Daddy’s head, is a sewing machine, a reference to her father’s first job as a Singer sewing machine salesman, which brought him to Kolkata. Design is what matters the most to Saklat, in art and life. “Another word for nature is design. Arteries, veins — everything is designed so beautifully,” says Saklat sitting in her living room stacked with paintings. She started drawing from age four, making dress designs with “so many additions to the same dress that it was not humanly possible to tailor them.” “I over-egged the pudding,” she chuckles. Later, when she started working in a toy and hobby shop, she designed children’s clothes. In 1957-58, Saklat briefly joined the J.J. School of Art in Mumbai, didn’t like it there, and moved to Indian College of Arts and Draftsmanship in Kolkata eventually. There she met artist Arun Bose, whom she describes as a “wonderful teacher and good human being.” Saklat shared her studio in the Grant Lane house with her classmate Bikash Bhattacharjee and other artists for many years. Glowing windows When Saklat was in London in 1973, she trained at the studio of Patrick Reyntiens, one of Europe’s leading stained glass artists, for a year. Saklat recalls some of the memorable stained glass panels she has created over the years — she says the most exciting design was for a toothbrush factory in Baroda that featured giant toothbrushes scattered all over. She has also done a dozen stained glass panels and lunettes for Kolkata’s only Parsi fire temple in Metcalfe Street. The largest piece is a glowing ovoid with Zarathustra in the middle surrounded by the Amesha Spentas , the divine entities. Saklat opened Gallery Katayun at her current residence in Auckland Square, Kolkata, in 1989, and hopes to turn it into a museum one day. Her only regret is that her clients commission her to do only figurative or pretty stained glass works. She would love to raise a toast to abstract design. The writer focuses on Kolkata’s vanishing heritage and culture.  Design is what matters the most to Saklat, in art and life. “Another word for nature is design. Arteries, veins — everything is designed so beautifully,” she says||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-past-is-a-strange-country/article33591968.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The learned emperor||Babur’s memoir did not have a name but is referred to as Baburnama or Tuzuk-e-Baburi . It is the first autobiography from the subcontinent and one of the first in the world. Babur came from two different cultures, of which one was literate and aspired to high culture. This was his father’s ancestral family, which was Timurid. His mother came from the nomadic Mongols, who weren’t literate. Babur describes his maternal uncles in his memoir. The Timurids had a tradition of poetry, hawking, music, and, of course, war. Babur was from a family of minor nobles who had inherited the governorship of Ferghana. His autobiography begins with a description of the geography and tells us that his father, Umar Shaikh Mirza, died in an accident when he was 39 and Babur 12. The young Babur struggled to hold on to his inheritance, losing several battles, including one in Ferghana, which he had to give up to the victor. Babur describes these decades of his life in an unemotional and direct way: he hardly valorises his own achievements. Like the great Caesar, whose books on his wars in Gaul and against Pompey may as well have been written by a non-partisan observer, Babur has the ability to distance himself from his life. Keen naturalist Babur’s life turns when he is found to be the only living heir to the throne of Kabul. He takes it and turns his eyes to India. For 20 years, he campaigns against India, being held back at the borders each time. Then, as we know, he defeated the Lodi dynasty (introducing firearms to the subcontinent for the first time) and captured north India in 1526 after a decisive battle at Panipat. Babur died five years later, spending much of this time travelling across India and writing his memoir in the afternoons. These paragraphs show how much of a keen naturalist he was. “The elephant, which the Hindustanis call hathi , is one of the wild animals peculiar to Hindustan. It inhabits the western borders of the Kalpi country... the elephant is an immense animal and very sagacious. If people speak to it, it understands. If they command anything from it, it does it. Its value is according to its size — the larger it is, the higher the price. On some islands an elephant is rumoured to be as tall as 20 or 30 feet, but here it is not more than 10 feet. It eats and drinks entirely with its trunk. If it loses the trunk, it cannot live. It has two great teeth (tusks) in its upper jaw, one on each side of the trunk. By setting these against trees and walls, it is able to bring them down; with these it fights and does whatever hard tasks fall to it. These teeth are called ivory and are highly valued by Hindustanis.’ ‘Like a goat, the elephant has no skin hair. It is relied on to accompany every troop of their armies. It crosses rivers with great ease, carrying a mass of baggage, and three or four can drag without trouble a special piece of artillery that takes four or five hundred men to haul. But its stomach is large. One elephant eats as much as a dozen camels. Elegant and clean Babur’s book was not freely available till a British amateur linguist named Annette Susannah Beveridge translated it. She taught herself the particular version of Turkish that Babur wrote in (later Mughals wrote in Farsi) and published it in four volumes from 1912 to 1922. At the time of the first British census a century and a quarter ago, India was 4% literate. Most Indians even today don’t have four generations of literacy: in fact, the proportion of those of us who can claim to have had great-grandparents who could write is tiny. Babur came from a tradition that already had centuries of literacy. His is elegant and clean writing of the sort that one would expect from a very literate and sensitive person. Babur’s daughter, Gulbadan Begum, sister of Humayun and aunt of Akbar, also wrote a lovely memoir in which she describes her father’s attention to detail which he passed on to his family. These two works, along with Jahangir’s autobiography, are some of the best material available on the Mughals. It’s a shame that these books are not taught in India’s schools today.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The kitchen’s calling||It is the season of black carrots — and a refreshing drink called kanji . Prepared with these antioxidant-rich carrots and spices, the velvety, reddish drink helps us battle the cold in North India. Chilled to the bone in a long cold spell, I had been thinking of kanji when a book arrived at my doorstep with an ode to the drink. There was no kanji at home, so I had to make do with an appetising description of it in a story called A Brief History of the Carrot by Rosie Dastgir, included in the Claire Chambers-edited anthology, Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia . “He poured out two glasses that glowed in the afternoon light. Room temperature, as the aunt’s recipe specified. The taste of it was sour and pungent and strangely restorative, though not exactly as he remembered,” it goes. “Was some vital ingredient missing?” Where’s the story? Chambers writes that South Asian kitchens are the “engines of an entire culture”. The volume seeks to capture this essence through essays and short stories. “The picture that we get of Muslim South Asian food is extremely eclectic, taking in everything from taco parties to lotus root slow-cooked in yoghurt, and from khichri to barfi,” the York University professor says in a recent interview. The collection is quite mouth-watering, especially since each chapter ends with a recipe. The works of fiction, however, left me a bit puzzled. These are nice food pieces, no doubt, but are they stories? Take, for instance, Jackfruit with Tamarind by Mahruba T. Mowtushi and Mafruha Mohua. The short story is peppered with aunty this and uncle that — interesting characters, all, but each of them making only brief appearances. I would have liked to know more about them, especially about Manwara aunty, for I enjoyed the comparison between her fish curry and Amma’s. “Amma is fussy when it comes to preparing a fish. It has to be cleaned numerous times... She then smears the pieces with turmeric and salt and lightly fries them — for a minute or two — in mustard oil. Amma has a fervid dislike of people who skip this process. Macher jhol should have a light, refreshing taste and so spices are added sparingly,” the authors write, adding, “Amma always complained of Manwara aunty’s macher jhol, which contained such inordinate quantities of vegetables and an odd assortment of greens that eating it was like walking through a virgin jungle with a machete in hand!” It is always fun to read about food, but the problem is that this isn’t really a story. It works well as an essay, and is eminently readable, with little descriptions of dishes after every paragraph or two. But a story needs a beginning, middle and end, and this had none. Stomach rumbling  The Hairy Curryby Asiya Zahoor does have a twist in the end. The story is about young Gulla, a Kashmiri boy who has moved to Srinagar and is working in Bibiji’s kitchen. The description of a lotus-stem dish is invigorating. “The velvety white curry was first to touch his palate. The softness and tangy taste was a delight. Each of the spices had given their essence fully to the curry. Its starchy texture, carrying the spices that complemented each other, was delectable. The lotus stems were cooked properly yet retained a certain crunchiness.” But Gulla is troubled: there’s hair in the curry — a lot of it! I was drawn more to the non-fiction part, and particularly enjoyed Rana Safvi’s piece (‘Qissa Qorma aur Qalia’), in which she recounts food memories and practices of Lucknow. I relished the conversation between two uncles-in-law where they complain (in chaste Urdu) about digestive problems, which persist although they have been following their doctors’ advice and eating “vegetarian khichri”. It transpires that the cook has been adding large amounts of dried fruit and meat to the dish. The problem with a book like this is that it sends you straight to the kitchen. I certainly felt like cooking khichri after reading Farah Yameen’s well-written story about a child and her troubled phua . “One does not serve khichri without mash and chutney to someone who is loved,” Yameen writes. Or without papad or pickle, in my neck of the woods. Shows that food, really, has no religion. The reviewer is a food columnist.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||The making of an entrepreneur and a philanthropist||The story of a person can be inspiring. The authors have chosen their subject well, for, everyone knows of Azim Premji, but few truly know what makes the man. A book about such a person, if well-written, may possibly inspire the reader into action. In this case, soon after you read the book, it’s difficult not to look up the Azim Premji Foundation website, to see if it had any volunteering opportunities, even if you have done nothing like it before! In chronicling any life, it is easy to get mired down with mind-numbing detail that comes your way if you are sifting through 50-odd years’ worth of the protagonist’s hits and misses. The authors have done well to stick to the most interesting parts of Premji’s life. Two things stand out across events and across time: his integrity and a penchant for frugality. Zest for austerity His insistence on paying for personal calls made on his office phone is legendary. His friends know of his love for cars but also about his unwillingness to spend fanciful amounts on one. He once wanted to buy a Fiat that was registered in Wipro’s name. He got the finance department involved in the discussion as he wanted to play by the rules and pay for the purchase. But with depreciation, the car’s value was zero to the company. The transaction did not go through. At one point, his friends were agog with excitement at his purchase of a Mercedes, but it was... hold your breath... a second-hand one! At another time, when his team was preparing to welcome clients on a visit to headquarters, and took Premji over the arrangements that included meals from a five-star hotel, he quipped, “If our cafeteria is good enough for our employees, it should be good enough for clients too!” It’s probably the same zest for austerity that had him pleased while on a U.S. visit, when two of his senior-most executives bought lunch for the three of them at a Burger King outlet for less than $7.50! And, this was a man who didn’t bat an eyelid when an employee of the vegetable oils business lost Rs. 25 lakh in a year in a trading position. A long journey The book chronicles the journey of Wipro from the time the Premjis put down roots in Mumbai. It throws light on the man’s spirit of entrepreneurship, as the company cautiously experimented with opportunities — expanding from vegetable oils to engineering products, computer hardware, tech services and consumer care and lighting. It also does not shy away from some of Wipro’s missteps such as the investment in financial services, a business which withered away despite the group’s entry into the space after much thought and preparation. His management style While doing justice to the man’s talent for perseverance, the authors have touched upon his management style that many say cramped some CEOs under his chairmanship. His taking over as CEO in 2005 after the abrupt exit of Vivek Paul, said to have been primed for the post, or his decision to have a joint CEO structure soon after, at a time when competitors were blazing ahead, had raised eyebrows in the world of IT services at the time. The reader may get the sense that the authors occasionally sound deferential when talking about the man or his family. But, it’s difficult not to be overawed by someone who has never sold a single share in his company but who chose to give away $21 billion worth of wealth to his foundation, leaving his two sons with shares valued at about Rs. 65 crore. How can one give away so much wealth and still, on the morning the news about the latest transfer to the foundation breaks, irritably ask an employee — who speaks of congratulatory messages overwhelming social media — “What’s all the fuss about?” ?

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Easy like Sunday morning||1On January 17, 1929, this cartoon character created by E.C. Segar made his first appearance in the Thimble Theatre comic strip. The protagonist has a characteristic ball-shaped biceps with which he dispatches the bad guys. In real life when a tendon in your biceps muscle tears, the muscle can bunch up and form a large, painful ball on your upper arm. This bulge is referred to by the name of the cartoon character. Who is this popular character who gets his strength from eating a leafy vegetable? 2Patients who have this syndrome suffer from mouth and lip inflammation and muscle spasms. Their hair turns orange and they suffer mental breakdowns. All this happens due to exposure to mercury. The syndrome is named after a particular profession because the makers of a certain article of clothing used mercury to treat leather. The name comes from a literary character in a children’s novel by Lewis Carroll. Which character gives his name to this syndrome? 3This is a psychodynamic complex that often begins as youthful rebellion but evolves into ‘frequent job changes and absenteeism as an adult.’ The syndrome is named after the titular character in a novel that is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer . Who is this chatacter who has been brought up by his father, the town drunk, and has a difficult time fitting into society? 4This complex describes a uniquely feminine condition in which women subconsciously fear independence. This complex leads to ineffectual behaviour on the job and anxiety about success. It is named after a certain character whose desire is for a prince to whisk her away and end her problems along the way. Who is this character who we also know for having a strict curfew? 5This syndrome describes the inability to believe that one is of an older, more mature age; such people do not know how to, or do not want to, stop being children. This is named after a character who refuses to grow up in a novel by Scottish playwright J.M. Barrie. Who is this character who has many adventures as the leader of the Lost Boys? 6Patients with this syndrome suffer from a rare combination of trichotillomania (the compulsion to pull out one’s hair) and trichophagia (the compulsion to eat one’s hair). The syndrome is named after a character who is known for letting her hair down. Who is this character whose hair got her tangled in many adventures? 7This syndrome is used to describe children with weak mental or physical traits, because they have suffered tremendous emotional stress as a result of parental neglect and abuse. It has been used to refer to children who grew up without the influence of human contact, such as those raised by wild animals. The syndrome is named after a character with whom we all should be familiar, thanks to a TV series and a Disney movie. Who is this character? 8This syndrome describes people who, despite the lack of any defects, are overly critical of their own physical appearance. They have difficulty dealing with ageing, so they try to cling to their youth by depending heavily on cosmetics. The syndrome is named after a novel by Oscar Wilde about a painting that ages and records every sin as its subject never ages. Who is this character? 9People with this neurological condition suffer from visual image distortions. They perceive parts of their body or any other objects around them as having been altered in size. This is named after a fictional character who finds herself shrinking after drinking a strange liquid, and goes on to enter a strange world. Who is this character? 10This disorder, which has been exclusively studied in teenage boys. is thought to happen due to a disturbance in the hypothalamus. Those suffering from this sleep for extremely long periods of time, sometimes almost a few months straight. Known as RVW syndrome for short, it is named after a fictional character, created by American author Washington Irving in 1819, who awakens after a 20-year-sleep and misses the American Revolution. What is the full form of RVW? A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and music, and is working on a rock ballad called ‘Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi is an Emotion’. @bertyashley||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/easy-like-sunday-morning/article33591974.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Cash for cookies||This New Year was a quiet one. We looked around at the home that had given us shelter for most of 2020 and felt infinitely grateful for its comforts. But it also struck us how the past year had made manifest the never-ending work that is the tending of home. And like a new year bonanza, along came Mr. Tharoor and Mr. Haasan supporting salaries for homemakers. Many of us rejoiced, but also wondered if the standard pay gap between men and women would literally hit home and lead to other battles on the home front. The roots of this call may offer some clarity. In 1972, Selma James began the ‘International Wages for Housework Campaign (IWFHC)’ as recognition and payment for all caring work, in the home and outside. It included both unwaged workers in the home and unwaged subsistence farmers and workers on the land and in the community. Also noteworthy is the work of Silvia Federici, key member of the Lotta Feminista in Italy who, in 1975, published the seminal Wages against Housework, arguing that the concept of paying homemakers was towards making visible the unpaid work of maintaining the home and reproducing the worker’s body that was not accounted for within traditional capitalist models of profit making. And lest you think that this only applies to capitalist and profit-driven masculinity, consider how the poet must have also taken for granted a cook, the writer his housekeeper, the artist a wife or two. No wonder Jane Sullivan writes that every writer must have a Vera, á la Vera Nabokov, while Virginia Woolf goes further claiming the need for an independent income and a room of her own. More work Which brings us to the next key question. Is there a gendering to the act of home care? The French comic artist Emma, for example, published a greatly popular illustration of what she called The Mental Load, highlighting the traditional frustration of women doing so much more work at home, even as the men retort “Well, you should have just asked me!” Except, the work of asking is itself managerial work, for which people traditionally get paid a ton of money in the outside world. It is only half-jokingly that I often say that my mother and her friends should have been the CEOs of this world. Wake-up calls In the current milieu of fake news and manipulated statistics, we may no longer turn to evidence, but it exists, and it overwhelmingly offers what ought to be wake-up calls to Mastercard-like priceless notions of mother’s love and wife’s care. A National Statistical Office (NSO) report, for example, calculates that the average Indian woman spends 243 minutes — a little over four hours — on domestic chores, which is almost 10 times the 25 minutes of home work performed by the average Indian man. For women who can afford it, this work is farmed off to the other protagonists of this battle — informal and underpaid domestic labour — with no security or safety provisions at worst, and the benefits of patronage and whim at best. In a world where men are conditioned to pay attention to the outside and to the traditional work of bringing home income, and women are conditioned to pay attention to the inside and the work of maintaining a clean and comfortable home, the burdens of gender accrue on both. Should housework also find itself equally valued, perhaps it may offer reprieve for all. The men who find the work of the outside debilitating and erosive, and the women who find working at home repetitive and soul-numbing. For we all know and recognise that the pursuit of a clean home is not trivial. How you treat your home is how you will treat the world. To treat the home and the everyday as small, to be sublimated in the service of a world that is big and in need of active intervention, is to disavow the labour of living. Kangana Ranaut believes that women should not be paid for being queens of their own kingdom. Ask some of us, we may well be willing to abdicate. For kingdoms are built on the rule of the few, the oppression of the many, and feudal norms of sovereignty and power. The first fairytales after all, ignored as they were by the Grimms brothers, were feminist ones. Written by 17th century French female writers known as the conteuses or storytellers, they sought to give agency to their female protagonists in a highly repressive society. Wages for housework may well be the fairytale we need towards egalitarianism, dissolution of gender norms, and the equal capacity to move between the inside and the outside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/cash-for-cookies/article33591982.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Not a lockdown Barbie||Size S was never for me. I have always been on the thicker side of the spectrum, and hence, a subject of frequent ridicule and endless counselling sessions from family and friends alike. Growing up, I was constantly reminded of how I didn’t fit the Indian ideal of “tall, slim, fair, with a Ph.D.” These comments didn’t help my negative body image or my struggle with social anxiety, and instead of dealing with them healthily, I ate through my feelings. But the 2020 pandemic brought a wave of articles overstating the potential effect of the lockdown on physical fitness, filling my mind with images of an inflated me struggling to pass through the doorway of my house. Exaggerated as this idea is, it pushed me to resolve to transform my entire appearance, hoping to emerge from the lockdown as a Barbie doll of sorts. It wasn’t easy. The sudden fitness regime was more than I could handle. I had no idea how to lose weight, and extreme exercise and stringent diet took a toll on my body. Hairfall, irregularities in my cycle, and an outbreak of acne were only a few of my body’s pleas to hit the brakes. Additionally, the abrupt elimination of added sugars, meat and carbs left my system gasping for nutrients. Eager for results I was forced to listen to these cries and re-evaluate my regime, but I didn’t slow down by any means. I wanted results and I wanted them fast. But unfortunately, weight loss isn’t like a get-rich-quick scheme. It took a long time, but eventually, I did begin to see results. I lost a significant amount of fat in my arms, calves, hips, and even my face. The problem was, these weren’t the areas I was keen to trim. Flabby thighs and a sizeable posterior have always been a constant source of shame for me, and I was keen on shedding them along with traumatic body-shaming memories from my school years. But I quickly realised that weight loss doesn’t go the way you want it to. But have I achieved my goal of becoming a Lockdown Barbie? No, and I probably never will. But no matter how much I change, it will never be enough. I realised this a while ago, when I met a family member who was one of my primary motivations for weight loss. I expected a surprised reaction, maybe even proud encouragement. What I received was a slap on my back and a remark to lose some more weight. Others, however, seem to think differently. Over the past couple of weeks, I have received hurtful comments on how I will look downright ugly if I lose more weight. But as another year ended and a new one began, I am happy with how I have changed. So, I’m not a Lockdown Barbie, but I will always be a work-in-progress. That’s good enough for me. divyagrace1997@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/not-a-lockdown-barbie/article33591925.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Across the great divide||The cataclysmic partition of 1947 has been chronicled by many writers from Saadat Hasan Manto to Salman Rushdie. In his autobiography, Truth, love and a little malice , Khushwant Singh recalled that “the atmosphere in the Punjab had become so charged with hate that it only needed a spark to set it ablaze.” People who lived on the east and west of a line drawn hastily by Cyril Radcliffe paid with their lives — Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus and Jains. The wounds haven’t healed and state propaganda is only keen to call each other’s country “enemy territory”. Votaries of peace have always maintained that more people-to-people contact is the way forward. In The Other Side of the Divide , Sameer Arshad Khatlani journeys to Lahore and comes away with some wonderful memories and glimpses of hope despite traumatic realities of the past and present (terrorism, hardened religious stands). The ‘other’ at home Long before Khatlani, a Kashmiri, crossed the border at Wagah in 2013 to attend a conference, however, he faced at least two instances of the ‘divide’ at home. Growing up in Bandipora, his family was caught in the middle of an Army search-and-cordon operation following the 1989 insurgency. The family had nothing to hide till someone remembered a possible source of trouble — his collection of posters of iconic Pakistani cricketers, courtesy Sportstar . Khatlani, a young boy at the time, had the presence of mind to dump them in a compost bin. His love of cricket would land him in bigger trouble in 2002. On a visit to Jaipur with a cousin in January he did not want to give up the chance to see Sawai Mansingh Stadium. As they clicked pictures outside the stadium, all hell broke loose when the security men found out they were from Kashmir. The police was radioed and Khatlani and his cousin were questioned for 24 hours, and asked repeatedly if they had been to Pakistan. Two Kashmiris had no business being outside a sensitive place ahead of Republic Day, they were told. Khatlani wanted to travel to the other side of the divide, his family’s protests notwithstanding. He insists that an artificial line drawn through the heart of Punjab “cannot be deep enough to change the shared language, culture, customs, idioms and attitudes shaped over centuries.” In Lahore, for instance, everybody speaks Punjabi on the street. The Sharifs, he writes, have deep roots in Amritsar and they have created a replica of their ancestral village Jati Umra at Raiwand near Lahore. He attended the premiere of Dhoom 3 and witnessed firsthand the love for Bollywood. Everywhere Khatlani went, people reacted with joy when told he hailed from India, and no one wanted to accept money. Most of the city’s landmarks, like the Shadman Chowk roundabout where Bhagat Singh was executed in 1931, have an India link. Historian Ayesha Jalal shared stories about Kashmir and her grand uncle Manto; Ramesh Singh Arora, the first provincial Sikh lawmaker, told him “there are still things that unite rather than divide us.” Khatlani was also in Lahore on a personal quest — he wanted to see what remained of his grandfather’s memories of the city of “high culture”. Though Anarkali Bazaar is now “a pale shadow of itself”, the bakery of S. Mokham-ud-din and Sons — famous for its Finger Stick Biscuits, inspired by the beautiful fingers of Mayo School for Arts Teacher Lady Harrison as the story goes — has stood the test of time. More such narratives are required to bridge the great divide in the subcontinent.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Which play?||Declarer will often reach a crossroads in the play of a hand, where he must choose between one play or another. It might seem like a toss-up, but it almost never is. There is usually something to go on. The ace of spades held the first trick and West continued with the king of spades. South ruffed and cashed the ace and king of trumps. East’s discard was a big disappointment. This would have been an easy one had the trumps split 3-2, with perhaps an overtrick or two coming declarer’s way. South had to decide what to do. Hoping for a 3-3 split in spades, South crossed to dummy with a diamond and ruffed a spade. Had the spades split evenly, South would have discarded a club on the queen of diamonds and another on an established spade. West, however, over-ruffed the third spade, cashed the queen of hearts, and exited with a diamond. He couldn’t be prevented from taking a trick with the king of clubs for down one. Could South have done better? Yes! Instead of ruffing a spade when he did, he could have cashed two more diamonds and then ruffed a spade. Regardless of how he defended, West would eventually be forced to lead a club away from his king. Should South have found this play? We think so. West would have been most unlikely to continue with a spade at trick two if he held three of them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/which-play/article33591977.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Bloodless coups of technology||The Netherlands physician Mark Post showcased the cooking of a hamburger using beef “grown” in his laboratory in London in 2013. An exponential increase in efforts to produce lab-grown meat followed, with some 60 companies currently engaged in it. From the fictitious restaurant Bistro In Vitro, established in May 2015 by the Dutch artist and philosopher Koert Mensvoort, that offers slaughter-free rare meat delicacies including those from extinct animals and human celebrities, we now have The Chicken, a restaurant in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ness Ziona, which is bracing to serve “Hero chicken burgers” prepared from meat grown in a bioreactor, visible to customers through a glass partition. In the first week of December, Singapore became the first country to permit the sale of lab-grown meat by allowing the San Francisco-based company Eat Just to serve nuggets prepared from chicken meat grown in reactors. The company started serving the lab-grown meat on December 19 in the restaurant 1800. Lab-grown meat, also called in vitro meat and clean meat, is produced by “cellular agriculture” in bioreactors, starting from a small number of specialised stem cells collected using painless biopsy from animals. For centuries, philosophers and preachers attempted to convert people to animal lovers, but slaughter of wild and domestic animals continued. Technology, more than empathy, has, however, come to the rescue of animals. During the early 19th century, whale oil was the principal source of lighting around the world. Bedford, Massachusetts was recognised as the “city that lights the world”, because of its innumerable fleets that slaughtered thousands of whales in the high seas. Animal lovers raised big concerns about the ruthlessness of the whalers. But it was the commercialisation of kerosene by the Canadian geologist Abraham Gesner in 1854 that saved the whales from extinction. Saving horses Similarly, technology saved the horses that were widely used for transport in the U.S. up to the late 19th century. The number of horses in New York City was so large that it was feared in the 1880s that the city would be buried under their dung and urine and would cease to exist in 100 years. Abuse of the equines led Henry Bergh to campaign for several measures for their protection, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was established in 1866. However, it was Henry Ford’s automobile, not Bergh’s society, that saved the horses. If lab meat crosses production hurdles and becomes acceptable as an alternative to animal meat, the world will surely be transformed into a more animal-friendly planet. msaleemuddin47@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/bloodless-coups-of-technology/article33591923.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Standing at the signal||Dear Agony Akka,  I am facing a dilemma. Everyone I know is asking me only one question: “Are you on signal?” At first, I didn’t understand why everyone wanted to know if I am standing at a traffic light. Then I learnt that Signal is a messaging service, like WhatsApp, and everyone wants to shift to it. It seems WhatsApp plans to leak private information about us to its parent company Facebook. How serious is this? I am asking because I belong to many WhatsApp groups: Residents Welfare Association; Office WhatsApp (official, with manager); Office WhatsApp (unofficial, without manager, where we make fun of him); Family group; Friends’ dirty jokes forwarding group... many, many groups like that, mostly for timepass only. Now it seems we have to migrate all groups to Signal because Facebook will read that Flat 12A’s dog bit child of Flat 14B’s resident because child pulled dog’s tail. And Zuckerberg might find a way to make money from this incident. While I don’t want That Man to make even more money at my expense, this shifting seems like too much effort. Is it worth it? Is there any other way? — 007   Dear 007,  Some would argue that the best way to punish the folks at Facebook for snooping on your WhatsApp messages is to expose them to the mind-numbing boredom of your daily life. The explicit messages to your husband about what vegetables to buy; the purple prose from daughter’s school about changes in class timetable; the thunderous edicts from RWA Secretary about sorting household garbage... Even Shashi Tharoor’s video introducing us to ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’ is something worth inflicting on our enemies. If you’re lucky, anyone spying on all this will suffer death by tedium. Serves them right. But we live in the 21st century. I am sure even you, 007, have heard of privacy concerns. Why, even my 12-plus niece knows that Facebook is particularly rapid in sneakily collecting user data. And that nitwit Rashmi from my Rummy Circle warned me that if you spend half an hour on the Internet, Facebook’s algae or some such will find out your lipstick colour and lingerie brand. And use it to make money. Do you want this? Your life might be dull, but must That Man get richer by finding out which bakery’s cake you bought for Christmas? So, your friends are moving to Signal? So are mine. They’re being a damn nuisance in fact. I’ve just about mastered WhatsApp and now I must learn Signal it seems. My friend Sunita has moved to Signal but can’t find everyone there. She says the ‘network effect’ is missing. What’s that, I asked. Well, she said, it’s like going to a party and finding you’re the only one there. And with no guarantee the others will turn up soon either. Good god woman, I said, come back home! Instead, she’s chomping on all the canapes alone. Of course, a few enterprising souls have set up Signal on two phones — and they chat with themselves. Very fatiguing. At any rate, I don’t trust Signal either. Soon, like my bank, they too will sell my data. Whatsapp said all its messages were 100% safe, then Navika came on TV reading other people’s chats. WhatsApp’s cover was blown. What rubbish encryption-shencryption. To return to your problem, 007 (sorry, I got carried away by my own), I am slowly coming to one big realisation in life. Like eureka moment although it does not involve a bathtub. The only way to stop chat services from collecting your number, BP rate, favourite cafes, tea brands etc (like people collecting stamps in good old innocent days) is to break free. Return to your roots 007. Embrace bush telegraph. Patronise pigeon post. Learn the tom-tom. One big advantage? No blue ticks. Your boss will never know if you’ve read his message or not.  — AA    agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/standing-at-the-signal/article33591973.ece

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Vaccine dilemma: to take or not to take Covaxin||As India’s largest vaccination drive using two COVID-19 vaccines began on January 16, health-care workers, who are the first to receive the vaccine, will have no option to choose one vaccine over the other. The same rule applies to other high-risk groups that would get the vaccine on priority. Addressing a press conference on January 12, the Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said: “At many places in the world, more than one vaccine is being administered, but presently, in no country, vaccine recipients have the option of choosing the shots.” It is true that in the U.S., vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna are available, and recipients, who are health-care workers and nursing home residents, do not have the option of choosing between the two. In the U.K., too, people will either receive a Pfizer vaccine, Moderna or AstraZeneca’s but cannot choose one over the other. The similarities of not providing the recipients the option to choose a vaccine, be it in the U.S., the U.K. or India end there. What the Health Secretary did not mention is that the safety and efficacy data used by the regulators in India, the U.S. and the U.K. to grant an emergency use approval are very different. While people in India will have to take a particular vaccine without knowing its efficacy, interim safety and efficacy from phase-3 trials, these are known for Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines that people in the developed countries get. The difference The emergency use approval granted by the U.S. FDA to Pfizer and Moderna and by the U.K. regulator to three vaccines – Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca – have been based on interim safety and efficacy data from large phase-3 trials with median follow-up of at least two months after the second dose. While both Pfizer and Moderna have nearly identical efficacy of 95%, the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine is 62% even when standard dose for the first and second dose is considered. In contrast, the Indian regulator issued restricted use approval for the Pune-based Serum Institute’s Covishield based on safety and immunogenicity tested in India on a small number of participants and safety and efficacy data from over 24,000 participants outside India. The restricted use approval was granted for the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin even in the absence of any efficacy data. The approval was solely based on a small number of participants studied during phase-1 and phase-2 trials; vaccine efficacy is studied only during a phase-3 trial. Matter of precaution In addition, Covaxin has been greenlighted in a “clinical trial mode” as a matter of “abundant precaution,” and informed consent has to be taken from the recipient before immunisation. There are no such conditions or riders in the case of Covishield. Hence, is it correct to compare the situation in India with other countries using vaccines with interim safety and efficacy levels known? According to the Union government, vaccine sites will offer either Covishield or Covaxin in order to avoid providing recipients the option to choose one vaccine over the other. Since COVID-19 vaccination is not compulsory, people walking into a site that provides only Covaxin can choose not to get vaccinated. A question of ethics But is it ethical to offer one health-care worker Covaxin whose efficacy is unknown and another health-care worker Covishield whose efficacy is known even though both face the same risk of infection at work? “This situation could have been avoided if the government had waited for few more weeks for the efficacy data of Covaxin to become available before granting it restricted use approval,” says Bhopal-based Dr. Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health and bioethics. “They could have begun vaccinating with Serum’s Covishield and added Covaxin after approving it based on efficacy data.” Will health-care workers and others who have refused to get vaccinated with Covaxin be offered another chance to get the vaccine on priority when data becomes available showing the vaccine has high efficacy? Likewise, if Covaxin is found to have less than 50% efficacy, will everyone who has been immunised with this vaccine be offered another highly efficacious vaccine? People at the vaccine sites offering Covaxin are required to take an informed consent from each recipient before immunisation. “Good consent also requires time. Some may want a day’s time to think over before consenting. Will this be allowed or will the person be compelled to give his/her consent then and there?” asks Dr. Bhan. Ensuring lack of bias State governments will decide which vaccine goes to which sites. But how can States ensure the allocation of health-care workers to sites, particularly those that offer Covaxin, is done without bias? “There has to be fairness – either random allocation or something to that effect. It could also be those who are willing to take Covaxin under “clinical trial mode” are assigned to sites offering the vaccine,” says Dr. Bhan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/vaccine-dilemma-to-take-or-not-to-take-covaxin/article33591430.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Exotic food exchange in the second millennium BCE||We are familiar with the ‘Silk Route’ that connects Chinese and Central Asian regions with Southern Asian and West Asian regions of the world and how trade between these regions had started over 4,000 years ago, or the second millennium BCE. It was then that the King of Babylon (the region near the Euphrates River) Hammurabi ruled and had strict moral laws for his subjects. In this connection, the remarkable and ‘must read’ book ‘The Silk Roads: A New History of the World’, written by Peter Frankopan mentions how even before that time, trade and cultural ties were going on between the East and the West in the Bronze Age (3000 BCE)’, that is, 5000 years ago. People from the Mediterranean region were trading with those in the Central, South and East Asia, introducing horses, camels and donkeys, and likewise from India through the Gulf region. Exchange of ‘exotic’ (non-native) food items such as wheat, rice, pulses, sesame, banana, soybean and turmeric was taking place. Bronze Age bodies Happily, studies from the Levant Region, a large land mass including Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, still has the bodies of people who lived there in the Bronze Age, in the cemeteries and burial grounds. Studies of the bodies have been carried out by a group from Israel, Germany, Spain, U.K. and the U.S. The exciting paper, titled ‘Exotic foods reveal contact between South Asia and the Near East during the second millennium BCE’, has appeared in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, or PNAS, in December 2020. Ancient literary sources referred to how long-distance travel was taking place in the third millennium BCE, of the transport of live animals such as the movement of donkeys from Egypt to the Southern Levant, i.e., the region between modern-day Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Syria and the cities of Amman, Aleppo, Beirut and Damascus, and even between Italy and Mesopotamia (Iran, Syria and Turkey). Botanical evidence also confirmed the exchange of fruit trees such as melons, citrus fruits and others from Southern Asian region during the Bronze Age (2000–1500 BCE). This showed the evidence of a Mediterranean cuisine, and even trading between the Indus Valley Civilisation and the Southern Asian region such as from Indonesia to the Southern Levant, in particular the Middle Bronze Age sites such as in Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. Dental calculus Two sites in this region, Megiddo and Tel Erani, were chosen. The research group had access totombs, cemeteries and burial sites in this region. Sixteen (16) samples were collected, from which they could obtain bones of the long-dead people. Analysis of the tooth bones, in particular the lower teeth connecting the jaw, was done and studied in detail. Scientists call this analysis, ‘dental calculus’. (By the way, this term calculus has nothing to do with mathematics at all, so please do not think that they were doing any advanced mathematical analysis!) The calculus here refers to the protein analysis of the teeth taken from the dead body, which offers information about the kind of food was eaten by the person – in particular plant material that had been stuck in the tooth. These plant materials are called ‘phytoliths’ (’phyto’ referring to plant and ‘lith’ to the fossilised part of the plant tissue stuck in the tooth). The researchers could analyse the dental calculus of 16 individuals buried in Megiddo and Tel Erani, and the analysis revealed the presence of millet, date palm, flowering plants, grasses and dietary plants such as wheat, rice, sesame, barley, soybean, banana, ginger and turmeric, among others. Proteome analysis The group followed it up with the proteome analysis, which tells us the entire set of proteins expressed in the cells of the material. This revealed the presence of vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, jasmine, cloves and peppercorn, revealing thereby that trade routes existed as early as the Bronze Age (3000–1200 BCE) and the Iron Age (500 BCE) between the Southeast and the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea-Dead Sea regions.  Bronze Age in India, particularly in the Northwest part of the country, is well documented by archeologists and historians. (The details of Bronze Age in the South of the region are still being studied). The Indus Valley Civilisation had already moved from the Stone Age into the Bronze Age (3300 – 1300 BCE). Metallurgy was practised. The Indus Valley Civilisation, around 2600 BCE, is well documented for its urbanisation in the cities of Mohenjo- Daro and Harappa in what is now in Pakistan, then Nothwest India region, where introduction of written texts, agriculture, water management, astronomy and philosophy, were practised. More on this can be had by accessing the site: <study.com/academy/lesson/the-bronze-age-in-india-history-culture-technology.html>. In agriculture, we note millet, rice, wheat, grasses were produced. In technology, water management was practised. In business, trade between this region and Central Asia, Mesopotamia, and the Southern Levant was practised. All this was happening long before the Silk Routes were established. dbala@lvpei.org||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/exotic-food-exchange-in-the-second-millennium-bce/article33591422.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Glucose addiction can foment tumours||Breast cancer is the top cause of cancer-related deaths in Indian women and is the most prevalent type of cancer in women. Worldwide statistics show that about two million new cases were detected in 2018. Researchers studying cancer metabolism have often noted that tumour cells are addicted to glucose. Once glucose enters the cell, it quickly gets fed to pathways and is utilised to multiply and grow. In contrast, normal cells primarily use glucose for energy production. This reprogramming of glucose metabolism by cancer cells often alters the response to drugs used in cancer treatment. An international team has discovered the conflicting roles of two genes in regulating glucose utilisation by breast cancer cells. They revealed that the CBX2 gene promotes glucose uptake and consumption by breast cancer cells whereas CBX7, a sister gene, does the opposite. Targeting these genes and/or their glucose pathway can pave way for new cancer treatments. Essential roles “The reason we chose to study CBX genes is because of their essential role in human embryo development. Since metabolic requirements during embryogenesis and carcinogenesis share a striking similarity, we got interested in CBX genes and their role in breast cancer,” says Mohammad Askandar Iqbal from Jamia Millia Islamia University who led the study. The researchers identified the roles of the two genes by studying molecular data from over 3,000 breast tumour samples. In normal breast cells, they found lower CBX2 but higher levels of CBX7. In breast cancer patients they noted the opposite – higher CBX2 and lower CBX7 expression. Among patients, those with higher CBX2 and lower CBX7 expression showed reduced survival, the study published in Molecular Oncology reported. When asked if gene therapy – where one can disrupt the problematic gene – can be used here, Dr. Iqbal explains: “We can try to specifically knock out the CBX2 gene in breast tumour cells; however, we cannot take the chance of knocking the gene out of our body as it plays an essential role in human embryonic development. Alternatively, we can target the glucose consumption by breast cancer cells.” Drug sensitivity analysis The team performed a drug sensitivity analysis on FDA-approved drugs which could treat breast tumours with higher CBX2 and/or lower CBX7 expression levels. They identified methotrexate and rapamycin as candidate drugs to which patients with higher CBX2 expression in breast tumours may respond favourably. “To enrich our knowledge of therapeutic biomarkers, we are interested in delving into the mechanistic basis of these important observations and profile the dependency of breast tumours on this pathway for designing personalised treatment strategies,” adds Dr. Iqbal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/glucose-addiction-can-foment-tumours/article33591420.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Fruit flies evolve in response to environment||A study of fruit flies bred in the lab shows that they may actually evolve to modulate their reproductive traits based on the extent of competitiveness of their competing males. This study of 150 generations of fruit flies, spanning about six years, shows how the environment can influence evolution of reproductive traits. It is a well-known fact that males of different species compete for the attention of females to mate with. In species where the female mates with many males, as in Drosophila (fruit fly) the sperms extend this competition to the post-copulatory domain. This is known as post-copulatory sexual selection. Evolving traits This study shows that over several generations, males actually evolve to modulate their reproductive investment based on their perception of the number and quality of the competition. The study was published in the journal Evolution.    It is significant because it shows how male fruit flies change the expression of their reproductive traits depending on the changes in the environment. “This study shows the evolution of plasticity according to the change in the socio-sexual environment,” says N.G. Prasad of Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali, who led the research. “In general, the rapidly changing environment can have a great impact on an organism’s behaviour. Acquiring plasticity enables an individual to cope with the fluctuating environment and maintain fitness in adverse conditions,” he adds, in an email to The Hindu.  The researchers maintained the study for over 150 generations. “The flies are maintained on a 14-day life cycle every generation. Therefore, one generation corresponds to 14 days, and 150 generations corresponds to 2,100 days, which is approximately six years,” explains Dr. Prasad. Competing sperm In general, post-copulatory sexual selection can be competition between the various sperm in the female reproductive tract to fertilise the egg, and also sperm choice mediated by the female reproductive tract. To understand this, the group studied three reproductive traits for males of male-biased and female-biased regimes. These were mating latency, copulation duration and sperm defence ability. Of these, mating latency is a measure of female receptivity and male courtship efficiency and intensity. Sperm defence ability is the ability of the experimental male sperm to displace another from a rival male. While mating latency and copulation duration were manually observed, the sperm defence ability was inferred from the (inherited) eye colour of the offspring. The experiments demonstrated that first, males can plastically modulate their reproductive investment in response to change in socio-sexual environment experienced in early-life. Secondly, evolution under different operational sex ratios led to divergence of male reproductive investment patterns. Also, the identity of early-life competitors can influence the pattern of reproductive investment. In order to eliminate the potential of parental effects to influence the results of the study, the flies were passed through one generation of standardisation. “During this process, flies were maintained in ancestral conditions and selection was not imposed on them. Then all the experimental conditions were also retained same for both the populations (male-biased and female-biased) and all the treatments,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/fruit-flies-evolve-in-response-to-environment/article33591425.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||DNA exchanges in plants||Do plants share genetic material with each other? Genetic material of plants and animalsare well protected in the nucleus of each cell and store all the information that forms an organism. In addition, cells contain small organelles that contain their own genetic material. These include chloroplasts in plants, which play a key role in photosynthesis, and mitochondria, which are found in all living organisms and represent the power plants of every cell. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam have shown, through experimental approaches, (Science Advances) how the genetic material is not actually permanently stored within one cell but can migrate from cell to cell. They conducted experiments with tobacco plants using grafting. Two different tobacco plants were grafted on to each other and the cells of the junction were observed microscopically in real time. They could observe that genome transfer from cell to cell occurs in both directions with high frequency at this site. The researchers were able to observe structural changes in the cell walls in the wound tissue of the graft site. Protrusions formed on the cell walls, thus creating junctions between the two partners. The size of the created pores allowed the migration of an entire plastid. “Therefore, the genome does not migrate freely, but encapsulated from cell to cell,” Dr. Alexander Hertle says in a release. However, to actually make this possible, the plastids have to shrink and become mobile. These rod-shaped plastids grow back to normal size after transfer into the target tissue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/dna-exchanges-in-plants/article33591423.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Can courts stay laws made by the legislature?||The story so far: The Supreme Court’s recent order staying the implementation of three farm laws, while appointing a four-member committee (one member, Bhupinder Singh Mann, has recused himself), to thrash out issues between agitating farmers and the Union government, has been criticised in some quarters. In particular, many have questioned the suspension of action under the laws as such interim orders are extremely rare. The court did not accept the Attorney General’s argument that laws made by the legislature should not be ordinarily stayed, as there is a presumption of constitutionality in favour of the laws. How did the SC justify its order on farm laws? “This court cannot be said to be completely powerless to grant stay of any executive action under a statutory enactment,” the Bench observed in its order. This means that it was apparently making a distinction between staying a law and staying its implementation or any action under it. Some may argue, however, that the effect remains the same, as the order operates as a stay on the government invoking its provisions. The court also cited an order passed by another Bench of the Supreme Court last September on the Maratha reservation issue. It directed that admissions to educational institutions for 2020-21 and appointments to posts under the government shall be made without reference to the reservation provided under the relevant legislation. The matter has been referred to a Constitution Bench. However, in the Maratha reservation case, the Bench said interim orders could be passed if an enactment isex facieunconstitutional or contrary to law laid down by the Supreme Court. It noted that the quota violated the 50% ceiling mentioned in the Indra Sawhney case (1992), and that the Maharashtra government had not shown any extraordinary situation to justify exceeding the limit. Moreover, the Supreme Court observed that a stay on the farm laws’ implementation may assuage the hurt feelings of farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table. What are the court’s powers in regard to staying enacted law? Under the broad framework of judicial review under the Constitution, the Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to declare any law unconstitutional, either because it isultra vires(or, contrary to any provision of the Constitution) or it violates any of the fundamental rights, or invalid because it is repugnant to a central law on the same subject or has been enacted without legislative jurisdiction. However, interim orders staying or suspending laws enacted by the legislature are frowned upon by constitutional courts and legal scholars. The general argument is that unless there are compelling reasons such as flagrant lack of constitutional validity, or absence of legislative competence (that is, the legislative body concerned lacks the jurisdiction to enact the law in question), a law ought not to be stayed. Why is it considered unusual for a court to suspend a law or its operation? The main principle is that suspending a law made by the legislature goes against the concept of separation of powers. Courts are expected to defer to the legislature’s wisdom at the threshold of a legal challenge to the validity of a law. The validity of a law ought to be considered normally only at the time of final adjudication, and not at the initial stage. The second principle is that there is a presumption that every law enacted by any legislature is constitutional and valid. The onus is on those challenging it to prove that it is not. Therefore, courts are circumspect when hearing petitions seeking suspension of a law pending a detailed adjudication. What precedents are cited against judicial interference at an interim stage? Case law suggests that in some cases, High Courts indeed stayed the operation of some laws. However, the Supreme Court took a dim view. In 1984, the top court set aside an interim stay granted against the operation of a municipal tax (Siliguri Municipality & Others vs Amalendu Das & Others) ;  in 2013, it removed the stay on some provisions of and regulations under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (Health for Millions Trust vs Union of India).  In the latter case, the court observed that “the operation of statutory provisions cannot be stultified by granting an interim order except when the Court is fully convinced that the particular enactment or the rules are ex facie unconstitutional and the factors, like, balance of convenience, irreparable injury and public interest are in favour of passing an interim order”. While upholding the validity of Section 45S of the Reserve Bank of India Act, which imposed restrictions on unincorporated bodies accepting public deposits, the Supreme Court criticised interim orders by some High Courts that stayed the provision. “When considering an application for staying the operation of a piece of legislation, and that too pertaining to economic reform or change, then the courts must bear in mind that unless the provision is manifestly unjust or glaringly unconstitutional, the courts must show judicial restraint in staying the applicability of the same,” the court said inBhavesh D. Parish & Others vs Union of India, 2000.    The main principle is that suspending a law made by the legislature goes against the concept of separation of powers.

17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Stock market highs and economic lows||The story so far: On Monday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the 22nd issue of its biannual Financial Stability Report outlining the risks to financial stability as well as the resilience of the financial system in the contemporary context. In his foreword, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das flagged the many risks ahead, including the recent, accentuating “disconnect between certain segments of financial markets and the real economy”. Mr. Das warned, “Stretched valuations of financial assets pose risks to financial stability,” adding, “banks and financial intermediaries need to be cognisant of these risks and spillovers in an interconnected financial system.” What prompted the RBI Governor’s warning? While Mr. Das did not explicitly name the stock markets, the RBI is unequivocal in the report’s chapter titled ‘Macrofinancial Risks’ in identifying the asset class triggering major concern among central bankers. The RBI noted that measures taken to support the economy and safeguard the financial system during the COVID-19 pandemic “may have unintended consequences as reflected, for instance, in the soaring equity valuations disconnected from economic performance”. The backdrop to the RBI’s comments is this: while the imposition in March of the initial nationwide lockdown to curb the pandemic and subsequent State-level restrictions pushed the economy into one of its deepest contractions in the April-June quarter (initial estimates show GDP shrank 23.9% in the period), which then extended into a technical recession as GDP contracted 7.5% in the July-September period, India’s equity markets rallied sharply after plunging to more than three-year lows on March 23. As of the close of trading on January 11 (the day the RBI released its report), the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex had appreciated almost 90% from its closing level on March 23, 2020. So, while the country’s economic output as a whole has been contracting — the government’s official advance estimates show GDP shrinking by 7.7% in the 2020-21 financial year — the stock markets have been seemingly disconnected and soaring to record highs. How did this situation arise? The onset of the pandemic saw monetary and fiscal authorities worldwide, including in India, introducing a slew of support measures to ensure that the restrictions imposed on economic activity did not completely devastate national economies and household incomes. The measures, which included interest rate cuts and infusion of liquidity, have driven a substantial surge in funds in the financial system, including in India’s case from overseas investors. The RBI noted in the report, “surges of capital flows are being experienced, with the return of risk appetite and a renewed search for yield. Financial markets and asset prices have been lifted by this resurgence of foreign portfolio investment to India.” Latest data from the National Securities Depository Ltd. show that net foreign portfolio investments into equities in the current fiscal year had surged more than 38-fold to Rs. 2,36,781 crore (as on January 16), from the meagre Rs. 6,153-crore inflow in the preceding year. Worldwide, easy money conditions have in the past invariably spurred stock market rallies as investors seek higher returns at a time when interest rates on fixed income assets such as deposits and bonds decline. Expectations of an economic recovery undergirded by supportive measures and the availability of lower-cost borrowings also spur people to borrow money to invest in stocks. Why is the RBI concerned? The central bank is wary of the risk that a sudden sharp reversal in the trend could cause the asset bubble to pop, triggering wider contagion effects. The 2001 recession in the U.S., for instance, was sparked by the bursting of the dotcom bubble, which, coupled with  the September 11 terrorist attacks and a series of accounting scandals at major companies, including energy firm Enron Corporation, pushed the economy into a contraction. In RBI’s own words, “active intervention by central banks and fiscal authorities has been able to stabilise financial markets but there are risks of spillovers ... In a period of continued uncertainty, this has implications for the banking sector as its balance sheet is linked with corporate and household sector vulnerabilities.”  While the country's economic output has been contracting – the government's official advance estimates show GDP shrinking by 7.7% in the 2020-21 financial year – the stock markets have been soaring to record highs||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/stock-market-highs-and-economic-lows/article33591348.ece
17 January 2021||January 17 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. & Section 230||The story so far: In the U.S., Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) regulates online publication and liability. Specifically, the 1996 law states: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” Author and cybersecurity lawyer Jeff Kosseff describes the law as ‘the 26 words that created the internet’. But the legislation has come in the crosshairs of both Republicans and Democrats. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for it to be repealed, including days ago, when he was suspended — first temporarily and then indefinitely — by social media sites, including Twitter and Facebook. President-elect Joe Biden has also called for the law’s repeal. Why was the law passed? The law grants Internet platforms immunity for almost all content posted by users — it is because of Section 230 of the CDA that Twitter is not normally liable for the content of tweets posted by its users, and Google is protected when a restaurant tries to sue it for a bad user review, for instance. The law was passed in the aftermath of two court cases against Internet service providers, and different courts had ruled differently on the extent of liability for content hosting, and the extent of this liability itself. Where do Republicans and Democrats stand on the law? Republicans oppose Section 230 because for long, they have accused social media giants of silencing or stifling conservative voices. Democrats oppose it because they want greater policing of the Internet to tackle extremism, abuse and misinformation. Mr. Biden called for Section 230 to be revoked in a 2019 interview to The New York Times . “[The NYT ] can’t write something you know to be false and be exempt from being sued. But he [Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg] can,” he had said. In 2019, Mr. Trump claimed that big tech was planning to rig the 2020 election. In May last year, he signed an executive order asking the Federal Communications Commission to propose regulations on the applicability of the law and review federal advertising spend on online platforms. After he lost the election, Mr. Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act (Congress passed it overriding the veto). Among the stated reasons for the veto was a lack of “meaningful” changes to Section 230. How has the industry reacted to the opposition? In general, the tech industry has said any changes to the law must consider the impact on First Amendment rights (free speech), business and innovation. In June 2019, the Internet Association, whose members include Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc., came out in support of Section 230. Referring to reviews posted online, its head said, “Repealing or weakening CDA 230 would take away the parts of the internet that help Americans feel safe and make better decisions about where they eat, shop, and travel.” Repealing the law would lead to increased censoring of online content, Mr. Zuckerberg told a Senate committee (led by Republican lawmakers) in October last year, to which he was subpoenaed along with Twitter head Jack Dorsey and Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai. The hearing was titled, “Does Section 230’s Sweeping Immunity Enable Big Tech Bad Behavior?” Mr. Zuckerberg, however, said he supported the need to update the law but did not provide details of which reforms he backed, as per a Financial Times report on the hearing. Mr. Pichai had said any changes should be thoughtfully considered bearing in mind the impact on consumers and business. “Eroding the foundation of Section 230 could collapse how we communicate on the internet,” said Mr. Dorsey, adding that it would mean only well-funded tech giants would survive. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference last February, Mr. Zuckerberg had said that the level of regulation for social media companies should fall somewhere between regulation levels for telecom companies and newspapers.  What lies ahead? Following the attack on the Capitol on January 6, Facebook suspended Mr. Trump’s account indefinitely. Twitter also did the same, on grounds of ‘risk of further incitement of violence’. It also suspended more than 70,000 accounts related to QAnon, a right-wing conspiracy theory group. Throughout the election, Twitter had labelled as ‘misleading’ numerous tweets in which Mr. Trump called the election fraudulent. With Mr. Biden stepping into the White House, Congress turning Democrat by a slim margin, and with a bitter election just fought, debates around Section 230 are likely to continue. The law may be modified, but it is not clear how.  The law grants Internet platforms immunity for almost all content posted by users. The tech industry has said any changes to the law must consider the impact on First Amendment rights (free speech), business and innovation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/us-section-230/article33591344.ece
