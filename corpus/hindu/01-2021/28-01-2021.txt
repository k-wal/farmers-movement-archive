28 January 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. conspiracy led to violence: farmers||Farm unions have blamed the violence which took place during their Republic Day tractor parades on a conspiracy hatched by the government with one Punjab union, the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and with Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu, who has previously been linked to the BJP. The unions have cancelled their plans to march to Parliament on February 1, when the Union Budget will be presented, but have vowed to continue their agitation in a peaceful manner. Their statements came even as the Delhi police accused union leaders of instigating farmers to break from the agreed parade route and head towards the Red Fort. The police have filed FIRs naming a number of senior farm leaders who held talks with the government and signed an undertaking promising to follow the conditions set for the parades. “The peaceful farmers parade was a victim of a conspiracy hatched by the government,” said veteran Punjab union leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, who is among those named in the FIR. He alleged that the police had removed the barricades for troublemakers from the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), who had previously declared their intention of breaking from the designated route. He also alleged that actor Deep Sidhu, who has been linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and associated with Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the person who instigated the flag hoisting at the Red Fort. “It was a historic parade by lakhs of farmers with over 2 lakh tractors, and 99.9% of the farmers stayed peaceful,” added Mr. Rajewal, speaking at a press conference of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the joint front of protesting farm unions, at the Singhu border on Wednesday night. 2 unions give up protest Earlier, two unions which are not associated with the SKM said they would withdraw from the protest. Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan leader V.M. Singh, who was also named in the FIR, said he was withdrawing from the Ghazipur protest site due to the violence on Republic Day and the protesters who unfurled a religious flag at the Red Fort. The Bharatiya Kisan Union-Bhanu, which filed a case in the Supreme Court on the issue and was seen as close to the government, also withdrew from the protest at the Chilla site. Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Srivastava said unions had not followed the terms and conditions laid down for the parades, alleging that farmer leaders made inflammatory speeches and were involved in the violence that left 394 personnel injured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-conspiracy-led-to-violence-farmers/article33680319.ece
28 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Sasikala is officially out of prison||V.K. Sasikala, the aide of late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, was on Wednesday formally released from the Parappana Agrahara Prison here after serving a four-year sentence in a disproportionate assets case. Officials announced her release at the Victoria Hospital here, where she is undergoing treatment for COVID-19. Ms. Sasikala, who was expelled from the AIADMK, will remain in hospital for another four or five days, a statement from the hospital said. She was admitted there on January 21. A team of officials visited Ms. Sasikala in the morning to complete the formalities of her release and hand over her belongings. While the prison escort has been withdrawn, more than 100 personnel of the Bengaluru city police have been deployed in and around the hospital for security, turning the COVID-19 facility into a fortress. A source said the police were not allowing family members and party workers to meet her, citing security reasons. Medical Superintendent Ramesh Krishna K. said, “As per protocols, she will be discharged on the 10th day if she is asymptomatic and free of oxygen support for at least three days.” She was admitted to the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital on January 20 after she complained of breathlessness and fever. From there, she was shifted to the Victoria Hospital on January 21 after she was diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection. Subsequently, her chest CT thorax showed features suggestive of severe respiratory infection. She tested positive for COVID-19 the same day. She was admitted to the COVID-19 ICU at the Emergency and Trauma Care Centre, the designated COVID-19 facility on the Victoria Hospital premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sasikala-is-officially-out-of-prison/article33680315.ece
28 January 2021||CHENNAI,||Mausoleum for Jayalalithaa opened||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami unveiled a mausoleum for late AIADMK leader and former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on the Marina here on Wednesday. AIADMK workers and the wider public thronged the venue in large numbers from early in the morning. Traffic was diverted in various parts of the city. Speaking at the event, Mr. Palaniswami accused DMK president M.K. Stalin of attempting to obstruct the construction of the mausoleum for Jayalalithaa. It was Mr. Stalin who moved the court through his ‘benamis’, the Chief Minister said.    “When his father [late DMK leader and former Chief Minister] M. Karunanidhi died, the same Mr. Stalin made his ‘benamis’ withdraw all the cases overnight. It is clear how Mr. Stalin has been against the construction of a mausoleum for our leader,” he said. Mr. Stalin’s drama was known to the world now, he said. Mr. Palaniswami called upon his party men to ensure the victory of the AIADMK in the Assembly election. “That would be the gratitude that we would be offering to our Puratchi Thalaivi Amma [Jayalalithaa],” he said. The Chief Minister recalled Jayalalithaa’s early life and how she had enrolled herself as a member of the AIADMK and detailed the schemes she had implemented when was the Chief Minister. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said his party men were indebted to the greatness of the late leader. He also recalled how Jayalalithaa had secured the rights of Tamil Nadu. Several members of the Tamil Nadu Cabinet and Assembly Speaker P. Dhanapal were present. Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam and Tamil Development and Information Department Secretary Mahesan Kasirajan spoke. The museum and the knowledge park located adjacent to the mausoleum are yet to be unveiled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mausoleum-for-jayalalithaa-opened/article33680332.ece
28 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Council: BJP, JD(S) strike pact||In a coming together of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal (Secular), the former has now decided to support a JD(S) candidate for the post of the Chairman of the Legislative Council when the seat falls vacant, while settling for the Deputy Chairman’s post for a party candidate. Senior JD(S) member Basavaraj Horatti, who has lobbied hard for this alliance, will be the JD(S) candidate for the Chairman’s post, while BJP member M.K. Pranesh will file his nomination papers for the Deputy Chairman’s post on Thursday morning, sources said.  High command’s word A decision to this effect was taken by the BJP high command on Wednesday, after the former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda spoke to BJP national president J.P. Nadda over the matter, sources said. Apart from support to several crucial Bills, including the contentious Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020, which the JD(S) had earlier opposed, several other issues “more than what meets the eye” were part of the understanding, said a senior BJP leader. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa held a meeting of BJP MLCs on Wednesday and announced the candidature of Mr. Pranesh, who is from Chikkamagaluru and RSS stable, for the post of the Deputy Chairman. “We have moved a no-confidence motion against Council Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty. But that can be taken up only by a Deputy Chairman, a post that has fallen vacant after the death of S.L. Dharme Gowda. Once Mr. Pranesh is elected as Deputy Chairman, we will take up the no- confidence motion as per due process of law and depose Mr. Shetty. The BJP will later support JD(S) candidate for the Chairman’s post,” a senior BJP leader said. “I am the senior-most member of the Council and members of the House have expressed their wish to elect me as Chairman,” Mr. Horatti said. CM unhappy? “Given that the JD(S) has always been thought of as a contingency plan if there is a threat to the government’s stability with leadership change, the Chief Minister is not very happy with the alliance, especially the way it panned out at the high command level, and not through him,” a senior BJP leader said. Meanwhile, Mr. Shetty is yet to take a final call on whether to resign or face the no-confidence motion on the floor of the House. Sources said he might opt for resigning after polls to Deputy Chairman’s post. Interim report by a special legislature committee that probed into the pandemonium in the Council on December 15 is expected to be tabled in the House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/council-bjp-jds-strike-pact/article33680418.ece

The guidelines under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, issued in December are applicable till January 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cinemas-allowed-to-seat-more-people/article33680311.ece
28 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||SEC censures two senior officials for ‘dereliction of duty’||The Andhra Pradesh government has “objected” to the censure notices issued by State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar to two senior IAS officials over preparations for the local body elections. Mr. Kumar said Principal Secretary (Panchayat Raj) Gopal Krishna Dwivedi and Commissioner M. Girija Shankar had failed in discharging their duties related to the gram panchayat elections. Addressing mediapersons here on Wednesday, Mr. Kumar said he had done no great harm by censuring them and that he may rethink the decision on being satisfied with their functioning hereafter. Mr. Kumar said he had reached the conclusion that the two senior IAS officers were responsible for the adoption of old (2019) electoral rolls which jeopardised the right of nearly 3.6 lakh youth who attained 18 years as on January 1, 2021, to vote, and there was nothing personal about it. “Having come from the same all-India services to which the two officers belong, why will I act in a vindictive manner against them,” he asked. In a letter to Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das, Mr. Kumar stated that Mr. Dwivedi and Mr. Shankar “displayed total lack of sensitivity to the tenets of empowerment of grassroots democracy and institutions as laid down by the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution,” citing their alleged failure in updating the electoral rolls, which forced the commission to adopt the voter lists that dated back to 2019. He mentioned that the “censure will form part of their service records”. Mr. Das has reportedly written to the SEC raising an objection to the censure of Mr. Dwivedi and Mr. Shankar on the ground that certain procedures were not followed. A government source told PTI: “The State government would not be considering that censure. It is one-sided. The SEC did not seek explanation from the officials before issuing the censure. The SEC is not the competent authority.” When contacted, Mr. Kumar said he was yet to go through the communication.

Now, employees have submitted representations seeking 65% fitment. The PRC cited the financial constraints faced by the State as the reason behind considering the 7.5% fitment.

28 January 2021||New Delhi,||SC stays Bombay HC order in groping case||The Supreme Court stayed a controversial Bombay High Court verdict, which acquitted a man found guilty of assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on the grounds that he groped his victim over her clothes and there was no “skin to skin” contact between them. A Bench, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde, on Wednesday took cognisance instantaneously after Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal made a special mention in court, saying the single-judge verdict would set a “very dangerous precedent” and cripple the intention of the POCSO Act to punish sexual offenders. On January 19, the High Court’s Nagpur Bench created a furore after it acquitted a man under the POCSO Act and held that an act against a minor would amount to groping or sexual assault only if there was “skin-to-skin” contact. The court concluded that mere touching or pressing of a clothed body of a child did not amount to sexual assault. Mr. Venugopal said that in future, because of the order, an accused could claim innocence under the Act by arguing that the child he assaulted was clothed and there was no “direct physical skin-to-skin contact” between them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-stays-bombay-hc-order-in-groping-case/article33680336.ece

28 January 2021||New Delhi,||Police were told not to fire at protesters||The Delhi Police were given instructions not to use firearms at agitators as some groups turned violent during the January 26 tractor rally in protest against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre last September. Farmer unions have alleged that “anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement”. “Strict legal action is being taken and no one involved in the violent incidents will be spared,” Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava told The Hindu . The police used tear gas and batons, and blocked the roads with public buses, containers and concrete barriers, which were breached by agitators. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who held a second review meeting on Wednesday, was briefed in detail by Mr. Shrivastava on the law and order situation in the national capital a day after the violence. “The police cannot be revengeful and there were instructions not to use firearms. The brief was not to further flare up the matter. The police personnel followed the instructions diligently. It took perseverance and patience to control the situation,” a senior government official said. Though there were intelligence inputs about violence during the tractor rally, permission was still given to “pacify” the farmers who have been sitting at Delhi’s borders since November 26, the official said. Asked why the intelligence inputs were not taken seriously, he said, “The police is a part of the government. It cannot unilaterally decide if permission is to be given or not. We have to find a solution. A warning from intelligence was there, but the farmer unions were also apprised of the security aspects.” Security in the national capital was on heightened alert for the Republic Day parade, and more than 5,000 Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) personnel were deployed in addition to the police. Farmer leaders Darshan Pal, Rajinder Singh, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Buta Singh Nurjgil, Joginder Singh Ugrahan and Rakesh Tikait — who held meetings with the police to agree on the tractor routes — were named in the first information reports (FIRs) filed on Wednesday. Deviation from route Protesters deviated from the route sanctioned by the police for rallies at three locations on the outskirts of Delhi and stormed into central Delhi, thereby damaging property and hoisting religious flags at the Red Fort. Several policemen were injured. Actor Deep Sidhu, a former election agent of BJP parliamentarian Sunny Deol in Punjab’s Gurdaspur who was seen leading the violent protesters at the Red Fort on Tuesday, was initially not named in any FIR. However, his name was added in an FIR registered at Kotwali police station later in the day.  “We have not reached any conclusion, the investigation will reveal the conspiracy and other aspects of the case.

He chaired the 148th session of the Board on Tuesday, said a press release issued by the Health Ministry on Wednesday. The release said Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the U.S. President, addressed the Board on behalf of the Biden administration, announcing that the U.S. would remain a member of WHO and fulfil its financial obligations, with continued technical collaboration at all levels, including through its collaborating centres. Dr. Fauci acknowledged the role of the WHO in leading the global public health response to the outbreak, convening scientists and researchers to help accelerate the development of vaccine therapeutics and diagnostics and tracking the latest developments for keeping the member-states informed. The Board, according to the release, welcomed the Immunisation Agenda 2030 and was unanimous in recognising the central role played by immunisation programmes in safeguarding public health globally. The member-states also called for early and equitable availability of COVID-19 vaccines, including through the COVAX facility. Dr. Vardhan said, “Immunisation has been a singularly successful global programme in preventing vaccine-preventable morbidity and mortality and the WHO must continue providing evidence-based and scientific advocacy to support member-states in effectively implementing the Immunisation Agenda. Vaccine coverage must continue to improve, particularly to reach vulnerable sections and reduce inequities.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-global-challenge-to-deliver-vaccine/article33680274.ece
28 January 2021||MALAPPURAM,||Stand united, Rahul tells workers||Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi exuded confidence that the party-led United Democratic Front (UDF) would come to power in Kerala in the coming Assembly election. Addressing a UDF meeting at Mambad, near Nilambur, on Wednesday, Mr. Gandhi called upon the Congress workers to stand united for an electoral win. He interacted with students at the Government Girls’ Vocational Higher Secondary School at Wandoor. He called upon girls to be independent, especially financially and psychologically. Mr. Gandhi was here on a two-day visit to his constituency. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and IUML national general secretary and MP P.K. Kunhalikutty were among those who welcomed Mr. Gandhi at the Karipur airport. Ventilators handed over After a brief meeting with the UDF leaders, Mr. Gandhi proceeded to Wandoor, where he inaugurated a new building of the Government Girls’ Vocational Higher Secondary School. He also inaugurated five school buses sanctioned from Mr. Anil Kumar’s MLA fund for different schools in the afternoon. He handed over the ventilators he sanctioned from the MP fund to Government Hospital, Nilambur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stand-united-rahul-tells-workers/article33680247.ece
28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sagging spirits at the Singhu site||A day after violence in Delhi, it was business as usual at the Singhu border with protesters speaking on stage one after the other. But the crowd seemed less than usual and spirit perceptibly depressed. While a majority of the protesting farmers admitted that the violence should not have occurred, they believed a host of reasons led to the events. They allege that the government sent its “elements” to infiltrate the protest and incite the angry and frustrated youth. Lack of communication was another reason, they said. Disagreement between Nihang Sikhs and volunteers trying to maintain peace at the protest site was also visible on Wednesday. Pritam Singh Nihang, 60, said he agreed with what happened on Tuesday because the original plan was to hoist the flag at the Red Fort. “If they agreed later not to go there, then it only means they bent in front of the government and we wouldn’t do that,” he said. However, Nihang Sikhs’ leader Raja Raj Singh condemned the violence, but alleged that the farmer leaders had not led the protest. “Yes, our group went to the Red Fort and broke barricades, but that’s because they didn’t know who to follow. The leaders should have led the protest from the front so that no one deviated from the path. Our men got carried away when they were instigated,” he said. Responding to the claim, stage management committee member Amrik Singh, Bharat Kisan Union district pradhan (Jalandhar), said leaders along with volunteers were at the front and when they realised that the situation was going out of control, they started calling people back to their respective protest sites. “For so many days, we have been saying from the stage that there is no plan to go to the Red Fort. What certain groups did was wrong. Our fight is for farming and nothing else,” he said. Mahant Jasbir Das Singh, who has been on a hunger strike since December 13, said he went to the Red Fort but did not support the violence. “I don’t know who led us to the monument, but groups started going towards it so we did too. But when we reached, we unfurled the national flag, sang the national anthem and stepped out. A group of people, however, started creating a ruckus and hoisted the Nishan Sahib which wasn’t right,” he said, adding that other protesters got involved because of heightened emotions. “It was all planned and planted by the government. How could a place like the Red Fort — an hour after Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves — not have enough security to stop people,” asked Sukhwinder Singh Barwa, a protester from Ropar, who had gone till Mukarba Chowk and returned after the group was asked by the leaders to do so. Another protester Mehtab Singh, 68, from Amritsar said there were barricades on the route given by the Delhi Police, which led the protesters to take the other route at Mukarba Chowk. “When they didn’t allow us on the route that was given to us, that’s when people got angry and diverted,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sagging-spirits-at-the-singhu-site/article33680264.ece
28 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Traditional medicine centre in Telangana?||The Centre has sought the willingness of the TS government to host the proposed World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Centre for Traditional Medicine here on Wednesday. The Ministry of Ayush — Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Yoga, Naturopathy, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy — secretary Rajesh Kotecha has written to the Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and informed that the Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy and Karimnagar MP Sanjay Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to consider setting up the proposed centre in Hyderabad and wanted to know the extent of support the government wished to give for it. Mr. Kotecha said that the proposed international centre will require global infrastructure, institutional and statutory support in a sustainable manner, adequate manpower, land for office and residences of staff, admissible security, appropriate AYUSH ecosystem etc. Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders including party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar and others have urged the government and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar to take appropriate steps to ensure that the Centre allots the global centre to the capital. Earlier, Mr. Reddy and Mr. Kumar, in separate letters to the Centre, lobbied for the city stating that a “large chunk of unused land is available on the premises of Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (IDPL) and it is strategically located.” The party leaders said the capital enjoys ‘locational advantage’ and connects to all major cities through rail, road and air. It has knowledge-based industries to drive economic growth like biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and IT/ITES. Multinational life sciences giants like United States Pharmacopeia (USP), Du Pont, Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI), Sanofi Aventis, Aptuit-Laurus etc. as well as home grown companies such as Dr Reddy’s, Aurobindo Pharma, Bharat Biotech etc, are here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/traditional-medicine-centre-in-ts/article33680921.ece
28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||No protection from arrest for Tandav team||The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to pass an order to protect the makers and artists of the web series Tandav on Amazon Prime from arrest, even as it agreed to examine their plea to club the FIRs registered against them in various States on the charge of hurting Hindu religious sentiments. A three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked them to approach the lower courts concerned for interim relief, including bail. The court also rejected their plea to quash the FIRs. The court did not appear convinced when the makers and artists said the web series was a “political satire”. They urged the court to protect their freedom of artistic speech and expression. But Justice M.R. Shah, on the Bench, said free speech is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions. One of the actors, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, told the court that he had enacted a character whose dialogues in the series had no connection whatsoever to his own individual beliefs. “I was contracted to play a character. What I said or did in the series has nothing to do with me as an individual,” his lawyer argued for him. “You cannot play the role of a character which hurts the religious sentiments of others,” Justice Shah replied. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, one of the lawyers appearing for the makers, said signing on to an OTT platform to watch a series was unlike public viewing on Doordarshan. “I have to pay and view. I consent to watch it. I want to see a political satire, so I watch it,” Mr. Luthra submitted. Senior advocate Fali Nariman, also for the makers, said FIRs have been filed in multiple States merely as a source of harassment. “We have already deleted one or two scenes, still FIRs are being filed,” he submitted. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi reminded the court of how it had, several years ago, protected painter M.F. Husain from arrest after FIRs were filed against him by people across the country, similarly for hurting religious sentiments. He said the makers have come directly to the SC following the precedent of the Arnab Goswami case where multiple FIRs were filed in different States and the court agreed to club them. The FIRs were registered on the basis of complaints filed against director Ali Abbas Zafar; Amazon Prime India head Aparna Purohit; producer Himanshu Mehra; show’s writer Gaurav Solanki and actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub. Transit pre-arrest bail Earlier, the Bombay High Court had granted a transit pre-arrest bail to Mr. Zafar, Ms. Purohit, Mr. Mehra and Mr. Solanki against whom a case was registered in Lucknow for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The four have been booked under Sections 153 A, 295, and 501 (1)(B) of the IPC and under relevant Sections of the IT Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-protection-from-arrest-for-tandav-team/article33680277.ece
28 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Farmers flay Deep Sidhu’s actions, call him govt. agent||Embroiled in controversy after he was seen in the crowd while a “religious flag” was hoisted at the Red Fort in Delhi on Republic Day, Deep Sidhu, a Punjabi actor-cum-activist, was chased away by farmers soon after the incident. In a video clip, Mr. Sidhu can be seen sitting on a tractor when a group of farmers confront him over his presence at the Red Fort. Amid heated arguments with the group, in which the farmers hurl abuses and accuse him of damaging the entire movement against the farm Acts, Mr. Sidhu can then be seen jumping from the tractor and, with the help of a few other people, rushing away from the spot on a motorcycle. Mr. Sidhu has been a close associate of BJP Lok Sabha MP from Gurdaspur Sunny Deol, and had campaigned for him during the 2019 Lok Sabha election. However, Mr. Deol on Tuesday distanced himself from Mr. Sidhu and made it clear that neither he nor his family members had any links with Mr. Sidhu. In a tweet, Mr. Deol said: “I am very sad to see what happened on the Red Fort today, I have already made it clear on Twitter on 6 December that I or my family has no connection with Deep Sidhu.” Mr. Sidhu had justified his actions, stating that the ‘Nishan Sahib’ had been hoisted at Red Fort as a symbolic protest against the farm laws, and that at no point was the tricolour removed from the post or the national flag insulted. Meanwhile, farmers’ outfits condemned Mr. Sidhu’s actions and accused him of working at the behest of the Central government. “Deep Sidhu is an agent of the government and he did it at the behest of the Centre to defame the farmers’ agitation,” said Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan on Wednesday. Gurnam Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Chaduni) said Mr. Sidhu’s actions were condemnable and that he had misguided the protesters. “We didn’t have any plan to go to the Red Fort,” he said in a video message.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-flay-deep-sidhus-actions-call-him-govt-agent/article33680270.ece
28 January 2021||CHENNAI,||Covaxin effective against U.K. virus variant, says study||Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has been found to neutralise the U.K. variant of the COVID-19 virus with “similar efficiency” as the strain used for making the vaccine and hence “dispels the uncertainty of possible neutralisation escape” following vaccination, say results posted on the bioRxiv preprint server. Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed and published in medical journals. The work was carried out by researchers from ICMR and Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad. The sera from people vaccinated with Covaxin were tested against the same strain used for making the vaccine, another strain found in India , and the U.K. variant. The median ratio of 50% neutralisation of sera was found to be 80% for the U.K. variant and 90% for the strain circulating in India, but different from the one used for making the vaccine, Samiran Panda of the ICMR and one of the authors of the preprint told The Hindu . The study was conducted using sera collected from 38 people who have been vaccinated with Covaxin during the Phase-2 trial. Researchers from ICMR’s Pune-based National Institute of Virology and Bharat Biotech found that the vaccine has “comparable neutralisation activity” against the U.K. variant and the strain used for making the vaccine. Explaining how the neutralisation studies are carried out, Dr. Panda said that the virus isolated from people is grown in the lab using cell lines. When viruses successfully grow in them, the pathogenic effects of the viruses are observed in the cells. The sera taken from vaccinated people are then added to the cell line culture system, and its ability to prevent the virus from causing pathogenic effects is observed. In this case, the sera taken from vaccinated people was able to neutralise the virus and hence prevent pathogenic effects being produced in the cell lines containing the virus. The U.K. variant was isolated and characterised from people returning from there. The variant isolated from returnees had “all signature mutations of the U.K. variant”, the authors say. The manuscript has been submitted to the Journal of Travel Medicine for publication, Dr. Balram Bhargava, Director-General of ICMR told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-effective-against-uk-virus-variant-says-study/article33680279.ece
28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC asks for timeline on appointments||The Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the government about the delay in clearing Collegium recommendations for judicial appointments to various High Courts. A Bench of Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant asked the Centre whether there was a timeline for government clearance of such recommendations. “If you don’t give comments for five months on Collegium recommendations, it is a matter of great concern,” Justice Kaul said. The Bench noted how recommendations from the High Courts of Bombay and Allahabad date back to May or June last year. It said 189 proposals for judicial appointments were still pending. “What is your timeline to respond to these recommendations of judges appointment? The government has taken more than a year to respond... You say something is pending with Intelligence Bureau and some Chief Minister has not responded. We want to know your timeline,” the court addressed Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal. The Bench served notice on High Courts which were not party to the petition filed by Lok Prahari, an NGO, seeking the appointment of additional judges in High Courts. “We expect the High Courts to express their views in the present matter. The High Courts that are not impleaded shall be impleaded as party respondents in the instant matter,” the apex court directed. In February last year, the Supreme Court had conveyed its alarm at the rising number of judicial vacancies in various High Courts. Some of them were functioning only with half their sanctioned strength. Mr. Venugopal, at the time, explained that the Collegium had also delayed the appointment process. The government’s delay was largely because it thoroughly combed through the antecedents of the candidate. The process, on an average, takes at least 127 days. On the other hand, the judiciary takes 119 days on an average merely to forward the file to the government, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-asks-for-timeline-on-appointments/article33680289.ece
28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Conservationist joins panel on elephant corridor case||The Supreme Court on Wednesday appointed conservationist Nandita Hazarika as Member of a Technical Committee constituted by it on October 14 last year to hear complaints by land owners against the action taken by the Nilgris Collector, which included sealing of their buildings and allegations about the “arbitrary variance in acreage of the elephant corridor.” The order came after a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde was informed of the death of one of the committee members, Ajay Desai, through an application filed by the Hospitality Association of Mudumalai. On October 14, the top court upheld the Tamil Nadu government’s authority to notify an ‘elephant corridor’ and protect the migratory path of the animals through the Nilgiri biosphere reserve. The reserve is the largest protected forest area in India, spanning across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. A three-judge Bench led by CJI Bobde had said it was the State’s duty to protect a “keystone species” such as elephants, immensely important to the environment. The corridor is situated in the ecologically fragile Sigur plateau, which connects the Western and the Eastern Ghats and sustains elephant populations and their genetic diversity. It has the Nilgiri Hills on its southwestern side and the Moyar River Valley on its north-eastern side. The elephants cross the plateau in search of food and water.  The Supreme Court judgment was based on 32 appeals filed by resorts/private land owners, including Bollywood actor Mithun Chakraborty, against a Madras High Court decision of July 2011. The High Court had confirmed a State government order of August 2010, notifying the corridor. The three-member Technical Committee of the National Elephant 2 Action Plan also includes former Madras High Court judge, Justice K. Venkatraman; and Praveen Bhargava, trustee of Wildlife First.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/conservationist-joins-panel-on-elephant-corridor-case/article33680249.ece
28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC stays arrest of Karnataka CM||The Supreme Court on Wednesday protected Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa from arrest in a corruption case concerning the 2011 denotification of a housing project proposal for middle and low income groups on 26 acres in Bengaluru, allegedly to make “illegal monetary gain”. HC order A Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde further agreed to examine Mr. Yediyurappa’s challenge against a January 5, 2021 order of the High Court of Karnataka restoring the corruption complaint filed against him by a private investor, A. Alam Pasha, whose infrastructure development company had applied for the Rs. 600-crore project before it was withdrawn. The apex court did not stay the January 5 order of the High Court. When senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for Mr. Yediyurappa, raised apprehensions about arrest, Chief Justice Bobde initially responded “you [Mr. Yediyurappa] are the Chief Minister. Who can issue a warrant against you?” The court, however, ordered that “there shall be stay of arrest in the meantime”. It issued notice to Mr. Pasha. Mr. Yediyurappa has raised the question of law whether “a court can proceed under the Prevention of Corruption Act against a public servant without prior sanction on the ground that he had allegedly demitted office which he was alleged to have abused”.       On January 5, 2021, the High Court had restored the complaint filed by Mr. Pasha on the ground that “no sanction for prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act is necessary after demitting office or retirement of the public servant”. The High Court had ordered the case to be proceeded in accordance with law. The table of events began in April 2012 when Mr. Pasha, who is the managing director of Pash Space International Pvt. Ltd., filed a complaint with the Bengaluru Lokayukta accusing Mr. Yediyurappa, the former State Industries Minister Murugesh R. Nirani and other senior officials of corruption. He alleged that a project proposal to build and establish “value homes for the middle and low income group”, generating employment to 500 people, was approved by the Yediyurappa government via a notification in July, 2010. Twenty-six acres at the Devanahalli Industrial Area in Bengaluru Rural district was allotted for the project. Mr. Pasha’s company had applied for the project. However, the plug was pulled on the project in January, 2011. Mr. Pasha claimed it was done with an alleged intention to divert the project to some other firm for illegal monetary gain. Mr. Pasha also alleged that a letter with his signature was forged to show that his company was not interested in the project. He said no such letter was rendered by his company. Further, the complaint alleged that the 26 acres were carved out of 4,500 acres in the Hardware Park, IT Park and Aerospace at the Devanahalli Industrial Area. The original owners were ignored and ineligible claimants were paid during the acquisition. Subsequently, the Special Judge had ordered an investigation by the Lokayukta in May 2012. In June, 2013, the Special Judge took cognisance of the chargesheet and registered a case of corruption and issued summons to Mr. Yediyurappa and the others. In October 2013, the High Court quashed the case for lack of previous sanction for prosecution of public servants. Two months later, in December 2012, Mr. Pasha had filed another complaint on the same allegations. This time the Special Judge dismissed the complaint for lack of prior sanction. Following this, Mr. Pasha had moved the High Court against the dismissal to win a favourable order on January 5 this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-stays-arrest-of-karnataka-cm/article33680233.ece

He was speaking at the first edition of SHEPahi, described as a first-of-its-kind initiative for women police personnel. The event saw more than 750 women police personnel in attendance. Actor Anuskha Shetty flagged off three Dial 100 Immediate Response Vehicles and a SHE Shuttle. The Commissioner said women officers are efficient and that 34% of investigating assistants are women. Three drivers of Dial 100 Immediate Response Vehicles – B Ganga, K Geetha and Swapna – learned to drive after joining the police force last October. All women recruits will be trained to drive, he added. He also spoke of the contribution of court constable Pankaja, whose efforts led to conviction of 16 persons. Swati Lakra, Additional Director General of Police, Women Safety Wing, said women officers are equal to their male counterparts. She informed Bharosa Centres, established in 2016, will will reach 10 other places this year. Touching upon the Dial 100 initiative, she said the response time is less than 10 minutes, underscoring that safety of women is priority. Anushka Shetty expressed admiration for women officers and described them as the real stars, and said that she feels safe because of their unflinching hard work. The event saw deliberations on problems faced by women in the police force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/half-of-senior-police-officers-in-cyberabad-are-women-sajjanar/article33680423.ece
28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.S. keen on boosting ties: Lloyd Austin||The new U.S. administration sees India’s importance in the Indo-Pacific region and is keen to strengthen partnership and this was conveyed in an introductory telephone call to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh from the new U.S. Secretary of Defence General Lloyd Austin (retired) on Wednesday, according to an official source. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval too had a telephone call with his U.S. counterpart Jake Sullivan in which they agreed to work collectively to address challenges in the post-COVID era and further expand the comprehensive global strategic partnership, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement. “During the telephonic talk, they reaffirmed their commitment to work together to strengthen the multifaceted India-U.S. defence cooperation and the strategic partnership,” a Defence Ministry statement said on the call between Mr. Singh and Gen. Austin. They also discussed bilateral, regional and global issues, it added. Stating that Gen. Austin calling just two days after being confirmed is significant, the source said Indo-Pacific was highlight of conversation, and the Secretary of Defence made it clear that the U.S. sees India’s importance in this region and is keen to strengthen partnership. In the conversation that lasted 15-20 minutes, Mr. Singh also raised the issue of high technology cooperation between the two countries. In his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. Austin said he would further operationalise India’s ‘Major Defence Partner’ status and continue to build upon existing strong defence cooperation to ensure that the U.S. and Indian militaries can collaborate to address “shared interests”. “I would also seek to deepen and broaden our defence cooperation through the Quad security dialogue and other regional multilateral engagements,” he had said. In possibly a divergence of views with New Delhi, Gen. Austin had said Pakistan had taken “constructive steps” in the Afghanistan peace process and also “taken steps against anti-Indian groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, though this progress is incomplete.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-keen-on-boosting-ties-with-india/article33680287.ece
28 January 2021||R. AvadhaniHARIDASPUR,||Village celebrates its newborn daughters||It’s celebration time in Haridaspur, a remote village in Telangana, whenever a girl is born in the locality. What’s more, all girl children in the village located in Kondapur mandal of Sangareddy district are going to have accounts of Sukanya Samriddi Yojana (SSY), a savings scheme being implemented by the Union government. As many as eight girl children of the village born last year and 49 girls born before that are going to have the SSY accounts shortly. The required amount was handed over to panchayat president Md. Shafi and secretary Rohit Kulkarni by Collector M. Hanumantha Rao on Wednesday. The transformation The village has been witnessing a great transformation. It all began on January 1, 2020 when Satyavati of the village gave birth to Bhavyasri on that day. She was the third girl child in the family. There were issues in the family over the third girl child. Hearing about this, both Mr. Shafi and Mr. Kulkarni visited the family and counselled them saying there was nothing wrong in giving birth to a girl child. They celebrated the birthday of Bhavyasri and since then have been celebrating the birth of every girl child by distributing sweets and lighting lamps. “Haridaspur is the first village in Telangana celebrating birth of girl children for the past one year. It has greatly transformed in the last one year and become a place worth a visit,” said Mr. Hanumantha Rao, promising to extend all the help to the village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/village-celebrates-its-newborn-daughters/article33680245.ece
28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP blames Cong. for Republic Day violence||The BJP on Wednesday accused the Congress of “continuously instigating agitating farmers” which led to the violence during the tractor rally taken out by farmer groups on Republic Day on Tuesday, and singled out the Amarinder Singh government in Punjab for not taking action against “habitual offenders” who, the BJP said, had headed to Delhi for the rally. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, at a press conference late on Wednesday evening, blamed the Congress and the party’s government in Punjab for inciting protesters that led to the violence. “They [the Congress] want to provoke violence, provoke the police to take harsh action, to create instability, that is all the politics the Congress is now reduced to,” he said. “The government has held 10 rounds of talks with farmers’ groups, and also said it was ready to suspend the laws for a year or two, to discuss it clause by clause. The laws dealing with agricultural reform were just to give an option to farmers. The Congress also understands this, but did not want any compromise to work out. They want to spoil the atmosphere in the country only because they lost the election. That the Congress would attempt this on Republic Day shows the depths to which their politics has sunk. They cannot escape responsibility as they are in power in Punjab,” he said. He lauded the Delhi Police for “showing restraint” in the face of provocation. “The Delhi Police showed remarkable restraint yesterday. They had weapons, but they did not use them despite being attacked by swords, rods, lathi s and managed to bring order in a few hours,” he said. “The people of this country have seen all, and will give an appropriate response to this. The Congress tried the same tactics by instigating protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, and now with the farm laws. I’m sure they will try again. Despite the Congress’s efforts, farmers have not agitated in many other States,” he said. The BJP’s official statement in the wake of the violence during the tractor rally shows that it is determined to seize the moral high ground it feels farmer groups have ceded, as violence erupted on Republic Day despite assurances by farm leaders that the protest rally would be peaceful. A section of the party, however, feels that the events have consolidated people in their own positions and the party would have to work hard to remove the anti-farmer tag from itself, especially in Punjab and Haryana. In Haryana, the resignation of Indian National Lok Dal MLA Abhay Chautala is being seen as an attempt to pressure his nephew and Jannayak Janata Party leader Dushyant Chautala to withdraw support from the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government in the State. “We are watching the developments,” a BJP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-blames-cong-for-republic-day-violence/article33680266.ece
28 January 2021||New Delhi,||Owaisi, Viswam file dissent on DNA Bill||Asaddudin Owaisi, president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), and CPI leader Binoy Viswam have filed dissent notes to the parliamentary standing committee’s report on the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 on the grounds that it does not take into account their concerns over privacy violations. They say if enacted, the Bill will target Dalits, Muslims and Adivasis by way of DNA sample collection and indefinite storage. The Standing Committee on Science and Technology, headed by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, will meet on February 1 to discuss and adopt the final report. The Bill proposes DNA sampling and profiling of citizens accused of crime or reported missing, and storing their unique genetic information for administrative purposes. The fear is that the law could be used for caste or community-based profiling. “It is most regrettable that while the finalised draft report recognises the potential dangers of indexing the DNA profiles of non-convicts, especially convicts and suspects, it has still retained these objectionable provisions,” Mr. Owaisi said in his dissent note. The crime data showed that the Indian criminal justice system disproportionately incarcerated Dalits, Muslims and Adivaşis. With this Bill, this targeted discrimination would be encoded into the law, he said. The Bill ran afoul with the standards set in the Puttaswamy and Subramanian Swamy judgments of the Supreme Court. “In the absence of a statutory framework protecting the right to privacy, this Bill will cause irreversible damage to individuals’ right to privacy as well as the criminal justice system,” he said. Jairam Ramesh clarifies Mr. Ramesh has countered Mr. Owaisi’s concerns. In a letter to Mr. Owaisi, he said the objective of the Bill was not overarching but limited to the establishment of a regulatory board to regulate the use of DNA technology in consonance with international standards. In his note, Mr. Viswam said, “Without adequate statutory safeguard to protect against the opacity of the law on the sort of information being collected and its unrestricted usage for a variety of purposes this law is susceptible to future misuse and abuse.” The impact that this law would have on Dalit, Adivasis and religious and gender minority was such that he could not support it, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/owaisi-viswam-file-dissent-on-dna-bill/article33680293.ece
28 January 2021||MANGALURU,||ODL courses: Mangalore varsity to move court||Mangalore University has decided to challenge in court a recent notification of the State government which offered the exclusive right of conducting Open and Distance Learning (ODL) courses to Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) in Mysuru. The decision has been taken as otherwise with the government’s notification Mangalore University will be forced to wound up its Centre of Distance Education which offers distance education courses. Vice-Chancellor of the university P.S. Yadapadithaya told The Hindu that the issue was discussed in detail in the meeting of the Syndicate, the highest decision making body of the university, on Monday and it was decided to approach court in the matter seeking remedy. Kuvempu University, which also offered distance education courses, has already moved court. Mangalore University too will follow suit. The Centre of Distance Education at Mangalore University now offers BA, B.Com and BBA courses under the distance education mode. In addition, it offerspost-graduate courses in Economics, History, Political Science, Sociology, English, Kannada, Hindi, Commerce and Tourism Administration. The Vice-Chancellor said that if Mangalore University wounded up its distance education courses, it would lose an annual revenue of about Rs. 6 crore. The university has permission from the Distance Education Bureau under the University Grants Commission (UGC) to offer distance education courses till 2020-21. Director of Centre of Distance Education at the university Y. Sangappa said that with the new development, the university has not yet issued any notification inviting applications to its distance education courses for 2020-21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odl-courses-mangalore-varsity-to-move-court/article33680944.ece
28 January 2021||Mumbai/Belagavi,||Uddhav’s call for UT sets off outrage in Karnataka||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said that the disputed border area between Maharashtra and Karnataka should be made an Union Territory until the matter is being heard in the Supreme Court. This sparked off a strong reaction in Karnataka. “Ideally, status quo must be maintained in an area where dispute is being heard in the apex court. But the Karnataka government renamed it Belagavi, gave it the status of the second capital of the State and it holds the Assembly session there. Doesn’t it amount to disrespecting the court?” asked Mr. Thackeray. He was speaking at the launch of a Marathi book on the issue of the ongoing conflict between the two States over the border area. Mr. Thackeray said that the disputed area is Karnataka-occupied Maharashtra and those living there are actually living in Maharashtra. “We never hated Kannada as a language, but we will not tolerate Kannadigas hurting our Marathi brethren,” he said. Maharashtra has been claiming that Belagavi, Karwar, and Nipani should be the part of it as they are Marathi-speaking areas. The Karnataka government has opposed the assertion. “The issue has been going on for many years. At least for the time the matter is being heard at the Supreme Court, why can’t it be made a Union Territory?” said the Maharashtra Chief Minister. While Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is yet to react to the comment, several leaders in Belagavi reacted strongly to this, asserting that Belagavi is an integral part of Karnataka. Srimanth Patil, Karnataka Textiles Minister, said he will urge the Chief Minister to ban the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti for its anti-Karnataka stand and other alleged provocative acts. District in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi said, “Mr. Thackery has failed as a Chief Minister on all fronts. His government has no development programmes to take credit for. That is why he is resorting to such provocative statements and acts.” Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Wednesday urged the Congress, which shares power with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, to convince its partner that Belagavi is part of Karnataka. “Congress should give Maharahstra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray a lesson on the issue. It is just not enough to critcise his statements,” he said on Twitter. “Kannadigas and Marathas are living like brothers and one should not poison their minds. A border is a confluence of people from two states. To argue that we are stronger is not right,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disputed-areas-should-be-made-ut-thackeray/article33680564.ece

28 January 2021||New Delhi,||Concerted conspiracy by Modi govt.: Congress||The Congress demanded the immediate sacking of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and alleged that the Republic Day events, where a group of farmers stormed the Red Fort, were a conspiracy drafted by the government to malign the farmers’ peaceful protest. “A concerted conspiracy, aided and abetted by the Modi government, took place to malign the entire farmers’ movement. A set of people with a premeditated motive of violence, who have nothing to do with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha [SKM], were permitted to enter the Red Fort,” Congress general secretary in charge of communications Randeep Surjewala said at a press conference. He claimed that the police facilitated the entry of a group of miscreants into the Red Fort. “Those who did it, Deep Sidhu and gang, have been seen in the past cohabiting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. Instead of arresting them then and there, they were permitted to go back. The police were mute spectators,” he alleged. Deep Sidhu is a Punjabi actor, who has been part of the protests from the beginning. Mr. Surjewala said there were 400-500 people present at the Red Fort. Instead of arresting them, the police were now registering false cases on leaders of the SKM, he added.  ‘Security lapse’ “It is a colossal security lapse and intelligence failure on the part of none less than the Home Minister of the country, Amit Shah. He should be sacked without delay,” he said. The Left parties also issued statements on similar lines. The CPI(M) Polit Bureau said the untoward incidents of Tuesday should not detract the focus from the main demand. “These incidents, handiwork of agent provocateurs, some with links to the ruling party, have been denounced by the entire farmers’ movement,” its statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/conspiracy-to-malign-farmers-movement/article33680272.ece

That was set aside by the High Court and his sentence was reduced to one year under Section 354 (assault of a women to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code... This is very disturbing,” Mr. Venugopal submitted. “Mr. Venugopal, do you remember how we took cognisance when the Attorney General mentioned about a judge ordering a public hanging?” Chief Justice asked Mr. Venugopal, who said he did. Issues notice The Bench issued notice to the accused and to the State of Maharashtra after registering a case on the basis of Mr. Venugopal’s mentioning. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had asked the State government to urgently appeal the High Court judgment. Meanwhile, several organisations, including the Youth Bar Association of India, represented by advocate Manju Jetley, also moved the top court against the High Court judgment. The petitioners said they were “badly perturbed” to note that the January 19 verdict contained several observations about the victim child’s modesty, which were both “derogatory and defamatory”. The child was even named in the judgment, the petition said. “Abuse and outraging the modesty of a child has been a matter of great concern. The POCSO Act was enacted to deal with evil and to impart speedy justice. Special courts were formed.

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Govt. conspiracy led to violence, say farmers||Mr. Rajewal also alleged that Mr. Sidhu, who has been linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and associated with Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the person who instigated the flag hoisting at the Red Fort. “It was a historic parade by lakhs of farmers with more than 2 lakh tractors, and 99.9% of the farmers stayed peaceful,” Mr. Rajewal said at a press conference of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the joint front of protesting farm unions, at the Singhu border on Wednesday night. Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Srivastava said the unions had not followed the terms laid down for the parades, alleging that the farmer leaders made inflammatory speeches and were involved in the violence that left 394 personnel injured. He added that a Special Investigation Team was being set up which will question all culprits, including farm unions. Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav asked how the police had not been able to control protesters before they entered a national monument. “The question must be asked — who let them in, who opened the gate? We must remember that the Red Fort is guarded not just by the police but by the armed forces as well,” said Mr. Yadav, who was also named in the FIR, although he has not been part of the farmers’ delegation during the negotiations. “It is very clear that the government was very worried by our agitation, which has been carried out peacefully for months,” said Shiv Kumar Kakkaji of the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh. He said the government conspiracy had specifically targeted Punjabi farmers, adding that this attempt to separate the Punjab unions from the wider movement would fail. “This was a deep rooted conspiracy to knock down the peaceful and strong farmers’ struggle,” an SKM statement said.  “The farmers’ organisations resolved to continue this agitation and harshly condemned the government and its administration, the said farmers’ organisation and anti-social elements, who tried to damage the peaceful farmers struggle.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/violence-a-result-of-govt-plot-say-farmers/article33680251.ece

28 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||PRC estimates net additional burden of Rs. 2,252 crore||The Pay Revision Commission (PRC) has estimated the net additional expenditure on account of implementation of its recommendations to be around Rs. 2,252 crore. Notwithstanding the recommendation of fitment benefit of 7.5%, the commission calculated it on the basis of “10% fitment and fixation benefit” working out to Rs. 1,272 crore. House rent allowance is expected to pose an additional burden of Rs. 135 crore while other allowances including the city compensatory allowance and special pay would entail Rs. 170 crore expenditure taking the total to Rs. 1,577 crore. Implementation of PRC recommendations for pensioners is expected to result in additional expenditure to the tune of Rs. 600 crore and another Rs. 75 crore on account of their medical allowances, taking the total to Rs. 675 crore. The commission said that the actual figures for 2018-19 were taken as base as the new scales were evolved by merging the dearness allowance that existed as on July 1, 2018. The commission lamented that only 61% of the sanctioned strength of employees were working in the State. As against a population of 3.52 crore, the sanctioned strength was 4.91 lakh, which was 1.4%. This translates to 14 posts sanctioned for every 1,000 population in the State. “But the actual number of employees working being 3,00,178, the ratio of government employees actually available for every 1,000 is 8.5,” the PRC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prc-estimates-net-additional-burden-of-rs-2252-crore/article33680884.ece
28 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||PDS supply affected across Kerala||Supply of foodgrains came to a halt on Wednesday morning after technical glitches in Aadhaar-based electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) machines affected the Public Distribution System in the State. Distribution of food kits and monthly allocation of foodgrains was affected due to network issues, which prevented authentication of the consumers. “The system was working fine till 10 a.m. We had managed to distribute food kits to a few people in the morning. But after that, we have been unable to get connected to the server. The server has gone down intermittently in the past too,” said the owner of a rationshop at Kuravankonam in the capital. The second phase of distribution of free food kits had begun on January 23. Customers who came to collect the kits to the various ration shops in the State on Wednesday went back empty-handed. Long queues were witnessed outside some of the ration shops in recent days due to slow network response. “I had set aside the morning for collecting the food kit. The shop owner had tried my card number in the machine, but there has been no response. Now that the machine is not working, I will have to come back later,” said Sarasamma, a resident of Marappalam in the capital. Minister for Civil Supplies P.Thilothaman told The Hindu that the technical team has been apprised about the network issue. “We have informed the technical team about this issue. There have been some network outages in the recent past too. We have held discussions with them on this,” said the Minister. Sabotage threat Earlier this week, after the distribution of food kits began, the general manager of the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) had warned employees against alleged attempts to sabotage the distribution. The ePoS machines were introduced in ration shops in 2018 to prevent leakage at every stage in the public distribution system, ensuring that the benefits accrued to the actual beneficiaries and help monitor the movement of ration articles. All ration shops in the State, numbering to around 14,000, have been equipped with the machine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pds-supply-affected-across-kerala/article33680239.ece

28 January 2021||Hyderabad,||PRC recommends 7.5% fitment for employees||The Pay Revision Commission, the first constituted after the formation of Telangana, has recommended a fitment of 7.5% for employees at different levels, much to their disappointment. Now, employees have submitted representations seeking 65% fitment. In its report submitted to the government recently, the PRC recommended a minimum pay of Rs. 19,000. The 7.5% fitment should be added to the total basic pay and to this, the dearness allowance admissible as on July 1, 2018, estimated at 30.39% should be added. The PRC cited the financial constraints faced by the State as the reason behind considering the 7.5% fitment. The commission, however, said that the revised pay scales should come into force from July 1, 2018, much to the relief of employees who can now expect arrears. PRC recommended enhancement of retirement age from the existing 58 to 60 years. The commission said that the previous PRC had recommended a minimum pay of Rs. 13,000, which in effect was revised to Rs. 13,825 due to enhancement of fitment from 29% to 43%. The minimum pay had now been revised to Rs. 19,000 (Rs. 13,825 + DA 30.392% + fitment 7.5%). Employees’ salaries should be fixed based on the relevant revised scale at the next stage, the commission said, adding that if an employee’s pay when fixed falls short of the minimum in revised scale, it should be fixed at the minimum scale. If the amount fixed exceeds that, excess should be treated as personal pay and should be absorbed in future pay increases or in the stagnation of increments sanctioned. The commission said it retained the master scale concept with 32 grades and 80 segments. The new scale was evolved by merging DA with basic pay as on July 1, 2018. The maximum pay in the master scale was worked out to Rs. 1,62,070 a month representing the minimum maximum ratio of 1:8.53. The existing practice of sanctioning DA twice a year should continue and the commission recommended conversion factor of 0.91% for sanction of DA with effect from January 1, 2019. This would mean that for every 1% increase in DA sanctioned by the Central government, the DA sanctioned to State government employees would be 0.91%. The PRC however, revised the HRA, dropping the existing rates of 30%, 20%, 14.5% and 12% in different parts of the State based on population to 24%, 17%, 13% and 11% respectively. And, it said this had been done keeping in view the seventh Central Pay Commission recommendations. Additional HRA in lieu of rent free accommodation had been retained at 8% basic pay, but the monetary ceiling should be increased from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,500. It also recommended streamlining the cashless treatment under employees’ health scheme by collecting 1% of basic pay from employees and 1% of basic pension from pensioners and creating a separate reserve as in the case of Aarogya Bhadrata.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prc-recommends-75-fitment-for-employees/article33680235.ece

28 January 2021||Kochi,||Kerala HC seeks report on tunnel work in limbo||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed Dr Sivakumar Babu, a scientist appointed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), to study the slope stability of Kuthiran tunnel on the stretch of Vadakkancherry to Mannuthy on the National Highway 47, and to file a report regarding the ongoing construction work for the tunnel. Justice P.V. Asha issued the order on a petition filed by K.Rajan, Assembly Chief Whip and Ollur MLA seeking to open at least one of the tunnels by completing the remaining works. He also sought to constitute an expert committee or any other agency to supervise and monitor the ongoing six-lane construction works to ensure effective completion of the works within a specified time frame. He pointed to the recent incident where rocks fell inside the tunnel while the operations for removing earth was going on. The NHAI submitted that the entire project works had come to a standstill due to a financial crisis. A meeting of financiers, NHAI officers and the representatives of the construction company would be held on Thursday. The work on the tunnels was moving at a snail’s pace. Once the financial issue was solved, the work of one tunnel could be completed within three months. In fact, 90 per cent work of that tunnel was over. When asked by the court whether three months were required for completing the remaining works, the NHAI replied that the tunnel could be commissioned after a thorough study and also approval from various agencies. Assurance The counsel for the construction company assured that the work would be completed before March 31. The work of left end side (Walayar-Palakkad stretch) was in progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-hc-seeks-report-on-tunnel-work-in-limbo/article33680236.ece

28 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||All commercial establishments to have digital water meters soon||The Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) is set to complete the project of fixing digital water meters with automated meter reading (AMR) in all commercial establishments in the city in February. Of the 12,708 commercial and water-intensive establishments, including companies, hotels and educational institutions, identified across the city, the water board has fixed digital meters in about 10,500 buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the project, according to officials. The installation of the remaining smart meters, procured with funding under the Smart City Mission, would be completed in February. Commercial establishments using about 500 kilolitres fall in the water-intensive category and would be charged Rs. 60 per 1,000 litres. The rates would differ according to the category. The meters would record and transmit the data to a central system through radio frequency. This would help officials read and monitor the meters from the area office concerned and the head offices every month. Consumers would get text messages about the bill. At present, meter reading is taken through manual checking system and hand-held devices. Once the meters are fixed, the board expects the revenue to go up by 15% to 20%. The cost of the meters would be collected from the consumer along with the bill, the officials said. The meters have been procured from Hitron, a French company, as part of the Rs. 9.5 crore project to encourage judicious use of drinking water. With abundant storage in city reservoirs, the water board is supplying 830.41 million litres of water a day. While nearly 792.04 mld is provided through pipelines and lorries, the remaining is supplied to industries, bulk consumers and neighbouring local bodies. The CMWSSB proposes to extend the metering system to consumers in core areas of the city in the next phase. This had been proposed as a package for distribution in the project to build the fourth desalination plant with a capacity to treat 400 mld of seawater at Perur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/all-commercial-establishments-to-have-digital-water-meters-soon/article33680827.ece
28 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CMRL may decide to build ballast tracks at Poonamallee depot||Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. is mulling laying ballast tracks in one of the depots as part of its phase II project. There will be two depots in the phase II project for maintenance of trains, one in Poonamallee and another at Madhavaram. The CMRL has been considering laying a ballast track — the traditional track as can be seen in Indian railways with crushed stones laid between rails — in the Poonamallee depot to save on capital expenditure. According to officials of the CMRL, no decision has been taken on whether Madhavaram depot will have ballast or ballastless tracks. “This depot, built at a cost of Rs. 225 crore, will have 24 tracks and we think we can save substantially on the initial investment with ballast tracks,” an official said. The soil has to be treated if a ballastless track is to be laid at Poonamallee depot and this may cost Rs. 80 crore to Rs. 90 crore. But sources say this may not be a good idea as ballast tracks will push up the cost of maintenance. “Ballastless is the way forward and hence was laid at Koyambedu years ago for the phase I project and has been in operation with barely any issue at all in the last several years now. Why at all switch to a ballast track now for a depot alone? What they want to save in the initial capital cost will be spent on maintenance over the years. Also, the maintenance of the ballast track is much more difficult as well,” a source said. Another source said ballastless tracks serve a longer period without causing much issue when compared to ballast tracks. “The phase II is estimated to cost Rs. 61,843 crore. When we are spending so much for the whole project and laying a ballastless track across the 118.9 km network itself, I wonder if we have to really save on this issue. Even in Koyambedu, the soil had to be treated although it did cost less when compared to the Poonamallee depot,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cmrl-may-decide-to-build-ballast-tracks-at-poonamallee-depot/article33680835.ece
28 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Need to look at issues concerning children with more sensitivity’||The need for sensitive reporting and effectively looking at issues concerning children and their rights came under the spotlight at a media and child rights seminar organised by the Asian College of Journalism in collaboration with the Unicef on Wednesday. Moderating a session on “Reporting on children from a gender lens: ethics and guidelines for journalists,” Kavita Chowdhury, an independent journalist, said the coverage on children was inconsistent and lacked depth. “There is a need to go beyond the routine and look at many stories around us with a humanitarian angle,” she said. “If an incident involving children is important, so is the context. Reporters need to give a holistic picture without judgment. If you look at any problem without focusing on the context, you will do more of a disservice,” said journalist Ashwaq Masoodi, addressing the students from ACJ. Drawing from her experience, Ms. Masoodi spoke about her interactions with children from a juvenile home and how important it was to speak a different language — a sensitive one to communicate with them. Speaking about menstruation, sanitation facilities in schools, female foeticide and child marriages, Kavitha Muralidharan, an independent journalist, said that most reports at the moment were largely incident-based and these needed to be seen as broader issues. “The media needs to keep in mind and follow several basics — such as not mentioning the name of the survivor. It is important to be effective and responsible voices for children to highlight their issues,” she said. Pooja Nair, a psychotherapist, stressed on the need to talk of gender and sexuality in an open, expansive way and that gender should be a part of conversations about child rights. “Children who do not conform know that they are different but this means that they internalise the idea that they are different in a bad way. This is what the regime of gendering results in the internalisation of shame,” she said. Speaking during a session about “Communicating with children during emergencies and experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic,” Sonal Kapoor, founder, Protsahan India Foundation, questioned if it was too much to expect basic empathy from the government and the system towards children. “We need to pass the mic on to children and listen to them, and look at the community in which they are surviving in at a time like this, during a pandemic. We think we know better, but as a society, we are only now learning,” she said. Nandini Raman, a consultant counsellor, said while the pandemic had been hard on everyone, children had it even harder but had managed to show resilience. “There has been a significant rise in the number of parents who have come to us to speak to their children during the pandemic. We need to talk to our children and tell them it is okay for them to get help. While privileged children know they can get help, there is a large section of children who can’t access this. For many others, stigma still outweighs everything else,” she said. At a time when education and learning have largely gone online over the last 10 months, S. Gomathi, director, AhaGuru, spoke about how teachers had to adapt to the new normal. “The classroom atmosphere cannot be replicated as it is online. Teachers are coming up with ways to ensure students participate and engage them,” she said. She shed light on how, through AID India, they were reaching out to students in rural areas and addressing issues of lack of access.  Children who do not conform know that they are different but this means that they internalise the idea that they are different in a bad way Pooja Nair, Psychotherapist||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/need-to-look-at-issues-concerning-children-with-more-sensitivity/article33680828.ece
28 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tatkal LPG supply scheme trial to be launched in Vellore||The Indian Oil Corporation will initially launch the tatkal scheme for supply of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) refills for customers with single bottles on a trial basis in Vellore in Tamil Nadu. Under this scheme, which is to be launched pan India soon, single bottle customers (SBC), meaning those having only one cylinder, would be able to get refills within two hours of booking on payment of an additional Rs. 25 per cylinder. The payment has to be done online. Around 60% of customers in the State manage with only cylinder and do not opt for a second cylinder. “This is mostly the scenario in rural households whereas in urban centres, you can see over 70% of customers with double bottle connections,” explained an official source. Vellore town was chosen for the trial due to its size and large number of SBCs. There are 10 distributors and the additional amount is meant for them since they have to keep a vehicle and cylinders ready for such Tatkal deliveries once the scheme is launched. However, distributors say that the scheme may not receive much patronage since only around 17% of customers have opted for online payment modes. “It was 5% till last year. The COVID-19 lockdown drove the figure up. People in other places are still not comfortable with online payment,” said a distributor. Another distributor in the city said that supply within two hours would not be a possibility if the supply is affected. “There are times when the LPG bottling plant goes for maintenance or there may be some strike or labour issue. At times, the demand may be high and we would be managing with a backlog of two days or so. In such cases, this tatkal scheme would be a problem,” he said. Another distributor said they were already having issues with preferred delivery time where customers pay extra for deliveries during a specified time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tatkal-lpg-supply-scheme-trial-to-be-launched-in-vellore/article33680839.ece

Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, urging him to ensure that the Sri Lankan government implements the 13th Amendment in letter and spirit. The party’s MPs also signed the letter, sent ahead of the 46th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). The UNHRC meeting is scheduled to take up past resolutions for creating an independent international mechanism for an inquiry to do justice to Eelam Tamils for the war crimes and other human rights violations committed by the Sri Lankan armed forces. Recalling External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s statement during his recent visit to Sri Lanka, Mr. Stalin said that while the Minister was only restating the Indian position on issues of power like devolution at the domestic level, he was silent on the UNHRC processes. “It is unclear whether he had really and meaningfully taken it up with Sri Lanka’s President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister,” he said. “It is now clear that the Government of Sri Lanka has seriously failed to honour its UNHRC commitments under Resolution 40/1, and has also been reluctant to take forward constructive and internationally acceptable measures for accountability in the matters of war crimes and all human rights violations,” the letter said. It had failed to bring forward substantive constitutional and administrative initiatives to uphold the dignity of the Tamils. Mr. Stalin said successive Sri Lankan governments had only whittled down the powers and authority of the provincial councils, even 34 years after the 13th Amendment was passed, treating the provincial councils with scant respect to their own Constitution. “The actions of these governments have deviated from the commitments made under the India-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987,” he said. With all Tamil parties in Sri Lanka unanimously appealing to the member-states of the UNHRC, including India, to work for referring Sri Lanka to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for ensuring effective international accountability over war crimes and other human rights violations, the Prime Minister should ensure at the personal and diplomatic levels that the Sri Lankan government implemented the 13th Amendment, he said. “You may recall that India has voted against Sri Lanka at UNHRC in the past. I, therefore, request you to effectively cause India to take the initiative in an earnest manner and implore other member-nations of UNHRC early so as to move the issue collectively and ensure that the appeals of joint Tamil representation from Sri Lanka are met at the 46th session of UNHRC,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-sri-lanka-implements-13th-amendment-stalin/article33680372.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy accepted a plea made by senior counsel Sriram Panchu, representing a writ petitioner who had challenged the law, and directed the Centre to file its response within four weeks. The direction was issued after the State government filed a 76-page counter affidavit, defending the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on a preferential basis to Students of Government Schools Act of 2020. The counter, filed through Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan, stated that 435 of the 5,567 MBBS and BDS seats were allotted to government school students for the academic year 2020-21 on the basis of the Act. “Government school students form a distinct and special category/class by themselves due to their economic, social and educational backwardness,” the government asserted, adding that it was fully competent to pass legislation providing horizontal reservation for them. Filing the counter affidavit on behalf of the Chief Secretary too, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said government school students had been found as socially, educationally and economically backward as per a report submitted by retired High Court judge P. Kalaiyarasan. The government stated that the law only provided a level-playing field for all students. After receiving a copy of the counter affidavit, senior counsel Rev. Fr. Xavier Arulraj, representing another writ petitioner, urged the court to grant him two weeks to file a rejoinder. The judges adjourned further hearing by four weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-centres-stand-on-quota-in-medical-seats/article33680820.ece

They said any meaningful public hearing was possible only after the EIA report was available. M. Yuvan, an avian expert, said the proposed harbour at Kazhiveli lagoon was in the Important Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Area. The area attracts 80 species of migratory birds, including plovers, terns, gulls, sandpipers and so on. A harbour project in such a sensitive area required a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, said K. Saravanan of the Coastal Resource Centre, Chennai. “The proposed fishing harbour will cater primarily to largescale mechanised fishery. Increasing the depth would hurt the livelihood of the small fisherfolk who use both motorised and non-motorised boats,” said Sathish Kumar from Alambarai. Two breakwaters had been proposed at the fishing harbour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/environment-study-sought-for-harbour/article33680829.ece

The land, which turned into a waterbody, belongs to the Revenue Department. The waterbody used to attract a large number of migratory birds because of its proximity to the Pallikaranai marshland. However, vested interests filled it up by dumping debris and tried to convert the land into house plots. In addition to garbage, the waterbody was filled with wild grass and hyacinth. Buffer zone A senior official of the Perungudi zone of the Corporation said the waterbody had become a buffer zone for pumping out rainwater from Taramani and Velachery during the northeast monsoon. But due to poor maintenance, it was filled with garbage, debris and wild grass. The civic body cleaned the waterbody by deploying an amphibian vehicle, and removed the vegetation and the garbage. While social activists welcomed the initiative, they want the Revenue department to hand over the waterbody to the Corporation for better maintenance and protection. Residents pointed out that the water spread located on the north side of the railway tracks could be converted into a water park on the lines of the Villivakkam tank, which is being restored by the civic body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-cleans-restores-kallukuttai-lake/article33680833.ece

Stalin on Wednesday criticised the AIADMK government for opening former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s mausoleum without bringing to light the truth about her death, as demanded by Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam during his rebellion in 2017. Speaking at a function here, he said the mausoleum was being inaugurated for a person who was found guilty of corruption and sent to jail. [The Supreme Court, while upholding the conviction of the co-accused, had held that the charges against Jayalalithaa stood abated in view of her death]. “The person inaugurating the mausoleum had got a stay from the Supreme Court on a CBI probe ordered by the Madras High Court. Such is the state of affairs today,” he said. Mr. Stalin said it had been 50 months since Jayalalithaa died. “It has been nearly four years. A ‘dharma yuddham’ [by Mr. Panneerselvam] took place for an investigation. It has been 48 months since that happened, and an inquiry commission was formed 42 months ago,” he said. The DMK president said it was Mr. Panneerselvam who sought an investigation into Jayalalithaa’s death. “It has been 25 months since he was called to depose before the commission. He has been called multiple times, but he has not gone [there],” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-criticises-unveiling-of-late-cms-mausoleum/article33680373.ece

28 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC restrains govt. from throwing open Jayalalithaa’s residence for public viewing||The Madras High Court on Wednesday restrained the Tamil Nadu government from throwing open to the public a memorial set up by the government at former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s residence, Veda Nilayam, in Chennai. Justice N. Seshasayee passed the order after her legal heirs J. Deepa and J. Deepak complained that an inventory of articles inside the bungalow had not been taken in their presence, despite it reportedly containing several valuables and treasures. The siblings had filed individual writ petitions through their counsel S.L. Sudarsanam and K.V. Sundararajan and challenged the acquisition proceedings primarily on the ground that there was absolutely no public interest involved for the government to acquire a private property. They also urged the court to pass interim orders restraining the government from converting the residence into a memorial until the disposal of their main writ petitions. They said the government had planned an inauguration ceremony for Thursday. Finding force in their submissions, the judge said that in the fitness of things, the government should have refrained from inaugurating the memorial when the legal heirs were clueless about the articles available inside the house and their monetary value. Nevertheless, since it was reported that all arrangements for the inaugural ceremony had been made, he permitted the ceremony to take place without prejudice to the rights of the petitioners and without conferring any right on the government. “The main gate to the premises of Veda Nilayam alone can be opened during the function. The building Veda Nilayam shall not be opened at any time, even during the function, since taking the inventory of the movables and their valuation is not yet complete. The right, title and interest of the heirs of the Late Chief Minister cannot be marginalised,” the judge said. ‘Hand over keys’ He ordered that whoever was in possession of the keys of Veda Nilayam should hand them over to the HC Registrar-General after the ceremony. The court also ordered that no flex banners or obstructive hoardings be placed at the venue and directed the Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai, to ensure that no undue inconvenience was caused to those residing in the locality. The judge further directed the High Court Registry to list the cases, filed by the legal heirs, for further hearing on February 24.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-restrains-govt-from-throwing-open-jayalalithaas-residence-for-public-viewing/article33680369.ece

28 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Defence Officers’ Colony residents complain about cattle shed||The residents of Defence Officers’ Colony in Nandambakkam, near Guindy, have complained that they have been facing hardship ever since a cattle shed was opened in the locality a few months ago. Set up on a vacant piece of land, the shed had become a source of nuisance because of the dumping of cow dung in the stormwater drain and also discharge of wastewater. They said the cattle shed violated the rules of the Greater Chennai Corporation. M.N. Rangamani, an office-bearer of the Tamil Nadu Area Defence Officers’ Cooperative Housing Society Ltd., said most of the residents in the layout were retired defence personnel. Parashuram, who lives near the spot, complained that the owners of the shed, which housed a number of cows and calves, were letting liquid and solid waste into a pit dug inside the compound. The pit was linked to the stormwater drain. Constant discharge of wastewater from the cattle shed, besides emitting a stink, made it a breeding ground for mosquitoes, he said. Plea to TNPCB Several petitions to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and the Corporation had not yielded any result. TNPCB officials visited the cattle shed only once based on a complaint but did not take any steps to contain the release of wastewater into the stormwater drain beyond levying a fine. The pollution control board officials passed the buck to the Corporation regarding the closure of the shed, said a resident. A senior official of the Corporation’s Alandur zone said local health officials had been asked to inspect the spot, and the shed would be closed if it is found to be a health hazard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/defence-officers-colony-residents-complain-about-cattle-shed/article33680836.ece

28 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ramadoss raises doubts over alliance with AIADMK||PMK founder S. Ramadoss raised serious doubts over the AIADMK-PMK alliance on Wednesday, alleging that the ruling party’s leadership has not responded to its modified demand of internal reservation for Vanniyars within the MBC quota. “The Chief Minister is keeping quiet. There has been no effort on their part to discuss the reservation issue. They said they would get back after Pongal but we did not receive any word from them. There are no legal tangles. We have come down from separate reservations to internal reservations within the MBC, but we are being told that these issues can be looked into after the election. How can this be accepted?” he asked during a virtual interaction with the media. “We joined the AIADMK-led alliance in February 2019 and then Anbumani met the Chief Minister in August 2019 regarding separate reservation for Vanniyars. I have written several letters and received no response from the Chief Minister,” he said. Two Ministers, who had met him last month, promised to resolve the issue in a matter of days. “After that, I did not hear from them. Again, two Ministers came to meet me before Pongal. We explained the whole story and we had modified our demand to internal reservation within the MBC quota,” he said. Faults Karunanidhi “A Narikuravar candidate had to compete with a candidate from a developed Backward Caste community until 1989. After that, MBC was created. I had suggested creation of 6 compartments in a scientific way just like other States to Kalaignar (DMK leader M. Karunanidhi). But he conspired and did not do it,” he contended. “Which community or parties are opposing this demand? Educationally, economically, socially and politically, Vanniyars and Vanniyar-populated districts are lagging behind. Of the 20 Chief Ministers the State has seen, Vanniyars have not even taken charge as the ‘acting Chief Minister’. Of the 23 Vice-Chancellors [now], there is not a single Vanniyar,” he said. He rejected that such a decision could be taken only on the basis of a report by a commission that has been instituted. “So far, a number of commissions such as Sattanathan Commission, Ambasankar Commission, K.N. Natarajan Commission, Janardhanan Commission, Thanikachalam Commission and Kulasekaran Commission have been constituted. These recommendations have not been implemented. It is just to delay action,” he charged. PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss said, “All we are asking for is internal reservation within the MBC quota. This is a developmental issue, not just a caste issue,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ramadoss-raises-doubts-over-alliance-with-aiadmk/article33680341.ece

28 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||College students develop satellite||Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology has developed a satellite which the Indian Space Research Organisation will launch on February 28. The college’s 12 students with support from faculty had developed the satellite, Sri Shakti Sat, at around Rs. 2 crore. The satellite would be a part of the UNITYSat, which would also include satellites built by two other institutions – one in Chennai and another in Nagpur, said its chairman S. Thangavelu at a press meet held here on Wednesday. The journey to develop the satellite started around 10 years ago when the college started postgraduate courses in VLSI and a few other disciplines and after a few other education institutions launched satellites. In the run-up to building the satellite, students and faculty from various disciplines worked together, experimented, went back to learning a few basic concepts and in the process the college had gained immensely in that it now wanted to offer papers on building satellites. The college had also learnt techniques to improve the teaching-learning process, Mr. Thangavelu added. K. Gopalakrishnan, academic and governing council member, said the satellite was for technology demonstration – to study on-board command, data handling, electronic power and communication system at low earth orbit. The satellite weighed around 500 gm and would be pushed into orbit by ISRO’s PSLV C-51. ISRO scientists had helped the college develop the satellite and would launch it at no cost. The space organisation had also helped the college in testing the satellite for various parameters. Mr. Gopalakrishnan said most of the components the college had used to build the satellite were bought off the shelf and were manufactured in the country. Likewise, the college had also used open source software. Mr. Thangavelu said the college had also built a ground station to communicate with the satellite. ISRO Chairman K. Sivan would inaugurate the station from Bengaluru on Thursday.  The satellite will be a part of the UNITYSat, which would also include satellites built by two other institutions S.

Karthik at a press meet held here on Wednesday. It had been 10 years since the DMK government had allotted Rs. 12 crore for the construction of the bridge across the crossing, LC 6, he said. But after the AIADMK government returned to power, there had been hardly any progress in construction. The absence of the bridge had affected residents and people who run their businesses and factories on both sides of the railway track, Mr. Karthik said and added that they were affected because the railways closed the gates at least 50-plus times a day to facilitate the passage of trains. The failure to complete the work was because the AIADMK government had not engaged land owners concerned to acquire land to build service road, he said and added that the Thursday’s protest would highlight the government’s failure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-to-protest-against-delay-in-completing-road-overbridge-across-railway-crossing/article33680854.ece

28 January 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||13th Century hero stones discovered at Talavadi||Four rare 13th Century hero stones erected in memory of heroes who killed cattle thieves were discovered at Thotta Mudukarai village in Talavadi here. A team comprising John Peter from Talavadi Mayyam, and volunteers of Yakkai Foundation Sudhakar Nalliyappan and Kumaravel Ramasamy found the stones in the village. Their findings were confirmed by Senior Epigraphist S. Rasagopal. The stones, with inscriptions in Tamil and Kannada, were reportedly erected in 1249 during the period of Vira Someshwara, a Hoysala King who ruled from 1234 to 1263. The inscription on the first stone says, “In the Chiriya Mudhukarai (Thotta Mudukarai), Manjunan, the son of Rava Kamundan, stabbed four thieves and died.” The second stone says, “Periyathazha Kamundan, the son of Kanga Kamundan and Kappanadazhvan, stabbed two thieves who came to loot cattle and finally died.” The third stone says, “Maadhayan, son of Sankara Kamundan, and his second son fought with the thief who came for looting cattle and finally they died.” The Kannada inscriptions on the fourth stone has been sent to the Mysore Archaeology Department. All the incidents took place in the same year confirming that cattle thefts were common in those days, said the volunteers. Many hero stones representing the cattle theft conflicts as “Aagol Poosal” have been discovered in Tiruvannamalai, Dharmapuri, Vellore and Krishnagiri earlier. But this is the first time the such stones were discovered in Talavadi,” they added. The village is located near the Karnataka border and people, under the Kannada rulers, conversed in Tamil and Kannada. The local people are still worshipping these 772-year-old hero stones as their ancestors, said the volunteers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/13th-century-hero-stones-discovered-at-talavadi/article33680401.ece

He told the reporters here that though the Centre held many rounds of talks with the farmers protesting against the farm laws, a consensus has not been arrived yet. “The purpose of the new farm laws is to enhance the livelihood of the farmers. Unfortunately, the protest by a few misguided farmers is affecting crores of other farmers in the country,” he said.

Taking a dig at DMK president M.K.

28 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Appavu moves HC Bench for release of water from dams||Former DMK MLA M. Appavu has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday seeking a direction to the State to release water from Pechiparai dam through Radhapuram channel so that 52 ponds in the area could be filled with water for the benefit of the agriculturalists. In his petition, Mr. Appavu said that in 1972, the State government had introduced a scheme and as per the scheme a water channel was created. Water from the Pechiparai dam would travel through Thovalai channel and to Radhapuram, which would then fill up 52 ponds in the area. He said that the project was for the benefit of the farmers. He said that approximately 16000 acres of agricultural land would get the benefit directly and 1012 acres of nanjai lands would get the benefit from water stored in the 52 ponds. He said that though the water capacity at the Pechiparai dam was surplus, only limited water was being released and this affected the livelihood of the farmers. In a connected petition, he sought the release of water from the Manimuthar dam as special supply to the ponds in Nanguneri, Radhapuram and Thisayanvilai in Tirunelveli district and Sattankulam and Udangudi in Thoothukudi district. In 2008, the State government initiated steps to meet the demands for adequate drinking water in the region, he said. A request was made to link the Thamirabarani-Karumeniyar-Nambiyar rivers as part of a project. The areas in the region will not face water scarcity if the project is completed. The public is facing a crisis as of now. Therefore, the water from the dam must be released to address the drinking water issue, he said. Taking up both the public interest litigation petitions for hearing, a Division bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi ordered notice to the State government and sought response from authorities concerned. The case was adjourned for the filing of response in the case and further hearing till February 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/appavu-moves-high-court-bench-for-release-of-water-from-dams/article33680386.ece
28 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘108’ ambulances handled 97,000 cases in 3 districts during lockdown||The ‘108’ ambulance service has served over 97,000 cases in Madurai, Theni and Dindigul districts from January to December last year during the COVID-19 pandemic, reveals data obtained from GVK EMRI, which operates ‘108’ ambulance service in collaboration with Tamil Nadu Health Department. Among them, the cases attended to in Madurai are the highest - 39,455. V. Vimal Raj, programme manager, GVK- EMRI, said there was a fall in the number of road accident cases attended to during the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown when compared to the corresponding period in the previous years. These ambulances played a pivotal role in transporting COVID-19 positive patients from their residences to hospitals. Irulandi, a member of ‘108 Ambulances Employees Association,’ said that most drivers and technicians continued to discharge their duty braving the fear of the spread of COVID-19. “Though initially we were sceptical about attending to COVID-19 positive patients, we realised we have to do it as a service to the public. The main advantage was that since the roads were free of vehicles during the lockdown, we could move fast,” he said. Mr. Vimal Raj said that additional ‘108’ ambulances were deployed in the three districts to handle the rising number of COVID-19 cases. “During this period, we even handled patients from private hospitals,” he said. A technician working in an ‘108’ ambulance said the drivers and technicians had to constantly protest to ensure that PPE kits and face masks were provided for those who were deployed in the ‘COVID-19 duty.’ The data showed that the highest number of cases attended to by the ‘108’ ambulances in 2020 were cases other than road accidents, COVID-19 and pregnancy-related cases. “Since there was a restriction in movement of public transport, ambulances were used to transport patients suffering from fever, diabetes, breathlessness, hypertension and other ailments to hospitals,” he said. Pregnant women formed the most number of patients handled by the ambulances during this period. As many as 94 deliveries were conducted in the ambulance itself in the three districts in 2020. “It was ensured that ante-natal mothers were served even when COVID-19 cases were rising,” said Mr. Vimal Raj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/108-ambulances-handled-over-97000-cases-in-3-districts-during-lockdown/article33680384.ece

Puducherry scored 21 out of a total of 24 points to rank along with other top performing States such as Delhi, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh, according to a press note from the Puducherry Pollution Control Committee (PPCC). The Union Territory fared better than States such as Bihar and Punjab (20), Tamil Nadu (19), Kerala (18) and Maharashtra (17). According to the PPCC, the CPCB carried out the evaluation on the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to examine the comparative track record of the 28 States/Union Territories in terms of implementation of the provisions of the Bio-medical (Management & Handling) Rules, 2016. The CPCB assessed the effectiveness of the States in implementing BMWM rules on a set of key performance indicators based on a quantifiable score. The survey gave equal weightage to each performance indicator with a score of two points given for initiatives taken for implementation, one for under progress action points and nil for non-implemented action points. Seven States not having common facilities were excluded for relative evaluation. A higher score against a State would only indicate where the State stands despite needing more action on the ground for effective implementation of the BMWM Rules. COVID-19 waste management was also taken as one of the criteria. On this front, the PPCC ensures proper collection, transport and disposal of COVID-19 waste in a common bio-medical waste treatment facility through bar coding, GPS and updating the data in the CPCB app regularly, the press note said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/biomedical-waste-management-puducherry-ranks-among-top-states/article33680993.ece

28 January 2021||SIRKAZHI,TAMIL NADU||Burglar gunned down within hours of murdering 2 members of jeweller’s family||Within hours of a gruesome double murder and burglary of about 17 kg gold at the house of a jeweller at Sirkazhi in the early hours of Wednesday, police teams tracked down three assailants, believed to be of north Indian origin, at Erukkur, and gunned down one of them for allegedly resisting arrest. The Hindi-speaking masked burglars hacked to death Asha, 45, and Akhil, 28, the wife and son of jeweller Dhanaraj, and inflicted grievous injuries on him and his daughter-in-law before escaping with the booty in the family’s car. The gang also took the hard disk of the CCTV camera installed at the house. The investigating teams found the car abandoned at Melamathur on the bypass road. Acting on information that the gang was in hiding in Erukkur, police teams from the Kollidam station rounded them up and confiscated the stolen gold and two pistols. The operation was carried out under the supervision of Mayiladuthurai Superintendent of Police N. Sreenatha. The police said one of the accused, Manipal Singh of Rajasthan, was being taken to a field for recovering the buried gold, when he tried to attack the policemen. The police opened fire in “self-defence”, killing him on the spot. His body was taken to the Sirkazhi Government Hospital for post-mortem examination. The two other assailants, Ramesh and Manish, were being interrogated to ascertain the involvement of more persons. The jeweller told the police that his family was attacked by a gang of five. A fourth accused, Karunaram, was arrested in Kumbakonam later in the day. The gang was said to have abandoned the car, fearing it could have a tracking device, and also because there was a checkpoint along the bypass road towards Chidambaram. After burying the gold, the gang planned to board a bus, the police said. The only clue the police had was that the gang hailed from a Hindi-speaking region. According to local sources, farmers alerted the police after witnessing the “suspicious behaviour” of the three. Police sources said the assailants had holed themselves up in the village in the morning, but did not anticipate that they would be confronted by farmers.

28 January 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Farmers have a re-think on utility of combined harvesting machine||For more than a decade, the combined harvesting machines (CHM) were integral to agricultural activities in the delta districts as a viable alternative to the manual process in the backdrop of manpower shortage faced by farmers. Over the years, the machines owned by the Agriculture Engineering Department and private entities have almost replaced the manual harvesting process even in landholdings classified as marginal and small. For, farmers with small land holdings hired the CHMs in groups to harvest their crop at one go. Overcharging However, the hiring of this service seems to be in trouble what with complaints of overcharging by the private service providers surfacing in the delta districts. Most of the private players act as ‘commission agents’ to owners of harvest equipment in other districts and States. It was for this reason that the State government intervened and started specifying the hiring charges every year. However, despite the government intervention, complaints of overcharging never abated. A disadvantageous dimension of the use of CHMs, farmers say, is the threat it poses to agriculture operations - the continuous use of the machines leaves behind an adverse impact on the soil, they point out. Solidification They claimed that regular deployment of heavy CHMs on the fields had almost changed the soil texture which had, in turn, made it difficult for them to have proper transplantation of nurseries using transplanting machines and also through the manual method. This is due to the solidification of the field in view of the weight of the CHMs. Even the deployment of machines for tilling and levelling have not produced desired results to make the field hundred per cent suitable for smooth cultivation, they say. Agreeing with them, M. Ramasubramanian, programme coordinator, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Tiruvarur, says the mini-CHMs which have been viewed as an alternative to heavy machines do have some problems. These mini-CHMs fail miserably on wet fields, he points out. A progressive farmer, G.Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam, also expresses a similar view, explaining that the mini-CHMs fail to function properly on wet fields, and leave the crop with panicles.  Machine woes   Transplantation of nurseries is difficult  On wet fields, the machine leaves the crop with panicles||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-have-a-re-think-on-utility-of-combined-harvesting-machine/article33680347.ece
28 January 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Turmeric, cardamom seized; four held||The Q Branch police arrested four persons and seized turmeric and cardamom, among others, worth about Rs. 7 lakh from them which was reportedly intended to be smuggled to Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Following a specific information, that a gang had planned to smuggle through a waiting boat in Kovalam beach near here, surveillance was intensified. At the appointed time, when a lorry came in, the police led by Inspector Vijay Anitha and team intercepted it. Sensing trouble, four among the eight persons in the vehicle escaped. However, the police secured the other four suspects. Preliminary inquiries revealed that they were planning to smuggle turmeric, turmeric powder, raw cardamom to an agent in Colombo.

28 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Revamp work begins in sewage treatment plant||Work on revamping the sewage treatment plant (STP) at Panjappur on the outskirts of the city has begun. A vast tract of land located on the Tiruchi-Madurai highway has been under use for discharging and processing the sewage being collected from different parts of the city for more than 20 years. A sewage treatment plant was established in 1995 as part of the phase-I underground drainage project. It was set up as per the Waste Stabilisation Pond Method. As per the method, the sewage water, after being processed through the STP, will be released into ponds which absorb the water. In the initial stages of the phase-I UGD project, the processed water was used for irrigation. The land has the capacity to process 85 MLD. Of it, only 58 MLD is being used for treating the sewage generated from households. The rest can be used to treat 30 MLD of sewage water. Since the unused land is needed to be modified in accordance with the Waste Stabilisation Pond method, the Tiruchi Corporation has decided to establish the needed infrastructure for the treatment process. Corporation sources told The Hindu that it would be revamped so as to use the unused land. If needed, the machinery would also be repaired. The component had been included in the phase-II UGD project, which was being implemented in various parts of the city. The work had already begun and was planned for completion within six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revamp-work-begins-in-sewage-treatment-plant-at-panjappur/article33680340.ece
28 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bheema Nagar awash with garbage mounds||Residents of Bheema Nagar in the city, irked by mushrooming garbage piles in their locality, complain that the civic body is ignoring their pleas. Bheema Nagar, a residential area off Heber Road, presents a picture of garbage mounds at road corners, much to the dismay of residents. The garbage is being dumped in the open due to irregular waste collection by the civic body, the residents say. Garbage is collected only on alternate days, says Ghouse Baig, a consumer activist. “The work was streamlined a year ago, but since the COVID-19 lockdown, matters have gotten out of hand. The civic body seems to be ignoring the public’s pleas,” he says. A large mound of garbage, including food waste from a nearby community hall and a school was especially bad. This is a health hazard and can cause infections, he says. Mr. Baig questions the intention of the civic body in setting up modern garbage collection bins under the Smart Cities Mission programme. The bins, purchased at a cost of Rs. 17 crore, would feature sensors to alert sanitary workers to clear them. “We had large metal bins and many open dumping sites are where such bins used to be. Now they are spending crores worth of money to replace the bins. So what is the intention of the civic body?” he asks. The Tiruchi City Corporation has, in May 2019, declared that nearly 95% of the 1,172 large bins across the city were removed to make it mandatory for residents to hand over domestic waste directly to sanitary workers arriving with pushcarts or light commercial vehicles. Residents and activists claim that the plan backfired and has resulted in the increasing garbage pile-up in several parts of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bheema-nagar-awash-with-garbage-mounds/article33680351.ece

28 January 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Officials go on casual leave||Regular work in taluk offices and other revenue offices in this district suffered as 50% members of Tamil Nadu Revenue Officers Association went on a mass casual leave on Wednesday. Out of 400-odd posts, over 200 workers in various cadres like office assistant, typist, junior assistant, revenue inspector, deputy tahsildar and tahsildar abstained from work. The association has been demanding steps to fill up vacancies. “We have a huge number of vacancies in the posts of office assistant, record clerks, watchman,” said TNROA district secretary, C. Kannan. Revenue Department offices being custodians for various important files and goods meant for distribution among people under various welfare schemes. Except for two offices, none of the offices have watchman to protect these documents and valuables. With no record clerks and office assistants, the movement of files suffers delay. “We are not asking for any new posts but only filling up of the sanctioned posts,” he said. While Department of Revenue has been rechristened as Department of Revenue and Disaster Management, the nature of job has changed a lot. “Besides working on Sundays and holidays whenever there is a government function, revenue staff have to work round the clock during natural calamities in rescue, relief and rehabilitation works. Even during the pandemic, our men had to man the check-posts,” he said. With the change in nature of job, employees of revenue department should be given a differential pay when compared to other departments. The association demanded that the unnecessary delay in regularisation of jobs given to people appointed under compassionate grounds should be done away with. “The appointment order is given by Collectors and the proposal to regularise their jobs is made by them. But, it takes five to 15 years for the government to regularise their jobs. This costs them in their promotion,” Mr. Kannan said. Stating that the basic training for revenue officials gets delayed for years together, the association sought that training institutes should be constituted at district levels to provide training before the selected candidates begin their career.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/officials-go-on-casual-leave/article33680387.ece

28 January 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Minister says he will urge CM to ban MES||Textile Minister Srimanth Patil has said that he will urge Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to ban Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) for its anti-Karnataka stand and other such provocative acts. He told journalists in Belagavi on Wednesday that it is the MES leadership that regularly approaches the Maharashtra Chief Minister and forces him and other Ministers to speak against Karnataka. “We have to ban the MES. It is our duty,” Mr. Patil said. Mr. Patil, a native Marathi speaker, refuted the charge by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that Karnataka government was committing atrocities on Marathi speakers. He was reacting to Mr. Thackeray’s statements in a book release function in Mumbai where he referred to Belagavi, Karwar and other areas as “Karnataka occupied Maharashtra”. Mr. Thackeray had also said that the linguistic minority areas in Karnataka should be declared as Union Territories till the Supreme Court decided on the border dispute. He also accused Karnataka government of attempts at Kannada imposition and of torturing Marathi speakers. He dismissed as meaningless Maharashtra government publishing the book, Maharashtra- Karnataka Seemavad: Sangharsh Ani Sankalp (Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute struggle and resolve). They write such books as they cannot write anything better, he said. Meanwhile, district in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi said that there was no point in discussing issues such as release of a book by Maharashtra. He said that he would not react to Mr. Thackeray’s demand for declaring all linguistic minority areas as Union Territories, till the Supreme Court gave a verdict on the boundary issue. “Mr. Thackeray has failed as a Chief Minister on all fronts. His government has no development programmes to take credit for. That is why he is resorting to such provocative statements and acts. Shiv Sena is known for diverting the attention of the people from the main issues, when it fails to deliver,” he said. He said that the media should play down such sensational issues. The people of Karnataka have positive regard for people who speak different languages. The Karnataka government treats all citizens equally, he said. “The State government’s stand is that the report of the Mahajan Commission was binding on all the parties, including Maharashtra, and that would not change,” he said. To a question, he said that there was no need for an exclusive Ministry for border dispute resolution, as in Maharashtra. “All the 34 Ministers in our Cabinet are united on this issue. We are capable of handling the dispute, without the need for an exclusive Minister for the purpose. Our legal team is strong too,” he said. Mr. Jarkiholi admitted the fact that this friend and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had attended the book release function. The former MLA from Khanapur in Belagavi Arvind Patil had also attended it. But that is the political practice in Maharashtra. “Utilising the border dispute for political ends is their agenda. Not ours. Our agenda is the overall development of the State,” he said. Rajya Sabha member Iranna Kadadi said that the MES was no longer relevant in Belagavi district as the voters had rejected it. Voters have chosen national parties over this local party with a single agenda. Some MES leaders are resorting to such tricks, only to save their identity and political existence, he said.  Uddhav Thackeray has failed as a Chief Minister on all fronts. His government has no development programmes to take credit for. That is why he is resorting to such provocative statements and acts. Shiv Sena is known for diverting the attention of the people from the main issues, when it fails to deliver, says Ramesh Jarkiholi||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/minister-says-he-will-urge-cm-to-ban-mes/article33680427.ece
28 January 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||CM protecting Oppn. leaders, says Yatnal||“Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is protecting Opposition leaders as they are partners in his politics,” BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal said in Vijayapura on Wednesday. Mr. Yediyurappa is partnering with Opposition parties to save his government. He is more worried about them than his own party leaders. He is targeting BJP leaders who are critical of the Congress leaders. He keeps changing the portfolios of Ministers who criticise Congress leaders Siddaramaiah, D.K. Shivakumar Zameer Ahmed and K.J. George, Mr. Yatnal said. He, however, said that such things would change soon. Change will begin during Ugadi and end by Deepavali, he said, without divulging details.  He said that pro-Khalistan forces were protesting against the farm laws in Delhi. They are being funded by China and Pakistan. Congress is channelling those funds, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-protecting-oppn-leaders-says-yatnal/article33680433.ece

28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cases decline but experts advise caution||The State has been maintaining a test positivity rate (TPR) of less than one per cent for the past one month. From 1.1% on December 25, the State’s average (TPR) reduced to 0.9% since the beginning of January and has continued to remain as low as 0.7% in the past 15 days. While this has brought cheer to the State, which had been expecting a second wave this month, it is not yet an indication of tiding over the crisis, experts said. “We can claim to have sustained the flattening of the curve only if the trend of less than one per cent TPR continues till March-April,” said C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force. Going by the exponential rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in countries such as Britain and France nearly five months after cases drastically reduced, the State should keep its fingers crossed till March-April, he said. While the State was reporting more than 10,000 new cases till mid-October, cases came down to around 5,000 after that. From November first week, new cases reduced to less than 5,000 and further reduced to less than 2,000 from December. From mid-December, cases reduced to less than 1,000 and have been further going down. Giridhar R. Babu, member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said the low numbers could be because the threshold for population immunity has been reached in most dense urban areas. “As long as there are pockets of susceptible people and as the vaccine has not yet been rolled out for the general population, it will not be safe to say we have herd immunity as yet,” Dr. Babu said. “Testing should continue on a syndromic approach even when there is no surge. Ideally, for every case detected, 10 persons (contacts) should be tested,” he said. No change in strategy V. Ravi, former senior professor and head of neurovirology at NIMHANS who is also a part of the TAC, said there should be no change in the testing strategy till March-end. “We will get the second sero survey results by then, and we will know the extent of population that has already been exposed to the virus. We can review the situation after that, but till then, we should continue testing the same number of people,” he said. Meanwhile, the number of daily tests conducted in the State has reduced in the last few days. While an average of over one lakh tests were being conducted every day, the number has come down to an average of 80,000. On Wednesday, the number of tests was 58,695. Dr. Manjunath said keeping up the same pace of testing has become a challenge. “Even if the target of testing symptomatic, high-risk and primary contacts remains the same, it is difficult to find more contacts as the number of new cases detected is coming down. But, it is important to continue the same level of testing based on syndromic approach at least till March,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cases-decline-but-experts-advise-caution/article33680549.ece
28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Employment scenario still to recover from COVID-19 shock’||A continued and expanded allocation for MGNREGA, as well as the introduction of an urban employment scheme in the upcoming Budget, was crucial for addressing livelihood crisis in the country, suggested the second round of COVID-19 Livelihoods Survey conducted by Azim Premji University in partnership with six civil society organisations. The survey carried out during October, November, and December 2020, found that more than two-thirds (69%) of those employed in February had lost work during the lockdown. Even six months after the lockdown, the economy was yet to recover entirely from the shock of COVID-19. One-fifth of those employed before the lockdown were still without work. Earnings have recovered for those back to work, but the situation was distressing for those who cannot find work, as per the survey. Out of every 100 workers, the study found, only 26 remained unaffected by the lockdown. Some 55 people managed to recover lost jobs but 15 had still not registered any recovery. As per the survey, women workers fared worse than men when it came to employment recovery (53% versus 57%). Urban areas had been worse hit despite a quicker bounce back. Nine in 10 households reported cutting back on food consumption during the lockdown. Six months later, only one third reported that consumption was back at pre-lockdown levels. Urban households were worse off with 28% reporting that food consumption was still at lockdown levels as against 15% rural households. “Our findings suggest that a continued expanded allocation for MGNREGA, as well as introduction of an urban employment scheme in the upcoming Budget, are crucial for addressing this livelihood crisis,” the survey observed. Given the weakness in food and earnings recovery, there was an urgent need to expand the scope of the current PDS, it recommended. The initial survey carried out in April-May covered nearly 5,000 respondents, mostly from informal and vulnerable households. Some 2,778 of these respondents from across 12 States were part of the second study and were re-interviewed to understand what economic recovery meant for self-employed, casual, and regular wage/salaried workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/employment-scenario-still-to-recover-from-covid-19-shock/article33680436.ece
28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Heavy penalty for illegal mining: Minister||Ahead of the Legislative Assembly session, Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh Nirani said the government has decided to crackdown on all those involved in illegal mining by levying five times the tax payable as penalty. He told presspersons that the government would invoke provisions under the law to impose hefty penalties on illegal mining. A few days ago, at least six people were killed in an explosion at a stone quarry in Shivamogga, Many companies would have mined more than what is permitted under licenses granted to them. They would have taken permission for one lorry and would be transporting 10. “This amounts to illegality. There is a provision to levy five times the tax for illegal mining. We will issue notices and collect the amount,” Mr. Nirani said. The government has not yet assessed the exact extent of illegal mining in the State. A survey would be conducted using drones. A task force led by tahsildars would be set up to probe into the illegal supply and manufacture of explosives, Mr. Niarni said. Several people have taken licenses without expertise in mining. To fill this gap, the government was planning to establish a mining training and research institute on the lines of the Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research in Dhanbad, Jharkand, he said. The Minister said a “Mining Adalat” would be conducted in all the five divisions in the State every fortnight to address all grievances related to mining activities.  Many companies would have mined more than what is permitted under licenses granted to them. They would have taken permission for one lorry and would be transporting 10.

28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ministry squabbles, governance issues may be highlights of session||The seven-day session of the Karnataka legislature will commence from Thursday with Governor Vajubhai Vala’s address to a joint session of both Houses. It is expected to clear nearly a dozen Bills, while the Opposition is likely to question the quality of governance, with Ministers continuing to squabble over allocation of portfolios. The election to the post of Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council and the ruling BJP members’ move to introduce a no-confidence motion against Council Chairman K. Pratapchandra Shetty (Congress) are expected to create some drama in the Upper House. The post of Deputy Chairman of the Council fell vacant following the death of S.L. Dharme Gowda in December last. The election for the post would be held on Friday. Thursday is the last day for filing nomination papers. Others issues The Opposition is expected to corner the government on issues related to illegal quarrying, inadequate release of money to farmers who were hit by last year’s floods, inadequate funds released to legislators’ constituencies for undertaking development works, delay in receiving the Centre’s funds under the centrally-sponsored schemes, and elections to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. Bills related to establishment of private universities, motor vehicle tax, and Karnataka urban municipality are expected to be introduced in the Assembly, said Speaker Vishveshwara Hegde Kageri. Like the last two sessions in 2020, this session would be conducted with a host of safety measures to ensure the physical distance and other norms to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, COVID-19 test is not made mandatory. A counter would be opened in the Secretariat to undergo tests for members and staff of the Assembly Secretariat, he said. The Speaker appealed to members, who are not feeling well, not to attend the session. No outsiders This time too due to COVID-19, no schoolchildren or public would be allowed to watch the proceedings of the Houses. Both the ruling and Opposition lounges would be closed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ministry-squabbles-governance-issues-may-be-highlights-of-session/article33680557.ece
28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ministerial jugglery hits BSY’s image||The four Cabinet rejigs by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, in less than a week, seem to have hit his image as an “assertive leader” that he had earned after convincing the high command and expanded his Cabinet, party strategists feel. Amidst speculation of leadership change, the party high command giving assent to expand the Cabinet was a clear message to dissenters within the party that the Central leadership was not thinking of changing him in the near future. It indicated that high command acknowledged the lack of credible alternatives to him. “However, the repeated jugglery with portfolios has painted a very different picture, of one who is prone to pulls and pressures and is unable to assert himself,” a senior legislator conceded. However, his close associates point to the “political reality” of the need to accommodate defectors and balance partymen upset over defectors cornering opportunities. “Given the composition of the government today, there is a need to make some adjustments, which cannot be wished away,” said senior MLC Lehar Singh. Meanwhile, others observed that the Chief Minister has retained plum portfolios of Bengaluru Development and Energy, which if devolved to others, would have solved the issue more amicably. Not just the 17 defectors, many other party leaders like C.N. Ashwath Narayan, C.P. Yogeshwar, J.C. Madhuswamy who played a role in toppling the coalition government and bringing BJP to power, feel they have a claim over this government, creating an imbalance in Cabinet in terms of caste, region and seniority, a Minister said. “The Chief Minister is in a fix and anyone in his place would face similar pressures. It is a compromise the party has made to come to power,” he said. “Mr. Yediyurappa fell a few seats short of majority twice in 2008 and 2018 and both times he has faced an antagonistic party high command. Operation Kamala, a political exigency to capture power, is at the root of indiscipline within the party’s political culture,” said one of his close associates, who did not wish to be named. However, another former legislator from the RSS stable identified with the opposite faction, said one of their main objections to Mr. Yediyurappa was his dilution of the ideological base within the State unit. “Today more than half of our party is filled with outsiders, creating a stark division between party workers and outsiders,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ministerial-jugglery-hits-bsys-image/article33680560.ece
28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CAR constable and second division assistant arrested in paper leak racket||The Central Crime Branch (CCB) police, on Wednesday, arrested two more people in connection with the leak of the first division assistant (FDA) competitive examination question paper, taking the total number of accused to 18. One of the accused is Mushtaq, a police constable with the City Armed Reserve force who was deployed as part of the security at the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC), which conducts the examination. The second accused is Basavaraj Kumbar, a Second Division Assistant (SDA), and roommate of prime accused Ramesh Herkal, also an SDA. All three men – Mushtaq, Ramesh and Basavaraj – planned to appear for the examination. According to the police, Mushtaq hails from Haveri. He was deployed at the KPSC office back gate on security duty while Basavaraj worked in the accounting department. “He was a friend of stenographer Sana Bedi [another accused], and had taken the question paper from her,” said Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime). Mushtaq had been with the CAR for the last two years and was deployed twice a week at KPSC’s back gate. “He got Sana’s sympathy by sharing his family's financial background and told that he was unable to bear their expenses. He asked her to help him access the question paper so that he could become a first division assistant and get a better posting,” said the CCB. The duo were arrested based on the confession of Ramesh and Sana. According to sources, Basavaraj had joined KPSC in 2017, and knew both Sana and Ramesh. According to the CCB, Ramesh and Basavaraj were staying in a rented house in Vijayanagar. They wanted to pass the FDA examination and get a posting in Vidhana Soudha. After receiving the paper from Sana, Ramesh had shared it with Basavaraj. He also hit upon the idea of making money and contacted Chandru, an inspector with the commercial tax vigilance squad, who was one of the first to be arrested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/car-constable-and-second-division-assistant-arrested-in-paper-leak-racket/article33680565.ece
28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NOC is no assent for land conversion in Kodagu, says HC||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday said that the no objection certificates (NOCs) given by the Deputy Commissioner-led Technical Committee in Kodagu for conversion of agricultural lands should not be construed as permission for conversion of lands as per the provision of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by C.P. Muthanna, a coffee planter from Gonikoppa in Kodagu district. The petitioner had questioned the legality of the government’s June 4, 2020 notification setting up a five-member technical committee for granting NOC for conversion of agricultural lands in Kodagu district. The Bench also directed the State government to communicate this interim order to all the authorities concerned. The petitioner has contended that some of the owners of coffee plantations in Kodagu district, without knowing the feasibility and contour of their land, are filing series of applications before the Deputy Commissioner, Kodagu for getting their agricultural lands converted for non-agricultural purposes. Some of the constructions in the ongoing projects on converted lands in future may be very devastating to the hilly areas of several villages and taluks of the district. “Lakhs of fully grown trees shall be chopped off and all coffee plantations shall be converted to layouts and commercial buildings which fetch huge revenue to the owners at the cost of the fragile ecology of Kodagu, which will again suffer another natural disaster which occurred in the district in the year 2018,” the petitioner has said. Adverse effect The NOCs issued by the technical committee will create a lot of adverse effect on the eco-sensitive zones of the district and it should be mandatory to obtain necessary clearance and permissions from the authorities concerned before issuing NOCs to the applicants seeking conversion of lands, the petitioner has argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/noc-is-no-assent-for-land-conversion-in-kodagu-says-hc/article33680539.ece
28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP referred 43,863 cases to pvt. hospitals||The ‘partnership’ between the civic body and private hospitals to fight the pandemic has come at a steep price. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) referred 43,863 COVID-19 cases under Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) initiative to private hospitals. The total cost for the treatment of these patients amounted to Rs. 292.23 crore. This data was released as part of a Right to Information (RTI) query by lawyer and social activist T. Narasimha Murthy. The activist himself contracted COVID-19, following which the BBMP referred him for treatment under SAST to a private hospital. However, during the time of his discharge, the hospital demanded Rs. 50,000, which was later brought down to Rs. 10,000. This, even though the hospital’s spend on treatment of patients admitted under SAST gets reimbursed completely. This incident prompted Mr. Murthy to file an application under RTI seeking information on the number of COVID-19 positive cases referred by BBMP to private hospitals and the amount spent. Of the 43,863 cases referred to private hospitals, 42,467 claims for Rs. 202.23 crore have been submitted. According to the data, 31,624 claims for Rs. 133.20 crore had been settled, as on January 13, 2021. Mr. Murthy told The Hindu that his case of being charged was not an exception. There have been several complaints about private hospitals charging money at the time of discharge from patients admitted under SAST, he alleged. “As per the terms of reference for COVID-19 empanelled hospitals, the hospital is supposed to provide cashless treatment and submit claims for treatment,” he pointed out. Following several complaints, the hospital administration (in his case) refunded the money and even gave him an apology letter, along with a compensation of Rs. 1. “Instead of compensating the private hospitals, the BBMP could have better utilised the money spent in not just upgrading the existing health facilities and/or constructed a super-speciality hospital to make health facilities more accessible to citizens,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-referred-43863-cases-to-pvt-hospitals/article33680543.ece

28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC cautions govt. on failure to set up SDRF||Viewing seriously the Chief Secretary’s statement that the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) would be established only in the next financial year, the High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday cautioned the government that it will have to issue writ of mandamus to set up the fund immediately if not established by February 2. Pointing out that the State government has failed to set up SDRF from the past 13 years even though the Disaster Management Act, 2005, came into force in August 2007, the court deprecated “unwillingness” of the government to implement the provisions of the DM Act despite directions issued by the court since October 2019. A Division Bench issued the direction while hearing PIL petitions filed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority and Mallikarjuna A, an agriculturist from Tumakuru district, on the issue of implementation of the DM Act. In response to earlier direction of the court on implementation of certain provisions of DM Act, Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar in his affidavit has stated that the SDRF would be set up in the financial year 2021-22. Declining to accept the Chief Secretary’s statement, the Bench said that the government cannot say that SDRF would be set up during next financial year while terming the government’s response as contrary to Section 48 of the DM Act. CAG report The Bench also noticed that the CAG has been consistently objecting in its reports on transfer of funds to the accounts maintained by the Deputy Commissioners instead of setting of District Disaster Response Funds in each district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-cautions-govt-on-failure-to-set-up-sdrf/article33680558.ece

Legislative Assembly speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri termed the incident as a “black spot” on Indian democracy and republic. Speaking to mediapersons here, he said all people have right to take out protest but indulging in violence would curtail the rights of other people. He called upon farmers to adopt democratic methods to solve their problems against the farm laws. ‘PM lacks a heart’ Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who speaks of having a 56-inch chest, lacks a heart that can wipe the tears of the poor, as he lashed out at the Centre over its handling of the farmers’ agitation. He said farmers have been holding protests for over 60 days despite severe cold weather and some of them have even lost their lives. He sought to know why there was no Intelligence input on the violent incidents that occurred on Republic Day and why it could not be controlled and prevented. “Eleven rounds of discussion would not have been needed if the government had genuine concern for farmers. Farmers are claiming that they will incur losses due to new farm laws. The govt. should have repealed it when farmers themselves are against the farm laws,” he tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/delhi-incident-sparks-off-reactions/article33680552.ece

28 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Second sero survey begins in Karnataka||To map the changing trend of the population’s response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the State began the second round of serological prevalence survey on January 25. The survey is being conducted in all the 30 districts as well as eight zones of Bengaluru. A serological prevalence survey involves drawing blood samples to detect whether the person was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the past and whether he/she has developed Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to combat the infection. The first round done from September 3 to September 16 in Karnataka had shown that 16.4% of the 16,585 persons covered under the survey had developed antibodies and 12.7 % had an active infection. The survey, that included people who had COVID-19 infection (prior to the survey) and those who had active infection during the survey, found an overall prevalence of 27.3% in the State then. V. Ravi, member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), told The Hindu on Wednesday that around 1,100 people from each district are being covered under the second sero-survey. During the first survey, an average of 400 samples from every district was included. “The plan is to cover nearly 40,000 people from high, moderate and low-risk categories. Sample collection may go on upto two weeks and we should have the results ready by mid-February,” Dr. Ravi said. The first sero-survey had shown that four districts – Dharwad, Gadag, Chickballapur, Bagalkot, and BBMP’s Mahadevapura zone – were yet to witness a surge then (September). These districts were found to have the lowest estimated prevalence. The overall prevalence was the highest in Ballari with 43.1% while it was the lowest in Dharwad with 8.7%. “The second round will reveal if there has been a change in the pattern of the disease spread. We can also ascertain whether the districts with low prevalence then have seen the surge subsequently, and if there is a need for further intervention to control the spread,” Dr. Ravi added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/second-sero-survey-begins-in-karnataka/article33680550.ece

Chairing a meeting regarding preparations for village visit in Udupi on Wednesday, Additional Deputy Commissioner B. Sadashiva Prabhu said that the Deputy Commissioner and officials from the Revenue Department will visit the villages and address problems, if any, of residents. He asked officials concerned to get applications from residents of the two villages regarding their issues with the Revenue Department by Thursday and take steps to address them. The Tahsildar, the Taluk Panchayat Executive Officer and other officers should compulsorily attend the programme, he said. Mr. Prabhu said that the officials should ensure that RTCs in those villages are bereft of any shortcomings and tally with their boundaries. Steps should be taken to transfer Khatas of deceased land owners to their legal heirs. Officials should ensure genuine beneficiaries are availing themselves of pension under the government’s social security schemes while on-the-spot sanction should be given to beneficiaries who have been left out. Officials should verify whether adequate space is available for crematorium/graveyard in the villages and reserve adequate land for government housing schemes. Removal of encroachment on government land, creating awareness about Aadhaar card, verification of electoral rolls, distribution of compensation for floods, verifying facilities at anganwadis and schools in the villages should also be undertaken. They should verify whether eligible people in the villages have BPL cards and take steps to remove ineligible persons from the BPL card list. Meanwhile, residents of villages too should positively respond to the pilot programme. They should inform authorities about the death of elders in the family and get Khatas transferred to the next of kin of the deceased person. They should also inform the authorities the death of a social security pensioner and if anyone is obtaining pension even after the death of the beneficiary, the amount would be recovered from them. While the Deputy Commissioner, the Deputy Director of Land Records, the Assistant Commissioner of the sub division and the Tahsildar of the taluk along with other officials will visit the identified village every third Saturday of the month, the Tahsildars of other taluks should visit identified villages in their limits along with officials to address issues, Mr. Prabhu said.

Raghupathi Bhat on Tuesday. Senior fishermen leader Rama Kachnan, who led the group, said that fishermen had no problems with the development of beaches for tourism. But they were opposed to a marina where fishermen may face the risk of being denied entry to the shoreline. Officials will be least bothered about fishermen when the marina comes up, he said. Allaying their fears, Mr. Bhat said that the marina project was still at the stage of proposal and no final decision has yet been taken on it. The Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune, has been asked to carry out a feasibility study. Local activities and fishing, Mr. Bhat said, will not be affected by the marina project. There will be no luxury hotels, clubs and pubs opened near the shore. The marina will help foreign yachts berth and this will give a boost to tourism and local economy, he said. The suggestions made by fishermen and local residents will be forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner who heads the district tourism committee, he said.  ‘We have no problems with the development of beaches for tourism but a marina may deprive us of our rights’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/locals-oppose-marina-at-padukare/article33680958.ece
28 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||K.R. Hospital awaits overhaul||The restoration of the State-run K.R. Hospital and Cheluvamba Hospital, the city’s major public healthcare centres that were in the forefront of the COVID-19 battle, largely hinges on when the trauma care centre and the yet-to-be-launched Super Speciality Hospital on KRS Road become operational. Thanks to the roll out of vaccine for COVID-19 and infection rate flattening to a considerable extent, the focus is now being shifted to equipping hospitals with facilities for non-COVID-19 services. The 120-bed Trauma Care Centre was inaugurated almost two years ago and the super speciality hospital is ready for the inauguration. Both the facilities have come up on the PKTB Sanatorium campus. Though the trauma care centre that was lying unoccupied for want of equipment and manpower was hurriedly readied when the pandemic was at its peak last year, the facility did not handle COVID-19 as the cases started dropping substantially and the designated COVID-19 Hospital managed the cases on its own. If the pressure on K.R. Hospital has to be eased, major departments from it have to move to the new hospitals. This can happen only when the two get required manpower and equipment as per the NMC and NABH guidelines. With the UG intake in Mysore Medical College and Research Institute going up from 150 to 250, the operation of new facilities has become imminent. The building of the super speciality hospital is ready but it too mainly needs equipment and manpower soon so that the purpose for which it was set up would be fulfilled, providing super speciality healthcare services. Sources in the MMCRI said funds had been sought in the budget for 2021-22 for making the trauma care centre and the super speciality hospital functional. At least eight departments from K.R. Hospital will move out of its existing premises if the super speciality hospital becomes fully ready for attending to the patients. Orthopaedic, emergency and related departments can be shifted to the trauma care centre if it becomes fully operational. The Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) has submitted its proposals to its parent department on the necessities of the new hospitals. It is now keeping its fingers crossed and awaiting special allocation in the budget so that it could take up renovation of K.R. Hospital, shifting in-patient and out-patient services to the new facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kr-hospital-awaits-overhaul/article33680538.ece

Hospital, a teaching hospital attached to the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI), on the occasion of its centenary? The hospital has been a major tertiary healthcare provider not just for the people of Mysuru but also for neighbouring districts since the time it came into existence. And the hospital has continued to serve the public despite increasing load of patients with each passing year. Post-COVID-19, the hospital is attending to nearly 2,000 out-patients daily. Also, despite limited resources, the hospital, its doctors and the staff successfully battled the COVID-19 pandemic. As the hospital was in need of a major restoration with its buildings turning weak, a proposal had been sent to the government seeking a special grant for taking up certain works on the occasion of it completing 100 years. A Rs. 52-crore grant is learnt to have been sought to take up repair and other works. Being a heritage structure, the renovation has to be done complying with the heritage norms, and restoration of such buildings would take a longer time than other buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/all-eyes-on-cms-budget/article33680536.ece

He said that the storming of the Red Fort was an attempt to besmirch the farmers who were protesting against the farm laws in a peaceful manner since more than 60 days Mr. Shanthakumar, who is the president of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators Association, said the farmers did not lose patience all these days though the Centre was trying to wear them down through prolonged negotiations but without meeting the demands for an abrogation of the laws. He alleged that though the government had intelligence report of the impending intrusion into the tractor rally by anti-social elements, it took no precautionary measures and allowed the situation to deteriorate. This calls for a probe as the government’s ‘inaction’ leads to suspicion that it was an attempt to discredit the entire rally and the farmers’ movement and deprive it of its legitimacy. He said the prolonged discussions by the government has not led to any solution and this is an attempt by the Centre to wear out the farmers and weaken the agitation. It and was an attempt by the government to project itself as being accommodative to the farmers’ demands while in reality it was not so, Mr. Shanthakumar contended. He said scores of farmers who have participated in the rally have lost their lives due to various reasons and the government displayed no sympathy nor is it empathising with their cause.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/delhi-violence-an-attempt-to-discredit-farmers-stir/article33680535.ece

According to data provided by the BBMP, the maximum number of illegal religious structures, including temples, churches, mosques, gurudwaras, are in the East zone (503), followed by South (427), Bommanahalli (203), West (129), Rajarajeshwarinagar (95), Mahadevapura (76), Dasarahalli (53) and Yelahanka (26). In a PIL filed in 2009, the Supreme Court had noted that structures that had come up before 2009 may be shifted to other locations while no structures should be allowed after that. An earlier survey had identified a total of 108 illegal structures. Dissatisfied with the manner in which the survey was conducted, the civic chief had directed officials to conduct a fresh survey, involving both engineering and revenue departments. Zonal joint commissioners and engineers were instructed to issue show cause notices to illegal religious structures that had come up after September 2009. The new survey found that of the 1,512 illegal structures, 214 had come up after 2009. The survey results will be submitted to the Karnataka High Court, which is hearing another case on the same matter. BBMP Commissioner Manjunath Prasad said that the civic body will prepare a plan of action for removing these illegal structures with assistance from the police. “The BBMP will draw up a plan of action following another round of discussions with senior civic officials on Thursday.

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||New police station||In the wake of the violence last year at D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli following an inflammatory post on social media against Islam, a new police station has been established in the area. The police station was inaugurated on Wednesday by Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai. It is located in Govindpura, between K.G. Halli and D.J. Halli. It was sanctioned after the city police requested the State government for additional presence in the sensitive zone on the grounds that the area is vast and the two existing stations were not enough to monitor the law & order situation effectively. On August 11, a mob attacked D.J. Halli station as well as the residences of Pulikeshinagar MLA Akhanda Sreenivasa Murthy and his nephew Naveen Kumar,who had put up the derogatory post. Most of the accused are from Nagaravara and Govindapura, said a senior police official. At the inauguration, Mr. Bommai stressed on the need to restructure the law and order system for better policing in the backdrop of Bengaluru’s rapidly expanding population. At present, the new station is operating from a rented premises. In future, funds will be released for construction of a building. Around 20 personnel have been posted at the station, but in the coming days, staff strength will be increased, said a police officer. The public can contact the police station on 080-22943305. Women’s help desk At K.G. Halli station, Mr. Bommai inaugurated a women’s help desk. Across the city, 26 personnel have been imparted training to improve their response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-police-station/article33680541.ece

It will be inaugurated jointly by Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan through videoconference at 1 p.m. The 6.8-km two-lane bypass, passing through the western side of NH 66, will link Kommady in the north to Kalarcode in the south. The project comes to fruition after a wait of nearly five decades. It was first mooted in the early 1970s. Although the first phase work was launched in 1980, the project got delayed on various accounts. On April 10, 2015, it was put back on track with a deadline of September 2017. However, the project got delayed further due to various reasons, including getting permission from Railways to place girders over the railway track as part of the construction of two rail overbridges (ROBs) at Malikamukku and Kuthirapanthy. Elevated highway One of the major features of the bypass is a 4.8-km stretch of elevated highway that passes beside the Alappuzha beach. Of this, 3.2 km is flyover. The project has been implemented at Rs. 348 crore with equal shares borne by the Union and State governments. Besides, the State government spent an additional Rs. 25 crore for developing Kalarcode and Kommady Junctions, installing street lights among other works. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran and others will attend the inaugural function.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/alappuzha-bypass-opening-today/article33680468.ece

28 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Rise in cases strains critical care facilities||Pressure on critical care facilities for COVID-19 in Ernakulam has been rising, with around 80 out of 100 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients occupied in government hospitals. Intensive care units for COVID-19 in the government sector are available only at the Government Medical College Hospital, PVS Hospital, and the Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital. The number of patients requiring critical care and ICU admission has grown in the past two weeks, said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. The situation is similar at private hospitals, where critical care facilities have been seeing increased admissions in the past few weeks, said Dr. T.V. Ravi, president, IMA Kochi chapter, and member of Kerala Private Hospitals Association. In the private sector, 12 hospitals are empanelled under the Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhathi (KASP) for COVID-19 treatment at rates fixed by the government. These hospitals have set aside 930 beds altogether. Around 120 patients are receiving critical care at private hospitals, Dr. Numpeli said. The critical care facilities at PVS Hospital will be ramped up soon, while a 100-bed facility coming up at the Aluva District Hospital is expected to ease the pressure when it begins functioning in another 10 days, Dr. Numpeli said. While the Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital has been exclusively treating COVID-19 patients so far, the possibility of opening the hospital up for non-COVID treatments will be considered depending on the caseload. The district has seven domiciliary care centres for people who might be asymptomatic but lack facilities to remain in isolation at home. These have a total capacity of 568, and 243 people are at these centres. The six first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) have a combined capacity of 598 beds, of which 235 are occupied. At four second-line treatment centres (at halls in Paravur, Mattancherry, Perumbavoor, and Kothamangalam), which have the capacity to treat 385 patients altogether, 253 patients are being treated. Data from the Health Department weekly bulletin says Ernakulam has the highest number of new cases reported per week for the last three weeks, with 6,129 new cases recorded between January 18 and January 24. The test positivity rate (TPR), which had been at 10.6% in the last week of December, has risen to 12.5% in the third week of January. A total of 879 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday, with 40 people testing positive in Rayamangalam, 33 in Thrikkakara, and 27 each in Kanjoor and Maradu. Six health workers and one police officer also tested positive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rise-in-cases-strains-critical-care-facilities/article33680927.ece
28 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||State draws green tribunal flak for improper waste management||The Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has said that officials have paid only lip service on compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, despite several orders from it in the last two years. “There is thus a clear governance deficit, which needs to be urgently remedied at the appropriate highest level in the State. There is failure to enforce environmental laws,” observed the bench comprising Adarsh Kumar Goel, Chairperson; S.K. Singh, Judicial Member, and Nagin Nanda, expert member. “There is no meaningful action for complying with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 [SWM Rules] and handling of solid waste in spite of repeated directions,” the bench said in its latest order in the case pertaining to unscientific handling of waste at the Brahmapuram yard of the Kochi Corporation. The bench warned that it might have to adopt coercive measures as per law, including prosecution of the officers concerned, unless prompt action was initiated. “Least expected is placing of order for execution of legacy waste bio-mining, landscaping of the area and plantation, development of bio-diversity park, rectification of the compost plant, continuous monitoring by the Secretary, Urban Development, and quarterly review by the Chief Secretary,” it said. The bench recalled that the parameters of environment were not being met at Brahmapuram, going by the samples tested by the State Pollution Control Board (PCB). “The municipal corporation is still continuing unauthorised operations. Work is yet to start for bio-mining. Compensation has been assessed but not recovered. Windrow composting plant is in [a] dilapidated condition. The affidavit of the Chief Secretary does not show that any effective action has been taken on the ground. Thus, the situation is far from satisfactory,” it said. Continuing violation of environmental norms is not only a violation of citizens’ rights but also has the potential to damage public health. The fact remains that the administration is patently a failure in protecting citizens’ right to clean environment, the bench observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-draws-green-tribunal-flak-for-improper-waste-management/article33680469.ece
28 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Woman alleges torture by husband abroad||The family of a 29-year-old woman from Chottanikkara has petitioned the police about the alleged mental and physical torture at the hands of her husband at Calgary, a city in Canada, where the couple had settled since their marriage, before they returned here last month. Though the family had petitioned the Chottanikkara police in December, the matter came to light only now, after a video on the plight of the woman made rounds on social media. The victim, identified as Shruthy Suresh, is bedridden and being fed through tubes, while her speech capacity remains lost, after her husband allegedly forced her to drink a strong chemical used as toilet cleaner in May while they were in Calgary. The couple returned to Kochi on December 12. “Her husband Sreekanth Menon left her at the airport and went to his home at Kodungalloor after which he had not contacted us. We have taken our daughter to multiple hospitals since then, and she has already undergone surgery, while a review is scheduled for next month for another surgery,” said Suresh Sathyalayathil, her father. The family has petitioned the State and Central women’s commissions and the District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). The woman got married in November 2018 and left for her husband’s place at Calgary the next month. The Chottanikkara police have registered a case under IPC Section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) based on her written statement and that of her family. Police sources said evidence would have to be collected from Canada, since the alleged crime took place there. “Violence demanding dowry, forced feeding of toilet cleaner, and forced drug use are among the charges levelled in the statements. But she had not mentioned forced drug abuse at the hospital she had sought treatment, while it also remains an enigma as to why she put up with the alleged ordeal for over a year in a country where the offender, if reported, would have met with severe punishment. Also, the family had levelled allegations against her in-laws, saying that they had also harassed her, in their petition to the Rural Superintendent of Police, while those charges were not there in the petition lodged with us,” said a senior officer associated with the probe. The police have issued a lookout notice, so that the woman’s husband does not leave the country. Meanwhile, CRS Smrithi Association, the Old Students Association of Cochin Refineries School Ambalamukal, of which the victim was an alumnus, is planning to form an action council, said Philip Jackson Biveira, its secretary. Representatives of the association met the victim on Wednesday. “She is a victim of domestic violence and that of forced drug and alcohol abuse. She could not reveal her ordeal while in Canada for fear of her life. We have collected all her medical records, which we will share with doctors in our association and take a call on the way forward shortly,” said Lakshmi Subramanian, a lawyer and a member of the association who met her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/woman-alleges-torture-by-husband-abroad/article33680471.ece
28 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Faecal contamination high in Perandoor, Edappally canals||The total coliform count, indicating faecal contamination, has exceeded the maximum permissible limits by 160 and 96 times respectively in Perandoor and Edappally canals. The alarming rise in the presence of coliform bacteria came to light during tests conducted by the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) from December 9 to December 23. The total coliform count in a sample collected from Monitoring Station-II in Perandoor canal was 4,00,000 cfu/100 ml. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the maximum permissible limit of faecal coliform in water used for organised outdoor bathing is 2,500 cfu/100 ml, while the desirable value is only 500 cfu/100 ml. The spike in coliform presence shows the indiscriminate discharge of septage into the two major canals. The board attributed the rise in coliform levels to the discharge of untreated sewage from households and commercial establishments into the canals. The microbiological examination of samples collected from another collection point in Perandoor canal found a total coliform count of 3,50,000 cfu/100 ml. It was nearly 140 times higher than the maximum permissible limit. The coliform presence in samples collected from Station-1 of the Edappally canal was 2,00,000 cfu/100 ml, which was nearly 80 times higher than the permissible limit. At Station-II, samples showed that coliform presence was 2,40,000 cfu/100 ml, nearly 96 times higher than the permissible limit. The Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), a proxy for organic pollution, was higher than the ideal limit of 3 mg/l prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board in samples collected from both the canals. The higher levels of BOD indicated the deteriorating ecological condition of the waterbodies. The board considers a BOD less than 3 mg/l an indicator of a healthy river stream. The BOD at Station-II in Perandoor canal was 35 mg/l, while the figure for samples collected from another spot was 14.5 mg/l. The BOD levels at Station-1 and Station-II in Edappally canal were 14.5 mg/l and 14.7 mg/l respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/faecal-contamination-high-in-perandoor-edappally-canals/article33680931.ece

Sujith C.S., who has been running a homestay for four years, was alerted about the death of his client of the past two years on Sunday morning. He was found hanging in a bedroom in the apartment by his aide who was sleeping next door. “He was my first client when I leased the building two years ago and had been staying on the first floor since then. He was found disturbed of late by the noise and dust from the construction of a building in the immediate neighbourhood and had even given a month’s notice to move out. But he could not find another ideal place and had agreed to continue his stay here when I offered a reduced tariff,” he said. The man used to exit the country and return every six months in compliance with visa norms, said Mr. Sujith, who now wants to dispose of the apartment, while he is no longer willing to host long-staying guests. He has another homestay in Fort Kochi. The Fort Kochi police registered a case for unnatural death but found nothing suspicious in the post-mortem report. “He was learnt to be depressed in the days leading up to his death, as his son was reportedly serving a prison term back in the US. We have alerted US Embassy officials, and the rest of the formalities will be completed once we hear from them,” said police sources. The body is kept at the Ernakulam General Hospital mortuary. Quoting the deceased’s aide, Mr. Sujith said he had not slept and was drinking heavily till around 5 a.m. before he retired to his bedroom. The aide also went to sleep thereafter and spotted the body when he woke up around 10.30 a.m., the police said. The man had stayed at Marari in Alappuzha for three years before he came to stay in Fort Kochi. The aide had been with him since his Marari days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/clients-death-leaves-homestay-operator-rattled/article33680462.ece

28 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Man arrested with fake Rs. 500 notes||The Panangad police on Wednesday arrested a man who was allegedly found in possession of fake Rs. 500 currency notes. The arrested man was identified as Anshad S., 32, of Irvaipuram in Kollam district. He was allegedly trying to pass off the fake currency in provision stores and such other places. He was nabbed on Tuesday night while trying to trick a provision store owner at Nettoor. He approached the store in the guise of buying provisions around 9.30 p.m. when the store was about to close and paid using a fake Rs. 500 note. Since he was in a hurry to close the store, the owner initially did not notice it and paid the balance amount. But he was quick to realise his mistake and raised an alarm, and with the help of local residents, stopped the accused, who was trying to flee on a scooter. The police were also alerted. The police party, while tapping him down, found four more similar fake Rs. 500 notes following which he was arrested. The arrest comes in the middle of a special drive against fake currency at the instance of C. H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City), and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Aishwarya Dongre. A team led by Thrikkakara Assistant Commissioner K. M. Gigimon and Panangad Station House Officer A. Ananthalal and comprising Panangad sub inspectors Rigin M. Thomas and Anas V.

Anilkumar said after visiting the area. A project to arrest waterlogging has been proposed with the help of GIZ (German Agency for International Cooperation). Under the Sustainable Urban Development – Smart Cities project, the Kochi Corporation and GIZ had conducted an urban design competition to come up with innovative solutions to waterlogging issues in the area of the 1.3-km-long Mullassery canal. Three winning entries were selected last year. The plans detailed in these entries revolve around protecting existing green spaces and creating new ones around the canal, allowing water to flow naturally through existing spaces which could retain some of the excess flow, and keeping the area pedestrian-friendly. A Detailed Project Report (DPR) would be prepared, integrating the plans in these entries, the Operation Breakthrough team’s proposals and the report prepared earlier by Esteem Developers, the Mayor said. The shortlisted entries from the competition would be exhibited soon in the area near the canal and the opinion of the public would be sought. People in the area and vendors would be consulted and not displaced before implementing the project, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mayor-promises-project-to-solve-waterlogging/article33680924.ece
28 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||A deep bonding that goes beyond borders||The death of a 68-year-old US citizen who had been staying in a homestay in Fort Kochi for the past two years has drawn attention to the practice of foreign tourists staying back for longer durations. Though not very common, some guests do prefer that, and homestay operators are not completely averse to it, since it is an assured income avenue even during off-seasons. “A strong bonding develops between homestay operators and guests in due course that goes beyond client-proprietor relations. Such guests are usually well-educated and choose to stay here as part of their retirement life. However, on the flip side, there could be complications if something happens to the guests during their stay here,” said M.P. Sivadattan, director, Kerala Homestays and Tourism Society (Kerala-HATS), a consortium of homestay providers. Usha Antony, who has been running a homestay in Fort Kochi for 14 years, felt that there was not much risk if the operators follow the relevant protocols, including submission of passport and visa details and duration of stay of foreign guests with the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) and the police.  S. Vijayakumar, Secretary, District Tourism Promotion Council, said there was no separate protocol for long-staying foreign guests other than the usual one applicable to all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-deep-bonding-that-goes-beyond-borders/article33680464.ece

28 January 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Justin gets his bike, smile back||A few days ago, thieves stole nine-year-old Justin’s new bicycle. Along with that he lost his smile too. But a plea from his differently abled father on social media connected the boy to just the right person. And on Republic Day, he was riding a new bicycle, thanks to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. As per the Chief Minister’s directive, District Collector M. Anjana visited Justine’s house on Republic Day and presented him with a brand-new bicycle. Officials said the boy’s face lit up with excitement when he got the bicycle. The act of kindness was especially meaningful to Justin’s father Suneesh Joseph who is differently abled. The 35-year-old runs an online service centre at Kuruvikkoodu Junction to eke out a living for his family of four. It had taken him several months to save Rs. 6,000 from his meagre income to buy a bicycle for his son. Although people assured him that the bicycle could soon be found, it began to break the father’s heart to hear his son constantly asking him, “When am I going to get it back?” “Justine was heart-broken but I couldn’t afford to get him a new bicycle instantly. So, I posted a message on social media requesting help to find out the stolen bicycle,” Mr. Joseph said. The message went viral and many offered a new bicycle for the boy. Moved by the family’s plight, the Chief Minister directed the Collector to buy a new bicycle for the boy. Akshaya Centre The Collector also promised Mr. Joseph that his request for allotting him an Akshaya Centre for him will be considered. “Upon the submission of documents from the local panchayat, the application will be taken up as a special case. The matter has been informed to the Chief Minister’s Office as well,” the Collector said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/justin-gets-his-bike-smile-back/article33680504.ece

During the meeting, Railways informed that work on the RoB at Mulanthuruthy had been completed as early as 2018 while work on the bridge at Carithas was on the final stages. The authorities are now awaiting nod from the Railway Safety Commissioner to carry out the remaining work on these two RoBs. In view of the lack of response to tenders for constructing the approach roads to these RoBs, Mr. Chazhikadan directed the officials to open the next round of tender on February 2 so as to complete the process by February 15. Land acquisition The meeting also decided to expedite acquisition of land for the Kuruppanthara RoB. The Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) will be tendering the works by July this year while the tendering process of Railways will be completed before November 30, 2021. The RBDCK officials will visit the Railway Chief Engineer’s office this week to expedite the approval of the General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) of the Kaduthuruthy flyover. The land acquisition process will be completed before January 31, 2022 and the tender process will begin soon afterwards.

Musafir Ahamed has said. He was reacting to a submission by councillor S.K. Aboobakker regarding the notice served on residents of the colony recently, asking them to vacate their quarters immediately, at the meeting of the corporation council on Wednesday. Mr. Aboobakker said that the 33 families in the colony, located near the corporation stadium, were financially backward and suggested the corporation build them homes under LIFE Mission. Corporation Secretary Binu Francis pointed out that the notice served by the corporation recently was part of a legal procedure as all people, except five families, in the colony were illegal residents who did not vacate the staff quarters even after they retired. Opposition councillors K. Moideen Koya and K.C. Shobhita also demanded an alternative facility before evicting the residents of the colony. The Deputy Mayor said that the issue would be discussed in detail. COVID spread Councillor V.K. Mohandas demanded immediate action to control the spread of COVID-19 in the city. He said that people who visit public places with families, especially on holidays, did not adhere to the COVID protocol, and there was no mechanism to control them. The Corporation Secretary listed the activities carried out by the Corporation to control the spread of the disease and stated that public cooperation was essential to implement them. Councillor N.C. Moyinkutty spoke about the traffic congestion at Mankavu Junction that needed immediate solution, while some others brought up similar issue at Palazhi due to the traffic in front of HiLite Mall. The Deputy Mayor suggested an immediate meeting of the traffic advisory committee to discuss the issue. Meanwhile, possibilities of a flyover as a permanent solution to the issue would be discussed with the Public Works Department, he said. Earlier, the Deputy Mayor denied permission to an adjournment motion by K.C. Shobhita. She wanted to highlight the gaps in fund allotment by the State government, which, the Deputy Mayor said, had already been brought to the attention of the government, and that the response was positive. Mayor Beena Philip was absent at the council meeting as she is in quarantine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-mulls-rehabilitation-of-sathram-colony-residents/article33680458.ece
28 January 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||IUWL makes strong pitch for women candidates||The ‘patriarchy’ label often attached to the functioning of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) by the party’s adversaries as well as a section of its women’s wing will once again be a talking point within and outside the party ahead of the parleys for selection of IUML candidates for the forthcoming Assembly elections. For the State committee of the Indian Union Women League (IUWL), known as Vanitha League in party circles, has decided to formally ask the IUML leadership to give adequate representation to women leaders while choosing candidates. For the IUML, which had fielded a woman candidate in the Assembly election only once (1996) ever since it was founded six decades ago, the label of patriarchy is not easy to shake off. The demand for more administrative and legislative representation of women leaders came to the fore when IUWL State committee formally made this demand to the IUML leadership before the 2016 Assembly elections. This time too the IUWL State committee decided to repeat what it had done five years ago. “The State committee of the Vanitha League has decided to formally demand to the IUML leadership that women members of the party be given due representation in the selection of candidates for the Assembly elections,” said P. Kulsu, State general secretary of the IUWL. Women members of the IUML had proved their mettle as members of local bodies, she said. However, she said the party’s decision would be supported as women members never felt any neglect within party bodies. According to IUWL leaders, the defeat of IUML candidate Qamarunnisa Anwar from Kozhikode-II Assembly segment in 1996 is cited by the party leadership as an excuse for denial of party tickets to women leaders. That female candidates of the party cannot win seats in the Assembly election is a wrong conclusion, they pointed out. “It is high time that adequate representation of women members of the party was made a policy of the parental organisation (IUML),” said IUWL general secretary P.K. Noorbina Rasheed, who is a practising lawyer. The leadership of the parental organisation should voluntarily field women candidates in the forthcoming election, she said noting that women were marginalised in all parties. It remains to be seen whether the IUML will field women candidates in the Assembly elections in response to the disgruntlement aired by a section of the IUWL. The IUWL, established as a feeder organisation of the IUML in early 1990s, is not known for raising banner of revolt against the party leadership when its demands for giving party tickets to women leaders in the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls in the State were overlooked. IUWL leaders such as Ms. Rasheed and Ms. Kulsu remained confident that the IUML would give women more representation in the Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iuwl-makes-strong-pitch-for-women-candidates/article33680465.ece

Speaking at an event organised here on Wednesday, he demanded that the government release data on the issue. Mr. Sathar asked the Opposition parties to pressurise the government to release a White Paper showing Muslim representation in government jobs. There had been allegations that it was the Muslim community that had largely benefited from government scholarships for minorities. Mr. Sathar alleged that this argument, propagated by the Sangh Parivar, was aimed at polarising society on communal lines. The government too had a role in facilitating circumstances conducive for raising the allegation. The government should appoint a committee to look into this. Mr. Sathar said that the Muslim community would not support politicians who did not stand by it during the time of crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-asked-to-clarify-on-minority-scholarships/article33680459.ece

Addressing a news conference here on Wednesday, he said that the celebrated public relations campaign of the State government had miserably failed. Half of the COVID-19 cases in the country were in the State having 4% of the total population of India, Mr. Surendran said. He ridiculed the statement of Health Minister K. K. Shylaja that the high population density of the State caused rising COVID-19 cases. The mounting cases could be attributed to failures in the measures adopted in the State, he alleged. He alleged that the government still showed an inept aptitude in dealing with the pandemic though the test positivity rate had crossed 15% in the State. The vaccine hesitancy witnessed in the State also showed the failure of the health department, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-laxity-caused-spike-surendran/article33680454.ece
28 January 2021||Malappuram,KERALA||Concern over anchoring of fishing boats in estuary||The anchoring of fishing boats in Kadalundi estuary is posing a threat to the ecologically sensitive mudflats and mangroves within the Kadalundi-Vallikkunnu Community Reserve (KVCR). Fishing boats from neighbouring places like Parappanangadi and Beypore have been increasingly seeking Kadalundi estuary for anchorage since the COVID-19 lockdown. The KVCR authorities, environmentalists, forest officials and scientists have warned that fishing boats in abundance can negatively affect KVCR, the first community reserve in the country. The oil that spills from boats and the increased movement of personnel working in boats within the ecologically fragile areas can negatively affect migrant birds that seek sanctuary in Kadalundi during the wintering months. Sensitive issue However, as it is a social issue involving the livelihood of fishermen, the authorities have been cautious in their approach. The Malabar Natural History Society (MNHS) and the KVCR managing committee raised concerns about Kadalundi’s ecological degradation in a recent meeting convened by the forest authorities in Kozhikode. “It is a sensitive issue, but it should be addressed for the conservation of the KVCR. There has been a perceptible decrease in the number of migrant birds arriving at Kadalundi,” said MNHS president Satyan Mepayur, quoting scientists from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). CMFRI marinologists validated the adverse effects that increased presence of fishing boats in the estuary can cause on the mudflats that remain the lifeline for migrant birds. Thousands of migrant shorebirds belonging to species ranging from sand plovers to sand pipers have been reaching Kadalundi from across continents during winter. Lesser sand plover remains the most popular among the 50-odd species identified at Kadalundi, one of the most popular wintering destinations along the west coast of India. Safe tourism P. Sivadasan, chairman of the KVCR managing committee, told The Hindu that increased presence of fishing boats would badly affect not only migrant birds, but also the tourism that they were promoting. “We are sanctioning only country boats with oars as part of promoting safe and sensitive tourism. If we don’t address in time such issues as waste and oil spill, the community reserve will die soon,” said Mr. Sivadasan. According to Mr. Satyan, the ecological changes taking place at Kadalundi would have cascading effects. The conservation of the mudflats had become the need of the hour, he said. T.R. Athira, who has been studying the habits of shorebirds reaching Kadalundi since 2016, said that there was a major change in the estuarine ecology after the back-to-back floods of 2018 and 2019. Sand dunes have increased, mangroves have proliferated and “ecological incursions of grave nature” have taken place at Kadalundi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/concern-over-anchoring-of-fishing-boats-in-estuary/article33680449.ece

The early-morning visit lasted for half an hour. IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty and State general secretary K.P.A. Majeed were present. IUML leaders said it was a courtesy meeting and the Congress leaders did not discuss anything serious or political. “It was a friendly meeting. They often come here. There’s nothing special,” said Mr. Thangal. However, Mr. Kunhalikutty hinted that the Congress leaders had initiated some serious talks about the elections. “During the friendly talks, they discussed matters that ought to be discussed with Mr. Thangal. But it was not a discussion on seat sharing,” Mr. Kunhalikutty said. He said the IUML and Congress leaders discussed the current political situation in the State. “Unofficial talks about seat sharing are currently on. We will have a formal sitting in Thiruvananthapuram, where we will finalise everything,” Mr. Kunhalikutty said. More seats Meanwhile, the IUML appears to up the ante by asking for more seats in the Assembly election.

A review meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Wednesday said the relaxations in control measures and the general laxity among the public had led to the sudden increase in cases and that the situation was likely to go out of hand if stringent measures were not put in place again.  More RT-PCR tests The Chief Minister directed that daily tests be increased to one lakh and that 75% of the tests be made RT-PCR. Everyone in migrant labour camps and workplaces such as cashew factories should be tested. Mr. Vijayan directed that COVID protocols be enforced strictly when public functions were held and that physical distancing and use of masks be implemented strictly. Sectoral magistrates who are in charge of COVID controls will continue their monitoring with the help of the police. Wedding celebrations and gatherings should not have more than 100 persons. The controls in containment zones would be made more stringent and by mid-February the State should be able to reduce disease transmission significantly, the Chief Minister said. It was pointed out that according to a study done at the community medicine department at Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital, 56% persons contracted the disease within their homes, the infection brought in by others from outside. Another 20% contracted the disease from shopping malls or markets and 20% from workplaces. About 65% of the infected were not using masks properly and that asymptomatic spread accounted for 30% of the infections. The meeting decided to empower local bodies to take up COVID control and to strengthen the awareness programmes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-case-graph-rising-govt-to-tighten-curbs/article33680519.ece
28 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||LDF to confront UDF on political, livelihood issues in Assembly polls||The Left Democratic Front (LDF) would fight the upcoming Assembly election primarily on twin fronts. On the political front, it would confront the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) for “kowtowing” to Islamist organisations and Hindu majoritarian forces in a feeble attempt to grasp power. LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan, who attended an LDF State committee here meeting here, said the UDF’s overtures to fundamentalist forces were akin to a drowning person grasping at straws. The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has exerted a stranglehold on the Congress, he said. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy had made a “pilgrimage” to Panakkad to meet the IUML supremo. The political message was clear, Mr. Vijayaraghavan said. The Congress in Kerala has become the ideological echo chamber of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Its response to the ‘anti-farmer’ laws was muted. The Congress has repeated every lie promulgated by the BJP against the State government. Mr. Vijayaraghavan said BJP cadres had cross-voted in strength to prop up UDF candidates in several local body constituencies. Livelihood issues “ignored” by the UDF would dominate the LDF campaign. It would launch an anti-Centre agitation to protest agaist the recurrent hike in fuel prices. Skyrocketing fuel prices could cause the cost of victuals trucked in from other regions into Kerala to spiral upwards, he said. ‘No clear vision’ Mr. Vijayaraghavan said the UDF had no clear vision about securing the necessities of life for the common folk. The coalition lacked political purpose and existed only to gratify its “insatiable” appetite for power. The UDF wanted to dismantle the LIFE Mission, the LDF’s flagship programme to provide free and modern housing to homeless families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-to-confront-udf-on-political-livelihood-issues-in-assembly-polls/article33680510.ece

28 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Zachariah’s writings reflect an enlightened mind: CM||Zachariah's writings are the reflection of an enlightened mind which always remains awake against intolerant tendencies and regressive ideas, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. He was speaking after presenting the 28th Ezhuthachan Puraskaram to writer Paul Zacharia at Secretariat Durbar Hall here on Wednesday. The award comprises a cash prize of Rs. 5 lakh, a citation and a plaque. He lauded Zacharia for his sharp criticism which has forced society and various religious communities to introspect. Black humour "He has criticised the Communist Party in his own humorous way. He has made society understand how patriotism is being misused by communalism. He beautifully weaved in black humour into his stories, making clear his disagreement to a decayed social setup. At the same time, he welcomed all streams of progressive thought. Zacharia has also been a strong voice against corporatisation," he said. Politics of writers Zacharia used his reply speech to speak extensively on the politics of writers accepting awards instituted by governments. He said that the LDF government in Kerala has a great significance in the current context, as the representative of a people who haven't surrendered to communal fascism. ‘‘The five power centres of government, religion, caste, media and economic interests control the lives of Malayalis. I have criticised each of these power centres in my own way, like several other citizens. Because I am a writer, or because of the silences of some writers, this voice might have been heard above all else. I have disagreements with the Pinarayi Vijayan government, else I would be a wooden doll. At the same time, I agree with the government in several things too. I accept this award on the basis of a politics which encompasses both these agreements and disagreements,’’ he said. He said that blind opposition, which regurgitates claims made by the media or Opposition parties or which becomes mouthpieces of caste or religious organisations, cannot be called criticism. It should be honest criticism based on an independent stand and human values. ‘‘Right now, politics decides what we should eat, what we should wear, whom we should love and whom we should marry. Autocracy has spread its tentacles in a much more effective manner than during the Emergency period. In this context, this Left government in Kerala, which has not surrendered to fascism, has a significance. It is important to strengthen the Left for the future of Kerala," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/zachariahs-writings-reflect-an-enlightened-mind-cm/article33680522.ece

Ramesh Kumar is acting in an “arbitrary and despotic manner” in issuing orders against senior government officers involved in the conduct of local body elections, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, Adviser (Public Affairs), has alleged. “The State government will stand by all the officers facing censure or being castigated by the SEC. The officers can continue to work without fear. The government will issue proceedings against the SEC orders. I advise the officers to file criminal defamation suit against the SEC. We believe that the SEC has crossed its limits in censuring or transferring officers at will. The SEC has entered into a conspiracy with TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy alleged while addressing the media at the party central office at Tadepalli on Wednesday. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy also faulted the SEC’s stand against the steps taken by the State government for ensuring free and peaceful elections, which included cash incentives to sarpanches and ward members of gram panchayats elected unanimously. “While we have taken this decision to ensure a peaceful poll and to reduce tension in the villages, the SEC thinks that the government is influencing the people. This is unfortunate,” said Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy. Stating that the government had taken a principled stand on the local body elections in the context of COVID-19 vaccination drive, he said it, however, abided by the Supreme Court’s decision. “We are confident of sweeping the elections and the people of the State are behind us. People are also watching the conspiracies of the Opposition in trying to create unrest by raking up communal issues,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/action-against-senior-officers-arbitrary-alleges-sajjala/article33680976.ece

28 January 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Long-pending Veligonda project nearing completion||The long-pending Pula Subbaiah Veligonda project, which was undertaken as part of the ‘Jalayagnam’ scheme during the tenure of former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, is nearing completion. But for some laborious dismantling work of about 1,000 tonne head of the tunnel boring machine (TBM), all other works including the Tunnel-I, have been completed, Superintending Engineer (constructions) N. Nagesh told The Hindu while taking stock of the progress of works at the project site in the Nallamalla forests. “Farmers can expect the Krishna water to reach their land during the coming kharif season,” he said, adding that they have a herculean task of dismantling the head of the TMB, which would save more than Rs. 24 crore to the exchequer. With a view to speed up the works, manual drilling was carried out from the other side of the gigantic Tunnel-I to a distance of 1,053 metres. As a result, the originally proposed towing of the entire TBM has been ruled out now. Now the dismantling of the TBM is being carried out inside the tunnel itself. “The head regulator works at Kollam Vagu is also nearing completion. We will be able to draw flood waters from the foreshore of Srisailam in all probability by August,” sources in the Irrigation Department said. As part of the project, two giant tunnels have been designed not to disturb the natural environment of the wild animals in the Nagarjunasagar-Srirsailam Tiger Reserve. The project, which originally was scheduled for completion in 2008, had suffered time and cost overruns in view of enormity of the drilling work with the TBMs procured from Germany and the U.S. Drilling work The government is keen on completing the Tunnel-II by August by speeding up the drilling to at least 1,000 metre a month. The work was hit due to conveyor belt issues. However, with multi-directional excavation method, the officials will be able to drill a distance of 7.5 km expeditiously, according to sources, adding that plans are afoot to drill at least 30 metres a day. The project has been designed to draw 43.50 tmcft of flood waters from the Krishna by gravity, which can irrigate 4.47 lakh acres in Prakasam, Kadapa, and Nellore districts, apart from supplying drinking water to over 15 lakh population in the fluoride-hit parts. Nallamala Sagar reservoir has been built by closing the Sunkesula, Gottipadia and Kakarla gaps to impound the Krishna water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/veligonda-project-nearing-completion/article33680422.ece
28 January 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Anganwadi workers seek fair deal||Hundreds of Anganwadi workers and helpers laid a siege to the Prakasam Bhavan here on Wednesday demanding regularisation of their services forthwith. The workers, who have been successfully running the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme launched by the Union Government since 1975, lamented that they were meted out a raw deal though their services were fully utilised to reach out to rural people. Though they took care of malnourished children, lactating mothers and pregnant women in remote locations, they were denied a minimum wage of Rs. 18,000, said Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union of India(AWHUI) Prakasam district unit general secretary Edara Annapurna. Demand for security benefits “How does the government expect us to feed our families with the meagre honorarium,” asked the functionary of the AWHUI, affiliated with the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. They also demanded social security benefits. Worried over ‘adverse events’ in some cases leading to deaths, they asked the government not to force them to accept COVID-19 vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anganwadi-workers-seek-fair-deal/article33680969.ece

The reptile also ate up eggs meant for distribution to the beneficiaries as part of the Take Home Ration (THR) programme. The cobra reportedly entered into the anganwadi through the damaged windows. The government is running a ward secretariat and an anganwadi out of the building of a closed Urdu elementary school. Anganwadi teachers Naga Lakshmi and Ayah Dhana Lakshmi found the cobra in the almirah and alerted the locals. When the staff tried to catch the reptile, it escaped into the nearby bushes. “There is an abandoned tank behind the anganwadi, in which some chicken shops are dumping their waste. Bushes have also grown up surrounding it. Snakes and other reptiles are slithering into the houses in the area. We are living in a fear,” said a local resident. West Godavari District Women Development and Child Welfare Project Director K. Vijaya Lakshmi said steps would be taken to take up the repairs to the anganwadi immediately. “Venomous snakes are moving freely in the area. As the anganwadi remained closed for the last few months in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, a major tragedy was averted. We request the government to shift the anganwadi and the ward secretariat immediately,” said a parent. Sanitation drive Palakol Municipal Corporation Commissioner N. Pramod Kumar said instructions have been issued to clean the premises of the anganwadi and the ward secretariat and their surrounding areas. “Estimates have been prepared to clear the bushes and take up a sanitation drive in the pond near the anganwadi,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/snake-found-in-almirah-at-anganwadi-centre/article33680989.ece

28 January 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vizag police system completes 160 years today||On January 28, 1861, exactly 160 years ago, the first police system was started in Visakhapatnam district, then known as Vizagapatam. The Government of Madras, by an Act XXIV of 1859, which was enacted on September 6, 1859, brought a police system in Madras Presidency, which was the foundation for the present police system. And what we see today in the district or in the city, is an implementation of that Act in 1861. At that time the presidency had about 21 revenue administrative districts and they were grouped under five police ranges such as Northern range, Western, Ceded Districts, Central, and Southern. Each range was headed by a Deputy Inspector General of Police and each of the districts by a Superintendent of Police. All them were then employees of the Imperial Police and the letters IP was inscribed on their shoulder tags. Vizagapatam was part of the Northern Range and Waltair was its headquarters, which was headed by a DIG rank officer. The four districts of Ganjam, Vizagapatam, Godavari (consisting of most parts of both East and West Godavari districts of the present day) and Krishna (consisting most parts of both Krishna and Guntur districts of the present day) were brought under Northern Range in 1861. The first DIG of Northern Range was Captain Tennant, and Superintendent of Police for Vizagapatnam was Lieutenant Stuart. Both were drafted from the British Army, said V. Edward Paul, chronicler of history of Visakhapatnam. According to him, many, including the ones in the police force, may not know about the exact formation of police system in the district, but all documents pertaining to them can be found in the archives in Chennai and in the British library in London. At that time the Vizagapatam district was the largest district in the whole of Madras Presidency, extending up to Rayagada in north and it included most part of Jeypore Zamindari. The Jeypore Zamindari area came under Vizagapatam District Police in January 1863 with the appointment of Captain Galbraith, as Assistant Superintendent of Police, said Mr. Paul. With the formation of Orissa State in 1936, the areas falling under Vizagapatam was carved out into Orissa State. The Visakhapatnam Revenue District was bifurcated into two police districts as Visakhapatnam North and Visakhapatnam South in 1946. After Independence, the two police districts of Visakhapatnam North and South were reorganised with the formation of Vizianagaram district in 1979, with the Viskhapatnam North going into Vizianagaram District. Thereafter, whole of the revenue district of Visakhapatnam formed into one police district. This again was bifurcated in 1983 into Visakhapatnam Urban and Visakhapatnam Rural. Out of the Visakhapatnam urban district, the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan area was carved into the Police Commissionerate in 1989. Campaign against Alluri Vizagapatnam District Police played a key role in the subduing the Rampa Rebellion led by Alluri Sitarama Raju from 1922 to 1924. Unable to rein in Alluri’s forces and guerilla tactics, the British deployed the Special Malabar Police, a paramilitary force that had the track record of quashing the Moplah rebellion in Kerala, under one Rutherford, who was appointed as the Special Commissioner. It was from here that Rutherford led the forces and the armoury then used to store weapons can still be seen at Police Barracks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizag-police-system-completes-160-years-today/article33681069.ece
28 January 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police Dept. yet to clear Rs. 7.35-crore dues to TTD||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) finds it challenging to collect the pending revenue dues for its buildings leased out to the Police Department, which over the years has accumulated to a staggering Rs. 7.35 core. Several letters sent by the TTD to the department in this regard have yielded no result, its officials say, adding that the temple trust board could neither collect the dues nor get its premises vacated. The TTD had temporarily leased out several buildings in Tirupati to the Police Department for carrying out their activities. Thirteen rooms in the TTD’s erstwhile Sri Venkateswara High School in the heart of the town were leased out for a monthly licence fee of Rs. 1.51,307 for a year in July 2010 after the formation of Tirupati (Urban) Police District. With, no payment of the fees during the past ten years, the dues has accumulated to more than Rs. 6.11 crore. Likewise, the dues pertaining to the eight portions leased out at TTD’s S.V. Rest House in Tirupati for a monthly fee of Rs. 10,553 is pegged around Rs. 1.19 crore. In addition to these, the TTD is yet to get around Rs. 4.70 lakh for its building at Sri Padmavati Women Degree College which it had leased out for the camp office of the Superintendent of Police in April, 2001 for a monthly licence fee of Rs. 3,483. This apart, the TTD is yet to collect the licence fee for its building in the Nehru Street, which it claims, under unauthorised occupation of the department since 1989.  While the deliberations for the collection of the dues were on, the TTD found itself cornered when Tirupati SP reportedly dashed a letter in June, 2014, claiming that a whopping Rs. 123.47 crore was to be reimbursed to the department towards the AR guard charges. The Police Department reportedly urged the TTD to adjust the arrears of licence fees against it. Letter to CS The TTD, in turn, addressed a letter to the Chief Secretary last April, with a request to consider waiving off the pending arrears of guard charges of Rs. 74.72 crore. It said the government should henceforth bear the financial expenses involved in the engagement of the SPF personnel as the onus of safety and protection of temples rested on it. Much to its dismay, the TTD received a memo from the Chief Secretary on June 4, 2020 wherein it was conveyed that the proposal submitted by it was rejected as the Finance Department did find it feasible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-dept-yet-to-clear-rs-735-crore-dues-to-ttd/article33680987.ece
28 January 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Panel to take action as students complain about lack of facilities||Students of a private college have given a written complaint to Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) over the lack of facilities like laboratories, library and playground. The college representatives were in jitters when the students also mentioned that they had paid Rs. 1.30 lakh as fee for the infrastructure. When abstaining contract faculty members are replaced by new ‘graduates’ on a daily basis, the students also complained of missing out on continuity in lessons. ‘No COVID protocol’ Accompanied by Regional Joint Director Viswanatha Naik and Regional Intermediate Officer V. Sreenivasulu Reddy, panel members V. Narayana Reddy and B. Eswaraiah made a surprise visit to a couple of private junior colleges in New Balaji Colony here on Wednesday when they were taken aback to see 90 students seated in one classroom, against the 40 mandated as per the COVID guidelines. The fan had been turned off and windows kept closed to prevent outside noise and smoke emanating from the neighbouring tea stall, making it look like a dungeon. “It was absolutely dark and suffocating, which the students had no option but to endure”, Prof. Narayana Reddy told the media conference later.  Parents’ committees Blaming parents for not monitoring the facilities available at the institutions where their wards studied, the commission insisted on formation of parents’ committees to facilitate regular interaction with the management. On the ‘hefty fee’ being collected by some institutions, especially in rural areas, he said such institutions would be sternly dealt with. As corporate education has percolated down to the mandal level, Prof. Reddy said the State-prescribed fee structure would be prominently displayed in the village secretariat buildings and at Panchayat offices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/panel-to-take-action-as-students-complain-about-lack-of-facilities/article33680973.ece

28 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||SEC warns against failure to exercise due diligence on unanimous polls||State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar on Wednesday expressed his resolve to take appropriate action against any government functionary found to have not done due diligence on unanimous elections as there was a limit for it, and said the fear of some parties that the election process could be subverted to someone’s advantage in the guise of such elections was not misplaced. “Unanimous elections have been a long-standing tradition, to which I am not opposed outright,” he said. Mr. Ramesh Kumar also said he would not hesitate to approach the Supreme Court again if the spirit of its judgment was violated in any manner, irrespective of the stature of the persons who vitiated the elections. ‘Minister’s comments unfortunate’ Addressing the media here, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said it was unfortunate that a Minister attributed motives to his action of censuring Principal Secretary (Panchayat Raj) Gopal Krishna Dwivedi and Commissioner M. Girija Shankar in spite of the scathing comments made by the apex court on the public abuse of the commission. Such unwarranted statements by those in power were against the spirit of the apext court judgment, the spirit of the Constitution and the Code of Conduct as well, he said. He pointed out that as the SEC, he ought to fulfil his accountability to the people.Mr. Ramesh Kumar said a final decision had not yet been taken on the complaints of intimidation of candidates in the run-up to filing of nominations for the ZPTC and MPTC elections. He insisted that the Collectors and SPs were duty-bound to ensure that the polls were not marred by blackmailing and attacks on contestants. “If such incidents happen, the SEC will not keep quiet,” he warned. Explanation sought on ads Referring to advertisements of incentives the government announced for the panchayats going for unanimous polls, the SEC said he sought an explanation from the Information & Public Relations Department, which released the ads ‘in blatant violation of the Code of Conduct.’ . He also ordered that the Commissioner of I&PR Department T. Vijay Kumar Reddy should refrain from issuing such advertisements and prior consultation with the SEC was mandatory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sec-warns-against-failure-to-exercise-due-diligence-on-unanimous-polls/article33680983.ece
28 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Forget the past and ensure smooth conduct of elections’||Asserting that he had never misused his discretionary powers, State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar on Wednesday exhorted the government officials to make a concerted effort in the available time for the smooth conduct of the Gram Panchayat elections in an apolitical manner. If unanimous elections were found to be due to pressure or other electoral malpractices, stringent action would be taken against the Returning Officers and the Assistant Returning Officers. “The past should be forgotten and focus laid on the road ahead as the elections are crucial and all possible cooperation must be extended to the commission that is fulfilling its constitutional mandate,” Mr. Ramesh Kumar said while addressing alll the District Collectors through a video - conference. Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das, Director General of Police D. Gautam Sawang, Additional DGP Ravi Shankar Ayyanar, Principal Secretary (Panchayat Raj) Gopal Krishna Dwivedi, Commissioner M. Girija Shankar, Principal Secretary (Finance) S.S. Rawat and Commissioner (Health & Family Welfare) Katamneni Bhaskar were among others present in the meeting. Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the commission would take action on genuine issues raised by the employees, and that he was not taking cognisance of “objectionable comments” made by some employees’ unions, hinting that he was more bothered about the circumstances under which elections had to be conducted. ‘No role for volunteers’ He ordered that the village volunteers should neither be used for election duty nor for campaigning, and warned that negligence in issuing caste and income certificates by the MROs during the election process would be dealt with sternly. Mr. Ramesh Kumar further said that polling would be closely monitored with the help of a special mobile application to ensure that the process was fair and transparent. Video footage and photographs could be uploaded on the mobile app by the officials concerned. A separate cell was being set up by the commission for keeping a tab on the elections. COVID vaccination Mr. Aditya Nath Das said that the employees need not fear that they might contract coronavirus infections as the State government was doing all possible it could to prevent the transmission of the virus while precautions were expected to be taken at the individual level. COVID-19 vaccine would continue to be administered alongside. Mr. Sawang said special teams were being formed to maintain law and order, and that steps were taken to get the police personnel inoculated in advance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/alert-sounded-on-unanimous-elections/article33680240.ece

28 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Allow online nominations for panchayat polls: Somu||BJP State president Somu Veerraju has demanded that the government ensure free and fair local body polls and prevent violence. The Chief Minister has to counsel Ministers, MLAs and his party leaders to refrain from forcing candidates to opt out of the race, he said. The State Election Commission (SEC) should allow online nominations after holding consultations with the government so that candidates would not be prevented from filing their papers, Mr. Veerraju suggested. Addressing the media on Wednesday, Mr. Veerraju said the alliance partners would support candidates who had strong chances of winning in all panchayats, and that the BJP-Jana Sena Party (JSP) alliance would put up a fight in the by election for the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat. Jana Sena political affairs committee chairman Nadendla Manohar criticised what he called the dictatorial attitude of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his lack of respect for the Constitution. He alleged that the government was conspiring to capture many gram panchayats through the so-called unanimous elections by misusing its official machinery and that the same would be taken to the notice of the Governor whose appointment was sought on January 29. Mr. Manohar said the State Election Commissioner (SEC) would also be apprised of the need to keep a close watch on the unanimous elections about which open statements were being made by Ministers and ruling party leaders. The SEC would also be requested to allow filing of nominations online wherever the situation warranted as there were multiple instances where candidates were prevented from submitting their papers to the election officials. Some Ministers were involved in the incidents, he alleged. Meeting with Governor today A delegation of the BJP-JSP combine will meet Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan on Thursday and submit a memorandum urging him to allow online nomination system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/allow-online-nominations-for-panchayat-polls-somu/article33680806.ece

At a press conference here on Wednesday, JAC member Yalamanchili Praveen Kumar lamented that “Christianity is under constant attack by political parties in the State.” He said anguished by this, the JAC decided to respond to the derogatory remarks being made against the community. He said the JAC resolved to hold mandal and district-level meetings to elicit views of the community people on the issue and bring them on to a common platform in a show of strength. Condemning the remarks made by TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu against Christians, Mr. Kumar said it was not their intention to degrade other religions and Christians only wanted to spread the love of Christ. “We are not against any party or community,” he clarified. Honorarium Referring to Mr. Naidu’s allegations on religious conversions, Mr. Kumar demanded that the TDP leader prove his charge. He reminded that Mr. Naidu had also promised in his party’s election manifesto that it would pay an honorarium of Rs. 5,000 to the pastors and had also taken their blessings. He said the JAC was ready for a public debate on the allegations levelled by the Telugu Desam Party chief and added that the committee members would go around the State to discuss the issue with the community representatives and take up a State-wide protest against Mr. Naidu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/christians-decry-naidus-charge-on-conversions/article33680325.ece

In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said the SEC was picking holes in the government’s appeal for “peace, brotherhood, and friendliness” among people in the villages. The statement was not political as was perceived by the SEC, he added. The government announced financial incentives to encourage unanimous elections and, thereby, enable gram panchayats to concentrate on development work. “These incentives have been in practice for decades. The commission should have found fault with the TDP government too that had followed a similar procedure. The SEC, however, was silent then,” he alleged. Mr. Ramesh Kumar should explain what was the basis for his comments that unanimous elections should be subjected to some limitations. “Does it have any legal standing?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/peddireddi-objects-to-sec-remarks/article33680981.ece

APTDC has six resorts in the district — two in Vizag city (Rushikonda, Appughar), Jungle Bells at Tyda, Mayuri and Yatri Nivas at Araku and Hill Resorts at Ananthagiri. All these hotels consist of 282 rooms, including suites, AC and non-AC rooms. Some of the resorts were opened about 10 to 15 years ago. Amid growing competition from new private hotels, the corporation wants these hotels to get a new look to attract tourists. On a pilot basis, the APTDC has upgraded a couple of suite rooms with all facilities at Araku Yatri Nivas and they had received good response from the tourists. On the lines of these upgraded rooms, the APTDC officials have planned to give similar facelift to other rooms in the remaining hotels in the district. In this regard, recently, the APTDC has prepared a feasibility report and sent proposals for the facelift with a budget of about Rs. 35 crore, to the State government. However, the final estimates are yet to be finalised. APTDC Divisional Manager, Visakhapatnam, T.G. Prasad Reddy, said that the State government too has given its nod for their proposal. Works for the project will begin soon and the department would go for tenders, he said. “Rooms, interiors, furniture, seating and restaurants will be upgraded,” he said. Mr. Reddy said that several rooms were renovated in Yatri Nivas. About 20 rooms and a conference hall are yet to be renovated, he added. APTDC hotels in the region generally receive a good number of visitors. During the peak season in winter, several hotels witness 100% occupancy. Located near the scenic valleys, a number of domestic tourists from in and around the district and foreigners throng these hotels during their visit to Araku, Paderu and Lambasingi in winter every year.

28 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pre-term baby girl weighing 420 gm survives against all odds||A premature baby girl, weighing only 420 gm at birth, has survived against all odds, thanks to the efforts of a team of doctors lead by Sai Sunil Kishore, chief neonatologist at Medicover Hospital. The baby born on July 31 last year, during the 23rd week of pregnancy of her mother, was discharged in a healthy condition with a weight of 1.65 kg on January 21, after spending 170 days in the hospital. A child born after 40 weeks of gestation is called a full-term delivery, and anything below 37 weeks is considered a pre-term delivery. In India, only 1% of the babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy. “The baby weighed just 420 gm when she was born. She was in an extremely critical state and the chances of her survival were minimal, even by the western standards,” Dr. Sunil Kishore told the media on Wednesday. The doctor said her lungs and other organs were functionally so immature that her development was stunted. ‘Zero immunity’ “She had zero immunity, thus prone to severe infections. The baby was administered surfactant injections to make her immature lungs to breathe. She was also given medicines and nutrition through hair thin central lines,” said Dr. Sunil Kishore. At this stage, she had very immature transparent skin, which mandated extreme care to avoid infections. She required invasive ventilation for 25 days and non-invasive ventilation for 30 days. The baby was given only mother’s milk. She was under supportive care which helped her survive, he said. “With advanced technology and healthcare, such micro preemies can be saved. Now, Now, she is taking feeds well, with normal vision and brain function. She will require regular doctor check-ups for the next two years,” said Dr. Sunil Kishore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pre-term-baby-girl-weighing-420-gm-survives-against-all-odds/article33681054.ece

28 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||A sure-footed dancing genius||Kanaka Raju is a short wispy thin man, with a pencil moustache, a mischievous smile and a pair of feet meant for dancing. The man from Marlavai village in Asifabad district is the sole winner of Padma Shri from Telangana and he basks in the limelight that comes with the recognition. Friends, relatives and officials pass their cellphones to him as he patiently repeats his story about how he captured the attention of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the nation in early 80s. Tryst with Indira Gandhi “I was a fearless young man. When Indira Gandhi entered the place where we were performing, I took the peacock feathers headgear and placed it on her head. I tied ghungroo to her feet and she danced with us for a few minutes,” says Raju. For the guru of Ghusadi-Dandari folk dance, who is known by his moniker Ghusadi Raju, it has been a long journey from the time he caught the eye of an Utnoor Integrated Tribal Development Authority official, Madavi Tukaram. The Ghusadi dance with the men decked with peacock feathers began as a courtship ritual in a matriarchal society. “Every year after Deepavali, batches of young men travel from village to village with invitations where they do puja and dance in the evening. Young girls choose their husbands from among them after finding details of their family,” says Mr. Raju. Dandari appears like dandiya where men dance with sticks. Ironically, for a man who has created a buzz about the courtship ritual, he got married when his father chose the girl for him. In the course of time as the tribal society moved away from nature, it was Kanaka Raju who trained young men in the dance form that mimics horses, cows, snakes, tribals, dandari and their divinity. “They should dance just like me without thinking. The feet should tap at the same time. I learnt on my own when I was eight. I began watching others and learning. People started talking about me and inviting me to their villages to train young men,” says Mr. Raju, who lives with his family of three sons and eight daughters. “I do farming and rest of the year, I go for work wherever it is available,” says Mr. Raju, who is set to get cash reward and a plot of land for farming from the Telangana government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-sure-footed-dancing-genius/article33680896.ece

If the coverage according to the percentage in each district is considered, the highest of 94.2% was recorded in Bhadradri-Kothagudem. Of the 7,073 listed beneficiaries there, 6,662 got the jab. The second highest was in Medchal-Malkajgiri (87.9%) with as many as 2,369 out of 2,696 individuals being immunised. In Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, 2,716 out of 3,200 took the vaccine, which worked out to 84.9%. The coverage was comparatively low in the districts which had highest targets. When coverage in terms of highest number of immunisation and the target are taken into account, Hyderabad is in first position. While 27,725 beneficiaries were planned to be inoculated in the State capital, 9,610 took the jab — a mere 34.7% of the target. Though it is the lowest vaccination percentage among all districts, 9,610 was the highest number of healthcare workers who took the jab. The vaccine drive was launched on January 16. It is held on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. From January 16 to 24, of the total 1,71,599 targeted healthcare workers in government sector, 1,10,251 were immunised. On January 25, vaccination for healthcare workers in private hospitals was initiated. After a two-day gap, it will resume from Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bhadradri-tops-covid-19-vaccine-coverage-in-state/article33680891.ece

She also praised the customs department in ensuring vaccine transportation across the country and its export abroad. It deserved extra praise for the preparedness to detect the future threat of spurious vaccines. This will effectively prevent the threat of spurious vaccines in future, she said addressing the International Customs Day 2021 celebrations organised by Hyderabad Customs Commissionerate on Wednesday. Commending the services of customs to help the country get vaccinated and prevent spurious vaccines, the Governor said she had cancelled her prior engagements in Chennai to be present on the occasion to appreciate the services of departmental officers as frontline warriors. “I always give top priority to honour COVID-19 warriors, to be there and to be with them, and here I am with you all to honour you as you were all at the forefront”. Referring to the department’s expertise in detecting and preventing gold smuggling, the Governor said the officers were getting even smarter and changing strategies like a virus that underwent mutations and came up with new strains to outshine the smugglers who were adopting weird methods to smuggle gold. “The smugglers are weirdly concealing the gold in their body parts and you are getting innovative to call their bluff,” she said. The Governor’s husband P. Soundararajan, Chief Commissioner of Indirect Taxes and Customs Malika Arya, Principal Commissioner J.S. Chandrahekar, Principal Chief Commissioner (IT) J.B. Mohapatra and Principal Commissioner (GST) D. Purushottam were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/governor-commends-export-of-drugs/article33680893.ece

28 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Tried to strike balance between welfare, need for reasonable pay hike’||The Pay Revision Commission (PRC) has claimed that it has tried to strike a balance between the welfare of people and the need for a fair and reasonable increase in pay and allowances of employees while finalising the recommendations. The commission said, in its report, that it has to tread the fine line between economic rationale and the aspirations of employees and arrive at a judgement on how much of the State’s resources can be spared for providing an increase in the salaries and pensions of employees. “Though the State started with a small surplus in its financial resources, the heavy commitment taken up by the government to meet the aspirations of people had in fact put the State in a financial stress,” the commission said. The PRC made an in depth study of the financial situation as one of its mandates was to take into account the overall financial position of the government before making recommendations on pay revision and allowances. The commission recalled how the State government sanctioned a special incentive equal to an increment to all employees and the 43% fitment, which was 14% over and above the fitment recommended by the earlier PRC. “This was the highest ever fitment recommended in the State after Independence,” the commission said, adding that employees’ associations made representations seeking a similar or better fitment. The PRC said Telangana despite being a middle income State achieved considerable improvement in the levels of per capita income. But, the State ranked below a number of States in terms of human development indicators. The outstanding debt as percentage of the GSDP slowly grew from 16.03% in 2014-15 and was likely to reach 21.39% in 2019-20, according to budget estimates. The repayment schedule on projects like Mission Kakatiya and Mission Bhagiratha and its associated works was likely to start from the current financial year and there was likelihood of increase in outstanding debt in the coming years putting strain on the revenues. The expenditure on major subsidies, including free power to farm sector, subsidies in account of fee reimbursement and other schemes had gone up from 32.76% in 2016-17 to 52.4% in 2019-20. Coupled with this was the expenditure on salaries and establishment accounting to 89.86% leaving hardly any scope for other developmental programmes. Apart from these, the State had started Rythu Bandhu scheme with an annual budget of more than Rs. 10,000 crore that further reduced any scope for other developmental works in the State. “The situation is likely to put a serious constraint on the growth of the expenditure in the coming at least 5 years,” the commission pointed out. Despite the constraints, the commission said it was of the considered view that reasonable increases were necessary to attract talented people to government service, to retain them and nurture in them a sense of commitment to public service. An attempt had accordingly been made to present an outline of the State’s performance in recent years and demands on its resources to arrive at an informed view of the reasonable pay structure for employees consistent with the resource position of the government, the Commission said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tried-to-strike-balance-between-welfare-need-for-reasonable-pay-hike/article33680911.ece
28 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘A cruel joke on employees’||Telangana Congress has termed the Pay Revision Committee (PRC) recommendations a huge disappointment and a cruel joke on employees, and assured that the party would stand with them. TPCC working president A. Revanth Reddy wondered whether any scientific method was used to arrive at 7.5% fitment, which was nothing but “insulting employees”. He said that 7.5% fitment was announced in 1974 and it was a shame that similar percentage was announced after nearly 50 years. AICC secretary and former Minister G. Chinna Reddy and former MLA Ch. Vamshichand Reddy said the announcement of just 7.5% fitment instead of 63% requested by employees, teachers and pensioners was the worst ever in the State. Mr. Chinna Reddy said that the Chief Minister had called for PRC report sensing the anger of employees before the elections but has disappointed all. He reminded that in the combined AP, when K. Rosaiah was the Chief Minister, employees got a fitment of 35%. He alleged KCR government was playing the careers and lives of employees and that the Congress would support them in their agitation for just demands. Mr. Vamshichand said that a minimum pay scale of Rs. 19,000 instead of Rs. 25,000 was all the more unfair. “The PRC report is a curse on lakhs of employees fighting for the cancellation of CPS,” he said and demanded the government to consult all employees, teachers, pensioners and CPS unions to take acceptable decisions. TRS response Meanwhile, TRS leaders did not respond. Neither MLAs nor ministers mentioned about it at any of their meetings or interactions with the media. A few MLAs, who were sought their opinion, refused to comment saying the CM would take a decision that would benefit employees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-cruel-joke-on-employees/article33680914.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao’s court with the employees’ unions planning to represent the ‘injustice’ done to employees through the PRC recommendations to him. The employees’ unions said they could not digest the PRC recommendations, which confined the crucial fitment benefit to 7.5%. In addition, there was a cut in house rent allowance. “This appears to be pay deduction committee, not revision committee,” employees’ representative Mamta commented. Representatives of the Telangana NGOs Association, Telangana Gazetted Officers’ Association and Telangana Secretariat Association held discussions with the three-member high power committee headed by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar on Wednesday. They said the panel had submitted its report 31 ‘long’ months after its constitution and the development was an outcome of the employees’ meeting with the Chief Minister, where the insecurity of the staff was explained to the latter. The representatives said the PRC was only an advisory body and it was the government that should take a political decision. “We have full faith in the CM. We will convince the government to ensure that fitment is not brought down below 43%,” another representative M. Rajender said. Ms. Mamata said that the recommendations were ‘highly unscientific’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/employees-unions-seek-cms-intervention/article33680912.ece

She told a meeting of District Education officers and District Intermediate Education officers that it was not compulsory for children to go to schools. They would be permitted to attend classes only if their parents gave consent. Depending on their parents’ preferences, children could either opt for physical attendance in schools or online classes. Since lakhs of children will go to schools, it was necessary that the managements took complete COVID precautions. It was their responsibility to instil confidence in parents about the safety of their children in schools. The district level education committees will prepare action plans and monitor the functioning of schools. Only fresh rice and other edible items should be used in mid-day meal (MDM) programme. Also, classrooms should be regularly sanitised and thermal screening applied on all children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/60-parents-okay-to-send-children-to-schools/article33680913.ece

The recommendation for a fitment of 7.5% on basic pay is a major disappointment when prices are sky-rocketing, they said. Official statement by CPI State Secretary Chada Venkat Reddy said the pay revision falls way short of the employees’ expectations of a fitment at 63%. Decrease in House Rent Allowance is astonishing when land rates and house rents are soaring, Mr. Reddy said, citing the spiralling prices of fuel, and essential commodities. Maternity leave for women employees is only a fraction of those granted for Central government employees. This indicates government’s interference in PRC, the statement said, and demanded that the government hold immediate deliberations with employees’ unions and take a positive decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/left-parties-criticise-prc-fitment/article33680915.ece

28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Have stepped up vigil to keep rogue elements away, say farmers||A day after the tractor rally turned violent, protesting farmers at the Tikri border on Wednesday said they had increased vigil at the protest site to prevent “rogue elements” from infiltrating the protest. With most of the farmers blaming “outsiders” for the violence that erupted during the tractor parade, several volunteers and village pradhans said regular meetings were being held with the protesting farmers to ensure that “anti-social elements” do not enter the protest. Jaswinder Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Sangrur district, said:“After Tuesday, volunteers have been strengthened and given specific instructions. As for the general public, we have asked the village heads to speak to people from their respective areas and increase awareness not only about the laws but also about the fact that rogue elements might try to breach the protest again.” Designated routes “We were on the designated route and did not want any violence. The clashes took place when some found barricades on the designated routes. While we tried to convince people to not create an issue, some ended up straying from the procession,” said Mr. Singh. Manpreet Singh, a 23-year-old volunteer at the protest, added: “We have been here since the first day and we ensured that all of us follow the designated route. However, because several unknown people ended up infiltrating the protest, violence erupted. We are now being more alert and the village-level leaders are having meetings with people of their villages.” Several other farmers also claimed that during the parade they encountered several locals in private vehicles who allegedly tried to incite the crowd and resorted to violence. Angrez Singh, a farmer from Haryana’s Sirsa district said: “The route we were told had barricades when the rally started. Despite being on the correct route the police fired tear gas at us. During the parade we saw several private vehicles with Delhi registrations. The protesting farmers were on their tractors. How did these private vehicles enter the protest and start throwing stones?” Agitation to continue Stating that the agitation would continue, the protesting farmers reiterated their demands of the three farm laws being repealed. Gurpreet Singh, a farmer from Sirsa, said: “The reason we are here is because we are fighting for our rights. We are a peaceful lot and we never wanted violence. In a protest which has these many thousands of people, at times it becomes difficult to control as there is a high chance of unscrupulous elements infiltrating. However, the farmers who have been fighting for their rights peacefully for so many months now ensured that they stuck to the route specified by authorities.” ‘Movement discredited’ Another farmer, Hardeep Singh added: “Everyone knows who created the ruckus, as their photos are quite visible with the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. By inciting violence and highlighting the same, the entire peaceful movement is being discredited.” Simarjeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Sri Muktsar Sahib district, said: “We went till the Peeragarhi Chowk and did not proceed further. We were around 50 of us with five to six tractors. While we maintained decorum and followed routes given to us, some elements ended up creating a ruckus at the Red Fort. The ones who raised flags over there were not the real farmers who have been protesting peacefully for all these months.”  The route that we were told had barricades when the rally started.

But none of the policemen on bandobast duties had imagined what eventually unfolded. Nursing grave injuries at city hospitals, a bunch of these policemen spoke to The Hindu and recounted what they now call “a near-death experience”. “We were on duty at the Red Fort when a large group of protesters forcefully entered the premises and went straight to rampart after breaking open the main gate. We tried to remove them but they turned aggressive and attacked the police personnel with swords and sticks. Many received serious head injuries and requested protesters to give way to injured policemen. A protester hit me with a sword on head and my helmet broke into two pieces. I became unconscious and my fingers were seriously injured. We all tried to restrain as we were dealing with farmers. If we had used force, there would have been numerous casualties and loss of lives,” said inspector P.C. Yadav. Head constable Narendra of Lahori Gate police station got injuries on back after he was pushed in the trenches by a group of protesters. “My shoulder got dislocated and suffered injuries on my back as I was thrown from a height of around 20 feet. We tried to stop protesters entering the Red Fort but were cornered and pushed in the trenches. Protesters tried to snatch our weapons but they failed to succeed,” said Mr. Narendra. Constable Mohan of Lal of Wazirabad police station, who is undergoing treatment at Trauma Centre at Civil Lines, said he has never seen a mob of this kind in a decade’s service. “A protester tried to ran a tractor over him and he jumped to save his life. I got my right hand fractured. We have been ordered to show maximum restrain and not to open fire at any situation and we followed the orders,” said Mr. Lal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/for-policemen-a-near-death-experience/article33680572.ece

A senior police officer said that three finials located on top of the domes of the fort have been found damaged. The CISF have beefed up security in and around the structure. The officer said that religious flags furled at the fort were brought down by policemen and confiscated. “The protesters damaged ticket counter, X-ray scanner and police vehicles parked on the Red Fort premises. Entry of public at the monument is restricted,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/3-finials-at-red-fort-damaged/article33680570.ece

He has to file a reply within three days. Chinmoy Biswal, DCP (Headquarters) said despite agreeing to mutually decided terms and conditions for the rally, Mr. Pal and other farmer leaders acted irresponsibly on Tuesday. These militant elements occupied the stage and started provocative speeches right from the early hours of Tuesday, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/explain-breach-of-agreement-with-police/article33680868.ece
28 January 2021||chandigarh,||Abhay Chautala quits as MLA||Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Chautala, a sitting MLA from Ellenabad in Haryana, on Wednesday resigned from the Legislative Assembly over the Centre’s new farm laws. Mr. Chautala, the sole MLA in Haryana from his party, submitted his resignation to Speaker Gian Chand Gupta here. The Speaker told journalists that the resignation had been accepted with immediate effect. In his resignation, Mr. Chautala mentioned that he was quitting because demands of farmers, who had been agitating against the Centre’s farm laws, had not been accepted, said Mr. Gupta. The resignation of Mr. Abhay Chautala, who is the uncle of Dushyant Chautala, Deputy Chief Minister in Haryana government, is being seen as an attempt to corner Mr. Dushyant, who has been under pressure from protesting farmers and the opposition parties to withdraw from coalition with the BJP in the State government by resigning from his post over farm laws. Mr. Dushyant Chautala of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) has been defending the new farm laws as “pro-farmer”. After his resignation, Mr. Chautala said the Centre should immediately repeal the three farm laws. He said farmers had been agitating peacefully, but to discredit the farmers and the ongoing movement, the BJP government had brought antisocial elements that resulted in violence in Delhi on Republic Day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/abhay-chautala-quits-as-mla/article33680870.ece
28 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘Don’t deny farmers their just demands’||A day after the incidents of violence on Republic Day in Delhi, the Shiromani Akali Dal has said that it stood against the use of violence in any form by anyone. “We are firmly of the view that Punjab and the country can progress and prosper only through preserving the atmosphere of peace and communal harmony,” said the statement issued after an emergency meeting of its core committee here. In a resolution, the party cautioned the Centre against using these incidents as an excuse to deny the farmers their just demands. “We will aggressively pursue these demands in the upcoming session of Parliament,” said the statement. Separately, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia demanded an international inquiry into the manner in which a few self-styled leaders in the garb of farmers incited violence in Delhi. These antisocial elements, he said, had played into the hands of agencies that wanted to torpedo the farmers’ agitation. Mr. Majithia said SAD stood with the farmers and would continue to fight for the cause of the farming community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dont-deny-farmers-their-just-demands/article33680872.ece
28 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Ghazipur quiet after fissures among groups||The Ghazipur protest site on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway was unusually quiet on Wednesday evening after fissures emerged between farm groups over incidents of violence in Delhi on Republic Day. V.M. Singh of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan declared that his organisation was withdrawing from the protest after the violence on Tuesday. “The protest deviated from the agenda on Republic Day. We were not supposed to go to the Red Fort and unfurl a religious flag that is meant to be hoisted on gurdwaras,” he told reporters. He and Rakesh Tikait were among several farmer leaders booked by the Delhi Police on Wednesday for violent clashes in the Capital on Tuesday. Mr. Singh, the ex-convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), said he could not work with Mr. Tikait anymore as he was among the ones who instigated farmers to break the barricades before the scheduled time. Though the working group of AIKSCC removed him from the position of convener last month, a significant number of farmers present at the Ghazipur border owed allegiance to Mr. Singh. The BKU leadership held it was Mr Singh’s personal decision and it would not affect the movement but sources in the union said it was going to hurt them both in terms of numbers and ration for the farmers. Describing it as a “selfish move”, Dharmendra Malik, media in-charge of BKU, said it seemed Mr. Singh had come under “the pressure of government”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ghazipur-quiet-after-fissures-among-groups/article33680871.ece

Most of the agitating farmers went to the Shahjahanpur protest site at Haryana-Rajasthan border. Locals from around half-a-dozen villages around the protest site held a meeting in the morning, raising objections to the farmers sitting on dharna and causing inconvenience to them, especially in the wake of the violence on Tuesday.

Members of the ULFA(I) had abducted radio operator Ram Kumar and drilling superintendent Pranab Kumar Gogoi from the Kumchaikha hydrocarbon drilling site in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh on December 21, 2020. The two were taken to an unknown location in Myanmar. Paresh Baruah, the outfit’s military chief, had reportedly asked the New Delhi-based Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Limited to pay Rs. 20 crore for Mr. Kumar’s release.

28 January 2021||LUCKNOW,||Three TV reporters booked for ‘baseless’ news||The police in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur Dehat district have booked three television journalists on charges of airing a “baseless” news report of children of a government school “shivering in cold” in knickers and cotton shirts during a drill at a public function on January 24. The event was part of a government function held at the Eco Park in Kanpur Dehat on the occasion of U.P. Foundation Day. Minister for Technology Ajit Singh Pal, MLAs and officials were present. The FIR was lodged at the Akbarpur police station on a complaint by Sunil Dutt, District Basic Education Officer. Mr. Dutt accused the three journalists of publishing “baseless and misleading” reports and videos that pupils were made to “shiver in cold” while performing drills and yoga.  The three, working for a local TV channel, were identified as Mohit Kashyap, Amit Singh and Yaseen Ali. They were not even present at the event, officials said. Visuals of the event shows pupils performing drills, apparently in summer uniform, and holding toy guns. The FIR accused the journalists of projecting the officials were busy while the children shivered in cold. In the complainant, Mr. Dutt said the pupils were made to take off their winter-wear only while performing yoga and exercise, and that after that they wore back their warm clothes. Yoga and physical exercise could not be carried out in winter cloth and required loose clothing, he pointed out. Kanpur Dehat District Magistrate Dinesh Chandra Singh said, “I am pained that some journalists who were not even present here have circulated such information that the pupils were shivering in the cold.” Yoga cannot be performed wearing a sweater, coat or pant, he said. “These children have performed well,” Mr. Singh said at the event, promising action against the scribes.

28 January 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Jharkhand duo held for stealing gold jewellery worth Rs. 1.37 cr.||The APMC police have recently arrested two people who had stolen gold worth Rs. 1.37 crore after drilling a hole in a jewellery shop at Vartak Nagar in Thane on January 17. The duo, identified as Rahul Abdul Majid Shaikh and Saheb Akbar Shaikh, residents of Jharkhand, along with their accomplices, had rented a shop adjacent to Varimata jewellers. According to the police, last week, a patrolling van spotted the two loitering suspiciously near the APMC market. When the police team stopped them for questioning, the duo looked scared. On searching their belongings, gold jewellery worth Rs. 3.67 lakh were found. They were taken to the police station and since the two could not give a satisfactory reply about the ornaments, the police registered a case under Section 41 (d) (in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected to be stolen property and who may reasonably be suspected of having committed an offence with reference to such thing) of the Indian Penal Code. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Vashi division) Vinayak Vast said, “On subsequent questioning, the accused revealed that four of them had opened a fruit shop adjacent to Varimata jewellers.”After doing a recce of the shop for around two months, they had in the early hours of January 17 drilled a hole in the wall of the jewellery shop and made away with gold valued at Rs. 1.37 crore. According to the police, the accused had rented the shop for Rs. 28,000 on the pretext of selling fruits. Further investigations are being conducted by the Vartak Nagar police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/jharkhand-duo-held-for-stealing-gold-jewellery-worth-rs-137-cr/article33680483.ece
28 January 2021||New Delhi,||BJP behind violence on Republic Day, alleges AAP||AAP on Wednesday alleged that the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was behind the violence in Delhi and the clashes at Red Fort on Tuesday. “We will prove how the BJP and Narendra Modi planned this conspiracy to defame the agitation and to trap the leadership of the farmers,” AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said at a press conference. Showing an alleged photo of Punjabi actor-cum-activist Deep Sidhu with the Prime Minister, at the latter’s official residence, Mr. Chadha said, “Deep Sidhu is a plant by the BJP. He infiltrated the agitation to defame it and planned the whole conspiracy. He was there at the Red Fort and carried out the events there.” Mr. Sidhu had been a close associate of BJP Lok Sabha MP from Gurdaspur, Sunny Deol, and had campaigned for him during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. However, last year, when he joined the farmers’ protest against the farm laws, Mr. Deol distanced himself from him and his activities. Calling Mr. Sidhu a “BJP agent”, the AAP leader said: “BJP’s agent, who works for the BJP’s sleeper cell, had infiltrated the agitation and has been the mastermind to end the [farmers’] agitation. The BJP and Modi government are trying to divert attention from the real issue. They don’t want to talk about the three farm laws.” FIR against farmers He also said that police have filed FIR against farmer leaders who were neither present when the violence happened nor was involved with it. Mr. Chadha also shunned allegations by the BJP that one Amrik Singh, who was seen at Tuesday’s protest, belongs to AAP. “With all the responsibilities I want to make it clear that Amrik Singh has no connection with AAP,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-behind-violence-on-republic-day-alleges-aap/article33680482.ece

Mr. Gupta also accused that “several Ministers and leaders” from the Delhi government had funded and collaborated with those who were part of the violence. “Whatever happened on Republic Day was very embarrassing. On one side, the soldiers of the country were performing excellently on the Rajpath and on the other side, there were scenes of shaming democracy,” Mr. Gupta alleged. “No one else is making Delhi hostage, but these are the very people who are running the government of Delhi today.

Hospital services The Delhi government on Wednesday allowed all State-run hospitals to restart all types of surgeries, invasive procedures, IPDs, OPDs, and other medical services, according to an official order.

28 January 2021||Pune,||Modi govt. responsible for chaos during tractor rally, says Chavan||Senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan on Wednesday said that the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were entirely responsible for the violence and chaos that erupted during the farmers’ agitation in Delhi on Republic Day. He further exhorted the Centre to cast off its intransigence over the amended farm laws and immediately repeal the contentious legislations. “The Modi government did not discuss the new laws with anyone but merely imposed them on the farmers before consulting them. The erstwhile Manmohan Singh-led UPA as well as the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA governments used to take all parties in confidence before formulating any vital legislation and implementing it,” Mr. Chavan, a former Maharashtra Chief Minister, said. Meanwhile, farmer leader Ajit Nawale, who is the State general secretary of the Left-affiliated All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), said that a number of farmer leaders had hinted at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) being responsible for triggering the chaos and violence in the capital. He further said that it was curious that the BJP’s IT cell did not circulate any videos of the one lakh-odd tractors that protested peacefully but only made viral one tractor that had crashed into the barricades. “Why is it that only this one video is being widely circulated by the BJP’s IT cell? The AIKS demands a thorough probe into the matter,” Mr. Nawale said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/modi-govt-responsible-for-chaos-during-tractor-rally-says-chavan/article33680484.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Most GOP Senators oppose Trump trial||All but five of the U.S. Senate’s 50 Republicans unsuccessfully attempted to block the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump from progressing, in a vote on the constitutionality of impeaching a former President. While Mr. Trump will be tried because 55 of the 100 Senators voted to proceed, Tuesday’s vote cast doubt on whether Mr. Trump would be convicted — a move that would need 17 of the Senate’s 50 Republicans to vote along with their Democratic colleagues. “I think it is pretty obvious from the vote today that is extraordinarily unlikely that the President will be convicted,” said Senator Susan Collins of Maine, one of the five Senators who voted against the motion to declare the trial unconstitutional. Mr. Trump is being tried on charges of “inciting an insurrection” for his alleged role in inciting violent protesters just before they attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, resulting in the death of five people. The other Republicans who voted against the motion questioning the trial’s constitutionality were Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. “If you voted that it was unconstitutional, how in the world would you ever vote to convict somebody for this?” said Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who introduced the motion. U-turn Notably, Senate Minority Leader, who had in recent weeks — including when he led the majority in the chamber — entertained the possibility of convicting Mr. Trump, joined his Republican colleagues and voted against taking the trial forward. Democrats are hoping that the evidence they plan to present during the trial — including videos — will sway more Republicans. “...There’s no predicting with any certainty what the result will be until we see all of that graphic evidence and it can include the words out of Donald Trump’s own mouth,” Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said. “That’s the most incriminating, but also other evidence about what he said when he saw those images of the assault on the Capitol and he called those mob rioters ‘special people’…” he said. While the members of the House of Representatives had delivered their charges to the Senate on Monday and Senators — all of whom will act as jurors — were sworn in, the trial itself is scheduled to commence in the week of February 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/most-gop-senators-oppose-trump-trial/article33680231.ece
28 January 2021||Washington,||U.S. issues domestic terror alert||The U.S. Department of Homeland Security declared a nationwide terrorism alert on Wednesday, citing the potential threat from domestic anti-government extremists opposed to Joe Biden as President. “Information suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fuelled by false narratives, could continue to mobilise to incite or commit violence,” the department said. The National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin said a heightened threat of attack “will persist in the weeks following the successful presidential inauguration,” which took place on January 20. “DHS does not have any information to indicate a specific, credible plot,” it said. “However, violent riots have continued in recent days and we remain concerned that individuals frustrated with the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition... could continue to mobilise a broad range of ideologically-motivated actors to incite or commit violence.” The alert said there had been mounting threats since last year from domestic violent extremists motivated by COVID-19 restrictions, Mr. Biden’s defeat of Donald Trump in the November election, police brutality and illegal immigration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-issues-domestic-terror-alert/article33680799.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Blinken gets to work, stresses on U.S. alliances||After his 78 to 22 confirmation at the Senate, new U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had an administrative swearing-in on Tuesday at the State Department, after which he got to work and spoke to his counterparts from Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Mexico on the phone. Speaking to Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, Mr. Blinken called the alliance between their two countries “the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity for a free and open Indo-Pacific region and across the globe”, according to a State Department readout of the call. “Secretary Blinken highlighted the importance of continued U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea cooperation and stressed President [Joe] Biden’s pledge to strengthen U.S. alliances and engage with the world again,” the readout said. On his call with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Mr. Blinken again brought up the importance of the U.S.-ROK-Japan trilateral relationship and “affirmed the enduring strength and importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance, the lynchpin of peace, security, and prosperity for a free and open Indo-Pacific region and across the world”. ‘Advancing values’ He also “underscored the continued need for the denuclearisation of North Korea and stressed President Biden’s commitment to strengthening U.S. alliances”, the readout said. “We will revitalise American diplomacy to advance our interests and values in the world as it is — not as it was,” Mr. Blinken, 58, tweeted on Tuesday. “Together, we will implement @POTUS Biden’s vision of a foreign policy that promotes America’s security, prosperity, and values — and that delivers for the American people,” he wrote. Tweeting pictures of his swearing-in, Mr. Blinken, who, during Barack Obama’s final term, was second in command at the State Department as Deputy Secretary, wrote, “I want to thank my colleagues for welcoming me home.” Mr. Blinken is expected to oversee America’s re-engagement with the world via multilateral forums. He will also seek to strengthen multilateral relationships and move away from a transactional ‘America First’ emphasis that characterised the Trump administration’s foreign policy. During his confirmation hearing, he said America should approach the world with “humility and confidence,” and that no country, however powerful, could address the world’s problems alone. U.S.-China ties However, Mr. Blinken also agreed with some areas of the Trump administration’s foreign policy. For instance, on the tough line against China, he told Senators that he agreed with the principle but disagreed “very much” with the way the former President went about handling the U.S-China relationship. He called India a “bipartisan success story”. At home, Mr. Blinken is expected to try and revitalise the State Department and increase the diversity of its workforce. The Department has close to a 1,000 fewer staff than when Mr. Blinken left it. Many have quit over the last four years, demoralised first with the leadership of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then Mike Pompeo, including as the 2019 Trump impeachment unfolded. Some career professionals had been edged out for political reasons. Last week, Mr. Blinken told Senators that the State Department will be a “non-partisan institution” on his watch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/blinken-gets-to-work-stresses-on-us-alliances/article33680229.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Chinese media takes aim at India over COVID-19 vaccines||China’s government said this week there was “no place for malign competition” on the issue of supplying vaccines. The media it controls in China have, however, adopted a different line, from accusing India of “interference” in preventing Chinese vaccines being used in South Asia, to questioning the efficacy of Indian and Western vaccines. “There are multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates out there on the market, and countries should be able to make their choices on the vaccines independently,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said this week when asked by Chinese State media about reports of India’s “vaccine diplomacy” in the neighbourhood. “This issue can afford no place for malign competition, let alone the so-called ‘rivalry’. We hope and welcome that more doses of safe and effective vaccines will be manufactured at a faster pace by more countries and then provided to more countries to benefit more people,” he said. “Malign competition” was, however, a theme in some of the reporting this week in Chinese media outlets. On Tuesday, the Communist Party-run Global Times , known for its hawkish views, quoted an “insider” as saying “China-Bangladesh cooperation was also disturbed due to interference from India.” The Global Times said “in the eyes of India, however, it has become a lever in its tool kit to compete with China”. The newspaper claimed clinical trials were delayed “due to the Indian government allegedly meddling in the two sides’ cooperation during the period”. That was not, however, the account from the Bangladesh government. In October, Bangladesh said it did not go ahead with using a vaccine from Sinovac, a leading Chinese vaccine-maker, because it was asked to co-fund a domestic trial. Health Ministry Zahid Maleque told Reuters then Bangladesh declined as “that was not in the agreement”. “They never asked for money when they approached us,” he said. “As per agreement, they’ll bear all expenses of the trial, they’ll give us 110,000 free vaccines and they’ll share the technology so that our pharmaceutical companies can make the vaccine... It has to be a government-to-government deal if we go for co-funding.” China has offered its vaccines to a number of countries in South Asia, including Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Pakistan is the only country in the region to have given the green light for a Chinese vaccine. According to Chinese media reports, more than 20 countries, predominantly in West Asia and Southeast Asia, have begun using Sinovac’s vaccines. Tian Guangqiang, a scholar at the National Institute of International Strategy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, blamed India for China’s inability to offer vaccines to countries in South Asia, saying "India has been smearing China's cooperation with countries in South Asia in cooperation on the anti-epidemic fight as the region is traditionally under India's influence." China’s State media have slammed foreign observers, including those in India, for raising questions about Sinovac’s vaccine, after authorities in Brazil reported a 50.4% efficacy rate, a number questioned by the Chinese media. State media have, however, been raising questions about the efficacy of India’s home-developed Covaxin and the Covishield vaccine, while offering no evidence, only saying “concerns are natural for anyone who has seen thick clouds of smoke billowing from the site [of Covishield manufacturer Serum Institute of India], 10 fire tenders rushing to the spot, and news stories that the fire had killed five people”. “Many Twitter users share the same uneasiness over the fire’s influence on SII’s vaccine manufacturing capacity,” the paper said, adding that “scientists ‘scoff’ at the goal of the Indian government agency to test and approve its homegrown COVID-19 vaccine at such a high speed”. State media has also raised unfounded questions about the Pfizer vaccine, calling for an investigation into reports of deaths of 23 elderly people in Norway which the media in China has widely covered, while not highlighting the fact that a WHO panel said the vaccines did not play a “contributory role”. The Global Times also reported of deaths in India but without offering evidence they were connected to vaccines. “In comparison,” the newspaper said, “not a single death occurred in China for having received coronavirus vaccines.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinese-media-takes-aim-at-india-over-covid-19-vaccines/article33680222.ece
28 January 2021||New York,||Russia moots West Asia meet as U.S. resets Palestinian ties||Russia backed a Palestinian proposal for a West Asia peace conference, suggesting on Tuesday it could be held at ministerial level in spring or summer, as the U.S. said it would move towards renewing ties with the Palestinians under Joe Biden. The U.S. — which had sided with Israel under the administration of Donald Trump — said on Tuesday it intended to “restore credible U.S. engagement with Palestinians as well as Israelis.” Recalling that Moscow had backed Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas’ idea for international talks in early 2021 when he first proposed it in September, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov offered ideas about who could be invited. “We propose holding an international, ministerial-level meeting in spring-summer 2021,” Mr. Lavrov told a UN Security Council meeting held by videoconference. The roughly 10 participants would include Israel, the Palestinians, the four members of the so-called West Asia diplomatic quartet (Russia, the UN, the U.S. and the EU), along with four Arab states — Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Lavrov said. “It would also be important to invite Saudi Arabia, which is behind the Arab peace initiative,” he added. China voiced its support for Russia’s idea at the UN meeting, but most other participants did not offer an opinion on the proposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-moots-west-asia-peace-meet/article33680226.ece

Mahmoud Vaezi, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s chief of staff, also vowed that his country was ready and willing to defend itself. “We have no intention of going to war, but we are serious about defending the country,” he said. Israel, a close U.S. ally, accuses Iran of seeking to build a nuclear bomb, a charge Tehran denies. Israel’s military chief General Aviv Kochavi said on Tuesday he had ordered new plans be drawn up this year to counter Iran’s nuclear capabilities, in case political leaders decided to target the country. “The power to initiate them lies with the political echelon,” Gen. Kochavi stressed. “However, the offensive options need to be prepared, ready and on the table.” Mr. Vaezi shot back on Wednesday, accusing Israel of “conducting a psychological war.” Iran’s recent military manoeuvres, testing missiles and drones, Mr. Vaezi added, showed that “our armed forces are trained” to defend Iran. Gen. Kochavi’s remarks came nearly a week after the inauguration of U.S. President Joe Biden, who has signalled he wants to return to dialogue with Iran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-says-israel-is-waging-a-psychological-war/article33680224.ece
28 January 2021||Islamabad,||Pak. plans to hold Senate polls through open vote||Pakistan Cabinet has decided to table a Bill in Parliament to amend the Constitution for holding the Senate elections through open vote. The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan. “The government wants the (Senate) polls to be held in a transparent manner and without horse-trading. This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,” Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting. He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. The Minister asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes. Mr. Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past. “The government will present a constitutional amendment Bill in the Parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-plans-to-hold-senate-polls-through-open-vote/article33680225.ece

Both houses of Parliament voted unanimously to extend the New START treaty for five years, a day after a phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin said they agreed to complete the necessary extension procedures in the next few days. Speaking via video link to the World Economic Forum’s virtual meeting, Mr. Putin hailed the decision to extend the treaty as “a step in the right direction,” but warned of rising global rivalries and threats of new conflicts. The pact’s extension doesn’t require congressional approval in the U.S., but Russian lawmakers must ratify the move and Mr. Putin has to sign the relevant Bill into law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-gives-nod-to-extend-start-treaty/article33680227.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Revise the text of the Budget speech||It is that time of year in India, when all eyes and ears turn to the Finance Minister to learn what she will unveil in the annual Union Budget. But it is a moot point whether, even in a year of the novel coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis, that speech will be of much significance. Indeed, it could be argued that there may be little point in listening to or poring over a speech that is likely to conceal more than it reveals. What might be said Going by past experience, we can make some predictions about the Finance Minister’s Budget Speech this year. It can be expected that it will be full of self-congratulatory declarations of how the country, the economy and the government’s finances have withstood the pandemic and how the economy is set on a path of revival. It will claim that the government’s policies have enabled the country to deal with the spread of COVID-19. It will downplay the completely inadequate health spending even in the face of the pandemic, and use absolute numbers rather than rates of change to suggest that public spending has been directed towards those in need. Ms. Sitharaman may take credit for controlling the fiscal deficit as much as possible despite the reduced tax collections, and even claim that she has been munificent to the State governments by increasing their borrowing limits. She will outline what will turn out to be completely unrealistic spending and taxation plans for the coming year. Meanwhile, the media will wait breathlessly for what they see as the crucial numbers: the ratio of fiscal deficit to GDP in the current year, and in the Budget estimates. Largely formal sector-centric Some of this will be only partly correct, much of it will be misleading, and some will be downright wrong. It is certainly true that COVID-19 infections are on the decline in India — as they are in the Asian region generally, including in countries that did not implement the extreme lockdown that India experienced. The “revival” of the economy that is being much touted is from the complete collapse of the first quarter of the current  fiscal year, and is largely confined to the formal sector, while most informal activities are still facing crisis. The “recovery” of employment is because of the absence of social security for the vast bulk of Indian workers, which forces them to seek out any income-generating opportunities, simply to survive. Wage incomes are significantly lower than before the lockdown. The stock market reaching stratospheric heights is really more of an indication of how divorced it has become from the real economy and its prospects. The past year has witnessed significant destruction of livelihoods and increases in material distress, poverty and hunger. To talk of economic recovery without factoring these in is untenable. Now, consider the numbers that will be presented. We know from past Budgets, especially with this government, that the numbers for revenues and spending have been inaccurate, sometimes off by around Rs. 1,50,000 crore as in Budget 2019-20. This is not only because the actual data are available only for the first nine months. It is also because the Budget numbers are themselves a fudge, with excessively optimistic projections for revenue generation in the remainder of the year and reducing the actual expenditures of the central government by pushing items “off-budget”. Expenditure estimates The Finance Minister never seems to learn from her own experience of actual revenues being much less than the Budget projections: each year, this mistake is repeated and even amplified. The expenditure estimates are even more disingenuous, because they understate the actual expenditures that should be counted. This concern has been repeatedly brought up by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). A CAG report in 2018 identified at least three methods of reducing the stated expenditure: not paying for the full fertilizer subsidy by using “special banking arrangements”; not paying the central government’s dues to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for the food subsidy, and forcing the FCI to borrow from the market; using other special purpose vehicles to pay for infrastructure investment, like the Long Term Irrigation Fund. In 2017-18, just those three items amounted to Rs. 1,29,446 crore, or 1.8% of GDP. To these could be added other strategies the central government uses to “reduce” its own spending, like not paying States their rightful dues under the Goods and Services Tax Compensation Fund, or not paying what State governments have already spent on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), which is legally mandated. These strategies are problematic not only because they are non-transparent: they also force other agencies (like State governments and public sector enterprises) to go in for expensive commercial borrowing that unnecessarily adds to their future interest costs. But what all this does underline is that the numbers presented in the Budget are not to be taken seriously, either for current year projections, or for the next year’s estimates. This also effectively means that Parliament is reduced to approving a piece of fiction. CGA data and spending So what do we have to go by, to gauge the real state of the government’s finances? The data from the Controller General of Accounts provide the most reliable information. They tell a rather disturbing story. Between April and November 2020, revenues of the central government predictably collapsed, by around 18%, or Rs. 181,372 crore, compared to the same period of the previous year. But despite that, expenditures should have gone up, because the lockdown-induced collapse in economic activity meant that public spending would be the only thing keeping the economy afloat. Indeed, that is what the government promised: in three rounds of stimulus packages, it claimed to inject amounts of Rs. 1.7-lakh crore in March, Rs. 20-lakh crore in May and then Rs. 2.65-lakh crore in November. But it turns out that very little of these apparently large amounts involved actual commitments of more public spending. And the public accounts show that total spending of the central government increased by only Rs. 86,301 crore. That was only a 4.6% increase — not even enough to keep pace with inflation. In other words, the central government reduced its real spending over the period of the pandemic and economic crisis! This fiscal stance obviously adds to the material suffering of the people and deprives them of basic goods and essential public services at a time of much greater need. But it is also a macroeconomically stupid strategy, because it adds to contractionary tendencies in the economy, and prolongs the severe demand recession facing millions of small and informal enterprises and hundreds of millions of self-employed workers. As we saw after demonetisation, policies that destroy informal economic activities set in train processes of economic contraction that eventually come to bite formal enterprises as well. A similar process is under way in India now. Those who celebrate the higher profits of some large corporate houses or the gains in the stock market will find out soon enough that these are ephemeral if the vast bulk of the economy continues to stagnate or decline. Only if the Finance Minister realises this and changes course, moving to a more expansionary fiscal stance that prioritises employment generation and public service provision, would the Budget speech this year be worth listening to.

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Emphasising self-reliance in science||On March 4, 1958, under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, for the first time in the history of independent India, Parliament passed a resolution on science policy. The resolution stated: “Science... has provided new tools of thought and has extended man’s mental horizon. It has thus influenced even the basic values of life, and given to civilization a new vitality and a new dynamism.” The resolution said the aim of the scientific policy was, among other things, to “encourage individual initiative for the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge, and for the discovery of new knowledge, in an atmosphere of academic freedom.” In effect, this resolution proved to be a springboard for the development of the country’s scientific infrastructure. Since that resolution, successive governments issued policy statements with varying emphasis on chosen objectives and goals, often echoing the existing national and global imperatives and the ruling dispensation’s ideology. The 2020 draft policy India’s Department of Science and Technology recently released a draft of the fifth Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy. This 62-page-long document presents the objectives and goals of our new science policy. The public is expected to provide feedback on this document before it gets finalised. But the problem with the document is that it is rambling and full of jargon and clichés, making the task of separating the grain from the chaff a major exercise in itself. The new policy envisages technological self-reliance and aims to position India among the top three scientific superpowers. Though the names of the other two nations are not mentioned, it must be understood that they are the U.S. and China. For that to happen, the draft policy says, we need to attract our best minds to remain in India by developing a “people-centric” science, technology, and innovation “ecosystem”. It states that the private sector’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Expenditure on Research and Development should be doubled every five years. The 2013 policy had similar aims. The 2020 draft policy fails to discuss what we have achieved on these fronts since then. Why does our R&D investment in science continue to hover between 0.5% and 0.6% of the GDP? Raising it to 2% of the GDP has been a national goal for a while. Despite strong recommendations in the past by several scientific bodies and leading scientists and policymakers, we are still well short of that goal. The 2020 draft policy blames this on “inadequate private sector investment” and adds that “a robust cohesive financial landscape remains at the core of creating an STI-driven Atmanirbhar Bharat.” It looks as if the government is trying to shift the responsibility of financing R&D to different agencies such as the States, private enterprises, and foreign multinational companies. But it is doubtful if the various funding models that are presented are workable or practical, especially during a pandemic. The policymakers who drafted this report should have gone back to the self-financing revenue model proposed in the Dehradun Declaration for the CSIR labs back in 2015 and critically evaluated its success rate. Common sense informs us that the private sector cannot be expected to pay for basic research. This is because the return on investment in basic research takes too long from a private sector perspective. Only the government can have long-term interest to support such research. Participation of the private sector in basic science has not happened even in the U.S. The fact is that basic science research in India is suffering from the lack of adequate funding despite grand proclamations. Even elite institutes like the Indian Institutes of Technology are finding it difficult to run their laboratories on a day-to-day basis because of paucity of funds. The draft policy visualises “a decentralized institutional mechanism balancing top-down and bottom-up approaches, focusing on administrative and financial management, research governance, data and regulatory frameworks and system interconnectedness, for a robust STI Governance”. This is easier said than done. This intention is in fact defeated in the document itself, where several new authorities, observatories and centres have been proposed, which may end up feeding up the already fattened bureaucracy in science administration. Decentralisation of administrative architecture is essential, but we need to explore the practical option of providing more autonomy to research and academic centres for financial management. Some points are welcome. These include the fact that policymakers are considering alternative mechanisms of governance of the financial landscape; that they realise the administrative burdens of researchers and the problem of journal paywalls; and promise to explore international best practices of grant management. It was reported in 2019 that more than 2,400 students dropped out from the 23 IITs in just two years, with over half of them belonging to the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Classes. The number of suicides of students is also on the increase in the IITs. Caste discrimination could be one of the reasons for these tendencies. As a part of inculcating an inclusive culture in academia, the document promises to tackle discriminations “based on gender, caste, religion, geography, language, disability and other exclusions and inequalities”. It mentions more representation of women and the LGBTQ community, but is silent on how we are to achieve their proportionate representation. Science and society In the chapter ‘Science Communication and Public Enagagement’, concerns on the disconnect between science and society are valid. But the fact is that hyper-nationalism is not conducive to the propagation of evidence-based science and a rational outlook. It is also heartening to see that the document harks back to our constitutional obligation to “develop a scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.” But it is silent on how this can be achieved when pseudoscience is deliberately propagated in the name of traditional science with the help of some arms of the government. A recent instance is the proposal by the Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog to conduct a national examination under the garb of ‘cow science’. The document does not mention how to stem the rot within, although it speaks extensively about science communication and scientific temperament. Our belief systems, values, and attitudes have an impact on the quality of research. That partly explains why Indians who have chosen to work in labs abroad are able to make path-breaking discoveries. The ruling dispensation has a moral obligation to facilitate an environment that encourages a mindset that constantly challenges conventional wisdom as well as open-minded inquiry among the students. Only a dissenting mind can think out of the box. The document contains nuggets of modern scientific vision and information. But its digressive style impacts the reader’s attention. The document should prioritise important issues and amplify first the problems which have cultural and administrative dimensions. With the advent of new disruptive technologies, global competitiveness will be increasingly determined by the quality of science and technology, which in turn will depend on raising the standard of Indian research/education centres and on the volume of R&D spending.

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Keep the wheels of economic recovery turning||The forthcoming Economic Survey will tell us about the state of the economy based on available empirical evidence. The first advance estimates of national income published on January 7 project a contraction of 7.7% for real GDP. The Q2 GDP estimates published by the National Statistical Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) on November 27 had suggested an economic recovery in India. An improvement in the rate of contraction from 23.9% in Q1 to 7.5% in Q2 was seen as the beginning of a sustained recovery. The Ministry of Finance, in its Monthly Economic Review highlighted it as signifying a ‘V’ shaped recovery and as a reflection of the resilience and robustness of the Indian economy. The Monetary Policy Statement of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released on December 4, 2020 also projects positive growth in the remaining quarters of the financial year. A low fatality rate and rolling out of the vaccination programme have added to the optimism. Growth rate of the economy had collapsed from 8.2% in Q4 of 2017-18 to a mere 3.1% in Q4 of 2019-20, sliding continuously for eight quarters. The policy stance adopted by the Union government against this backdrop was premised on the hope that private corporate investment will pick up momentum sooner than later, putting the economy back in the trajectory traced in the first decade of the new millennium. The RBI did the heavy lifting through five consecutive lowering of repo rate, adding to a total of 135 basis points from February to October 2019 along with liquidity infusion programmes. However, monetary-fiscal linkages are crucial to catalyse the demand. Revise monetary framework While being cautious of inflation, the RBI has decided to continue the accommodative stance in its latest monetary policy to support growth. It has retained status quo in the policy rate of repo at 4%. The CPI inflation after crossing 7% has cooled off to 4.6% in December. Still, the real interest rates remain very low. The RBI expects inflation to ease to the specified band. The efficacy of the new monetary framework (NMF) — the agreement between the RBI and Government of India in February 2016 to adopt inflation targeting in India — will be reviewed in March 2021, and we flag the need for revising the framework. The RBI is continuing its liquidity infusion programmes including the on-tap Targeted Long Term Repo Operations (TLTRO). This programme announced on October 9, 2020 for five stressed sectors has been extended to 26 stressed sectors notified under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS 2.0). The RBI is also continuing its ‘operation twist’ — the elongation of debt maturity structure through simultaneous buying of long-term bonds and selling of short-term bonds — with Open Market Operations (OMO) of Rs. 10,000 crore scheduled for December 17, 2020. Nevertheless, the RBI Governor has rightly pointed out that the signs of recovery are far from being broad-based and are dependent on sustained policy support. He has also pointed out that it is a no-brainer that Union Budget 2021-22 will be pro-growth. Stimulus by the state’s moves The economies which rebounded fast, post the global financial crisis, were the ones which resorted to significant fiscal stimulus. We argue for fiscal stimulus not based on “business cycle” arguments to trigger animal spirits, but from the perspective of much needed targeted state interventions in public health, education, agriculture and physical infrastructure, and to redress widening inequalities in the time of the novel coronavirus pandemic. In a context where private final consumption expenditure is sluggish, contracting 26.7% and 11% in Q1 and Q2, respectively, a “fiscal dominance” is expected in India for sustained economic recovery. However, India cannot afford fiscal stimulus at the rates of advanced economies, due to a lack of fiscal space. The pandemic has hit many crucial sectors and has left millions jobless. It is in this context that the Finance Minister has promised a “never before like budget” on February 1, 2021. The Biden Plan of $1.9 trillion will make the pandemic response of the United States a massive $5.2 trillion one. Compare this with the $800 billion worth U.S. fiscal response to the global financial crisis. According to the International Monetary Fund’s Fiscal Monitor Database of Country Fiscal Measures, the fiscal stimulus for India is 1.8% of GDP. The corresponding figures are: for Brazil 8.3%, Russia 2.4%, China 4.6%, and South Africa 5.3%. The IMF, in its Fiscal Monitor, highlights the need to scale up public investment to ensure successful reopening, boost growth and prepare economies for the future. Subdued interest rates make this case even stronger. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her interview on December 8, 2020 to Bloomberg TV, indicated that the “fiscal deficit fears will not derail government spending”. This announcement is welcome, given the much needed fiscal package for enhancing the public health infrastructure and the COVID-19 vaccine roll out, to address the falling effective enrolment rates due to the digital divide, the employment and livelihood crises and the need for strengthening social and physical infrastructure spending.  Plummeting private corporate investment in India is a matter of concern. A co-authored paper by Hrishikesh Vinod, Honey Karun and Lekha Chakraborty in The Handbook of Statistics titled “Financial, macro and micro econometrics using R” (bit.ly/3oNf6sn) using maximum entropy ensembles time series methodology showed that public infrastructure investment is the prime determinant of private corporate investment in India. The fear of financial crowding out emanating from high fiscal deficit is misplaced in the context of India. Flexible fiscal rules The path of economic recovery will be determined by the degree of containment of the pandemic and the sustained macroeconomic policies. Any abrupt withdrawal of ongoing economic policy support, both by the monetary and fiscal authorities, will be detrimental to growth in times of the pandemic. The fiscal rules at the national and subnational government levels need to be made flexible to enhance the fiscal space to deal with the extraordinary situation. The public debt deficit dynamics in India, therefore, needs a careful calibration in the forthcoming Budget 2021-22.

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The best shot against COVID||This is slated to be the year of minimising the impact of COVID-19. While mutants of the virus pose a new threat, the only viable strategy to curb COVID-19 has been to develop vaccines. The fast-paced scientific work done to develop the vaccines is unparalleled. Within a year of COVID-19 being identified, several vaccines have become available. What do we know about these vaccines? Types of vaccines The result of the trial of Pfizer and BioNTech’s mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2020. It showed 95% efficacy in adults ages over 65. However, the infrastructure for the delivery and storage of the vaccine under fastidious requirements of -70oC is not easy to achieve. Equally, this vaccine has come under a cloud, with 29 deaths of elderly people with pre-existing illnesses reported in Norway following administration of 42,000 doses. Moderna using mRNA-based vaccines and Johnson & Johnson using DNA-based vaccines are also being developed in the U.S. These vaccines are unlikely to come soon to India because of cost and storage requirements. The first heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two components has been used in Russia with good initial reports. However, this adenovirus-based vector vaccine, Sputnik V, was released after Phase 2 studies in a very small number of volunteers and the protocols were not published. Other countries to get a nod for its use are Serbia, Argentina, Bolivia, Algeria, and Palestine. It has reportedly been administered in more than a million people in several countries without safety concerns. In India, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is using Sputnik vaccine in a placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial with 1,500 volunteers. The results are expected by mid-2021. The chimpanzee adenoviral vector vaccine by Oxford University-AstraZeneca is the only vaccine in India which has completed Phase 3 trial.The large placebo-controlled trial of 23,848 volunteers in the U.K. and Brazil has shown an acceptable safety profile along with increased antibody response by homologous boosting.The Drugs Controller General of India gave approval for its use in India on January 2 and it is being rolled out under the name Covishield.The Serum Institute of India in collaboration with AstraZeneca has produced a stockpile of 50 million Covishield vaccines which has been sent to all the States. This vaccine can be stored and transported easily. Then we have the adenovirus vector-based Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, which is in Phase 3 trial with a goal of 26,000 volunteers. The results are expected only after three months or so. Yet this vaccine has been rolled out in India for restricted use in clinical trial mode which lacks clarity. The States and priority group beneficiaries don’t have the option to choose whether they receive Covaxin or Covishield. Consequently, uptake amongst health professionals has significantly reduced. As per established protocols and ethical norms, the immunogenicity and safety data from Phase 1 and 2 trials are not enough for approving the clinical use of a vaccine. Without Phase 3 trial data, confidence in the safety and effectiveness of Covaxin will remain questionable. It is noteworthy that due to inadequate immune response of two vaccines using inactivated virus, Merck & Co in the U.S. abandoned its trials. Zydus Cadila is developing two COVID-19 vaccines. The company’s novel DNA-based vaccine will complete Phase 3 studies by mid-March before applying for approval. It is appropriate for the company to wait until Phase 3 results are available. In addition to these, there are at least two more vaccines in various stages of development in India. Biological E is working on a protein-based vaccine in collaboration with the Baylor College of Medicine, U.S. The company is conducting Phase 1 trial. Phase 2 trial may begin in March. Gennova’s vaccine is India’s first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine that can be stored at 2°C-8°C. Phase 2 trial of this vaccine is likely in March. How do we choose a vaccine? Our choice of the vaccine has to be dependent on whether the data have been gathered with scientific rigour. Each trial should involve an adequate number of volunteers; studies need to have a control or placebo arm; protocols of the studies should be in the public domain and in peer-reviewed scientific journals; and Phase 3 trials should be completed with an adequate number of volunteers and observation periods of adequate length with the results reviewed by experts. Trial outcomes need to be scientifically validated and should not be influenced by political pressure and deadlines. The aim must be to effectively and safely protect the population and make COVID-19 innocuous.

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||More vaccines than takers||Ten days after the massive COVID-19 vaccination drive began in India to immunise 300 million high-risk individuals first, only over 1.95 million people were vaccinated as of January 25. It is true that while the U.S. took 10 days to breach the one-million mark and the U.K. took 18, India took only six days. The number of people vaccinated each day has been slowly but steadily increasing since day one — from over 1.91 lakh on January 16 to about 3.35 lakh on January 25. Yet, seen in the larger context, the number of individuals vaccinated so far pales in comparison to the number of children vaccinated each year under the universal immunisation programme. About 25 million children are born each year in India. Millions of children are immunised against 10 vaccine-preventable diseases within the first year of life across the country. By end-December 2020, Serum Institute of India (SII) had already manufactured about 50 million doses of Covishield. Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer of SII, had told NDTV that the company manufactures 2.4 million doses each day. On January 11, SII signed an agreement with the Indian government to supply 11 million doses for local use. A long way to go At the current rate of 2 lakh jabs per day, it would take about eight years to immunise the target population of 300 million people with two doses of the vaccine. This is provided that COVID-19 vaccination is carried out on all seven days of the week. However, as the Health Ministry has recommended that COVID-19 vaccination should not affect routine immunisation and other health services, most States have been vaccinating only on four days a week. The most populous State, Uttar Pradesh, vaccinates only twice a week. A single session can vaccinate only 100 people. Until January 25, 35,785 sessions had been held altogether, with the maximum number of sessions held on a given day touching 6,230 on January 21. India plans to vaccinate the target 300 million people by July, which would mean 600 million doses to be administered within the next six months. That would require 33,333 sessions to be held on all seven days to vaccinate 100 people per session to complete the vaccination target by July. Faster vaccination Ramping up the vaccination process can be achieved either by increasing the number of vaccination sites or the number of sessions in a site or both. Since each session should have five dedicated people, only large hospitals have increased the number of sessions held per day. The government has permitted vaccine sites to hold only up to seven sessions per day. Similarly, increasing the number of sites per day too would mean finding additional manpower and other resources for each site. However, increasing the number of sites and/or sessions per day alone will not serve the purpose unless the site selection and number of sessions per site is based on a mapping of people in a given area who are eligible for vaccination. Since one of the priority groups included is people younger than 50 years with co-morbidities, only a bottom-up approach to first identify eligible young people with co-morbidities can help in deciding the number of sites and sessions needed in an area to cover the eligible population. Given these complexities, India is unlikely to ramp up the number of people vaccinated per day before the target date of July, and hence very unlikely to utilise all the 50 million doses manufactured by SII by end-December before the vaccines reach the expiry date. Covishield has a shelf life of six months from the date of production. The decision by the government to allow the company to supply limited quantities of vaccines to other countries before they reach the expiry date therefore makes eminent sense. Also, India stands to earn the goodwill of many countries by allowing the export of Covishield, much like in the case of hydroxychloroquine drug export. prasad.ravindranath@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/more-vaccines-than-takers/article33680219.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Troubling trends||The world economy is slowly recovering from the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but that is only partial solace. The recovery is uneven among countries, and within countries, but the emerging universal truth is that economic inequality is rising sharply in all countries. A new report by Oxfam has revealed that the 1,000 richest people worldwide recovered their losses from the pandemic within nine months as opposed to the world’s poorest who might take a decade to limp back to their pre-pandemic standing. Inequality was alarmingly high and destabilising social and political order in much of the world even before the pandemic struck. It is set to further aggravate, fear 295 economists from 79 countries, commissioned by Oxfam. Inequality in India has risen to levels last seen when it was colonised. The additional wealth acquired by India’s 100 billionaires since March when the lockdown was imposed is enough to give every one of the 138 million poorest Rs. 94,045, according to the report. An unskilled worker in India would take three years to earn what the country’s richest person earned in one second last year, the report calculates. The worsening inequality in income and opportunities impacts some sections disproportionately due to discrimination based on gender, caste and other factors. The poorer people were worst affected by the disease itself. The focus on growth had led politicians and policy makers to accept rising inequality as inevitable for decades. Inequality came to be seen as a benign outcome of economic growth that led to reduction of absolute poverty. Concerns about inequality could also be easily dismissed as being informed by socialism. Any criticism of capitalism was viewed with scepticism in the mainstream of development debates, until the crisis of capitalism could no longer be ignored. The literature on capitalism and its linkage with democracy is now growing fast. There is now universal agreement among economists that the distribution of new wealth between capital and labour has become so one-sided that workers are constantly being pushed to penury while the rich are getting richer. This has social and political consequences as upheavals in democratic societies around the world show. The environmental costs of a development model that hinges on higher and higher growth are also obvious. On the one hand, there is an acknowledgment of the crisis among capitalist moghuls. The theme of the World Economic Forum at Davos this week is ‘the Great Reset’ which it says is a “commitment to jointly and urgently build the foundations of our economic and social system for a more fair, sustainable and resilient future”. On the other, measures that favour capital at the cost of labour continue; for instance, changes in labour laws in several States during the pandemic. Lip service is not enough to tackle inequality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/troubling-trends/article33680201.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||A wrong turn||The chaos and mindless violence unleashed on the national capital by a section of protesting farmers on Republic Day were abhorrent. It is plausible that agents provocateurs infiltrated the farmers’ march but that does not absolve the leaders of responsibility. The chances of fatigued agitators breaking loose were high as were the possibilities of vested interests triggering violence. The leaders of the agitation should have taken note of the divergence in the rank and the rejection by certain recalcitrant groups of the routes for the march they had agreed with the Delhi police. True, no popular mobilisation can be held hostage to the threat of violent deviation by a handful, but there is judgement to be made at each turn. The leadership, itself an association of disparate individuals and organisations, should have been more realistic about its capacity to manage such a gathering. In the end, unruly elements took over the streets of Delhi. They broke barricades, thrashed, and tried to mow down police personnel. The police resorted to lathi charge and used tear gas, but, given the circumstances, showed restraint. More than 300 personnel were injured, at least 40 of them seriously. All this, and the march itself, was avoidable. The Delhi police must investigate and hold to account individuals and groups responsible for the violence. Farmer leaders have the unenviable task of cooperating with the police in the investigation. False friends and real enemies of the agitators have painted them with a communal brush. Bringing the culprits to book is essential not only to salvage the reputation of an agitation that had remained largely peaceful for nearly two months but also to nip in the bud a dangerous communal slant before it slips out of control. The Centre has said it would continue to engage the protesters in negotiations. The offer of the government to keep in abeyance for up to 18 months the three controversial farm laws that are at the heart of the current face-off remains an opportunity for the leaders to seek a negotiated settlement. The agitators want the laws to go lock, stock, and barrel but their maximalist approach is unhelpful. They must discontinue the protest for now and disperse, while reserving the option of restarting it later. They should consider options short of a complete repeal of the laws. The Centre must consider more concessions, including the suspension of the laws until a broader agreement can be arrived at. It must make more efforts to allay the fears of those most affected by these reforms. The Centre’s imperious refusal to engage with political parties and State governments on critical questions of agriculture reforms has come back to haunt it. The resolution to this impasse can come only by involving them all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-wrong-turn/article33680202.ece

Influenced by a few men amongst themselves, some of them presented a demand, that men should be paid at Rupee one a day, and women eight annas, as well as a rice allowance of Rs.4 a month. The authorities and the men could not agree and the meeting dispersed. Yesterday morning I called a meeting of all the scavengers in the Napier’s Park. Almost all the men attended.

The Union Food and Agriculture Minister, Mr. Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, who gave this call at the inauguration of the second international symposium on plant pathology here [New Delhi], said pathogens from the time of planting seed through harvest to the consumption stage took away between 10 to 20 per cent of the produce and had created a “dent” in the world’s granaries. He asked plant pathologists to reorient their research programmes and eliminate the ravages of diseases that affected plants. Mr. Ahmed said last years’ devastating epidemic of leaf blight in the United States highlighted the importance of co-operative endeavour of plant pathologists and plant breeders in crop improvement. The eight-day symposium, organised to celebrate the silver jubilee of the Indian Phytopathological Society, is being attended by 500 Indian scientists and more than 60 top agricultural scientists from 19 countries. Mr. A. H. Boerma, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, said the tremendous promise of the high-yielding varieties carried with it a host of problems, creating greater hazards to plants, particularly in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/problem-of-pests/article33680212.ece
28 January 2021||MUMBAI,||Sensex falls 1.9% as FIIs eye exit||Benchmark stock indices fell sharply on Wednesday, extending their losses to a fourth straight session, as foreign funds turned net sellers and domestic investors opted for caution ahead of the Union Budget due to be presented on Feb. 1. Analysts expect the correction to continue till the presentation of the Budget. The S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 938 points, or 1.94%, to 47,410 led by banking stocks and Reliance Industries. Top losers included Axis Bank, Titan, IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank and Dr. Reddy’s. RIL, which has the highest weight in the index, slid 2.3% as Amazon pursues challenges to its deal to acquire the Future Group’s retail assets. “The fall was across the board,” said Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Shares & Securities. “Most stocks tanked 2% on average. Ahead of the Budget, there is a little bit of reluctance and the market does not want rollover [of futures positions],” he added. The Nifty 50 index fell 271 points, or 1.91%, to 13,968.  Net sellers Foreign funds were net sellers of Rs. 662 crore of equities on the bourses on Monday, NSDL data show. “Several factors like negative foreign flows combined with not so encouraging earnings’ announcements dented sentiment,” said Ajit Mishra, VP, research, Religare Broking. “Caution ahead of the Union Budget and scheduled derivatives expiry also added to the pressure. In line with the benchmark, all the other indices, barring FMCG, ended with losses wherein metal, realty and auto were the top losers,” Mr. Mishra said. He said he expects the Nifty to test 13,700. “This decline of Nifty by 800 points from the top ought to be seen as a healthy correction and an interim consolidation phase before the markets begin the next leg of movement,” said Pankaj Pandey, head of research, ICICI Direct.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sensex-falls-19-as-fiis-eye-exit/article33680185.ece
28 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘High debt burden could hamper India’s ability to provide stimulus’||India’s high government debt could limit its ability to give a fiscal stimulus to the economy, Moody’s Investors Service noted in a report on credit conditions in Asia. Job losses, income shocks and the gaps in health infrastructure pose ‘highly negative risks’ for the country’s growth prospects, Moody’s added. “In India, a high government debt burden will limit the extent of fiscal support, although the government has undertaken a number of measures to improve policy transmission and broader structural reforms,” it pointed out. It warned that the sheer magnitude of the recession would lead to a degree of economic scarring in the more vulnerable Asian economies, which was likely to have persistent effects on potential output. Moody’s expects income and social inequality to widen in 2021, while the number of people falling into poverty will rise significantly, erasing three to four years’ gains on poverty reduction. The ratings agency said the traditional emphasis on infrastructure spending to support growth may now have to expand to include social spending on healthcare and pensions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/high-debt-burden-could-hamper-indias-ability-to-provide-stimulus/article33680190.ece

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||China slams apps ban, urges India to ‘correct discriminatory measures’||China on Wednesday called on India “to immediately correct its discriminatory measures” over the decision to extend a ban on 59 Chinese apps. The Indian government recently sent notices to Chinese firms, informing them that the ban, announced in June, would continue. India had banned the 59 Chinese apps including TikTok, WeChat and UC Browser, citing national security concerns in the wake of the stand-off in Ladakh. Another 118 apps were banned in September and 43 more in November. The recent notice was sent after reviewing the responses from the Chinese firms, which had been given a chance to respond to the June move. The Ministry of Electronics and IT had said in its order last year that it had received “credible inputs that such apps pose [a] threat to sovereignty and integrity of India” and that it had taken the measure “in view of information available they are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.” “Since last year, the Indian side has repeatedly used national security as an excuse to prohibit some mobile apps with Chinese background,” the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said in a statement. “These moves [are] in violation of WTO’s non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of a market economy and severely damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,” said Ji Rong, a spokesperson for the Embassy. “The Chinese side firmly opposes them. ‘Comply with local laws’ “The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas,” the Embassy said. “The Indian government has the responsibility to follow WTO rules and market principles and protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies.” The moves had “hindered the improvement of the Indian business environment and the innovative development of related Indian industries,” the Chinese Embassy said. “China-India economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial by nature,” it said. “We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/china-slams-apps-ban-urges-india-to-correct-discriminatory-measures/article33680194.ece

28 January 2021||London,||Man City zooms to the top||Manchester City thrashed West Brom 5-0 to move back top of the Premier League on Tuesday as Arsenal aided its push towards the European places with a 3-1 win at Southampton. City has now won 11 consecutive games since West Brom earned a shock 1-1 draw at the Etihad last month. Pep Guardiola’s men have hit top form since and did not miss the presence of the injured Kevin De Bruyne in blowing away the Baggies by scoring four goals before half-time. Ilkay Gundogan opened the floodgates by curling home from the edge of the box before Joao Cancelo’s controversial strike doubled City’s lead. Distracted defence The West Brom defence was distracted by a wrongly raised offside flag before the Portuguese full-back found the net, but the goal stood after a VAR review. Gundogan then took his tally to seven goals in his last eight league games before Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling rounded off the scoring. West Brom has now conceded 17 goals in Sam Allardyce’s four home games in charge as it remain second bottom of the table, six points off safety. Fine run Guardiola’s former assistant Mikel Arteta is also enjoying a fine run of form as Arsenal has taken 16 from the last possible 18 points. The Gunners avenged their FA Cup to Southampton at the weekend despite falling behind after three minutes to Stuart Armstrong’s sweet strike. Nicolas Pepe quickly levelled before Bukayo Saka rounded Alex McCarthy and slotted home to give the visitors a half-time lead. Alexandre Lacazette sealed a vital three points 18 minutes from time as Arsenal moved up to eighth and within five points of the top four.  The results: Crystal Palace 2 (Zaha 3, Batshuayi 90) lost to West Ham 3 (Soucek 9, 25, Dawson 65); Newcastle 1 (Almiron 57) lost to Leeds 2 (Raphinha 17, Harrison 61); Southampton 1 (Armstrong 3) lost to Arsenal 3 (Pepe 8, Saka 39, Lacazette 73).   West Brom 0 lost to Manchester City 5 (Gundogan 6, 30, Cancelo 20, Mahrez 45, Sterling 57).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/man-city-zooms-to-the-top/article33680181.ece
28 January 2021||Chennai,||England arrives, tough challenge beckons||With the close-in cordon surrounding the batsmen, the ball will turn and bounce with shouts of ‘howzat’ renting the air. Welcome to the Indian conundrum. The English team landed here from Sri Lanka on Wednesday to face one of the toughest challenges in cricket — defeating host India in a Test series. The first of the two Tests in Chennai gets underway on February 5; the teams will start practice only from Feb. 2. Under quarantine Skipper Joe Root & Co. joined their teammates including influential all-rounder Ben Stokes — he has the ability to impose his will on a match — who is already under a quarantine in the city. Also coming in batches here were the Indian team members including skipper Virat Kohli. They are high on morale after their exploits in Australia. England will not be short of confidence either after having triumphed 2-0 in a two-match Test series on pitches offering turn in Sri Lanka. Driving force And Root, rediscovering his mojo, was the driving force with innings of 228 in the first Test and 186 in the second. The first game in Chennai would be Root’s 100th Test — at 49.39 he has an average inching towards 50.00 that so often is the cut-off point for greatness — and it would be a pity the match would be played before empty stands. In off-spinner Dom Bess and left-armer Jack Leach, not to forget off-spinning all-rounder Moeen Ali, England has a useful spin attack. These men, though are not in the same league as Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar, who, bowling quicker through the air, ambushed the home team in the 2012 Test series in India. That series defeat was also inflicted by some scientific and methodical batting from left-handed opener Alistair Cook and some inspirational strokeplay by the gifted Kevin Pietersen, whose 186 on a spiteful wicket in Mumbai has to be rated among the greatest innings against spin in our times. England, like India, has a worthy pace attack — old warrior James Anderson’s swing, Stuart Broad’s seam, and Jofra Archer’s sheer pace and hostility. There is plenty to play for. At stake will be pride.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-arrives-tough-challenge-beckons/article33680307.ece

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Lomror sets up Rajasthan’s win||Bihar put up a fight, but that wasn’t enough to upset the formidable Rajasthan in the quarterfinals of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament. The favourite won by 16 runs at the Motera Stadium, Ahmedabad, on Wednesday night. It was a superb unbeaten 78 off just 37 balls (5x4, 5x6) by Mahipal Lomror that set up Rajasthan's victory. A target of 165 proved too much for Bihar. Mangal Mahrour’s unbeaten 68 (58b, 4x4, 2x6) helped Bihar stay in the hunt, but his strike-rate wasn’t enough against a strong Rajasthan attack, even without the Chahar cousins, Deepak and Rahul. Thirty six runs were needed in the final two overs, but Khaleel Ahmed gave away only nine in the 19th, virtually sealing his team’s semifinal berth. Earlier, it was very much a Lomror show. After an opening wicket stand of 59 between Bharat Sharma (38, 33b, 4x4, 2x6) and Ankit Lamba (38, 41b, 2x4, 1x6), the Rajasthan innings had stuttered against some tight bowling. Lomror came in at the fall of the first wicket — Bharat cleaned up beautifully by Bihar's captain and left-arm spinner Ashutosh Aman — and saw the other batsmen struggle. The Rajasthan Royals left-hander was prepared to wage a lone battle. He pressed the accelerator at the right time. Just 61 had come off the first 10 overs, but 103 were taken off the last 10, as Lomror unleashed some massive hits, often coming down the track to the spinners. Ashutosh had given 11 from his three overs, but in the final over of the innings, he went for for 20. The skipper’s bowling figures were destroyed and, as it would turn out, his team's dream too, by Lomror. Earlier, a stunning unbeaten 46-ball 71 from Vishnu Solanki (4x4, 5x6) helped Baroda snatch victory off the final delivery against Haryana. Needing 15 off the last three balls and five off one, Solanki pulled out the helicopter shot to flick Sumit Kumar down the ground for six.   The scores:   Haryana 148/7 in 20 overs (Himanshu Rana 49, Shivam Chauhan 35) lost to Baroda 150/2 in 20 overs (Kedar Devdhar 43, Vishnu Solanki 71 n.o.).   Rajasthan 164/5 in 20 overs (Bharat Sharma 38, Ankit Lamba 38, Mahipal Lomror 78 n.o.) bt Bihar 148/4 in 20 overs (Mangal Mahrour 68 n.o.).   The semifinal line-up: January 29: Tamil Nadu vs. Rajasthan, noon; Punjab vs. Baroda, 7 p.m .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lomror-sets-up-rajasthans-win/article33680505.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Blasters denied by the crossbar||It was a story of missed chances for Kerala Blasters as they were held to a goalless draw by Jamshedpur FC in the Hero Indian Super League at the GMC Stadium, Bambolin, on Wednesday. On a very unlucky day, Blasters were denied thrice in the space of five minutes towards the end of the first half as Gary Hooper, Jordan Murray and Lalthathanga Khawlhring ‘Puitea’ hit the crossbar. The story was virtually the same in the second half and this time it was Murray who hit the ball wide on a few occasions. “It’s frustrating, we created a lot of chances but couldn’t convert,” said Blasters’ young star Sahal Abdul Samad after taking the hero-of-the-match award. Blasters, ninth on the league table, were desperate for a victory. They sprung to life shortly after the half-hour mark and moments after Jamshedpur’s star striker Nerijus Valskis — second in the list of leading scorers this season with eight goals — messed up a fine shot. Bad luck Hooper did not appear confident early, but came up with some fine play later as he combined with Murray. He must be a disappointed man, for he put the ball in the back of the net in the 34th minute but was flagged down as offside. A few minutes later, his shot which bounced back in after after hitting the crossbar, appeared to have crossed the goalline. Jamshedpur custodian T.P. Rehenesh came up with some fine saves but it could have been a day when Blasters, which clearly dominated the second-half, should have won by a good margin.  The result: Blasters 0 drew with JFC 0.

28 January 2021||SYDNEY,||CA confirms racial abuse at SCG||Cricket Australia (CA) on Wednesday confirmed India’s players were subjected to racial abuse during the third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground but cleared six spectators who were taken from their seats and questioned by police at the ground. The cricket board had launched an investigation with the police after Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj complained of hearing racist slurs while fielding near the boundary rope. Play was held up for about 10 minutes on day three after Siraj approached an umpire to voice his concerns before police stepped in to take six male fans from their seats. “CA confirms that members of the Indian cricket team were subjected to racial abuse,” CA integrity chief Sean Carroll said in a statement. CA’s investigation on “CA’s own investigation into the matter remains open, with CCTV footage, ticketing data and interviews with spectators still being analysed in an attempt to locate those responsible. “CA’s investigation concluded that the spectators filmed and/or photographed by media in the Brewongle Stand concourse at the conclusion of the 86th over on day three of the Test did not engage in racist behaviour.” CA said it had submitted its report on the investigation to the International Cricket Council (ICC). The board added that it was awaiting confirmation from police that they had completed their own investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ca-confirms-racial-abuse-at-scg/article33680160.ece
28 January 2021||BANGKOK,||Sindhu and Srikanth lose their openers||P.V. Sindhu and K. Srikanth squandered an opening-game advantage before suffering close defeats in their first Group-B matches at the $1.5 million HSBC BWF World Tour Finals here on Wednesday. World champion Sindhu lost to World No. 1 Tai Tzu Ying of Taiwan 21-19, 12-21, 17-21, while World No. 3 Anders Antonsen of Denmark got the better of Srikanth 15-21, 21-16, 21-18 in 77 minutes. Strings broken “It was a good match, there were no easy points. In the third game I came back and it was just a one point difference at one stage. I broke my racquet strings twice (during rallies) and that made a difference,” said Sindhu. It was the Indian’s 16th defeat to Tzu Ying in 21 meetings. Asked for his reactions, the former World No. 1 Srikanth said “I can’t say I’m happy with the way I played today, because I was playing much better in training before I came here. I had my chances today, I could have won from 17-16 in the third.” Sindhu, who had won this title in 2018, will next play home favourite Ratchanok Intanon, who had handed her a defeat last week, while Srikanth, ranked 14th, faces fourth seed Wang Tzu Wei of Taiwan on Thursday.  The results: Men: Anders Antonsen (Den) bt K. Srikanth 15-21, 21-16, 21-18; Women: Tai Tzu Ying (Tpe) bt P.V.

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Solanki seals it with a last-ball six||A stunning unbeaten 46-ball 71 from Vishnu Solanki (4x4, 5x6) helped Baroda snatch victory off the final delivery against Haryana in the quarterfinals of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on Wednesday. Needing 15 off the last three balls and five off one, Solanki pulled out the helicopter shot to flick Sumit Kumar down the ground for six. Solanki, who came in with Baroda 33 for one, added 68 with captain Kedar Devdhar (43, 40b, 2x4, 2x6) in a chase of 149. The two did not take undue risks against Haryana's trump card Yuzvendra Chahal (one for 15 off four overs), but targeted the other spinners, Jayant Yadav and Rahul Tewatia. Devdhar got stuck into Tewatia, collecting 12 off an over while Solanki scored 13 off Jayant. Baroda was threatening to take the game away from Haryana when Sumit prised out Devdhar for 43. The asking rate started to climb after a few tight overs at the death, but Solanki had the final say. Earlier, Haryana, asked to bat, lost openers Chaitanya Bishnoi and Guntashveer Singh within the first five overs. A third-wicket stand of 80 between Shivam Chauhan (35, 29b, 3x4, 1x6) and Himanshu Rana (49, 40b, 7x4) saw Haryana reach a promising 105 for two. However, once Chauhan and Rana were dismissed in successive overs, Haryana lost the momentum and finished at 148 for seven, a total it nearly defended. On the rampage In the other quarterfinal, Rajasthan rode on Mahipal Lomror’s unbeaten 78 (37b, 5x4, 5x6) and contributions from Bharat Sharma (38) and Ankit Lamba (38) to score 164 for five against Bihar. The latter fell short by 16 runs despite Mangal Mahrour’s best efforts. He remained unbeaten on 68.  The scores:   Haryana 148/7 in 20 overs (Himanshu Rana 49, Shivam Chauhan 35) lost to Baroda 150/2 in 20 overs (Kedar Devdhar 43, Vishnu Solanki 71 n.o.).   Rajasthan 164/5 in 20 overs (Bharat Sharma 38, Ankit Lamba 38, Mahipal Lomror 78 n.o.) bt Bihar 148/4 in 20 overs (Mangal Mahrour 68 n.o.).

Eric Gordon and Victor Oladipo added 20 apiece for Houston, which extended its season-best winning streak to three games. DeMarcus Cousins tallied 19 points, 11 rebounds and five steals for Houston, which played without center Christian Wood (ankle). Beal does well Washington’s Bradley Beal, the league’s leading scorer, tallied 33 points on 12-of-28 shooting, while Russell Westbrook, traded for Wall in the off-season, added 19 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists.

28 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Financial control has helped weather crisis, says LaLiga’s Tebas||Most of the Spanish clubs have successfully weathered the financial crisis brought about by the pandemic due to the systems put in place by LaLiga, feels its president Javier Tebas. Speaking to a select Indian media, Tebas said the economic controls introduced by La Liga seven years ago was proving effective, allowing the Spanish clubs to deal with falling revenues far better than other big football leagues around the world. “If we we look at the figures available, the Spanish clubs, excluding the big ones like Barcelona and Real Madrid, owed €300 million before the financial control was put in place. Now, prior to the pandemic, they were earning €300 million,” said Tebas. “The economic control has also meant that the Spanish clubs can handle any new financial crisis like the one the world is facing now. “This means that the clubs are financially sound and can overcome the situation despite having less revenues. This is something other leagues can learn from. Prior to a season, LaLiga determines how much the clubs can spend on the salaries of the players and the technical staff. We do studies on their spending and the revenues, and hence this has become quite a successful model,” said the LaLiga president. Not serious The financial issues plaguing global giant Barcelona is not that serious and the club will be able to manage it, he felt. “We have been reading about Barcelona’s financial problems, but the situation is not as bad as the headlines say. You need to know that if you have a debt, it needs to be in line with your revenues. I think Barcelona has a billion (Euros) in debt, but they also generate one of the highest revenues in the world. So when the pandemic comes to an end, Barcelona can easily overcome its problems,” Tebas said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/financial-control-has-helped-weather-crisis-says-laligas-tebas/article33680174.ece

Even though she lost the third and final qualifying round to Olga Danilovic of Serbia in three sets in Dubai, the 28-year-old Ankita was taken to Melbourne as she stood a good chance to be one of the lucky-losers making the main draw. “In quarantine, I get to be at the venue for five hours which includes two hours of tennis, one and a half hour at the gym, one hour of nutrition and half an hour of going back and forth,” said Ankita from Melbourne. Ankita, ranked 180 now, who had a career-best 160 before the pandemic broke out, said that she was able to adjust to Australia, after a few days of rest. Coached by Hemant Bendrey in Pune, Ankita has been accompanied by coach Utsav Mukherjee who has been travelling with her in recent times. It has been a long-time dream for Ankita to figure in the main draw of the Grand Slams.

Avvaiyar, in her Kondrai Vendan, advises us to speak gently, and not use harsh words. Ulaganathanar, in his Ulaga Neeti, says we must never speak in such a way as to offend others. Sivaprakasar, in his Nanneri, gives an example to help us understand the importance of proper speech. When the moon is up, with its cooling luminousness, the tides in the ocean rise high, as if in joy. But when the Sun with its scorching rays is up, the ocean shows no such approval of its heat. In the same way, when we speak pleasing words to someone, their hearts are filled with happiness. But when we use unpleasant language, their hearts are filled with sadness. Kumaragurupara Adigal says good conduct is like the kalpaka tree. A gentle look in the eyes is like a bud on this tree. A smiling countenance is like a flower. And sweet words are like the sweet fruits in the tree. Thiruvalluvar said that those who spoke kind words will not suffer the agonies of poverty. He further says that he who has humility and also gentle speech has no need of further ornamentation. If we are gentle in our speech, then this reduces the burden of our sins, says Thiruvalluvar. He wonders why a man who has been witness to the benefits of gentle speech would resort to rude words. When good words can so easily be used in conversation, if a man still chooses to speak harshly, then his action is like shunning a sweet, ripe fruit and consuming an unripe fruit instead. To have a pleasant look and equally pleasant words is even better than generosity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pleasing-speech/article33680295.ece

The club was handed over a two-window ban following a complaint from its former player Malemngamba Meitei. The midfielder from Manipur was sacked by Gokulam after one season, ahead of the three-year contract. Sources at the club said that it was due to disciplinary reasons that Meitei was asked to leave. The player complained to the Players’ Status Committee demanding a compensation of about Rs. 30 lakh, according to sources. It is learnt that the committee has arrived at an amount of Rs. 18 lakh. The club, the sources said, would file an appeal to lift the ban after making the payment to Meitei, who is now with Bengaluru United.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gokulam-to-appeal-against-transfer-ban/article33680179.ece

Brad is very driven, Jack says over a video call from Ontario, Canada. “He wants to get promoted. He has to suck up to those above him. He has a lot of aspirations, he is a bit of a climber, but his heart is in the right place. He geeks out about everything Starfleet. He is book smart, but doesn’t know how to improvise. Intellectually he is ready for the captain’s chair, but his lack of experience is holding him back.” The son of actors Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, Jack says he can relate to aspects of Brad. “Not all of them. I can relate to being driven and ambitious. I can relate to wanting to make your mark on the world when you are just starting out. A lot of it is the amazing writing and stuff that we were able to figure out in the booth, little pieces of improv that I am surprised actually made it into the final product.”  Star Trek: Lower Decks is Jack’s second foray into animation on the small screen after playing Richie Rich in Harvey Girls Forever! The 28-year-old actor says, “When you are on camera, you get to convey so much with your face, eyes and body language. Your voice is one of many tools at your disposal. With voice acting, you have to communicate everything through your voice. It is a challenge, one that I love. I love having a line on a page, saying it, having a director tell me to say it a different way, workshop it a few different ways, try a few other improvised lines and move on. It is acting solidified in a nutshell.” Twin worlds Animation has proved to be a great format during the pandemic year. “It was a rough year for everyone. What was cool was that we were lucky enough to be able to record a lot of dialogue not only for season one but also season two in quarantine. We did it in our closets at home. I felt very lucky to be able to do something during that time when everything seemed so uncertain and crazy.” There are two kinds of people in the world — Trekkies ( Star Trek fans) and Star Wars fans. Jack says before working on Lower Decks , he was more of a Star Wars fan than a Trekkie. “Now I would say they are equal.” Excited to be in a Star Trek show, Jack realised he needed to do research as Brad was a huge fan of Starfleet. “Mike McMahan (creator) and Tawny Newsome (co-star) recommended a tonne of great TNG episodes for me to check out and it took me from casual Trek fan to full blown trekkie.” Jack’s favourite Star Trek character is Data. “He brings up so many questions about the nature of humanity. He is portrayed so well and is so fascinating. Kirk and Spock from The Original Series are iconic and so well played. The actors took this idea that was such an insane concept at the time and made it a pop culture phenomenon. It is a feat in and of itself.” While Jack made his acting début with The Hunger Games franchise, he has acted in quite a few shows including the period drama, Vinyl , created by Mick Jagger, Martin Scorsese, Rich Cohen and Terence Winter. When asked to choose between the two formats, Jack groans, “Oh that is such a hard question! Though now you have shows that are as highly anticipated as certain movies, I am going to go with my first love of movies only because that is what got me into doing what I do.”  Star Trek Lower Decks is presently streaming on Amazon Prime Video||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/acting-in-a-nutshell/article33680774.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Nature on a concrete w a l l||Branches of a tree entwine to form an interconnected pathway on which are perched sparrows — in blues, oranges, and pinks — that embody the spirit of freedom. In the backdrop are a few windows suggestive of an urban landscape; a couple of deer stand in front of this celebratory scene almost as if guarding a pocket of happiness and festivity. They represent one of the most common elements seen in India’s Gond art culture. A red ribbon that runs across, ties them all together. Thus, on a 21 x 10 metre concrete facade, Nature celebrates its little dance. Singapore’s Little India is not alien to street art, but it now houses a facet of traditional Indian art through an unusual mural titled Dancing in Unison. Sprawled across the wall of Broadway Hotel, the mural — a colourful amalgamation of the traditional and contemporary — brought together celebrated Gond artist and Padma Shri-awardee Bhajju Shyam and Singaporean visual artist Sam Lo in an unprecedented fashion: through multiple Zoom calls and back-and-forths. As a testament to COVID-19 pushing the boundaries of the art world, what was supposed to be an on-ground collaboration was restricted to the digital media, with Bhajju sending over reference sketches as Sam painted the facade in Singapore. The mural, heavy with motifs of Nature and its fauna, unveiled last week by St+art India Foundation and Singapore Tourism Board (STB), also marked the start of Artwalk 2021, the annual public art festival of Little India with the theme: In Spite Of. This is not the first time that STB is collaborating with St+art India: first in 2017, in the public art district of Sassoon Docks, Mumbai, and subsequently in Delhi’s Lodhi district where Sam and Bhajju collaborated for the first time. Crossing boundaries “Artwalk 2021 proved to be a canvas for us to come together again. We wanted to bring a little bit of India into Singapore. What better place to do it in than Little India which has a very strong historical link to India,” says Raymond Lim, area director, STB, in a joint interview with curator and co-founder of St+art India, Giulia Ambrogi, who joins from Berlin, Germany. “In spite of the distance and boundaries, and in this unusual situation, we have been able to think through and understand how we can cross these boundaries. We wanted to bring an artform that is very well known in India but perhaps not so known abroad, like Gond art,” she says, adding, in terms of visibility, scale and positioning in the urban fabric, the Broadway Hotel facade was the perfect canvas because unlike other walls in Little India, this was broad and, coincidentally, very close to an Indian restaurant. “The process that went into shaping a mural conceptualised by two artistes across countries was the most eye-opening,” Giulia says. “We are lucky to be living in a time where the Internet is accessible because I have not had the opportunity to meet Sam. So, without technology this would not have been possible,” says Bhajju, who was born and raised in the village of Patangarh, Madhya Pradesh, which is home to the indigenous Gond Pradhan tribe. Sam says that this project was a learning experience. “Although it was intimidating at first, to be working with such a highly respected artist representing such a significant cultural art form... it really helped that Bhajju exuded such an ease of manner. In the end, this experience really represents hope and a spirit of possibility,” they add. This was the first time that Sam has taken someone else’s work to a wall. They recall, “It was one thing to have to take artwork that was created entirely on paper with paints and pigments and put it on a 21 x 10 metre wall by hand, but it was a whole other ball game figuring out the appropriate technique to re-create the use of stippling and short brush strokes in Gond art using my medium of spray paints.” While Bhajju says that though he has previously experimented with large format works in Gond art, translating his work to a wall of this scale was a first. “I had seen Sam’s work at the Lodhi Art District in Delhi, and noticed similarities in our practice in terms of the subjects we choose. In this mural, we saw the tree (done in Gond art) as the focal point and developed other elements around it,” says Bajju. In the Gond art tradition, each of the elements in Nature — be it a hill, river or tree — is believed to be inhabited by a spirit, and is consequently sacred. And so, natural elements are recurrent motifs. According to Bhajju, collaborations like these introduce an element of contemporaneity to Gond art. “It acts as a form of preserving the gods we worship and our Adivasi stories and practices,” he says, adding that he has been seeing a greater engagement in the last decade. “People have been wanting our art in their homes and private collections, which is encouraging.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/nature-on-a-concrete-w-a-l-l/article33680791.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Aari Arujunan interview: ‘Bigg Boss taught me self-discipline’||After emerging victorious at the Bigg Boss Tamil House, Aari Arujunan has been busy. Apart from spending time with his family, he has resumed work on his film projects; the teaser of his upcomingEllam Mela Irukaravan Paathuppanreleased a few days ago. But the buzz surrounding his conduct at Bigg Boss does not seem to die down, if one one were to go by comments on his social media. “This isn’t my victory. I see it as people’s victory,” says the actor, whose honesty and outspoken nature seem to have contributed in a big way to people voting for him. In a telephonic chat with MetroPlus , Aari talks about taking one of the biggest decisions of his life — getting into the House — and the plans ahead. Excerpts: Who do you have to thank most for your victory? People who have voted for me. And my wife, for being so patient and handling all the feedback and criticism of me that came her way.  At what point in 2020 did you decide that you had it in you to compete in the House?  In my 15-year film career, I have faced more losses than victory. Offers to participate in Bigg Boss have come during previous seasons as well, but I could not take them up due to other commitments. This year, when I was in a dilemma to take it up, it was director Thamira ( Rettaisuzhi ) who gave me the confidence. That push — and the fact that I could use this platform to tell the world about issues close to my heart — is what prompted me to take it up. Did you do any preparation before entering the House?  I have never seen the previous seasons completely. When I decided that I would take part this year, I told myself, "Why should I prepare when this is all about being myself?" With lockdown and work from home coming into being, several regular households became like the Bigg Boss House. Would you agree?  Oh yes. Earlier, we would be out most of the time and spend just a few hours at home. But now, with people working from home, there is a lot of time spent with family members. This can lead to both love and differences of opinion. Maybe that’s why this season of Bigg Boss was celebrated so much; perhaps the audience saw their own lives on screen. Also, having spent time in the House, I can vouch that nothing was scripted. Every contestant is as raw as clay when we go inside; it is entirely up to us to mould ourselves the way we want. What were your biggest learnings from this experience?  It taught me what my strengths are, and the importance of self-discipline. What made you the happiest from this experience?  Many people have called me to say that they would like to see their children grow up like me; I see this as a big compliment. I’m also happy that I could sow the seeds of change among contestants about aspects like speaking in Tamil and the importance of not wasting food. What do you wish to convey to the fans who have been supporting you?  Plant a tree. Take tuition classes for someone in your neighbourhood. Write a ‘kural’ somewhere where kids can read it. Be the reason for change. And, if there’s someone in your neighbourhood who is doing this earnestly, recognise and celebrate them. I am not the only brand for nermai (honesty); it’s a virtue that is present in all of us. You have voiced your opinion on many important issues, including during thejallikattuprotests. In the long run, do you see yourself getting into politics?  I am already in politics, just like every citizen. Today, I am in the politics of casting my vote. If, there comes a time when I feel worthy enough of asking votes, we will see.  I’m happy that I could sow the seeds of change among contestants about aspects like speaking in Tamil and the importance of not wasting food Aari Arujunan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/aari-arujunan-interview-bigg-boss-taught-me-self-discipline/article33680777.ece

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Ponchiki in Madras||In early 2020, Dank was among a small set of promising debutantes in Chennai’s dining scene whose season was cut short by the COVID-19 lockdowns within mere weeks of their opening. However, the T Nagar-based bar and restaurant has persevered, strutting into 2021 on the arm of celebrity chef Sabyasachi Gorai. Saby, as he is popularly known, has collaborated with Dank to create a special menu that includes — among other things — ponchiki , a custard-filled Armenian pastry almost synonymous with Lavaash by Saby in New Delhi. The chef, who has been in the industry since 1997-98, has worked largely with European and Mediterranean restaurants. “My stint with SodaBottleOpenerWala in Bombay happened almost as an offshoot of that. Lavaash, on the other hand, was connected to my father’s work with the Armenian colony in Calcutta. So European, Middle Eastern, Turkish, have always been a part of the cuisines [where I worked]. In a French-Mediterranean restaurant where I worked, we would serve beignets; they were very similar to ponchiki, but without the filling. The custard filling is how it is done in Russia, Armenia, Poland and Georgia,” explains Saby, adding, “The custard for our ponchiki at Dank is entirely homemade. We didn’t want it to taste commercial.” The offerings at Dank, however, are not all exotic — a large part of the menu plays with regional ingredients and tastes, even making it a point to boast about the locally-sourced ingredients in fine print. Says the chef, who was briefly in town to introduce the new menu to guests, “We have not changed the recipes of the European-origin or Mediterranean-origin dishes; but have made them using local ingredients. One of the dishes is an arancini (an Italian rice dumpling) that we have made out of ghee bhat . We also have a lot of spice blends, to which we have added podi s like black sesame podi , curry leaves podi and red chilli podi .”He also used the local seeraga samba rice to create Mexican paella for a special brunch, along with a string of fish items. “A good thing about Chennai is that the people here are very open to fish and other seafood. Meat, I think, we still have to work on. Bengaluru, on the other hand, is more accepting of meat than it is of seafood,” muses Saby. For a first foray, Chennai has been smooth sailing for the chef. “I was warned by many that the dining habits of Chennai are very different from that of Bengaluru, Pune and other cities. But a large part of the community that I see meeting at Dank are well-heeled, well-travelled youngsters, very similar to those I see at restaurants in other cities. They know good food and appreciate innovation. Like Bangalore, Chennai has higher spice levels than what we probably take in Bombay, but I felt quite at home.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/ponchiki-in-madras/article33680794.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Out of the gearbox||A lunch for the crème de la crème, a midday-soirée, a scattering of classic wheels, and the resultant mix is arguably “out of the gearbox”. Chromes, Curves, Classics — on January 31 at Radisson BLU Temple Bay in Mamallapuram — follows a nuanced and ambitious script: a display of cars from the classic era, and a time travel to that period through four visceral routes: music, movies, food and fashion. Organised in association with Historical Cars Association of India (HCAI), it is an invitation-only event (from 11.30 am onwards) that can however be savoured vicariously via the hotel’s Instagram (@radissonbluresorttemplebay) and Facebook (RadissonBluTempleBay) pages, where it would be livestreamed. Sasikumar U, vice president, GRT Hotels and Resorts, says a majority of the classic cars on display will have a whiff of stardust around them, as clips from Hollywood films featuring similar cars would play on a loop. “Selections include Two For the Road (MG TD); Danger: Diabolik (Jaguar E-Type); The Day Of The Jackal (Alfa Romeo); The Italian Job (Mini Cooper); and Diamonds Are Forever (Mustang),” adds Shubhangi N, general manager, sales and marketing, GRT Hotels and Resorts. What constitutes the classic cars era is a nebulous zone, with more debate than consensus on most time-frames. Placing it loosely in the 1940s to ‘70s time-frame, with a cautious toe in the 1980s, should be a safe bet. Songs harking back to those decades — of course, that includes Beatles, Frank Sinatra and Rolling Stones — would rend the balmy beach air. For the fashion part, “the hotel staff would be togged in dress reminiscent of icons associated with these cars, as also other worthies from that era,” says Sasikumar. So reportedly, the staff would play “Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Jane Fonda and Vivien Leigh”, among others. Sasikumar hints at surprises parked in store, even letting one cease to be a surprise anymore: Al Capone of the Chicago Mob would doff his hat to the guests. Well, why not? It takes all sorts to make an era. Al Capone went the way of all flesh in 1947, but his Outfit continues to this day, even as a sub-cultural trope depicted in films. Invitees are urged to reflect the zeitgeist of the Fifties through their sartorial choices. However, if a guest dressed further or a wee bit nearer in time, they should still pass muster. He underlines one ingredient of the buffet lunch — “dishes known to have captivated icons’ tastebuds”. Examples: the Soup Station features ‘JFK’s favourite seafood chowder’. Through its selection, Churchill Barbecue Station celebrates how Winston Churchill “relished meats cooked to perfection marinated with fine herbs”. The one taking its name after K Kamaraj features traditional dishes from the Virudhunagar region. When Ranjit Pratap, president of HCAI, suggested a classic cars rally suitably fitted to a chassis of history tropes, the idea seemed “right up the lobby”. “We are right in a place that is steeped in history — Mamallapuram town, with thousands of years of recorded history. Our 64-year-old heritage lobby inaugurated by leader K Kamaraj is itself steeped in history,” says Sasikumar. “A majority of these cars would be displayed at the heritage lobby without diminishing the place’s own charm; the lawns around the lobby make up another area; the place where Prince Charles planted a tree would be another space; a few cars would be on the Infinity Pool deck; a car associated with James Bond would be parked with the sea as the backdrop,” Sasikumar elaborates, adding that pandemic-related SOPs would be followed. The cars from HCAI that make it to Chromes, Curves, Classics, not in any particular order, are: MG TD, Jaguar E-Type, Mini Cooper, Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, Triumph TR-3, Chevrolet Bel Air, Chrysler New Yorker, Jaguar Mark II, Jaguar Mark IV, Chevrolet Styleline, Volkswagen Camper, Volkswagen Beetle, Studebaker Champion Bullnose, Cadillac Series 62, Chevrolet Fleetmaster, Fiat Spider, Mustang Sports Back, Studebaker President, Alfa Romeo 1961, Chevrolet Impala, Fiat ‘Topolino’, Standard Herald, Standard Ten, Fiat Elegant and Morris 8 – E Series. Storyboards are said to have been prepared for each car.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/out-of-the-gearbox/article33680797.ece

Maajja, a tech platform to help resource-bereft artistes widen their reach, and YAALL, its global music festival of nearly unprecedented proportions, has musicians and fans around the region already sitting up and taking notice. YAALL Festival has scores of Chennai’s — and the South Asian diaspora’s — finest in its lineup, from Toronto-based acts like Cartel Madras and Shan Vincent De Paul to widely recognised local talent like Siennor, Tamil rock band Oorka, producer-composer-singer Tenma, rapper Arivarasu Kalainesan aka Arivu and more, all performing on the ground in Chennai. Noel Kirthiraj, CEO of Maajja, states over a call from Toronto that the festival had to be put on hold because of COVID-19. “We have been working on it [the platform] with Rahman sir for years,” says Noel, adding, “When the festival can happen, we envision over 80 artistes coming in from 12 countries. But meanwhile, why not do something else to showcase how the indie content here is on a par with movie music?” To that end, a series of online performances and narratives telling the story of each musician — will kick off in February. Musicians in the loop are gung-ho about the plans, with Bharath Sankar of Oorka describing the festival as “Tomorrowland-esque in vision”. Tenma, who has composed for the film industry in addition to spearheading independent movements, states, “This elevates the music scene to the next level.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/rahman-bats-for-indie-musicians/article33680795.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The edible city/ Hunt, gather, eat||Between sips of blue pea flower tea, Saritha OT, a teacher of environmental science, makes patties out of sessile joyweed foraged from near her house in Hyderabad’s Jubilee Hills. Next, she grinds leaves of creeping sorrel from her garden into a chutney. Having recently learned that the weed she pulled out from her potted plants was wandering Jew ( Commensalis benghalensis ), an edible green, she has been surfing the net looking for suitable recipes. Fortunately, she has a community to lean on: Saritha is part of a growing group of urban Indian foragers who use wild edibles in their food. Foraging is gathering ‘food’ — edible weeds, fruits and flowers — that grows in the wild (not uncultivated). Traditionally associated with rural and tribal communities, foraging is also practised in urban and semi-urban pockets. Edible weeds are consumed across the country, and they vary due to geographical and climatic variations. Lately, foraging has picked up in cities, triggered by lockdown, when people had more time at hand to explore their surroundings and experiment in the kitchen. Saritha got interested in the hobby two years ago when she attended a lunch, Festival of Uncultivated Foods, hosted by the Deccan Development Society, Hyderabad. “Edible weeds were used in cutlet, vada , chutney and even rotis. Each has a distinct taste — purslane is tangy, gale of wind is bitter,” she says. She was impressed by the uses plants such as devil’s horsewhip, kidney leaf, spider wisp and jute mallow, as well as their nutritional content. “I learnt that farmers and locals depend on foraging during dry months when there isn’t much else,” she says. Facilitating change  ShrutiTharayil (@forgottengreens on Instagram) hosts programmes to teach people more about how to recognise and cook edible wilds, to make fritters, soups, dal , stir fries, salads and more. “Foraging is not new. We have always done it; our mothers probably still pluck herbs and add them to the food. We have a lot of knowledge, but there is a gap between practice,” says Calicut-based Shruti, who calls herself a ‘facilitator for change’. Her curiosity was piqued when she was working with a non-profit organisation in rural Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. She noticed rural women collecting greens to cook. The more she researched, the more she learnt and the results fascinated her. Shruti sees foraging as a means of connecting with the immediate ecosystem and staying connected to the land and soil; more importantly that it helps keep biodiversity alive. India boasts a diverse range of these greens — mountain knot grass, creeping daisy (wedelia), wood sorrel, Indian pennywort, Peperomia pellucida , Bengal day flower, red hogweed, desert horse purslane, asthma weed, Indian nettle, and stinging nettle are some which figure on a very long list. “It is not that these have been forgotten or that only rural or tribal communities use these. Certain plants are recognised in urban pockets too. You see an empty plot — you will find many edible weeds there,” says Elizabeth S, a gardener from Bengaluru. Foraging is not easy — it demands patience, time and skills of observation. Active communities of gardeners and farmers share information and recipes online, sustaining interest and guiding newcomers. Lockdown brought with it a lot of time and an increased interest in foraging. People began cooking with what was available in their compounds, typically familiar greens such as moringa leaves, kuppai keerai ( Amaranthus viridis ), and colocasia leaves. “Confinement draws attention to what is nearby. People are thinking about how to self-sustain — this is a life skill,” says Elizabeth. She and foragers like her use ‘wild greens’ to supplement store-bought vegetables as these are not found in huge quantities. Kush Sethi from Delhi has been organising forage walks in Delhi’s Lodhi Gardens for the last four years (it was cancelled in 2020). The walks are organised in winter months from November to March. “I don’t forage for myself; this is an educational walk programme. We do it in Lodhi Gardens as there is an interesting mix of plants,” says Kush. The walk ends with a multi-course meal at a pan-European restaurant, made with the plants foraged. Kush leads foraging walks not more than five or six times a year. Working with gardeners, he forages from plant beds in the park. (“I tell them that I’ll pluck the weeds for them,” Kush jokes.) He also does commissioned work for travel companies organising ‘forage walks’. “They are selling aspects of the city that extend beyond its [Delhi’s] heritage,” he adds. The interest, he believes, has been consistent. Urban foraging is not as dichotmous as it sounds. “Urban spaces have so much — empty plots or road dividers — where you can find edible weeds. These could be polluted which can be cleaned by washing with rock or table salt water or turmeric powder or tamarind infused water,” Shruti says. Farah Yameen, digital archivist from Delhi, started @thesaagarchive, an Instagram handle during lockdown on which she posts illustrations of edible weeds, with recipes, usually shared by other enthusiasts such as Shruti. Saag refers to greens, usually leafy vegetables. Some are well-known and others family recipes, recently a chana saag recipe came from Bihar. She is careful about where she sources these greens from, avoiding spaces that could be toxic as some plants such as varieties of amaranth tend to absorb toxins from the soil. “People have found these edible plants in the most unexpected places — flower pots on terraces,” she says. Anumitra Ghosh Dastidar, chef and co-founder Edible Archives (Goa) links foraging with first creating awareness. The edible herb she uses — gotu kola — as seasoning is plucked from the garden at the restaurant just before serving. “There is the perception that what we ‘buy’ is food has to change. For me it is related to conservation,” she says. It is a delicate balance, indiscriminate foraging might cause a shortage for people whose source of nourishment these plants might be.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-edible-city-hunt-gather-eat/article33680790.ece

28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Acting in a nUtshell||In the animated show, Star Trek Lower Decks, Jack Quaid plays Brad Boimler, a support crew member aboard the U.S.S. Cerritos. Brad is very driven, Jack says over a video call from Canada. “He wants to get promoted. He has to suck up to those above him. He has aspirations, he is a bit of a climber, but his heart is in the right place. He geeks out about everything Starfleet. He is book smart, but doesn’t know how to improvise. Intellectually he is ready for the captain’s chair, but his lack of experience is holding him back.” The son of actors Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, Jack says he can relate to aspects of Brad. “Not all of them. I can relate to being driven and ambitious. I can relate to wanting to make your mark on the world when you are just starting out. A lot of it is the amazing writing and stuff that we were able to figure out in the booth, little pieces of improv that I am surprised actually made it into the final product,” he says.  Star Trek: Lower Decks is Jack’s second foray into animation on the small screen after playing Richie Rich in Harvey Girls Forever! The 28-year-old actor says, “When you are on camera, you get to convey so much with your face, eyes and body language. Your voice is one of many tools at your disposal. With voice acting, you have to communicate everything through your voice. It is a challenge, one that I love. I love having a line on a page, saying it, having a director tell me to say it a different way, workshop it a few different ways, try a few other improvised lines and move on. It is acting solidified in a nutshell.” Twin worlds Animation has proved to be a great format during the pandemic year. “It was a rough year for everyone. What was cool was that we were lucky enough to be able to record a lot of dialogue not only for season one but also season two in quarantine. We did it in our closets at home. I felt very lucky to be able to do something during that time when everything seemed so uncertain and crazy.” There are two kinds of people in the world — Trekkies ( Star Trek fans) and Star Wars fans. Jack says before working on Lower Decks , he was more of a Star Wars fan than a Trekkie. “Now I would say they are equal.” A big fan of the JJ Abrams reboot movies, Jack says they were great because they were able to bring in a new audience as well as satisfy old fans. Jack realised he needed to do research as Brad was a huge fan of Starfleet. “Mike McMahan (creator) and Tawny Newsome (co-star) recommended a tonne of great TNG episodes for me to check out and it took me from casual Trek fan to full blown trekkie.” His favourite Star Trek character is Data. “He brings up so many questions about the nature of humanity. He is portrayed so well and is so fascinating. Kirk and Spock from The Original Series are iconic and so well played. The actors took this idea that was such an insane concept at the time and made it a pop culture phenomenon. It is a feat in and of itself.” While Jack made his acting début with The Hunger Games franchise, he has acted in quite a few shows including the period drama, Vinyl , created by Mick Jagger, Martin Scorsese, Rich Cohen and Terence Winter. When asked to choose between the two formats, Jack groans, “Oh that is such a hard question! Though now you have shows that are as highly anticipated as certain movies, I am going to go with my first love of movies only because that is what got me into doing what I do.”  Star Trek Lower Decks is presently streaming on Amazon Prime Video||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/acting-in-a-nutshell/article33680577.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Nature on a concrete w a l l||Branches of a tree entwine to form an interconnected pathway on which are perched sparrows — in blues, oranges, and pinks — that embody the spirit of freedom. In the backdrop are a few windows suggestive of an urban landscape; a couple of deer stand in front of this celebratory scene almost as if guarding a pocket of happiness and festivity. They represent one of the most common elements seen in India’s Gond art culture. A red ribbon that runs across, ties them all together. Thus, on a 21 x 10 metre concrete facade, Nature celebrates its little dance. Singapore’s Little India is not alien to street art, but it now houses a facet of traditional Indian art through an unusual mural titled Dancing in Unison. Sprawled across the wall of Broadway Hotel, the mural — a colourful amalgamation of the traditional and contemporary — brought together celebrated Gond artist and Padma Shri-awardee Bhajju Shyam and Singaporean visual artist Sam Lo in an unprecedented fashion: through multiple Zoom calls and back-and-forths. As a testament to COVID-19 pushing the boundaries of the art world, what was supposed to be an on-ground collaboration was restricted to the digital media, with Bhajju sending over reference sketches as Sam painted the facade in Singapore. The mural, heavy with motifs of Nature and its fauna, unveiled last week by St+art India Foundation and Singapore Tourism Board (STB), also marked the start of Artwalk 2021, the annual public art festival of Little India with the theme: In Spite Of. This is not the first time that STB is collaborating with St+art India: first in 2017, in the public art district of Sassoon Docks, Mumbai, and subsequently in Delhi’s Lodhi district where Sam and Bhajju collaborated for the first time. Crossing boundaries “Artwalk 2021 proved to be a canvas for us to come together again. We wanted to bring a little bit of India into Singapore. What better place to do it in than Little India which has a very strong historical link to India,” says Raymond Lim, area director, STB, in a joint interview with curator and co-founder of St+art India, Giulia Ambrogi, who joins from Berlin, Germany. “In spite of the distance and boundaries, and in this unusual situation, we have been able to think through and understand how we can cross these boundaries. We wanted to bring an artform that is very well known in India but perhaps not so known abroad, like Gond art,” she says, adding, in terms of visibility, scale and positioning in the urban fabric, the Broadway Hotel facade was the perfect canvas because unlike other walls in Little India, this was broad and, coincidentally, very close to an Indian restaurant. “The process that went into shaping a mural conceptualised by two artistes across countries was the most eye-opening,” Giulia says. “We are lucky to be living in a time where the Internet is accessible because I have not had the opportunity to meet Sam. So, without technology this would not have been possible,” says Bhajju, who was born and raised in the village of Patangarh, Madhya Pradesh, which is home to the indigenous Gond Pradhan tribe. Sam says that this project was a learning experience. “Although it was intimidating at first, to be working with such a highly respected artist representing such a significant cultural art form... it really helped that Bhajju exuded such an ease of manner. In the end, this experience really represents hope and a spirit of possibility,” they add. This was the first time that Sam has taken someone else’s work to a wall. They recall, “It was one thing to have to take artwork that was created entirely on paper with paints and pigments and put it on a 21 x 10 metre wall by hand, but it was a whole other ball game figuring out the appropriate technique to re-create the use of stippling and short brush strokes in Gond art using my medium of spray paints.” While Bhajju says that though he has previously experimented with large format works in Gond art, translating his work to a wall of this scale was a first. “I had seen Sam’s work at the Lodhi Art District in Delhi, and noticed similarities in our practice in terms of the subjects we choose. In this mural, we saw the tree (done in Gond art) as the focal point and developed other elements around it,” says Bajju. In the Gond art tradition, each of the elements in Nature — be it a hill, river or tree — is believed to be inhabited by a spirit, and is consequently sacred. And so, natural elements are recurrent motifs. According to Bhajju, collaborations like these introduce an element of contemporaneity to Gond art. “It acts as a form of preserving the gods we worship and our Adivasi stories and practices,” he says, adding that he has been seeing a greater engagement in the last decade. “People have been wanting our art in their homes and private collections, which is encouraging.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/nature-on-a-concrete-w-a-l-l/article33680583.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Aari Arujunan interview: ‘Bigg Boss taught me self-discipline’||After emerging victorious at the Bigg Boss Tamil House, Aari Arujunan has been busy. Apart from spending time with his family, he has resumed work on his film projects; the teaser of his upcomingEllam Mela Irukaravan Paathuppanreleased a few days ago. But the buzz surrounding his conduct at Bigg Boss does not seem to die down, if one one were to go by comments on his social media. “This isn’t my victory. I see it as people’s victory,” says the actor, whose honesty and outspoken nature seem to have contributed in a big way to people voting for him. In a telephonic chat, Aari talks about taking one of the biggest decisions of his life — getting into the House — and the plans ahead. Excerpts: Who do you have to thank most for your victory? People who have voted for me. And my wife, for being so patient and handling all the feedback and criticism of me that came her way. At what point in 2020 did you decide you had it in you to compete in the House?  In my 15-year film career, I have faced more losses than victory. Offers to participate in Bigg Boss have come during previous seasons as well, but I could not take them up due to other commitments. This year, when I was in a dilemma to take it up, it was director Thamira ( Rettaisuzhi ) who gave me the confidence. That push — and the fact that I could use this platform to tell the world about issues close to my heart — is what prompted me to take it up. Did you do prepare for it?  I have never seen the previous seasons completely. When I decided that I would take part this year, I told myself, "Why should I prepare when this is all about being myself?" With lockdown and work from home, several regular households became like the Bigg Boss House.  Oh yes. Earlier, we would be out most of the time and spend just a few hours at home. But now, with people working from home, there is a lot of time spent with family members. This can lead to both love and differences of opinion. Maybe that’s why this season of Bigg Boss was celebrated so much; perhaps the audience saw their own lives on screen. Also, having spent time in the House, I can vouch that nothing was scripted. Every contestant is as raw as clay when we go inside; it is entirely up to us to mould ourselves the way we want. What were your biggest learnings?  It taught me what my strengths are, and the importance of self-discipline. What made you the happiest from this experience?  Many people have called me to say that they would like to see their children grow up like me. I see this as a big compliment honestly. I’m also happy that I could sow the seeds of change among contestants about aspects like speaking in Tamil and the importance of not wasting food. Your fight with Balaji was much talked about on social media. How do you handle aggressive people? I recall having a heart-to-heart talk with him before we came out. I told him to be patient, listen to others and see life from other people’s shoes. Actually, I see myself in Balaji; I was like him a few years ago. What do you wish to convey to the fans who have been supporting you?  Plant a tree. Take tuition classes for someone in your neighbourhood. Write a ‘kural’ somewhere where kids can read it. Be the reason for change. If there’s someone in your neighbourhood who is doing this earnestly, recognise and celebrate them. I am not the only brand for nermai (honesty); it’s a virtue that is present in all of us. You voiced your opinion on important issues. Do you see yourself getting into politics?  I am already in politics, just like every citizen. Today, I am in the politics of casting my vote. If there comes a time when I feel worthy enough of asking votes, we will see.  I’m happy that I could sow the seeds of change among contestants about aspects like speaking in Tamil and the importance of not wasting food Aari Arujunan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/aari-arujunan-interview-bigg-boss-taught-me-self-discipline/article33680596.ece

Maajja, a tech platform to help resource-bereft artistes widen their reach, and YAALL, its global music festival of nearly unprecedented proportions, has musicians and fans around the region already sitting up and taking notice. YAALL Festival has scores of Chennai’s — and the South Asian diaspora’s — finest in its lineup, from Toronto-based acts like Cartel Madras and Shan Vincent De Paul to widely recognised local talent like Siennor, Tamil rock band Oorka, producer-composer-singer Tenma, rapper Arivarasu Kalainesan aka Arivu and more, all performing on the ground in Chennai. Noel Kirthiraj, CEO of Maajja, states over a call from Toronto that the festival had to be put on hold because of COVID-19. “We have been working on it [the platform] with Rahman sir for years,” says Noel, adding, “When the festival can happen, we envision over 80 artistes coming in from 12 countries. But meanwhile, why not do something else to showcase how the indie content here is on a par with movie music?” To that end, a series of online performances and narratives telling the story of each musician — will kick off in February. Musicians in the loop are gung-ho about the plans, with Bharath Sankar of Oorka describing the festival as “Tomorrowland-esque in vision”. Tenma, who has composed for the film industry in addition to spearheading independent movements, states, “This elevates the music scene to the next level.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/rahman-bats-for-indie-musicians/article33680585.ece
28 January 2021||January 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The edible city||Between sips of blue pea flower tea, Saritha OT, a teacher of environmental science, makes patties out of sessile joyweed foraged from near her house in Hyderabad’s Jubilee Hills. Next, she grinds leaves of creeping sorrel from her garden into a chutney. Having recently learned that the weed she pulled out from her potted plants was wandering Jew ( Commensalis benghalensis ), an edible green, she has been surfing the net looking for suitable recipes. Fortunately, she has a community to lean on: Saritha is part of a growing group of urban Indian foragers who use wild edibles in their food. Foraging is gathering ‘food’ — edible weeds, fruits and flowers — that grows in the wild. Traditionally associated with rural and tribal communities, foraging is also practised in urban and semi-urban pockets. Edible weeds are consumed across the country, and they vary due to geographical and climatic variations. Lately, foraging has picked up in cities, triggered by lockdown, when people had more time at hand to explore their surroundings and experiment in the kitchen. Saritha got interested in the hobby two years ago when she attended a lunch, Festival of Uncultivated Foods, hosted by the Deccan Development Society, Hyderabad. “Edible weeds were used in cutlet, vada , chutney and even rotis. Each has a distinct taste — purslane is tangy, gale of wind is bitter,” she says. She was impressed by the uses plants such as devil’s horsewhip, kidney leaf, spider wisp and jute mallow, as well as their nutritional content. “I learnt that farmers and locals depend on foraging during dry months when there isn’t much else,” she says. Facilitating change ShrutiTharayil (@forgottengreens on Instagram) hosts programmes to teach people more about how to recognise and cook edible wilds, to make fritters, soups, dal , stir fries, salads and more. “Foraging is not new. We have always done it; our mothers probably still pluck herbs and add them to the food. We have a lot of knowledge, but there is a gap between practice,” says Calicut-based Shruti, who calls herself a ‘facilitator for change’.

28 January 2021||Mumbai,||Border dispute: make area a UT till SC settles issue, says CM||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that the disputed border area between Maharashtra and Karnataka should be made a Union Territory until the matter was decided in the Supreme Court. He said no matter what happens, the disputed part would be made a part of Maharashtra. “Ideally, status quo must be maintained in an area under dispute and the case is being heard in the apex court. But Karantaka government has renamed it Belgaum, given it the status of second capital of the State and holds its Assembly session there. Doesn’t it amount to disrespecting the court?” he asked. He was speaking at the launch of a Marathi book on the ongoing conflict between the two States over the border area. Mr. Thackeray said the disputed area was Karnataka-occupied Maharashtra and people there were actually living in Maharashtra. “We never hated Kannada as a language, but we will not tolerate Kannadigas hurting our Marathi brethren,” he said. Maharashtra has been claiming that Belagavi, Karwar and Nipani belong to it as they are Marathi-speaking areas. “The dispute has been going on for many years. At least till the time the matter is decided in the Supreme Court, why can’t it be made a union territory? Our government should be telling this in the court. We don’t want the Karnataka government meddling in the day-to-day affairs there,” Mr. Thackeray said. “No matter which political party gains power in Karnataka, they work together. We have to stand together in this,” he said. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who was also present at the event, said that after a prolonged exercise involving collection of evidence and making reports, the battle was now in its last stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/border-dispute-make-area-a-ut-till-sc-settles-issue-says-cm/article33680473.ece
