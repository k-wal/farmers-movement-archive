01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccine close to approval, hints DCGI||V.G. Somani, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), indicated at a webinar on Thursday that the country was close to approving a COVID-19 vaccine. Mr. Somani was participating in a webinar, organised by the Department of Biotechnology, that saw vaccine experts, infectious disease experts and representatives of firms developing vaccines discuss its development and India’s preparation. “We will probably have a Happy New Year with something in hand,” he said while discussing the regulatory process. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday also suggested that a vaccine was at hand. “Earlier, I said, ‘ Dawai nahi toh dheelai nahi’ (No laxity till a cure is found). Now, I am saying 'Dawai bhi aur kadaai bhi' (Along with the medicine, be vigilant). Our mantra for the year 2021 is ‘ Dawai bhi aur kadaai bhi’ ,” he said. Mr. Modi was speaking after laying the foundation stone of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Rajkot through video conferencing. Stating that India is getting ready to run the world’s largest vaccination programme, the Prime Minister said India has turned into the nerve centre of global health. He also cautioned against rumours about COVID vaccination. “Different people for their personal gains or due to irresponsible behaviour spread various rumours. Maybe rumours will be spread when vaccination begins, some have already begun,” he said. “I appeal to the people of the country that the fight against COVID-19 is the one against an unknown enemy,” Mr. Modi said. “Be careful about such rumours and as responsible citizens refrain from forwarding messages on social media without checking,” Mr. Modi said. On Friday, the DCGI’s subject expert committee, which is perusing applications by companies developing vaccines in India, is expected to review applications by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech (BB) for emergency use authorisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccine-candidate-close-to-approval-hints-drug-controller/article33467556.ece
01 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Schools to reopen partially today||With schools set to reopen on January 1 after more than nine months in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, elaborate arrangements have been made to welcome students back in strict compliance with the safety protocols. Schools were cleaned up and disinfected by the Fire and Rescue Services or local self-government institutions with PTA support. Masks, sanitisers, handwash and thermal scanners too are ready. Own plans General Education Secretary A. Shajahan said schools had drawn up their own plans to make arrangements for students to attend revision classes and practicals. Schools had also decided the focus subjects for each day and which teachers would be deployed for the day. In schools that did not have teachers, measures such as redeployment of teachers, Samagra Shiksha’s teachers, and local teachers such as retired personnel would be roped in to meet emergency situations. The General Education Department had a few days ago issued detailed safety guidelines such as limiting the student strength in a day to 50% in schools which have up to 300 students, 25% in schools that have more than this number, one bench for each students and no sharing of lunch or drinking water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/schools-to-reopen-partially-today/article33467742.ece
01 January 2021||Bengaluru,||COVID-19 vaccination: Dry run in five districts of State tomorrow||To test the linkage between planning and implementation, and identify challenges, a dry run for COVID-19 vaccination will be conducted in five districts of Karnataka on January 2. Dry runs will be conducted in three “vaccine session sites” each in Bengaluru Urban, Kalaburagi, Shivamogga, Mysuru and Belagavi districts. Around 75 to 100 vaccinators and 375 beneficiaries are expected to be part of the dry run in Karnataka. This follows directions from the Union government that has asked all States and Union Territories to gear up for roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bushan, who chaired a high-level meeting on Thursday to review preparedness, has asked all States and UTs to ensure effective preparedness for the vaccine roll-out, by conducting a dry run on January 2. State Deputy Director (Immunisation) Rajani Nageshrao told The Hindu on Thursday that the dry run will take place at taluk hospital, district hospital and Primary Health Centre level in each of the five districts. “We will have an orientation for the jurisdictional officials through the Deputy Commissioners (DCs) on Friday. The dry run will be an exercise for end-to-end testing of COVID-19 vaccination process, except the actual vaccination. As many as 25 beneficiaries (identified healthcare workers) in the jurisdiction of each session site of the five districts will be sent a message asking them to come to the location along with their ID proof for the dry run,” she said. “The aim of the exercise is to understand how the actual vaccination and all related activities must take place. Three rooms, waiting area, syringes, beneficiaries, vaccinators who will administer the vaccine, adverse events following immunization (AEFI) kits which are usually kept ready during all immunisation programmes and an observation room will be kept ready,” Dr Rajani explained. “After the dry run is over, challenges and difficulties faced at the session sites of each district will be collected and communicated to the Union government. The exercise will provide confidence to programme managers at various levels,” she added. A dry run of COVID-19 vaccination was conducted in Assam, Punjab, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh for two days from December 28. The exercise was conducted in two districts each in these States where five session sites with 25 beneficiaries each were identified. No major issues were observed in the operational aspects during this dry run.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-vaccination-dry-run-in-five-districts-of-state-on-jan-2/article33467689.ece

Lenin, have been aggressively marketing the railway goods service among trade and industry bodies in southern districts for the last few months. “We had carried 12 goods train loads of tractors in 2019-20 and made a revenue of Rs. 2.33 crore. This year, the revenue has gone up to Rs. 11.78 crore after 61 rakes were used to transport tractors till date,” he said.

01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Core sector output shrinks 2.6% in Nov.||Output from India’s eight core sectors hit a three-month low in November, contracting 2.6% in the festive month with coal, fertilizers and electricity the only sectors to record positive growth on a year-on-year basis, suggesting the economy is still not out of the woods. The good news is that the Index of Eight Core Industries was revised upwards for both August and October, based on updated data inputs received by the Office of Economic Adviser in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade that compiles the data. Revised final numbers Core sector output shrank by just 0.9% in October compared to an earlier estimate of 2.5% contraction. The index had contracted 0.1% in September, while revised final numbers for August reflect a 6.9% contraction compared to the original estimate of a far sharper 8.5% contraction. Electricity output rose for the third month in a row, albeit at a slower pace of 2.2%, while coal production rose year-on-year for the fourth month in a row at 2.9%. Fertilizer production continued to grow, rising 1.6% in November. Fertilizer remains the only sector to have recorded growth in the first eight months of 2020-21, growing 3.8% between April and November 2020-21. On a cumulative basis from April to November, the eight sectors’ index has declined 11.4% from the same period a year ago. These sectors account for around 40% of the Index of Industrial Production or IIP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/at-3-month-low-core-sector-output-shrinks-26-in-nov/article33467559.ece
01 January 2021||Bengaluru,||After over nine months, schools and PU colleges reopen today||As schools and pre-university colleges in Karnataka are all set to reopen on Friday after a span of nine-and-a-half months, several teachers and non-teaching staff may not be able to attend classes as they are not willing to get tested for COVID-19. According to the Department of Public Instruction (DPI), all teachers and non-teaching staff have to mandatorily get tested for COVID-19 and can attend classes only after they get a negative report for the RT-PCR test. On Friday, classes 10 and 12 will be held. The Vidyagama programme, which was stalled in October, will also be restarted for students of classes 6 to 9. D. Shashi Kumar, State general secretary of the Associate Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said many teachers are reluctant to undergo COVID-19 tests fearing consequences. “In many other schools, the staff have taken the COVID-19 test, but they are waiting for results and will not be able to attend classes if their results do not come by Friday,” he said. Based on the response to these classes, the State government will take a call on whether other classes can be reopened on January 15. Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar appealed to parents to send their wards to school without any fear. “Along with academics of children, their health is also very important. So parents also should keep an eye on the health of their wards and avoid sending them if there are any symptoms,” he said, urging parents to watch out for symptoms such as cold, cough or fever in their children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/after-over-nine-months-schools-and-pu-colleges-reopen-today/article33467868.ece

Chandrababu Naidu and Telangana Congress leader Revanth Reddy as the key persons who offered to give money to MLA Elvis Stephenson to cast his vote in favour of Vem Narender Reddy in the MLC election held in 2015. The Enforcement Directorate recorded his statement on December 28, 2020. In a signed statement, Mr. Mathaiah, an independent pastor, reportedly said that he was told by R. Jimmy Babu, a TDP leader, that Mr. Naidu and Mr. Revanth Reddy wanted to have a confidential meeting with him on June 1, 2015, and later, he met both of them in a room behind the stage, where Mr. Revanth Reddy, in the presence of Mr. Naidu, asked him to convince Mr. Stephenson to cast his vote in favour of Mr. Narendra Reddy in the Council election. Mr. Revanth Reddy also told him that if Stevenson cast his vote in favour of Mr. Narender Reddy, he would be paid Rs. 5 crore, and if he abstains from voting, he would be paid Rs. 3 crore, he claimed. When he conveyed the offer to Mr. Stevenson, the latter laughed it off. Later, he also met S. Anthony to convince Stevenson, he said. Later, an ACB trap was laid in which Mr. Revanth Reddy was seen offering Rs. 50 lakh to Mr. Stevenson. Harry Sebastian and Uday Simha were also seen in the video. An audio tape in which the former Chief Minister was found speaking to Mr. Stevenson was also leaked to the media.

01 January 2021||MANGALURU,||Belthangady Police arrest three in sedition case||The Belthangady Police on Thursday arrested three persons in connection with a case of sedition registered against 15 activists of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) for shouting pro-Pakistan slogans outside the counting centre in Ujire on Wednesday. The police gave the names of the arrested persons as Mohammed Harshad (22), Dawood (36) and Isaq (28), all residents of Pilichandi Kallu Kuvettu near Belthangady. A 54-second video clip showing a group of people carrying flags of SDPI and raising pro-Pakistan slogans went viral in the social media on Wednesday afternoon. The slogans in support of Pakistan were heard amid the counting centre authorities making announcements regarding counting of votes related to Mundaje Gram Panchayat in Belthangady taluk. Later, a case was registered in this connection under Sections 124 (A) (sedition) and 143 (unlawful assembly) of Indian Penal Code. In a statement here on Thursday, the Belthangady Police said that the video clip has been subjected to technical examination. The police secured two videos of the incident which were captured on mobile phones and examined them. Based on this examination and other evidence that were gathered, the police arrested three persons. Unacceptable, says MP Asking the State government to take tough action against those involved in the incident, Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel said on Thursday that it is unacceptable for activists of a registered party to raise anti-national slogans. “Any celebration of party activists wining an election should be in a controlled manner. Raising anti-national slogans during such celebration is unpardonable,” he said at a press conference. Mr. Kateel said instead of legally questioning the arrest of Campus Front of India leader Rauf Sherif, CFI activists made an attempt to picket his office in the city recently.SDPI is trying to instigate communal unrest in the State, Mr. Kateel added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/belthangady-police-arrest-three-in-sedition-case/article33468261.ece
01 January 2021||MADURAI,||Loan pact for establishment of AIIMS likely in March 2021||The loan agreement between the Government of India and the Government of Japan for sanctioning funds from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the construction of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Madurai is likely to be signed in March 2021, reveals a Right to Information (RTI) Act reply from the Department of Health and Family Welfare. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for AIIMS at Thoppur here in January 2019. The project was scheduled to be completed in 45 months since the commencement of construction works. A preparatory survey was conducted by JICA officials at the site in February 2020. The RTI reply, obtained by R. Pandiaraja, an activist, said that meetings were held between JICA officials in India and their colleagues in Japan. The last meeting was held on December 24, 2020, the reply added. “This project was not showing much progress and finally there is some positive news regarding the signing of the loan agreement with JICA,” said Mr. Pandiaraja. JICA would provide 85% of the total cost of establishment of new AIIMS, which was around Rs. 2,000 crore, said the RTI reply. However, classes at AIIMS would commence only when the buildings were ready, it said. For the question whether temporary buildings were identified to commence admissions at AIIMS, the reply said that no temporary buildings were identified. Madurai Member of Parliament Su. Venkatesan said that the main problem was that no special officer was appointed by the State government to oversee the operations of AIIMS in Madurai. He also said that the announcement for setting up AIIMS at Jammu was made at the same time as that of Madurai AIIMS. “While admissions for medical courses commenced this year for Jammu AIIMS, the Tamil Nadu government has taken no steps to commence admissions for AIIMS in Madurai. It has to identify a temporary building and a 300-bed hospital to commence admissions for AIIMS here,” Mr. Venkatesan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/loan-pact-for-establishment-of-aiims-likely-in-march/article33467588.ece

Licensed premises open Licensed premises such as restaurants, bars and clubs will not be counted as “public places”, according to the order. Also, there will be no restriction on inter-State and intra-State movement of persons and goods during the curfew period. The decision has been taken considering the threat posed by the mutant strain of the COVID-19 virus, first reported in the U.K. A Delhi government official said the idea is to prevent people from gathering at locations such as India Gate or at the roadside to celebrate New Year. “All District Magistrates of Delhi and their counterpart District Deputy Commissioners of Police and all authorities concerned shall ensure strict compliance of this order and shall adequately inform and sensitise the field functionaries about these instructions for strict compliance, in letter and spirit,” the order further said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-imposes-two-night-curfew/article33467914.ece
01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘New Year will begin only after govt. repeals all three farm laws’||For Jaipal Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Gurdaspur district, ushering in the New Year is a faraway dream. The 25-year-old, who has been camping at the Singhu border for over a month now, said his New Year will begin once the Centre accepts the farmers’ core demand of repealing the three farm laws. “Our New Year will begin only when all this ends. Once the government takes back the three laws, we will be able to celebrate properly. Legal guarantee for a minimum support price is the most substantial one,” said Mr. Singh, a BSc (Agriculture) graduate. Scores of farmers at the protest site asserted that the-re was “nothing to celebrate” at the moment even as the “challenging” year came to a close. “We are used to celebrating New Year’s Eve with our families. We have barely been able to see them all of December. There are 7-8 lakh people crying on the streets. How can we celebrate at such a juncture?” said Sukhpreet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Bathinda district.  Candlelight march Bereft of family, Gurpreet Singh has decided to look for a silver lining in celebrating with the nation this time round. The student from Tarn Taran district in Punjab plans to join a candlelight march on January 1. Nirmal Agni, a volunteer with the Working People’s Charter, said a call had been given for women, transgenders and those from the informal sector to join the protest and ring in the New Year. “Considering the manner in which this government handles issues, this is probably the first time some group has been able to stop them. If we are successful, then we will be able to win fights for other categories as well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/new-year-will-begin-only-after-govt-repeals-all-three-farm-laws/article33467909.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Explore night curfew imposition, HC tells State government||The Telangana High Court on Thursday directed the State government to explore the possibilities of imposing night curfew in the State to check further spread of COVID-19 strain. Hearing a batch of PIL pleas on COVID-19 related issues, a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said amidst reports of new coronavirus strain spreading, the State government had to take proactive steps like some States which brought night curfew into force. The bench expressed dissatisfaction over the government permitting liquor shops to remain till midnight on the eve of New Year. One one hand the government cautions all those who participated in GHMC elections to get quarantined and on the other decides to keep pubs, bars and wine shops open till midnight, the bench remarked. Referring to reports that the new strain was spreading much faster, the government’s action would only aggravate the situation and make the State a hotspot of coronavirus, the bench said. Stating that newspaper reports said nearly 279 passengers who had come from England to Hyderabad could not be traced so far, the bench noted that those passengers did not behave like socially responsible citizens. Cases under Section 279 of Indian Penal Code should be registered against such persons to deter others from doing so. Explaining measures taken by the government, Public Health director in-charge G. Srinivasa Rao informed the court that appeals were made to the people to keep off from New Year celebrations. The bench felt that imposition of night curfew like in Rajasthan and not permitting movement of more than four persons together would give better results. It recalled that on an average 3,100 positive cases per day used to be reported when coronavirus was at its peak. Eventually, that had come down to 500 per day after the government imposed restrictions following court directions. The bench gave exemption from personal appearance to Mr. Rao who said he would not be able to appear during next hearing since the government was planning dry runs and other arrangements for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The bench directed Advocate General B.S. Prasad to file a detailed report by January 20, 2021 about the government’s measures relating to tackling COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/explore-night-curfew-imposition-telangana-hc-tells-state-govt/article33467697.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||PRC report submitted to State government||The first Pay Revision Commission of Telangana submitted its report to the government on Thursday evening. The commission chairman C.R. Biswal and a member Mohammed Ali Rafath submitted the report to Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar who is also the chairman of an official committee announced by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday to negotiate with employees’ unions on salary hike for over nine lakh State government staff. The committee member K. Ramakrishna Rao was also present. The commission was constituted in May 2018 with the mandate to submit its recommendations in three months. However, the government repeatedly extended the deadline with the latest one expiring on Thursday. The report was submitted in the background of the Chief Minister’s announcement to revise salaries and enhance age of retirement of staff by the third week of January. Mr. Rao asked the official committee to negotiate with employees unions on January 6 and 7. Mr. Rao himself had a meeting with the unions on Thursday. He assured to take a decision on PRC shortly. Union leaders told media persons later that Mr. Rao also promised to complete promotions in all departments before month end.

01 January 2021||Kolkata,||Trinamool lost faith in its own MLAs: Left, Congress||Alleging that the Trinamool Congress government has lost faith in its own elected MLAs, Leader of the Left Front Legislature Party in the Assembly Sujan Chakraborty on Thursday questioned why the government was shying from convening the Assembly session when it was business-as-usual in West Bengal amidst the pandemic. “We have not asked for a trust vote as the Assembly is not in session, but we are sure that the Trinamool government has lost the trust of its MLAs,” Mr. Chakraborty said. The Left parties and the Congress have been demanding that the West Bengal government convene a session of the Assembly and adopt a resolution nullifying the farm Bills passed by the Centre. On Thursday, Mr. Chakraborty, along with Leader of the Opposition and Congress MLA Abdul Mannan wrote another letter to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee urging her to convene an Assembly session. Mr. Mannan also spoke in the same vein, saying that the people of the State were unsure of the situation after several MLAs of the Trinamool joined the BJP. Along with former minister and Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari, over half a dozen MLAs from the State’s ruling party have joined the BJP in the last few months. Political observers, however, say that the Trinamool enjoys support of majority of the MLAs. Of the 294 MLAs, the Trinamool has support of over 200 despite the defections. Among other issues, the Left and Congress leaders demanded discussions on “regular interference” in the affairs of the State by the Centre and the worsening of ties between Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and the State government. BJP’s charge The BJP leadership said that by demanding an Assembly session in the midst of the pandemic and daring the Trinamool to prove its strength in the House, the Left and the Congress were trying to give oxygen to the State’s ruling party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/trinamool-lost-faith-in-its-own-mlas-left-congress/article33467799.ece
01 January 2021||Pune,||Denied nod, ex-judge Kolse-Patil claims he will hold ‘Elgaar Parishad’ on Jan. 30||With the Pune police denying permission to hold another ‘Elgaar Parishad’ on December 31, retired Bombay High Court judge B. G. Kolse-Patil — who was among the chief organisers of the original and controversial ‘Elgaar Parishad’ held in December 2017 — has announced his resolve to hold the event on January 30, 2021, on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary. Stating that he would take to the streets if permission was denied for the January 30 event, Mr. Kolse-Patil hit out at the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, accusing it of directing the police to allegedly keep a watch over him during his meetings in the city. A vocal critic of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Home Minister Amit Shah, Mr. Kolse-Patil nevertheless said that the MVA, which claimed to be ‘progressive’, had withdrawn the security that had been given to him by the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP regime in Maharashtra. “While we had been provided security after the 2017 ‘Elgaar Parishad’ by the then Fadnavis government, it was withdrawn after the MVA came to power. It only proves that the parties in the present government, even if they stake claim to the ‘progressive’ tag, are no different from their predecessors,” he said, claiming that he had been arrested no less than three times in the past when the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party government ruled the State between 1999 and 2014. Claiming that the objective of holding a new edition of the ‘Elgaar Parishad’ was to steer politics away from divisive issues like religion and caste, and to instead focus on pressing matters like food security, health and education, Mr. Kolse-Patil said January 30 was so chosen to coincide with Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary and deceased Ambedkarite scholar Rohith Vemula’s birth anniversary. “Come what may, we will be holding the event on January 30…we had wanted to hold it earlier on December 31 to raise awareness of how vital issues were being sidelined by governments. However, those with a ‘brahminical’ disposition of mind have tried to defame the ‘Elgaar Parishad’,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/denied-nod-ex-judge-kolse-patil-claims-he-will-hold-elgaar-parishad-on-jan-30/article33468284.ece

At present, voice calls to rival networks are charged an interconnect usage charge (IUC). The IUC of 6 paise per minute was to make up for the cost incurred by the rival network for completing the call. So despite Jio charging its users for only data usage and keeping voice calls free, 6 paise had to be paid to rivals such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea whenever its users made a call to those networks. The IUC regime, as per the sector regulator Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), comes to an end on January 1, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jio-calls-to-all-networks-free-from-today/article33467554.ece

This was because Wednesday’s High Court order by Justices Rakesh Kumar and D.

01 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||A night of poetry and contemplation||“ Ib toh maan ja, Modi (Modi, please yield [to our demands] now).” The lilt in the voice of 90-year-old Hari Singh from Shamli brought cheer to a chilling New Year Eve on the Ghazipur border and the Meerut-Delhi Expressway where hundreds of farmers have been sitting for more than a month. “Where is the chill? I am feeling the warmth that I have never experienced before. It is a festival like no other as it has united farmers across the spectrum,” said Mr. Singh, who had attended many a protest with Mahendra Singh Tikait, the founder of Bhartiya Kisan Union, including the historic protest at the Boat Club in 1988. He was right for a few metres away Sita Singh of All India Kisan Khet Mazdoor Sangthan was reciting poet Balli Singh Cheema’s popular poem, “ Le mashalen chal pade hain mere gaon ke log, ab andhera jeet lenge mere gaon ke log .” (The people of my village have begun the march with torches, the people of my village will win over the darkness.) There was poetry in the air. A farmer was trying his hand at homonyms from the stage as he was putting the politicans on notice. “ Jo humko halke main lega woh apne halke main nahin ja payega. (Those who would take us lightly would not be able to go into their constituencies.) Beyond the rhetoric of “Jo asal beej hai, woh yahan se nahin hilega” (the true sons of the soil won’t budge) in response to the government’s attempts to reach out to farmers in Western Uttar Pradesh, farmers had started discussing the what ifs. “The government is playing different tricks to break us. Policemen are being sent to villages to stop farmers from joining the protest. Those who have nothing to do with farming are being propped up as farmers. Here attempts are being made to malign the image of our leaders. They want to tire us out,” said Prashant Pawar from Muzaffarnagar. “The two demands that have been accepted could not digress us from our core demands of legalisation on MSP and repealing the three unjust farm laws,” he said. A realisation was dawning that if the government didn’t yield, the anguish had to be translated into votes. There were discussions that for how long the game of one-upmanship among the khaps of Western Uttar Pradesh could be buried under the newfound unity. “Our grandfather used to say that diya bati (the symbol of Bhartiya Jan Sangh) should not enter the village as it was a party of merchants. We voted for the BJP because of its nationalist approach. Now we are realising our mistake,” said Hemant Chaudhary, a student of engineering from Khurja in Bulandshahr district. On a nearby trolley, one could see a poster asking to boycott Ambani and his products. “But, by far there is not alternative. No political party protested in Parliament. No MP or MLA resigned in protest against the farm laws and none could be seen here” said Kushal Pal Singh from Malenda in Shamli district. “Agar Modi hi maan le, toh woh kya bura hai” (If Modi accepts our demand, he is not bad), chipped in Brijpal Singh from Dabathwa village in Meerut. ‘It’s like sewa for us’ Meanwhile, young Baldev Singh from Bijnor was sweeping the floor in front of the makeshift stage on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. “It is like sewa for us. The place is no less than a gurdwara,” he said, as hundreds of peasants started collecting to pay tribute to 40 farmers who lost their lives during protests with candles and mobile lights to flash in the mist that had covered the expressway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-night-of-poetry-and-contemplation/article33468156.ece
01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Only oral assurances from govt.: farmers||Despite reaching an agreement on exempting farmers from the penal provisions of stubble burning under an ordinance on air quality in the Capital, the Centre does not plan to take action until all other issues with protesting farmers groups are also resolved. Asked about the timeline to amend the ordinance, Agriculture Ministry officials noted that only an “in-principle” agreement has been reached during Wednesday’s negotiations with protesting farmer leaders. “Since the talks are still going on, once everything is finalised, then the timeline, etc, may come up for discussion. It was an in-principle decision that two of their demands were acceptable to the government,” a senior Agriculture Ministry official told The Hindu . “The modalities and timeline will be as per the final agreement. Once everything gets finalised, only then we will do it.” Farmer leaders said government action on the agreements already made would help to boost confidence for the talks ahead. However, they also emphasised that these were minor issues in comparison to the unresolved demands to repeal three contentious farm reform laws and provide a legal guarantee for MSP. ‘Verbal commitment’ “There was only a verbal commitment from the government. No written agreement was given to us. But they can easily take action on the parali [stubble burning] issue, and direct the Pollution Board to make changes to exempt farmers. Let them do it,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union-Tikait, who was part of the farmers’ delegation at the talks. “What they committed, let them do,” said Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, who was also a part of the delegation. “But this is only a peripheral issue. Our major demand is on repeal of the three laws. So actually, there is only 1% advancement, 99% deadlock after yesterday’s [Wednesday] talks. It is not 50% progress as the [Agriculture Minister] claimed.” The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella front representing all protesting groups, said no concrete solutions had been reached on the main issues. “However, the assurance of withdrawal of two ordinances is a major victory as this decision protects the country’s federal structure and prevents privatisation,” it said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-oral-assurances-from-govt-farmers/article33467519.ece
01 January 2021||New Delhi,||Nationwide vaccine dry run tomorrow||A dry run will be conducted by all the State governments and Union Territory administrations on January 2 (Saturday) with the objective of preparing for the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccine across the country, the Union Health Ministry said on Thursday. “The activity is proposed to be conducted in all State capitals in at least three session sites; some States will also include districts that are situated in difficult terrain/have poor logistical support; Maharashtra and Kerala are likely to schedule the dry run in major cities other than their capitals,” the Ministry noted. High-level meeting Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Thursday chaired a high-level meeting to review the preparedness at session sites and noted that the objective of the dry run for COVID-19 vaccine introduction was to assess operational feasibility in the use of Co-WIN application in field environment, to test the linkages between planning and implementation and to identify the challenges and guide way forward prior to actual implementation. “This is also expected to give confidence to programme managers at various levels,” he said. The Ministry said the planning for the vaccine introduction would follow the operational guidelines issued by the Ministry on December 20. For each of the three session sites, the medical officer in-charge will identify 25 test beneficiaries (healthcare workers). “The States/UTs have been asked to ensure that the data of these beneficiaries is uploaded in Co-WIN. These beneficiaries will also be available at the session site for the dry run. The States and UTs shall prepare the facilities and users to be created on Co-WIN application, including uploading the data of Health Care Worker (HCW) beneficiaries,” added the Ministry. Logistic support It added that the States/UTs had been asked to ensure physical verification of all proposed sites for adequacy of space, logistical arrangements, Internet connectivity, electricity and safety. They have also been asked to prepare at least three model session sites in each State (at State capital) for demonstration. “An important focus of the dry run will be on management of any possible adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The mock drill will include concurrent monitoring a review at the block and district levels, and preparation of feedback. The State Task Force shall review the feedback and share with the Union Health Ministry,” noted the Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nationwide-vaccine-dry-run-tomorrow/article33467540.ece
01 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala passes resolution for repeal of farm laws||The State Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government repeal the contentious farm laws. The special session witnessed high drama after the lone BJP MLA O. Rajagopal chose not to oppose the resolution, putting the BJP leadership in a fix. Mr. Rajagopal who told mediapersons after the session that he supported the resolution and joined the general consensus in a ''democratic spirit'' subsequently issued a clarification stating that he was not opposed to the farm laws or the Central government. He maintained that he opposed the resolution in the Assembly. The former Union Minister blamed Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan for procedural lapses during the voting. The United Democratic Front (UDF) supported the resolution, but criticised it for not being sharp enough against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. UDF flays govt. The UDF was also critical of the delay in enacting a State-level law to counter the Central laws. The resolution, presented by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, called for prompt measures to repeal the ''controversial laws.'' The laws lacked the teeth to protect the interests of farmers, it noted. By enacting the Bills and shrugging off responsibility to ensure fair prices to farmers, the Centre had paved the way for corporates to monopolise the trade in agricultural produce. The withdrawal of the government from procurement would imperil food security and food distribution. It would increase the chances of blackmarketeering and hoarding, the resolution said, adding that the laws could have a serious impact on Kerala. Moreover, agriculture is a State subject under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. As a matter that has serious ramifications for the States, the Bills should have been discussed in a meeting of the inter-State council. That the Bills were passed in haste without even referring them to the standing committee of Parliament was a serious matter, the resolution noted. Responding to the Opposition's demand for a State-level legislation, Mr. Vijayan said the matter was under examination. The special session was scheduled for December 23 but was put off after Governor Arif Mohammed Khan turned down the Cabinet recommendation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-passes-resolution-for-repeal-of-farm-laws/article33467505.ece

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Pakistan’s theatrics at the UN pose no challenge to India’||Counter-terror cooperation and United Nations reform are at the top of the agenda, says India’s Permanent Representative at the UN, T.S. Tirumurti ,  in a written interview as India takes its seat for the next two years at the UN Security Council, its eighth stint as a non-permanent representative from Friday.  As a member of the UNSC beginning January 1, what will India’s first intervention be? The Security Council, being the primary organ responsible for peace and security, is theoretically supposed to work round the clock. So, in a way, the clock starts ticking after midnight of December 31. That said, the Tunisian Presidency of the Security Council has planned for two High-Level events in the first two weeks — one on Peace and Security in Fragile Contexts and the other on International Cooperation in Combating Terrorism, where we expect to participate at a high level. Would India use the UNSC tenure to push for the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism? What kind of resolutions do you hope to see the UN adopting on the issue of countering terrorism, and in the application of the 1267 committee on ISIL/Al Qaeda? Counter-terrorism is a major priority area for India when we are on the Security Council. As for the 1267 Sanctions Committee on ISIL (Da’esh), it is important that its decisions are taken in an impartial and apolitical manner and those that refuse to implement its decisions are held accountable. We should guard against attempts by certain member states to politicise the work of the 1267 Committee thereby, again, diluting our fight against terrorism. The inability of the United Nations to agree on a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) remains one of the glaring shortcomings in the international legislative framework which could have boosted enforcement efforts to destroy safe havens of terrorists, their financial flows and their support networks. Could tensions between India and China at the LAC at present spill over into UNSC as well? Bilateral issues are best handled bilaterally. As far as we are concerned, we are entering the Security Council with a positive and progressive agenda. We look forward to working constructively with all members and we do hope that we can do so with all members in a similar spirit of constructive cooperation. In the past year, the UN Secretary General and UN agencies have expressed concern over a number of India’s internal matters such as Jammu & Kashmir, Citizenship Amendment Act, the Hathras rape case, restrictions on NGOs, etc. Will India’s position at the UNSC curb such activism from UN agencies or will there be a greater spotlight on India? These issues concern India’s internal affairs. The officials who have made comments on these matters were obviously overstepping their mandates. However, we have never hesitated to explain our position on all such issues in detail when questioned since we are dispelling ill-informed pronouncements, motivated or otherwise. We sincerely hope that irrespective of whether we are in the Security Council or not, these UN agencies restrain themselves and deal only with those matters which are within their mandate. Pakistan has also forwarded a “dossier” of allegations against India on the issue of terrorism in the run up to the UNSC term. How much of a challenge are such actions by Pakistan? No country or international organisation would humour anyone inciting terrorism and encouraging separatism within UN member states under whatever justification. The laughable attempt of Pakistan submitting a “dossier”, is yet another farce played out on the international community. A delegation that is universally acknowledged as the epicentre of global terror and refuses to take any action against the terror factories that it continues to churn out has absolutely no credibility. There are, for obvious reasons, no takers in the international community for what is obviously another one of its anti-India propaganda exercises. As far as India is concerned, such theatrics do not pose any challenge. Can UNSC reform, that India has called for, be achieved during India’s two-year tenure at the UNSC? The reality is that, while the overwhelming majority of UN member states firmly support the comprehensive reforms of the Security Council, a handful of status-quoists have consistently opposed any reform. Of course, the reform of the Security Council is not driven by the Security Council but through the so-called Intergovernmental Negotiation (IGN) process under the General Assembly. We are determined to work towards immediate and time-bound text-based negotiations. India’s credentials are known to all. However, our two years in the Council will be one more opportunity to demonstrate to the global community how important it is for the Security Council to be more representative and reflective of contemporary realities. If there is one single outcome/resolution that you hope more than others will be achieved by the end of India’s UNSC tenure in 2022, what would that be? While questions like these don’t have easy answers, if there is a single objective which I would like to achieve by 2022 – it is to show the world the importance of “reformed multilateralism” and inevitably the important place that India enjoys in that construct for promoting international peace and security.  There no takers in the international community for what is obviously an anti-India propaganda exercise||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pakistans-theatrics-at-the-un-pose-no-challenge-to-india/article33467527.ece
01 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Will complete my term: Yediyurappa||Flexing political muscles, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday ruled out any possibility of a change in leadership and asserted that he would complete his term in the top post. Addressing a press conference on the New Year’ Eve, Mr. Yediyurappa said there was no doubt about him continuing as the Chief Minister till the next elections to the State Legislative Assembly. “BJP national general secretary in charge of Karnataka Arun Singh too has already clarified that I am continuing as the Chief Minister and there is no change in the leadership,” he said. “There is no doubt among legislators. There is no doubt among the public about my continuity in the office. But only the media is having a doubt on me continuing as Chief Minister,” Mr. Yediyurappa remarked, and asked mediapersons to stop speculating about leadership change. Asked about some legislators’ comments about the possibility of a leadership change, the Chief Minister said a couple of MLAs have expressed their views. He would solve grievances of the legislators by holding divisional-level meetings, Mr. Yediyurappa said. Revenue shortage On the financial difficulties in the State owing to COVID-19, the Chief Minister said the State was likely to face financial constraints in the coming fiscal year too. The State is expected to face a revenue shortage of Rs. 30,000 crore in 2020–21, the Chief Minister, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said. Mr. Yediyurappa said the year 2020 was an acid test for the government with the onslaught of the pandemic and floods. “Despite the crisis, we will do our best to grant funds for priority sectors and major programmes announced in the State Budget 2020-21,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-complete-my-term-yediyurappa/article33467494.ece
01 January 2021||Srinagar,||Families raise questions on Srinagar encounter||Wednesday’s operation resulting in the death of three militants in the Lawaypora area here by the Army’s 2 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) has come under the scanner after the families of the dead men said they were innocent. Police sources said the operation launched in an abandoned three-storey building was carried out on the basis of intelligence generated by the human network of Rashtriya Rifles. The intelligence inputs were shared with the police only after the operation resulted in the trapping of the three militants. Just over a month ago, The Resistance Front (TRF), a militant outfit, had released a video showing its attackers killing two soldiers of the 2 Rashtriya Rifles near the same encounter site and then escaping without any resistance from the unit. Police sources had said the three trapped militants were carrying one AK-47 rifle and two pistols “but engaged the Army and the police for more than 17 hours and remained holed up the whole night, while returning fire of the security forces”. The police said none of the slain militants was “categorised as an active militant” or “declared missing”, “but two were working as overground workers of the militants”. On the police statement that the trapped militants were offered the option of surrender, the families said they were not approached by the police to join in appealing for surrender, as is the policy of the security forces in most cases. The mother of one of the alleged militants, Zubair Ahmed Lone on Thursday said her son was “ never under the radar of security forces”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/families-raise-questions-on-srinagar-encounter/article33467517.ece
01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Young farmers break barricades at Shahjahanpur||Some young farmers have broken through the police barricades at the Rajasthan-Haryana border and are moving on the road towards Delhi. The Haryana Police attempted to stop them, using water cannons and tear gas, while protest leaders say they appealed to them not to break the barricades. Thousands of farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have been protesting on the Jaipur-Delhi highway since December 13, when police prevented them from heading further towards the capital to join the ‘Dilli Chalo’ agitation against three contentious farm reform laws. About 25 tractors broke the barricades at Shahjahanpur on Thursday, according to Rajesh Chechi, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Bawal. The police used water cannons and tear gas to try and stop them, but there was no lathicharge, he said.  Next barricade The next barricade was 16 km away on the Jaipur-Delhi highway, and the police would attempt to halt them there, he added. “There were about 12-15 tractor trolleys with a group of youth from Ganganagar who broke the barricades. They got impatient and said they were going to Delhi,” said Ashutosh, spokesperson for the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, one of the platforms leading the protest. “We appealed to them not to break the barricades, as that is the policy of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, that we will sit and protest wherever we are stopped by police, but they were impatient. The police closed the barricades again, and the mass of protesters is still sitting at Shahjahanpur,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/young-farmers-break-barricades-at-shahjahanpur/article33467522.ece
01 January 2021||KOCHI,||Kerala bakery forced to remove ‘halal’ notification||A bakery at Kurumasserry in Parakkadavu block panchayat, near Aluva, has been forced to remove under duress a notification about the availability of ‘halal’ food. The bakery, named ‘Mody’, that had been opened just a month ago was forced to remove the sticker following a notice issued by the Parakkadavu unit of the Hindu Aikya Vedi on December 28. The notice, signed by unit president Arun Aravind and secretary Dhanesh Prabhakran, is widely circulating on social media. The notice observed that the display of the sticker publicising ‘halal’ food amounted to discrimination of food based on religion. This, the notice read, was tantamount to untouchability and hence criminal. ‘Within seven days’ “The sticker notifying ‘halal’ should be removed within 7 days of the receipt of the notice and such discriminatory descriptions should henceforth be avoided from your future advertisements, failing which the Hindu Aikya Vedi will be forced to boycott the shop and launch protests,” the notice read. The bakery removed the notification on receiving the notice. It all started when Mr. Aravind and a few others dropped in at the shop for snacks earlier this week and insisted on non-halal food. They were told that only ‘halal’ food was available. “The panchayat does not have enough members of the community to warrant publicising of ‘halal’ food. Those who need it will ask and there is no need for such a notification,” said Mr. Aravind, who justified the notice saying that there was no threat of violence. Shop’s reasoning A source at the shop said the availability of ‘halal’ food was one of their attractions. The bakery did not cater to local residents alone but passers-by as well, he said. The shop largely sold bakery items and only served Al-fam and Shawarma, two chicken-based snacks, that fall under the category of ‘halal.’ Panchayat’s stance The newly sworn-in Parakkadavu block panchayat president T. V. Pratheesh from the Left Democratic Front said the incident had not been brought to the notice of the panchayat. He said an arbitrary demand for removal of ‘halal’ notification was unacceptable. ‘‘We will look into the matter and intervene, if needed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-bakery-forced-to-remove-halal-notification/article33467508.ece
01 January 2021||MYSURU,||Injured leopardess camera trapped 41 times||The leopardess that was found injured in Chamundi Hills and shifted to Bannerghatta for treatment, has been identified as CML-04 based on camera trap images and it had been sighted 41 times during camera-trapping exercise since the last few years. Senior scientist Sanjay Gubbi of Nature Conservation Foundation said they had carried out camera trapping at Chamundi Hills in 2015, 2017, and 2019. They analysed the pictures of the injured leopardess with the images in their database and it turned out to be CML-04 which had incidentally appeared in their camera-trap images during all the three years. CML-04 was captured 41 times in the camera traps placed near Gowrishankar Nagar at the Chamundi foothills, Hosahundi, Parushanayakanakere, Chamundipura, Rajendravilas Palace, and other locations. Mr. Gubbi said the same leopardess was also camera-trapped in 2017 with a cub of about 3 to 4 months and based on its body size it was estimated to be at least 10 years old. Chamundi Hills is a natural habitat for leopards but their population is dwindling due to unnatural removal and captures that takes place when the Forest Department steps into mollify the local villagers who sight them. Between 2016 and 2019, nearly 50 leopards were caught and relocated following complaints by the villagers. Chamundi Hills is a reserve forest and has a natural prey base to sustain at least six to seven leopards. It is not an island ecosystem and is linked to paddy and sugaracane fields that connect to the adjoining forests and hence, is an ideal habitat for leopards to thrive. But, there are also concerns that the growing urbanisation atop Chamundi Hills with a slew of tourist facilities and parking lot, and rapid growth of residential areas at the bottom will squeeze out the leopards in due course. Mr. Gubbi said Chamundi Hills is now ensconced on three sides by human habitation and residential area and the only link to the hinterland was on the Lalitadrinagar side. But the gap here too is fast closing. Experts say what is happening to leopards at Chamundi Hills is also emblematic of what is happening to their population in other areas. In the recently released report by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Karnataka has the second highest number of leopards in the country at 1,783, after Madhya Pradesh. But this was based on the study of tiger landscapes and did not cover places which are outside the tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuary. Another comprehensive study by Sanjay Gubbi and his team pegged the leopard population in the State at around 2,500.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/injured-leopardess-camera-trapped-41-times/article33467718.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao has ordered constitution of tribunals headed by Collectors in all districts to resolve disputes in Revenue courts. A window on courts which recorded changes to ownership of lands after the judgments were delivered should be opened in Dharani portal of land transactions. The Collectors should also take up survey of border disputes over agricultural lands and fix the borders, he said at a meeting to discuss how best to finetune the functioning of Dharani. Mr. Rao insisted with Collectors to inquire into ‘sethvar’ (land resettlement records), upload the decisions on Dharani and issue passbooks to farmers. Dharani should also be loaded with information about demarcation done between government and private lands where they existed on a single survey number. The details about beneficiaries of private lands should be uploaded on Dharani. Dharani should be enabled to take up registration of lease agreements, lease deeds and exchange deeds of agricultural lands, agreements of sale-cum-General Power of Attorney, land transactions of firms and corporates operating in agricultural lands and registration of lands of NRIs. Mr. Rao asked officials to ensure that assigned lands enjoyed by farmers should be transferred to their legal heirs in the event of death of the former. True copies should be supplied to farmers if they lost their pattadar passbooks. Occupancy certificates should be given to people cultivating Inam lands and the details uploaded on Dharani. An option be created on Dharani specifying reason for failure to book slots for registration of lands.

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Adilabad was dealing with a complaint filed by Shila Ray, wife of the victim Sukumar Ray, and Malathi Ray, Amit Ray and Manish Ray, the victim’s minor children, and Prasant Ray and Susuma Ray, his senior citizen parents. The respondents were officers of the Telangana State Northern Power Distribution Company (TSNPDCL). In the complaint, the victim’s kin stated that on September 15, 2018, while walking to his agricultural field, a high tension line snapped and the victim, caught unawares, came in contact with it. This led to his electrocution, hospitalisation and later, his death. The Chinthamenepalli police station registered a case.  Notice unanswered The complainants stated that they sent a legal notice demanding ex-gratia of Rs. 18 lakh to the TSNPDCL since the victim was the sole breadwinner. However, the notice remained unanswered. For their part, the TSNPDCL officers denied all allegations. They stated that an unknown person was illegally tapping power from the HT line, and routed it to a fence around a land parcel to protect crops from animals. The victim ‘knowingly’ touched the fence, they claimed. ‘Officials unaware’ They also stated that at the time of a field inspection, this illegal tapping was not noticed and that officials were unaware of it. The DCDRC Adilabad president Jabez Samuel and Member V Narasimha Rao took into consideration the evidence placed on record including copies of a first information report, inquest report, and legal notice dated December 1, 2018, as filed by the complainants, and an exhibit filed by the discom. Allowing the complaint in part, the commission directed the TSNPDCL Rs. 5 lakh as ex-gratia and another Rs. 5 lakh as compensation. The commission passed orders that the victim’s wife be given Rs. 4 lakh and cost of complaint of Rs. 1,600. The victim’s daughter is to be given Rs. 2 lakh. His minor sons are to be given Rs. 1.25 lakh each. The victim’s parents are to be given Rs. 75,000 each. The Commission entrusted itself with the responsibility of investing the compensation amount awarded to the victim’s children in a nationalised bank as fixed deposits.  The victim ‘knowingly’ touched the fence.

01 January 2021||New Delhi,||Trinamool youth leader on CBI radar||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday conducted searches on two premises linked to West Bengal Trinamool Youth Congress general secretary Vinay Mishra in connection with a case of alleged smuggling of cattle to Bangladesh, said an agency official. “The searches are being carried out at two places in Kolkata, related to Mr. Mishra,” said the CBI official. In November, the agency arrested Border Security Force (BSF) Commandant Satish Kumar for his alleged role in the case. He was booked along with three traders named Enamul Haque, Anarul Sheikh and Mohammed Golam Mustafa. Haque was earlier arrested by the CBI. After registering the case in September, the CBI searched the premises of the accused persons at 13 locations in Kolkata and Murshidabad in West Bengal, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, Amritsar in Punjab and Raipur in Chhattisgarh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-youth-leader-on-cbi-radar/article33467523.ece

In separate letters to IIM-A authorities, the group of architects and the COA both said a restoration project should be undertaken instead of demolishing and rebuilding the dorms. COA president Habeeb Khan, in identical letters to IIM-A Director Errol D’Souza and IIM-A Governing Council Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, wrote that the first phase of restoration work undertaken by IIM-A was “an exemplary initiative”. He recalled that the IIM-A had initially decided to restore the campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/architects-urge-iim-a-not-to-demolish-dormitories/article33467529.ece
01 January 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan Cong. MLAs flay Governor’s ‘inaction’||The ruling Congress MLAs in Rajasthan will stage protests across the State on January 3 against Governor Kalraj Mishra’s “inaction”, in neither giving his assent to the farm amendment Bills passed by the Assembly nor sending them to the President. The Bills, which had sought to stop the applicability of the Centre’s new agriculture sector laws in the State, were passed on November 2. The demonstrations will also express solidarity with the farmers agitating against the farm legislations. Besides, the Pradesh Congress Committee will run a week-long ‘Kisan Bachao, Desh Bachao’ (save farmers, save the nation) campaign in all villages of the State, starting on January 5, demanding the repeal of the farm laws. The decision for undertaking the campaign was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, presided over by Mr. Gehlot, here on Wednesday night. Mr. Gehlot slammed the Centre for is failure to resolve the farmers’ issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajasthan-cong-mlas-flay-governors-inaction/article33467533.ece
01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccine firms flag ‘recruitment’ challenges||India, along with the world, may be at the cusp of a vaccine but companies which are involved in testing the vaccines have said there have been challenges in recruiting volunteers. On December 22, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech (BB) said it had recruited 13,000 volunteers across the country which was the halfway mark for its target of 26,000. Krishna Mohan, executive director, BB, said in a webinar on Thursday there were ‘challenges’ in recruitment. This was partly because, he said, several people were under the impression that a vaccine would be soon available and so didn’t see a point in participating in a trial, where there was only a 50% chance of getting the actual vaccine. The phase-3 trials under way involve people at various hospitals getting a dummy shot or a real shot three-four weeks apart in so-called double blinded placebo trials. “There were press releases that said a vaccine would be available by Dec 15 or 26 and that has hurt us badly in terms of recruitment. Because there is an overlap between clinical trials and EUA this has posed a challenge in terms of recruitment,” said Mr. Mohan. V.G. Somani, Drug Controller General of India, also a participant at the webinar, agreed that there would be challenges in recruitment but said he didn’t foresee such a problem immediately. “For the next 3-4 months we don’t see a problem, but going ahead [when the vaccine is more widely available] there could be problems in recruitment.” Mr. Mohan said his company had additional challenges because their recruitment norms required that a certain percentage of volunteers be over 50. “In spite of these challenges, we have had volunteers who were aged 97, 81, 91 come in and be part of the trial.”   In spite of these challenges, we have had volunteers who were aged 97, 81, 91 come in and be part of the trial Krishna Mohan Executive Director, Bharat Biotech||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-firms-flag-recruitment-challenges/article33467537.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Vaccine set for approval, says Drug Controller||Mr. Modi was speaking after laying the foundation stone of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Rajkot through video conferencing. Stating that India is getting ready to run the world’s largest vaccination programme, the Prime Minister said India has turned into the nerve centre of global health. He also cautioned against rumours about COVID vaccination. “Different people for their personal gains or due to irresponsible behaviour spread various rumours. Maybe rumours will be spread when vaccination begins, some have already begun,” he said. “I appeal to the people of the country that the fight against COVID-19 is the one against an unknown enemy,” Mr. Modi said. “Be careful about such rumours and as responsible citizens refrain from forwarding messages on social media without checking,” Mr. Modi said. On Friday, the DCGI’s subject expert committee, which is perusing applications by companies developing vaccines in India, is expected to review applications by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech (BB) for emergency use authorisation. Under this, companies are allowed to market the vaccine even if they haven’t furnished all the evidence required to establish the product’s safety and efficacy. The SII has partnered with AstraZeneca to market the Oxford vaccine, approved by health authorities in the United Kingdom on Wednesday. Both SII and BB are testing the vaccine in ongoing phases-3 trials in India, the results of which have not been publicised yet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-set-for-approval-says-drug-controller/article33467489.ece

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Core sector output shrinks 2.6% in Nov.||Coal production rose year-on-year for the fourth month in a row at 2.9%. Fertilizer production continued to grow, rising 1.6% in November. Fertilizer remains the only sector to have recorded growth in the first eight months of 2020-21, growing 3.8% between April and November 2020-21. On a cumulative basis from April to November, the eight sectors’ index has declined 11.4% from the same period a year ago. These sectors account for around 40% of the Index of Industrial Production or IIP. Refinery products, natural gas and crude oil output continued to decline, falling 4.8%, 9.3% and 4.9%, respectively. A fresh cause of concern, however, emerged in the steel and cement sectors, where output collapsed by 4.4% and 7.1%, respectively, in November, after a fledgling recovery. “Steel, after recording three consecutive months of positive growth, and cement, after recording a positive growth in October 2020, slipped into contraction. This shows that the industrial recovery continues to be uneven and fragile,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings and Research. “Given the performance of eight core sectors in November 2020, we expect the IIP growth to remain weak. Also, it will be interesting to see if the momentum recorded in factory output due to pent up, festive demand during the past two months continues in November 2020,” Mr. Sinha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/core-sector-output-shrinks-26-in-nov/article33467491.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Hyderabad Lit Fest to be held virtual from Jan.22||The 2021 edition of the annual Hyderabad Literary Festival (HLF), which is scheduled to be held from January 22 to 24, will be completely virtual. In December, the Bangalore Literature Festival opted to have authors at the venue and live stream the sessions, and the forthcoming Jaipur Literature Festival 2021 is also poised to be a virtual one. Amitav Ghosh, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Devdutt Pattanaik, Aakash Singh, Devaki Jain, Harsh Mander, Parmesh Shahani, NK Singh and Kobad Ghandy are among the authors who will be participating. The four directors of HLF – professor T. Vijay Kumar, Amita Desai of Goethe Zentrum, Kinnera Murthy of Moving Images film club, and Ajay Gandhi of the public discourse forum Manthan — have all been actively engaging in virtual sessions in their respective streams of work. The HLF hosted several virtual sessions with authors during the pandemic, and hence, moving towards a completely virtual HLF 2021 was a natural progression. Each January, the HLF welcomes visitors to engage with authors and partake in interactive workshops and exhibitions for three days; there’s something for every age group. The vibrancy of a lit fest where one forges new friendships or engages in debates might be tough to replicate online, but the HLF directors are confident that there will be enough to engage the curious mind. The popular segments of HLF such as Stage Talks, Nanha Nukkad for young children, Kavya Dhaara or storytelling, cultural events and art exhibitions will all be held online. The final list of workshops and stage talks is being chalked out and registrations will be open on the HLF website (hydlitfest.org) soon. Workshops will require registration while other sessions will be open to everyone. Expect interactive virtual art exhibitions where you can zoom in and out, and get a walk-through experience. Cultural programmes are likely to be a mix of pre-recorded shows, live streams and a hybrid where someone anchors a recorded show. The virtual edition has made it relatively easier to get delegates on board, since the logistics of travel and accommodation are done away with. Amita cites the example of dancer Aditi Mangaldas who will be participating in a Stage Talk from Germany: “She has been working on a new project and will be interspersing her talk with visual clips.” Amita admits it is a challenge to create a virtual fest that will provide creative and intellectual engagement like a real-time fest, but is eager to see how things go. There will be fewer sessions though, unlike the real-time edition. Anyone who has been to the HLF would be aware of parallel sessions held in different pavilions, adding up to 100 or more in three days. In a digital set-up, the number of sessions will be limited so as to have focused audience and to avoid digital fatigue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hyderabad-lit-fest-to-be-virtual/article33468190.ece
01 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Backed it in democratic spirit, says BJP MLA||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) senior leader O. Rajagopal, MLA, sprang a surprise on Thursday when he chose not to oppose the resolution passed by the State Assembly demanding that the Narendra Modi government repeal the contentious farm laws. After the session, Mr. Rajagopal told reporters here that he supported the resolution and that it was indeed passed unanimously. ‘General consensus’ On his part, he had opted to go along with the general consensus in supporting the resolution, he said. The Opposition, Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), had joined the ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in supporting the resolution presented by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Mr. Rajagopal abstained from the voting and Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan declared that the resolution was passed unanimously. Asked whether he supported the resolution, Mr. Rajagopal replied in the affirmative. He said he had reservations regarding certain points in the resolution, which he pointed out in his speech. Nonetheless, he was in agreement with the substance of the resolution, he said. “I gave my opinion. But that is not consensus. I accept that. Isn't that the democratic spirit,'' he said in reply to questions. He said he did not believe that his stand created a problem for the BJP. “I interpret it as democratic spirit,” he said. In his speech in the Assembly, Mr. Rajagopal said the laws were designed to protect farmers. The laws avoided middlemen and commission agents and enabled farmers to sell their produce wherever they chose to. Those who opposed the laws were against the farmers, Mr. Rajagopal said. He expressed the hope that the discussion in the Assembly would contribute to fruitful discussions for resolving the dispute.  I gave my opinion. But that is not consensus. I accept that.

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Jio calls to all networks will be free from today||Jio, in a statement noted that as per the telecom regulator’s directions, “Bill and Keep regime”' is being implemented from January 1, thereby ending IUC rates for all domestic voice calls. “Honouring its commitment to revert off-net domestic voice-call charges to zero, as soon as IUC charges are abolished, Jio will again make all off-net domestic voice calls free, starting January 1. On-net domestic voice calls have always been free on the Jio network,” it added. Off-net calls refer to calls that terminate in other operators’ networks. The zero-IUC regime was previously slated to come into effect from January 2020, but last year the telecom regulator deferred its implementation till January 1, 2021. The IUC is a charge that is paid by a telco to another operator when its customers make voice calls to subscribers of that network, and these charges stood at 6 paise per minute. “For context, in September 2019, when TRAI extended the timeline for implementation of the Bill & Keep regime beyond January 1, 2020, Jio was left with no option but to start charging its customers for off-net voice calls, at a rate exactly equivalent to the applicable IUC charge,” Jio said. It said that even while doing so, the company had assured its users that this charge would continue only till the time TRAI abolished IUC charges. “Today, Jio has delivered on that promise and made off-net voice calls free again,” the statement said adding that the company stood by its commitment to make the common Indian the beneficiary of advanced technologies like VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution). Jio further said it is committed to lay the foundation of a digital society where everything, everyone, everywhere is connected with the best quality service, at the lowest price globally, and has access to the most advanced digital platforms. “Through technological innovation, Jio will continue to deliver revolutionary products and services to its users, with a customer first approach,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jio-calls-to-all-networks-will-be-free-from-today/article33467510.ece

Mr. Gangwar said a notification to the effect was issued earlier in the day and the process of crediting the amount into the accounts of the subscribers was under way. He said the announcement of 8.5% as the interest rate in March had surprised many, given the pandemic. He said the conditions in 2020 were not favourable. But, he was happy to announce that the decision taken in March was being implemented now. Of the amount, the 8.15% came from debt income and 0.35% from capital gains from the sale of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), he said. The EPFO had proposed in September to make the payment in two instalments of 8.15% and 0.35% after selling its investments in the ETFs. However, after the sale of the investments, it was able to propose crediting the entire 8.5% interest in one go.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/epfo-starts-crediting-85-interest/article33467542.ece
01 January 2021||Belagavi,||No access to CM: Yatnal||In an indication of his displeasure over Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s way of functioning, BJP MLA and former Union Minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal on Thursday urged the Chief Minister to convene a meeting of the BJP legislature party so that legislators could express their problems openly. “We are suffering from several problems such as lack of funds and slow pace of development works. The Chief Minister issued a letter in response to my letter, asking officials to release Rs. 23 crore for Vijayapura city development. But they have not released a single rupee till now. We need to discuss such things with the Chief Minister,” he told presspersons in Vijayapura on Thursday. “But we don’t have proper access to the Chief Minister. Staff at the CM’s home office discourage MLAs from meeting Yediyurappa, saying he is taking rest. When the Chief Minister holds division-level meetings with legislators, it is difficult to speak freely and openly as it is a small group. But if a legislature party meeting is called, then all of us can voice our opinions freely as it is a group of 117 of our own party members,” he said. Replying to a query, he said he had not gone to Bengaluru to meet the Chief Minister in the past six months. “I have not set foot in his office and much less in his home office,” he said. “Since the Chief Minister refused us funds, I have stopped following up the matter with him.” Mr. Yatnal welcomed the prohibition on public New Year celebrations on account of the new strain of the coronavirus. “Anyway, it is not new year as per Indian culture. Ugadi is our new year. This western New Year celebration is only for drinking, eating and merrymaking. That has caused several accidents in the past. I congratulate the Chief Minister on this bold decision,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-access-to-cm-yatnal/article33467492.ece
01 January 2021||Bengaluru,||IPS officers Nimbalkar, Roopa shifted||IPS officers Hemant Nimbalkar and D. Roopa, who have been at loggerheads trading allegations over the Safe City Project tender, have been transferred. According to a State government notification on Thursday, Mr. Nimbalkar, Inspector General of Police and Additional Commissioner of Police (Administration), Bengaluru, has been transferred as Inspector General of Police, Internal Security Division, Bengaluru. Ms. Roopa, Inspector General of Police and Secretary to government, Home Department, has been appointed as Managing Director, Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation Ltd., Bengaluru. As the public spat between the two officers blew into a raging controversy over the last few days, sources in the State government had hinted that their transfer out of their present posts was likely to avoid further controversies and ensure that the Safe City Project tender was not affected due to it. It all began when Mr. Nimbalkar, Additional Commissioner (Administration), BCP, and member secretary of the State-level Apex Committee monitoring the Safe City Project, wrote to the Chief Secretary seeking an inquiry against an IPS officer for trying to procure classified information of a tender much before it was published without authorisation. Mr. Nimbalkar’s letter also alleged the officer impersonated the Home Secretary. The State government instituted a probe into the matter. Ms. Roopa then accepted that she did make a call to the Project Management Consultant (PMC) for the Safe City Project tender, but claimed to be a “whistleblower” who was “studying” the tender file and found “serious irregularities in tender drafting”. Mr. Nimbalkar then held a press conference on Sunday, rebutting the allegations and said attempts were being made to cast aspersions on the tender process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amidst-safe-city-project-controversy-ips-officers-roopa-and-hemant-nimbalkar-transferred/article33467884.ece

Meanwhile, one CRPF jawan was injured and a civilian was killed in attacks in Kashmir on Thursday. “The Pakistan Army’s frustration over its failed infiltration attempts across LoC over the years has been an established fact. However, of late, it seems to have shifted its focus from targeting the Army posts to targeting civilians in forward villages, to compensate for its dwindling abilities,” a Srinagar-based Army spokesman said. The Army said the Pakistan Army had on Wednesday targeted forward villages of Tad, Sudpura and Dhanni in Tangdhar Sector in Kupwara. “The Army also undertook targeted firing on civil habitation and the Dhani Mosque to inflict civil casualties at the time of evening namaz,” the Army said. Unidentified gunmen shot dead a civilian, goldsmith by profession, in the busy market of the Sarai Bala area in Srinagar on Thursday afternoon, while a CRPF jawan was injured in a militant attack in south Kashmir’s Anantnag. The police identified the civilian as Satpal Nischal, owner of the Nischal Jewellers. Preliminary reports suggest Mr. Nischal was fired upon at his shop.

01 January 2021||Bengaluru,||State to conduct second round of sero survey in January||The State is all set to conduct a second round of serological prevalence survey in all the 30 districts as well as eight zones of Bengaluru in mid-January. A serological prevalence survey involves drawing blood samples to detect whether the person was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the past and whether he/she has developed Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to combat the infection. The first round done from September 3 to 16 had shown that 16.4% of the 16,585 people covered under the survey had developed antibodies and 12.7% had an active infection. The survey — that included people who had COVID-19 infection (prior to the survey) and those who had active infection during the survey — found an overall prevalence of 27.3% in the State then. Official sources, who are part of the team that is chalking out protocols for the second survey, told The Hindu that the sample size from each district would be increased to around 1,500 this time. During the first survey, an average of 400 samples from every district was included. “The proposal is to cover over 35,000 people from high, moderate and low-risk categories. The protocols have been chalked out and the survey is expected to begin mid-January,” sources said.  “We had expected that the State would witness a surge after Dasara, Deepavali, bypolls and GP polls as there was rampant violation of COVID-19 protocols. But, the surge did not happen and this could be because a large extent of the population may have already been exposed to the virus. The second sero survey will show if this is true and estimate the existing disease burden,” sources said. The first sero survey had shown that four districts — Dharwad, Gadag, Chickballapur, Bagalkot — and BBMP’s Mahadevapura zone were yet to witness a surge then (September). These districts were found to have the lowest estimated prevalence. The overall prevalence was the highest in Ballari with 43.1% while it was the lowest in Dharwad with 8.7%. “The second round will reveal if there has been a change in the pattern of the disease spread. We can also ascertain whether the districts with low prevalence then have seen the surge subsequently and if there is a need for further interventions to control the spread,” sources said. New strain “In the context of the new mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2, we may also have to consider taking up genome sequencing of random samples that test positive through RT-PCR during the survey. This will help us determine if the new strain is already present in the community. If it is there, we really do not have to worry much,” sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/state-to-conduct-second-round-of-sero-survey-in-january/article33467496.ece
01 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Six held for performing child marriage||Falaknuma police on Thursday arrested six people who allegedly forcibly got a minor girl married to a 57-year-old man. While the police rescued the 16-year-old girl, the ‘groom’ managed to escape and is currently at large. Police said that the girl’s father got married to another woman after the death of her mother and since then she was living with her aunt Hoor Unnissa at Teegalkunta. Conspiracy angle South Zone in-charge DCP Gajarao Bhupal said that a few days ago Unnisaa along with her husband Mir Farhatullah and their son Mir Rahmathullah conspired to get the girl married to a well-off person so that they can get money to clear the debt. They approached the brokers, Mohammed Abdul Rahman and Waseem Khan, for ‘prospective’ alliances, who soon finalised the marriage with Abdul Lateef Paramban from Kerala, he said.

01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Numaish rescheduled||The annual Numaish will not begin on January 1 given the COVID guidelines on public gatherings, and a decision on when it would be organised will be taken after January 31. This announcement was made by Health Minister and All India Industrial Exhibition Society president Eatala Rajender at a press conference on Thursday. Mr. Rajender hinted that there is a possibility that Numaish could be organised in March or April, depending on the situation in the State vis-a-vis the pandemic. “The (Central) government has issued orders restricting public gatherings of over 200 people. The Telangana government is implementing the order. Despite the reduction in cases and low death rate, we are going to implement these orders. The Exhibition Society has decided to abide by this,” Mr. Rajender said. He added that the committee will take a decision on when to formally throw open Numaish to public once the orders, which are in force till January 31, run their course. He clarified that Numaish has only been postponed, which does not mean that it has been cancelled. The Health Minister said that this is the second time that Numaish has been postponed. The first time was in 1949. In the previous years, Numaish used to witness tens of thousands of visitors. The number used to spike significantly on the weekends. Taking questions from the media, Mr. Rajender said that there is no COVID second wave in Telangana. Responding to other questions, he clarified that there is a difference between people converging at restaurants, function halls and Numaish. The Numaish, he said, records footfalls of up to 40,000 visitors, which is much higher than at other places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/numaish-rescheduled/article33468195.ece

01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fewer murders in 2020 compared to 2019: police||The police said the number of murder cases and chain snatching offences have been fewer in 2020 as compared to 2019. Also, more cases were booked against drug peddlers this year. In 2020, the number of murder cases reported was 147, while it was 173 in the previous year. All the 147 murder cases have been solved and the accused have been arrested. Similarly, there has been a substantial reduction in incidents of chain snatching. A total of 246 cases were reported in 2020 against 310 cases in the previous year. After the present Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal took over, the police also launched a special drive against narcotics. A total of 522 cases have been booked and 2,966 kg of contraband has been seized in 2020, compared to 452 cases in the previous year with a seizure of 1,128 kg. Mr. Aggarwal said, “In order to maintain law and order and to control the activities of habitual offenders, the Greater Chennai Police detained 542 anti-social elements under the Goondas Act. A special drive was initiated for the execution of non-bailable warrants.” They got the bail of 123 criminals cancelled to curtail their illegal activities, he said. “Our emphasis has been to provide police service at the doorsteps [of residents] and build a very good rapport with the public We should be serving people in different ways,” said Mr. Aggarwal. The police also registered 938 cases of mobile snatching. A special impetus was given to mobile phone snatching cases. As many as 2,834 phones were recovered and handed over to their rightful owners. Cyber crimes Cyber crimes were given special emphasis and investigation of cyber-related crimes were decentralised by creating special units at the district level. The cyber units registered 87 FIRs and 1,925 CSRs in a period of four months, and successfully restored Rs. 1.56 crore to victims. In addition, they were able to bust 15 call centres involved in job racketeering. The CCB’s cyber crime wing arrested criminals involved in impersonating police officers on social media. Special teams were able to solve the murder of a family of three in Sowcarpet within 36 hours, with the investigation spanning Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. In order to make the police accessible to the public, the video call grievance redressal was introduced during the pandemic. Mr. Aggarwal himself received 996 grievances and 849 petitions have been disposed of. Similarly, the police also organised foot patrolling and accepted complaints from petitioners at patrol vehicles stationed at designated locations. Road accidents Road safety was another major area of concern for the police. Their efforts led to a reduction in fatal accidents from 1,229 in 2019 to 839 in 2020 — an almost 33% decline. The traffic police successfully implemented zero traffic violation junctions in four places to ensure road discipline and make motorists follow traffic rules strictly. Mr. Aggarwal said, “This will be extended to ensure roads are safer and accident free.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fewer-murders-in-2020-compared-to-2019-police/article33468120.ece
01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||An unkind cut for consumers of cooking gas||With liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumers getting just Rs. 24.95 as subsidy per refill this month, many of them are complaining that the drastic cut is hurting them. Customers have been visiting the agencies to find out why the amount was so less, considering that the price of a domestic cylinder in Chennai is Rs. 710. Last December, when a 14.2 kg cylinder was priced at Rs.714, the subsidy amount debited to a customer’s bank account was Rs. 174.72. In April 2019, when a refill was priced at Rs. 722, the subsidy amount borne by the Centre was Rs. 238.27. In May 2020, the cost of a cylinder in the city was Rs. 569 and the subsidy amount dropped to zero. From the next month onwards, the subsidy amount remained between Rs. 25.45 and Rs. 23.95. However, the cost of the cylinder has risen from Rs. 606 to Rs. 710. “People are fighting with our staff since they are used to getting subsidy amounts of above Rs. 100 each time they book. Even the very educated people are asking why the amount is less. We are having a tough time explaining to them that the distributors have nothing to do with cylinder pricing or the subsidies. Whatever the price, our commission remains the same,” said a distributor in the city. G. Murugan, a resident of Alwarpet, said he had just paid Rs. 710 for his cylinder but was dejected at the paltry amount being given as subsidy. “At a time when the economy is yet to see any relief and countless people have lost jobs or are getting only partially paid, the government must consider raising the subsidy amount. That is a small relief that it can give consumers. It very kindly gave free cylinders to the Pradhan Mantri Ujwala Yojana consumers for three months during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown,” he pointed out. The State has 2.38 crore LPG consumers, of which 32.42 lakh are PMUY consumers and only some 32 lakh have given up subsidies voluntarily. Oil industry insiders said the subsidy amount is fixed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the oil companies only charge what they are directed to. And the Ministry always says prices of liquefied petroleum gas and petrol and diesel are connected to the prices of crude oil, they said. No transparency Consumer activist T. Sadagopan said the pricing of LPG was not transparent. “The government gives the retail selling price, the commission of the distributor, with which they have to cover transportation and office charges, rents, salaries and also the 5% GST. They don’t tell you how that price is arrived at. It is the same case with petrol and diesel. The government must understand that cooking gas is a crucial input to running the home, especially during these tough times.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/an-unkind-cut-for-consumers-of-cooking-gas/article33468130.ece
01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||300 roads in Chennai to have smart parking||The Greater Chennai Corporation has planned to increase the number of smart parking slots to 12,000. Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani announced this on social media on Wednesday.  The Corporation is planning to introduce premium smart parking spaces on Khadar Nawaz Khan Road with a fee of Rs. 40 an hour. Other roads such as Anna Nagar Second Avenue, Third Avenue and Fourth Avenue will also get smart parking spaces at Rs. 20 an hour. Smart parking spaces will be increased in Besant Nagar, Purasawalkam, T. Nagar and George Town. At present, there are 3,000 smart parking spaces. Roads in the vicinity of NSC Bose Road will get smart parking spaces shortly. At least 300 of 471 bus route roads in Chennai will get smart parking spaces, the officials said. App in the works The Corporation has implemented the parking management system for improving the ‘On Street’ parking in congested neighbourhoods. “Optimum usage of the available parking space enhances the overall functioning of streets in the city. Fatalities and injuries are likely to be brought down with parking discipline,” said an official. Motorists can book a parking slot through the official GCC Smart Parking mobile app before arriving at the lot. The app navigates the user to the particular parking lot through the inbuilt Google Maps. The parking fees can be paid through various e-payment options facilitated by the app. Number plate recognition cameras would capture the vehicle information and automatically generate e-receipts in the user’s mobile. The project focuses on cashless transaction and IT-enabled system with dedicated mobile app, websites and other hybrid IoT facilities to ensure a friendly smart parking experience. Further, the system will be integrated with multi-level car parking and other off-street parking facilities. There will be separate parking lots earmarked for bicycles, officials said. “A prepaid system is on the cards. The system is not aimed at making profits but only to provide quality parking. The service providers would assist in towing and clamping vehicles which violate parking regulations, in concurrence with the Police Department. A dedicated control room for this purpose is functional at Ripon Buildings with necessary video walls and supervisors to monitor the operations,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/300-roads-in-chennai-to-have-smart-parking/article33468377.ece
01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Steady flow of Krishna water boosts storage in Chennai||The Water Resources Department is building storage in other city reservoirs as the waterbody in Poondi continues to get inflow from its catchment areas and from Krishna water released by Andhra Pradesh. The shutters of Poondi reservoir, which remained open for about a month, were closed on Tuesday evening as the inflow from the catchment areas had decreased. On Wednesday, the reservoir got inflow of 594 cusecs (cubic feet per second) and of this, nearly 70 cusecs were from catchment areas and the remaining from Andhra Pradesh. The five reservoirs, including the newly formed one at Kannankottai Thervoykandigai, are filled to nearly 92% of their combined capacity of 11.75 tmcft. The department is diverting water from Poondi to other reservoirs, including Red Hills and Chembarambakkam, to shore up their storage to full level for city water distribution. Officials said the reservoirs still had space for more water. For instance, the water level in Red Hills reservoir is at 20.5 feet and storage can be built to its full level of 21.2 feet. “We expect Poondi reservoir to get inflow from catchment areas till Pongal. Unlike other reservoirs, the one in Poondi, built across Kosasthalaiyar river, has a large catchment area. It receives water from Andhra Pradesh and also Nandiyar. We plan to use the water for building storage and maintaining city water supply,” said an official. Nearly 6 tmcft of water was discharged from Poondi reservoir between November 27 to Tuesday. However, half of the water was saved by diverting it to other waterbodies and check dams, officials added. The Poondi reservoir has been continuously getting Krishna water since September 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/steady-flow-of-krishna-water-boosts-storage-in-chennai/article33468378.ece
01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vintage Nectar, a lyricist’s 5-year project to redeem and enrich film songs||A five-year project — Vintage Nectar or Naatpadu Theral in Tamil — seeking to enrich the content and quality of Tamil film songs has been unveiled by lyricist Vairamuthu as he felt that the need for songs in films was slowly diminishing. “Among the great artists I know, I joined hands with those I could reach out to. Hundred new songs will be created with the help of 100 composers, 100 singers and 100 directors. This is my dream plan. One could term this a five-year plan for songs,” he said in a statement. He recalled that Naatpadu Theral , a phrase borrowed from Sangam poetry, refers to the honey fermented in a bamboo pipe for years. Elini, the son of Athiyaman, one of the seven philanthropist chieftains, would offer poet Avvaiyar the nectar which would be felt like a sting of scorpion in the tongue. “Even now, some songs in some movies are extraordinary, but in many movies, there’s just an emptiness. Where are the film songs that resounded with Sangam literature and Thirukkural? Where are the movies that sing aloud the devotion of Bhakti literature? Where is the film poetry which enabled socialism and Dravidian emancipation,” he said. Pointing out that though technology was soaring above the skies, the artistic notion is perishing like a wild flower in a forest fire, Mr.Vairamuthu said in many cases the songs seemed like a market for selling sound and mostly an unsatisfactory union of language and music. “There are no lines for those in love to quote; there are no songs to teach children Tamil; there are no lullabies for mothers to croon to their babies.....” he said, explaining the reason behind launching the project. Mr. Vairamuthu, who would pen the lyrics for the project, said the beautiful verses that lend themselves to be memorised would have honey-soaked music and would be rendered in the voices of a chorus of nightingales. He said every song would be recorded visually and he had planned to personally render an introduction for each song and aid the audience’s mind in deeply relishing and experiencing each creation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vintage-nectar-a-lyricists-5-year-project-to-redeem-and-enrich-film-songs/article33468131.ece
01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Teachers’ appeal to parties||With election due in the State, teachers’ associations have started approaching parties with their demands. The Aided College Teachers’ Association has appealed to the parties to address their grievances in their manifestos. The association has demanded the reinstatement of the old pension scheme, withdrawn in 2004. It has sought timely promotions, salary increments and an end to the practice of recalling salary paid while assessing pension needs. All eligible teachers who have been appointed guest lecturers in constituent colleges must be made permanent. They also want the actions initiated against college teachers who participated in the protest launched by JACTTO-GEO to be dropped. The association wanted parties to reject the National Education Policy. ACTA general secretary S. Sahaya Satish said the association had a policy of meeting representatives of parties during the Assembly election to present demands. A team of office-bearers met Udhayanidhi Stalin, secretary of the youth wing of DMK, in Tiruchi, and appealed to him to include their charter of demands in the manifesto. Meanwhile, a group of professors from the University of Madras has written to the Chief Minister, appealing for the release of funds towards pensions to retired employees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-appeal-to-parties/article33468383.ece

Baalu on Thursday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to stop the abolition of provincial councils in Sri Lanka, saying it would destroy the self-respect of Tamils in the country. “The Prime Minister should warn [Sri Lanka] that the move would affect the relationship between India and Sri Lanka. The abolition of the councils is part of the Sri Lankan government’s attempt to make Tamils secondary citizens,” he said in a statement. Mr. Baalu alleged that ever since the Rajapaksa brothers came to power, they had been depriving Tamils of their rights, self-respect and dignity, and it was concerning that the BJP-led Centre was a mute spectator. “Abolition of provincial councils is against the 13th Amendment enacted based on the Indo-Sri Lankan accord. It is shocking that the External Affairs Ministry and the National Security Advisor remain silent when an agreement signed with India is subjected to question,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/baalus-plea-to-pm-over-sl-provincial-councils/article33467646.ece

01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Work like the RSS, Ramadoss tells PMK members||While the ruling AIADMK has said its alliance formed for the 2019 Lok Sabha election is still intact, S. Ramadoss, founder of the PMK, a key ally, on Thursday wondered whether his vision of seeing a political change in Tamil Nadu will remain just a dream. A special general body meeting of the PMK on Thursday vested full powers with him to decide on electoral alliances and strategies. Dr. Ramadoss, addressing the attendees virtually, told the cadres to work like the RSS to strengthen the party. He expressed disappointment over the party not being able to establish itself well and the dream of the party forming a government not being realised. “We have faced six Assembly elections and nine parliamentary elections. We neither have representation in the Assembly nor a people-elected representative in Parliament now,” Dr. Ramadoss said. He said the cadres did not do enough fieldwork. Dr. Ramadoss frequently referred to the functioning of the RSS and how they ensured victory for the BJP. “The RSS also studies the weak points in certain constituencies and fixes it. They also highlight the policies of the government,” he said. He asked what was the point in running the party if it could not win more seats. “We have 30 different units in the party. Even with such a structure we have not reached out to the masses. Don’t ask about whom our alliance is with, think of what you can do to strengthen the party,” he said. A resolution passed at the meeting sought immediate implementation of 20% reservation for the Vanniyars in education and jobs. The other demands of the party included 80% jobs for locals in government and private jobs, release of funds by Centre for cyclone relief and amicable resolution to current farmers protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/work-like-the-rss-ramadoss-tells-cadres/article33468138.ece
01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Even Deputy CM not projecting Palaniswami as CM candidate: Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday said while Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was projecting himself as the Chief Minister candidate, his alliance partners, particularly the BJP, were not ready to accept it. “Even Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam did not project Mr. Palaniswami as the Chief Minister candidate during his campaign [at the YMCA grounds],” he said. The Opposition leader said Mr. Palaniswami was targeting the DMK, and describing it as a family outfit, just to overcome his disappointment and agony at not being endorsed as the chief ministerial candidate. At a virtual meeting with DMK functionaries from Ariyalur and Perambalur districts, he countered Mr. Palaniswami’s assertion that even a thousand Stalins could not break the AIADMK, saying neither the DMK nor he were interested in breaking the AIADMK. “There is no need for it. We are sustained by our strength and not the weakness of others. We do not consider a weak Chief Minister, who could not even become the general secretary of the party, as an enemy,” Mr. Stalin said. Reiterating that he was never against the Pongal gift of Rs. 2,500, Mr. Stalin said he actually wanted the government to distribute Rs. 5,000 in April itself. “The Chief Minister, who was not ready to pay heed to my request, is now giving Rs. 2,500 because elections are round the corner. He is using government money for the benefit of the AIADMK and we have approached the court.” In reply to Mr. Palaniswami’s comments on his contribution as the Mayor of Chennai, the DMK president said all the flyovers on which the Chief Minister travelled were constructed when he was the Mayor. “I introduced mechanisation in garbage clearing, laid 302 km of roads and 203 km of inner roads, constructed bus stops with shelters, 81 resting parks and 18 roadside parks, 47 residential playgrounds and storm water drainage systems that ran many kilometres,” he said. The DMK president said he plunged into a political war to safeguard democracy when he was 23-years-old and would not sleep till the AIADMK government was removed from power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/even-deputy-cm-not-projecting-palaniswami-as-cm-candidate-stalin/article33467644.ece

In a statement, Mr. Stalin said the government had belittled the demands and aspirations of the employees, though they had stopped protesting after Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami promised to look into their grievances. The DMK president said government employees had contributed Rs. 150 crore to the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund to fight COVID-19. “The Chief Minister should withdraw the action against them.

01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Surgeon’s expertise helps man sit, kneel||A 24-year-old man in the city, born with a congenital deformity in his hip bones , recently underwent a procedure to enable him to sit normally. The ball of his hip bone was too large and would not fit into the socket to enable him to sit cross-legged or kneel. He approached G. Leonard Ponraj, head of the arthroscopy and sports injury department at the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital in Omandurar Estate. Examination Dr. Leonard said a thorough examination found that his ball and socket joint were malformed. He was suffering from a congenital anomaly, in which the ball in the hip bone did not fit into the socket. “He was not able to sit cross-legged for over two years. He was not able to do namaz. We have the facilities in the hospital and were able to help him,” he said. According to Dr. Leonard, only four orthopaedists in the country have specialised in minimally invasive surgery to correct the malformation of hip bone-and-socket joints. Three of them are in the private sector. From being a blob of bone, the hip joint differentiates into a head, neck and shaft. In the patient, the bone stopped remodelling, making it a birth anomaly. “In his case, the ball did not narrow and remained a bony bump. We call this a ‘cam lesion’. This does not allow the ball to enter the socket. Through a 5mm keyhole, we skimmed the excess bone, just like a carpenter would scrape the excess wood with sandpaper,” Dr. Leonard said. The excess bone was burred to enable the ball to glide into the socket smoothly. Two days later, the man was able to sit cross-legged. When he came for suture removal, as a token of appreciation, he donated a Rs. 3 lakh drill to the department. “It would have cost him at least Rs. 2.5 lakh in a private hospital,” Dr. Leonard said.

Radhakrishnan on Thursday said arrangements were being made to send samples to two national institutes in Bengaluru — National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences and National Centre for Biological Sciences — to expedite the process. “We had earlier sent 30 samples of U.K. returnees and their contacts who had tested positive for COVID-19 to NIV, Pune, for genomic analysis. Another 10 samples were sent on Wednesday, and two more on Thursday. As the next step, we spoke to the Central government and got the authorisation to send the samples to the two national institutes in Bengaluru to expedite the works,” he told reporters. Of the 30 samples, two results were known till now. While a sample of a Chennai resident had returned positive for the new U.K. strain early this week, the sample of a patient in Madurai has returned negative. “Genomic sequencing is a tough job. As of now, 28 samples are being run, and 12 more are on the way,” he said. Four test positive According to the bulletin issued by the Health Department on Thursday, four more U.K. returnees have tested positive for COVID-19. Till date, 24 U.K. returnees and 20 of their contacts were found to be infected. So far, 1,936 passengers who returned from the U.K. were traced and tested. Though 1,853 of them have tested negative, as a precautionary measure 1,554 close contacts were traced and tested and all were found to be negative. The Health Secretary said they were tracing the remaining passengers who had returned between November 25 and December 23. The department had arrived at a reconciled figure of 2,080 passengers. About 54 persons had returned to the U.K., while some of them, especially in Chennai and Chengalpattu, had provided different addresses. He added that all U.K. returnees and their contacts who had tested positive for COVID-19 were isolated in separate wards and were stable. “According to doctors, there is no difference in the clinical manifestation in the existing COVID-19 and new variant. The Centre and the national task force has said that there was no need for changes in the testing and treatment protocols,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-will-send-samples-for-genomic-analysis-to-bengaluru-radhakrishnan/article33468134.ece
01 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Train us to handle leaking cylinders: delivery boys||Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder delivery men have urged the State-run oil companies to conduct in-plant training programmes for them at bottling plants. The programmes can help them and mechanics deal with emergencies, including leaks in cylinders. “A couple of weeks ago, a delivery boy with 10 years of experience got injured in a fire when he was trying to fix a leaking cylinder in Tirunelveli district. We are not saying he did not know the job, it could have been an error of judgment. Regular training at the plant could have helped him avoid it,” said Shanmugam, a delivery person from Tiruchi. Most times customers call delivery personnel in case of leaks since they are the first point of contact when it comes to cylinders. A long-time distributor said earlier oil companies used to hold regular training programmes for delivery boys and mechanics. “Nowadays the companies only bother about cylinder deliveries on time. It seems as though consumer safety has taken a back seat. If they do proper quality checks, leaks would be less frequent,” he said. Another distributor said companies did not even give them enough spare O-rings and pins to replace damaged ones. “They don't allow us to buy them in the open market, which is a problem when it comes to attending leaks,” he said. Oil industry insiders said that in-plant training was being conducted only by certain plants and that too because of the interest taken by few individual officials. Oil company officials, however, said that such training programmes were being held on a regular basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/train-us-to-handle-leaking-cylinders-delivery-boys/article33468133.ece

01 January 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Release grant to Avinashilingam deemed university: MP||P.R. Natarajan, MP, has written to the Union Minister of Human Resource Development demanding release of grant for the Avinashilingam Institute of Home Science and Higher Education for Women, a deemed university. In his letter recently, Mr. Natarajan said the university had not paid in full the retirement benefits to those faculty who retired recently. In a few cases, it had withheld commuted value of pension and 50% gratuity and for a few pensions, it had commuted pension based on the Sixth Pay Commission and not the Seventh. A few of the faculty and retirees had received zero percentage salary and pension respectively for July 2020 and for October and November 2020 they had received 75% of what they ought to receive. When the faculty and retirees took up the issue with the university management, they were told that the Ministry had not released sufficient funds. Mr. Natarajan said he would like to point that the university being an one of a kind institution offering education for girls, it would be forced to become a self-supporting institution and that would mean increase in cost of education. The Minister should, therefore intervene immediately by taking steps to release the required funds to safeguard the future of thousands of girls. Besides, he should also take steps to covert it into an MHRD-sponsored institution so that it continued to receive grants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/release-grant-to-avinashilingam-deemed-university-mp/article33468148.ece

Murugan at Arachalur and urged him to take up the issue with Central government. Led by its president L.K.M. Suresh, the members met Mr. Murugan and expressed their concern over the Ministry of Commerce and Industry recommending imposition of anti-dumping duty on VSF for five years for the fibre imported from China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Members said that one-third of their yarn needs are fulfilled by import while two-thirds are fulfilled by purchases from the domestic market where price is very high. Representation to Centre They said that they had made a representation to the Central government in June, 2019 during which officials agreed not to impose anti-dumping duty.

01 January 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Aquafarms warned against breeding African Catfish||The district administration has warned against breeding of the banned African Catfish, otherwise known as Clarias Gariepinus, in aquaculture farms and local waterbodies. Though the National Green Tribunal had banned the culture of African Catfish, a few aquafarms reportedly held stocks clandestinely, posing a threat to the ecology, a release said. Collector V. Jaya Chandra Bhanu Reddy, in the release, warned inland aquaculture farmers against breeding of the banned fish species that was proved to be invasive, threatening the survival of native fish species. According to the administration, African Catfish bred in farms tend to swim out during heavy rain and floods escaping into the general water stream. This will lead to proliferation causing the extinction of other native varieties. Farmers had been advised to destroy the fish that were bred in the farms. The public were told to alert the office of Assistant Director of Fisheries, No24-25,Ward No-27, 4th Cross, Cooperative Colony, Krishnagiri -635001; phone -04343-235745.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aquafarms-warned-against-breeding-african-catfish/article33467667.ece
01 January 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Farmers want more DPCs||With the commencement of paddy harvest in a few pockets of the double-crop region in the district, farmers have urged the district administration to open Direct Purchase Centres (DPCs) in these areas. Steps have to be taken to avoid any mismanagement or corruption at these centres, they say. Joint Director of Agriculture T. Vivekanandan said paddy crop on around 5,000 hectares would be harvested within the next 15 days in Vadipatti, Madurai East and Madurai North blocks. Water was released in the last week of August to irrigate the first crop of the double-crop area in the district. Apart from the double-crop region, paddy was also being harvested in a few villages of Kottampatti and Melur blocks, said N. Palanichamy, president of Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers’ Association from Melur block. M. Tirupathi, a farmer from Kulamangalam, stressed the need for early opening of the DPCs. While one bag of rice was sold for Rs. 800 to Rs. 900 in the open market, the farmers could earn an additional Rs. 400 for each bag if they sold it at the DPCs, he said. “The opening of the DPCs will ensure that the farmers are not exploited by traders. The open market rate for rice will also increase,” he added. In the past, there were several complaints of mismanagement and irregularities in the functioning of the DPCs. G. Murugan, a farmer from Mannadi Mangalam in Vadipatti block, said many times the traders bought rice for a lower rate from the farmers and sold it at a higher rate at the DPCs. “Members of Farmers Producers Groups must be entrusted with the responsibility of managing the DPCs,” he said. A district-level monitoring committee with 14 members, including district administration and Agriculture Department officials and six farmers, had been formed to prevent DPC mismanagement, said Mr. Vivekanandan. S. Dharmaraj, a farmer from Karuppayurani and a member of the committee, said farmers had to pay Rs. 40 for each bag of rice at the DPCs as ‘labour charges’. “The practice of farmers paying for weighing, packing and loading of rice at the DPCs has been prevalent for many years. Ideally, the government must pay the charges. The committee will ensure that this practice is ended,” he said. Mr. Vivekanandan said details of area coverage of paddy in all blocks and tentative date of harvest had been submitted to the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation. “The authorities concerned have told that the DPCs will be opened from next week,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-want-more-dpcs/article33467650.ece
01 January 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Consumer product stockists stage demo||Opposing the ‘dual pricing’ policy adopted by manufacturers, members of Madurai District Consumer Product Stockists’ Association staged a demonstration in the city. Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, Association president A.S.V.A. Mathavan said the manufacturers, mostly MNCs, had adopted an “innovative” business model, which had ruined the stockists in Tamil Nadu. Since the manufacturers offered their products to chain store operators at lower prices, the business of the stockists was completely wiped out. A stockist in Madurai, who was dealing in MNC products, said he wound up his business two years ago as his turnover dipped from Rs. 4 crore to Rs. 1.40 crore because of the dual pricing policy adopted by the manufacturer. The agitation was held across Tamil Nadu and the stockists said they would meet soon to plan the next course of action. The Association members passed resolutions urging the Centre to regulate the sector and urged the manufacturers to enhance commission offered to stockists from 4% to 8% as they had invested huge amounts in infrastructure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consumer-product-stockists-stage-demo/article33468254.ece

01 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||MP opposes decision to cancel Madurai-Chennai Tejas Express||Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has opposed the decision of the Southern Railway to cancel the running of the Madurai-Chennai Egmore Tejas Express with effect from January 4. Terming the move a “New Year gift” to the people, he said the Railways had already cancelled two Shatabdi Express trains from Chennai Central to Bengaluru and Coimbatore, citing the same reason — poor patronage. In a memorandum sent to Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, the MP said poor patronage in these trains was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the unaffordable high fares. The trains had a minimum 30% occupancy. Due to the pandemic, it was desirable that there was no crowding to avoid the spread of COVID-19. “The government itself is asking people to desist from travel and to undertake journeys only for essential purposes. The Indian Railways, a government undertaking, should run for the needy people during this pandemic, as they ran for migrant workers appreciably, without any motive for profit,” Mr. Venkatesan said. High fares The other reason for the poor patronage was the high fares, especially when compared to other trains running on the same route, he added. It was understandable to have fares reasonably above those of regular trains. However, the Tejas fares between Madurai and Egmore were 35% higher than the Vaigai Express’s A.C. chair car, he said. Due to the pandemic, people had been earning less, leading to the fares becoming unaffordable, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-opposes-decision-to-cancel-madurai-chennai-tejas-express/article33467657.ece

01 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Tourists throng Puducherry for celebration, despite restrictions||The ban on celebrations in hotels and restrictions imposed on the beach promenade due to COVID-19 did not deter domestic tourists from travelling to Puducherry to celebrate the New Year. A majority of the large and mid-size hotels reported around 90% occupancy, with some of them even full, as tourists from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka flocked here to celebrate the New Year. “With all the controversies and confusion, we did not expect many tourists but most hotels have reasonably good occupancy. The guests are a bit disappointed about the lack of events or activities in the hotels. We have clearly told the occupants that there will be no celebrations,” said Anand Gandhiraj, treasurer of the Hotels Association of Pondicherry. The association has around 25 medium and large-sized hotels with around 1,500 rooms. According to Mr. Gandhiraj, the tourist arrivals started a day prior to Christmas. “In fact, most hotels got crowded for three days due to the weekend along with the Christmas holiday. But one has to admit that rooms have gone at a discounted rate during this festival season, unlike previous years, when they were given at premium rates,” he said. December and January are the months the hospitality industry gets maximum business, he noted. V. Ramachandran, owner of Hotel Jayaram, said, “The impact of COVID-19 is really there. In the previous years, we used to get foreign tourists in large numbers but this time it is only domestic tourists.” Chief executive officer of the TGI Group of Hotels Amitava Roy said since there were no events on the New Year day, the hotels were concentrating more on special food items. “People wanted to rewind after months of work from home and there were enquiries on entertainment but hotels have strictly followed the government order, banning events as personal safety matters,” he said. Front officer of Ananda Inn Hirak Mahapatra said it almost had 90% occupancy. “Since the restaurant is small and social distancing could not be ensured, we have converted the banquet hall for serving food. All the guests were screened using thermal scanners before they were allotted rooms,” he said. Tourists started arriving from Wednesday evening itself and the beach promenade came alive on Thursday morning. “It is for public good that the government has imposed restrictions and there is nothing wrong in banning celebrations. We are planning to spend the day out and get back to the hotel by evening to have dinner,” Raghavendra, a tourist from Bengaluru, said. Senior Superintendent of Police Rahul Alwal toldThe Hinduthat they have started screening people using thermal scanners in the border areas for COVID-19 symptoms from Thursday morning. Deployment of police personnel for regulation and security in the White Town area started by noon. Around 1,000 personnel would be deployed in the White Town, including the beach promenade. Another 2,000 policemen would be on duty till late night to ensure COVID-19 protocols are followed and for peaceful New Year celebrations. According to a police officer, drones would be used for crowd management on the beach. The police have also established a desk near Gandhi Thidal and the ADGP office complex to assist in locating missing persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tourists-throng-puducherry-for-new-year-despite-restrictions/article33467638.ece

01 January 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||In delta, focus shifts to availability of harvesting machines||With harvest ofsamba/thaladipaddy set to begin in the Delta region soon, progressive farmers are looking up to the authorities to ensure availability of harvesting machines in adequate numbers so that the reaping of paddy is done on time without hassle. Lastsambaseason, hundreds of huge combined harvester machines were pressed into service in the delta districts and the crop was harvested on time. The Agriculture Engineering Department, which moved its own machines from other districts, also encouraged private parties owning combined harvester machines to divert them to the delta districts. The timely action ensured that farmers realised their yield before the panicles of samba paddy lodged on the fields due the inclement weather prevailed during that time getting sprouted. Since a similar situation prevails all over the Delta this season also, farmers expect prompt and timely action from the authorities to help them harvest samba paddy in good condition. Meanwhile, the Madukkur Farmers Producers Organisation has submitted a memorandum to the Thanjavur district administration seeking financial support for purchasing a combined harvester machine for the use of its members and as well as other farmers in Madukkur and Pattukottai region. Speaking toThe Hindu, the president of Madukkur FPO, G.Suresh said that around 160 farmers have enrolled in the organisation as members. Farmers in this region usually goes in for a single paddy crop cultivation. Making a huge investment of around Rs. 20 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh on a harvester machine could not be considered as an unwise decision considering the demand for this machine in the Delta region during the harvesting period starting from mid-December to first fortnight of February in the subsequent year, he said. Further, of late the farmers in some pockets of rain-fed areas in the delta region prefer to raise paddy as summer crop by tapping the groundwater potential.  Extra charges Another reason which had influenced the Madukkur FPO to own a combined harvester machine was the’extra’ charges levied by the private parties which offer this service during harvesting days. “If we own a harvester our members and fellow farmers can hire the machine from us at the price fixed by the government”, Mr.Suresh said. Endorsing Mr. Suresh’s statement that private combined harvester machine service providers do charge an additional amount, G.Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam urged the FPOs making a huge investment in these machines not to hesitate to offer their service to the farmers in neighbouring districts through the Agriculture Engineering Department or on their own, if need arises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/in-delta-focus-shifts-to-availability-of-harvesting-machines/article33467609.ece
01 January 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Thoothukudi sees dip in murder cases in 2020: SP||Stringent efforts by the district police have enabled in detaining 128 habitual offenders under the Goondas Act and seizure of close to 10 tonnes of banned tobacco goods and narcotics substances during 2020, said Superintendent of Police S. Jeyakumar here on Thursday. In the last six months alone, the police had detained 86 persons under the Goondas Act, which had considerably paved the way for effective maintenance of law and order. The number of murder cases in the district was 58 and 180 accused were arrested. Constant vigil had led to marginal reduction of murder cases from 72 in 2019 to 58 in 2020. As for road accidents, the police said that there were 252 deaths against 303 reported in 2019. Wearing helmets and better enforcement by the traffic wing had enabled reduction in number of accidents. The SP appealed for self-discipline among the motorists. If every road user obeyed rules, the fatalities and freak accidents can be prevented to a great extent. Most of the deaths were due to rash and negligent driving and drunken driving. During 2020, the police booked 187 vehicles under charges of smuggling sand and other natural resources, which was marginally higher than 2019. Specific information and tight vigil had facilitated in bringing to book 168 cases under the narcotics substances Act. About 25 kgs of charas and 134 kgs of ganja were seized and a total of 168 cases were booked. In 2019, the police had booked 73 cases and seized 75 kgs of ganja. Though the government had banned tobacco, 841 cases were booked and Rs. 58 lakh worth goods weighing 9,587 kgs were seized. Giving due credit to police personnel across the district for their untiring efforts in maintaining law and order, prevention of crimes and on reduction in number of traffic related cases, the SP said that it is a reflection of collective responsibility and teamwork of the Deputy Superintendents of Police at the sub-divisions, the role played by Inspectors at the stations and their subordinate officers. Thoothukudi district was recently in the eye of a storm after the police fired against anti-Sterlite protestors and the subsequent father-son duo death in alleged custody at Sattankulam police station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thoothukudi-sees-dip-in-murder-cases-in-2020-sp/article33467633.ece
01 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||NDA meeting in T.N. after polls are notified: CM||Ruling out any strain in the AIADMK-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Tamil Nadu, party co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday said the formation remained intact. Speaking in Tiruchi, he said that while AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam had declared him the Chief Ministerial candidate “after due consultations with seniors in the party”, the question of convening a meeting of the NDA would arise only after the dates for the Assembly election are announced. There would be scope for even expanding the alliance then, he added. As for the BJP and the PMK playing hardball on endorsing his candidature, Mr. Palaniswami argued that it was normal for parties to make such statements to boost the morale of their cadre and strengthen themselves. The AIADMK was unlikely to lose minority votes, he said, citing the DMK’s alliance with the BJP in 1999. Each party had its own ideology, Mr. Palaniswami said, and maintained that alliances were only an electoral understanding and would not alter the ideology of the parties. He felt issues might crop up in the DMK-led alliance during the seat-sharing talks. The DMK could split soon, as former Union Minister M.K. Alagiri may launch a party, he said. He did not foresee any political impact in the event of the release of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s jailed aide V.K. Sasikala. Campaigning amid pouring rain in Srirangam during the day, he urged voters to give a clear mandate to his party to continue the agenda of development and people’s welfare. “The AIADMK government has fulfilled the promises it made to the people during the last Assembly election. The people-friendly government should continue,” he said. Equal importance was being given to strengthening infrastructure and creating employment opportunities, he added. Dig at DMK At Maravanur near Manapparai, Mr. Palaniswami claimed that the AIADMK was the only party in the country where an ordinary cadre could become the Chief Minister. On the other hand, the DMK had been nurturing family politics and was being run like a corporate, with family members of former party patriarch M. Karunanidhi holding key positions, he alleged.

01 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Small onion growers in Perambalur, Tiruchi dists. seek compensation||Small onion growers in Perambalur and Tiruchi districts, a major shallot growing belt in the State, are worried over the persistent disease attack on the crop which, they say, has adversely hit yield. The peculiar root rot disease, referred to as ‘thirugal noi’ in Tamil, has been worrying farmers for a couple of years. The incidence of the disease was widespread in the two district though the extent of damage varies. In some fields, the disease has completely damaged the crop, while in others it has caused over 60% of loss in yield. The crop is normally raised on about 7,000 hectares in Perambalur district and more than 3,000 hectares in Tiruchi district. Though officials and scientists have inspected some affected fields and suggested preventive measures and specific pesticides, farmers say that the recommended pesticides have not been effective in controlling the disease. Last week, a group of onion growers resorted to a protest at Sellipalayam near Thuraiyur demanding compensation for the crop damage. Farmers from Sellipalayam, Maruvathur, Sengattupatti, Narasingapuram and Ammampalayam, who participated in the protest, complained that the crop raised on about 1,500 acres have been severely damaged. Farmers had been raising the issue at the agriculture grievances meetings in these districts. The disease has caused extensive damage causing severe losses to farmers, said R.Raja Chidambaram, state secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam. “Despite applying pesticides recommended by officials and scientists, the disease could not be controlled. Farmers should be compensated after proper enumeration but at the same time we should strive to find a permanent solution,” he said seeking a special campaign like the one taken up over to check the incidence of Fall Armyworm in maize. The disease is causing at least 60 to 70% of loss in yield, says D.Srinivasan, a farmer of Renganathapuram. “In a good season, we harvest up to six to seven tonnes of small onions in an acre. Now, we are sustaining heavy losses after spending up to Rs. 30,000 an acre. No official has inspected our fields,” he said as he awaits compensation from the insurance company for the crop damage he has suffered this season. R. Arunachalam of Nagalapuram near Thuraiyur said the disease starts affecting the crop when it is about 30 to 35 days old and the problem has been persisting for two years now. “We are all small farmers in our village; some have lost the crop fully and others have sustained 50 to 75% yield loss,” he said urging the government to sanction a compensation of at least Rs. 10,000 an acre from the State Disaster Response Fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/small-onion-growers-in-perambalur-tiruchi-dists-seek-compensation/article33467662.ece

Vikram Kumar, 34, a Siddha doctor in Tirupathur, when patients who were treated by him at the Siddha COVID-19 Care Centre, along with some village residents, came together and honoured him. The State government had ordered kabasura kudineer , a herbal concoction regarded as an immunity booster and capable of combating viral infections, to be included in the integrated approach to combat COVID-19. Subsequently, Siddha COVID-19 Care Centres were started to combat the virus. Accordingly, a care centre was started in Agaram Polytechnic College in Tirupathur district on July 15, 2020. It had 60 beds in 26 rooms and the patients were provided with traditional food and herbs to combat the virus. Food and soups were cooked only in earthen pots. Words of comfort “Besides, we kept the patients engaged. We opened a library, a herbal garden that the patients maintained and engaged them in dance and music. We kept talking to them and helped relieve them of their stress,” said Mr. Kumar, who was in-charge of the centre. A total of 625 patients were treated at the centre till November 29, when it was closed. “Cases dropped in the district and as Siddha centres in other districts were shut, we also closed it. But there is a demand from the public to reopen it,” said Mr. Kumar. Recently, some patients who were treated by him honoured him. Tirupathur Collector M.P. Sivanarul handed over a memento to him on behalf of the people. “In March itself, he started distributingkabasura kudineer. As the numbers increased, a centre was started.” “He provided good treatment and taught us yoga and exercises. He dedicated himself for our treatment, and he did not go home at all for four months,” said Arun Mozhi, a social worker.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-survivors-fete-siddha-doctor/article33468380.ece

Train services were resumed after more than nine months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the resumption in services, it is hoped that one of the biggest attractions in the district will lead to an increase in tourist footfall in the coming months, and help small businesses recuperate some of the losses they incurred in 2020. K. Natrajan, a heritage train enthusiast and founder of the Heritage Steam Chariot Trust, distributed sweets to people who took the train to Udhagamandalam station on Thursday morning. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Natrajan said that it was a relief to see the heritage train service resumed. “The NMR train is not only a very important part of the Nilgiris’ heritage, but a very important attraction for tourists, generating crores in revenue to local businesses indirectly,” said Mr. Natrajan. Tourists visiting the Nilgiris too voiced their excitement at the resumption in services. Latha Sukumar, a tourist from Karnataka, said that she and her family had arrived in the Nilgiris a few days ago and were disappointed to learn that the train service was not functional. “During the course of our stay here, it was announced that the NMR service was resumed, and we quickly booked tickets to experience the train ride to Coonoor,” she said.

01 January 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Even 40 days after ROB collapse, traffic diversion on NH continues||National Highways Authority of India has come in criticism for not promptly attending to the rail overbridge (ROB) at R.R. Nagar, a portion of which collapsed more than 40 days back. With the Sattur-Virudhunagar double lane remaining closed for repair works, all vehicles on both directions of the busy national highway were being diverted through the other double lane since the third week of November. Vehicles that usually tend to go on high speed on the four-way highway pose danger to vehicles coming on the opposite side on the same lane, complained Communist Party of India (Marxist) Virudhunagar South union secretary, P. Nehru. He pointed out that several passengers were injured when a speeding omni bus hit a van within few days after the diversion of vehicles was implemented. Complaining that poor quality of construction had led to the collapse of the bridge wall for the fourth time in the last 10 years, Mr. Nehru said that NHAI was interested only in collecting toll from road users. “This stretch of road has not been re-laid for the past 10 years”, he said. Local people complained that the damaged portion of the bridge had been covered with a huge plastic sheet and no work has been taken up till date. However, a NHAI official said that a team from Central Road Research Institute had inspected the ROB and have collected samples of the materials used for its construction. NHAI is in the process of finding out the cause of damage and was trying to revamp the bridge depending upon the report to prevent any further accident. “Since, we want to find a permanent solution, it is taking some time,” he added. “After the accident on the diverted portion, we have provided glittering stickers on the road and temporary median to avoid accidents”, he added. Mr. Nehru said that the local people were planning for a protest against NHAI for its lackadaisical attitude.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/even-40-days-after-rob-collapse-traffic-diversion-on-nh-continues/article33468257.ece

In a move to control the spread of COVID-19, the government has banned New Year celebrations in hotels, clubs and other places. To ensure that this is followed, security has been increased across the district. Barricades have been put up at 58 places in Vellore to curb bike racing. Superintendent of Police S.

While the pandemic did impact on the progress of some projects, the district administration and Tiruchi Corporation were not able to push through many of the long expected development initiatives such as establishment of an integrated bus stand, shifting of wholesale traders of Gandhi Market, building service lanes along the city stretch of Tiruchi-Thanjavur Highway and pending works on Junction Road Overbridge. Most notable among the setbacks for the district administration was its inability to make the Kallikudi Central Market for Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers, established at an investment of over Rs. 77 crore, fully functional despite repeated attempts. In the absence of political will, officials’ attempts to shift the wholesale traders of the Gandhi Market to the new market failed as the traders remained stubborn and succeeded in entrenching themselves again at the old market after it was reopened following the easing of lockdown restrictions. In an election year, no forward movement on the shifting is expected at least over the next few months. The Corporation’s earlier plan of redeveloping Gandhi Market under the Smart City Mission has also fallen by the wayside amid the controversies that plagued the shifting of the traders. Despite the 10-year stint, the AIADMK government has still not been able to identify a site for the proposed integrated bus stand in the city, making it another most notable failure for the authorities. The proposal that has been hanging fire for nearly three decades and despite an assurance of the Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami, the proposal is yet to see the light of the day. “t is pathetic that proposals such as establishing an integrated bus stand and the shifting of the wholesale traders of Gandhi Market have been hanging fire for so long. The land acquisition for laying the service lanes on the city stretch of Tiruchi-Thanjavur Highway is also progressing at a snail’s pace,” observed K. Sakthivel, coordinator, Federation of Tiruchi City Residents Welfare Associations. “We are compiling a list of such major pending projects and issues which need to brought into focus in the public domain in the run up to the elections,” said Mr.Sakthivel. The list already has 16 issues and is to be consolidated in consultation with federation members. Pointing out to increasing traffic congestion in the city, especially in places such as Vayalur Road, Thanjavur Road and parts of the city, Mr. Sakthivel wondered why a holistic approach was not adopted for development of the city. While the lack of progress in such big ticket project come in for criticism from activists, for the common man inadequacies in civic amenities remain the biggest concern. “Many arterial roads in the city are in tatters; interior roads in residential colonies are still worse. At the slightest of rain, many residential colonies and houses are still flooded with rain water mixed with sewage. Let the civic body ensure that such basic necessities are first fulfilled,” fumed Sakunthala Srinivasan, president, Tiruchi District Payaneetalar Iyakkam. Tiruchi Corporation was able to initiate some projects under the Smart City Mission such as redevelopment of Chathiram Bus Stand and a few others, but inadequacies plagued the civic services, especially in terms of solid and waste water management and maintenance of roads including internal roads. Some of the earlier initiatives such as roadside gyms, development of parks, city cleanliness and beautification efforts, taken up earlier, also seem to have taken a back seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-projects-more-misses-than-hits/article33467604.ece

The express train passes through Tiruchi. Citing poor patronage, Southern Railway recently announced the cancellation of Tejas Express (six days a week) with effect from January 4. Describing the action as “wrong”, Tiruchi Lok Sabha MP Su. Thirunavukkarasar contended that rail services could not be operated with the intention of earning profit. In a statement issued on Wednesday, he said rail services were being operated for the welfare of the public. Although the number of rail travellers could have reduced in view of COVID-19, it was only a temporary phenomenon and not a permanent one. The operation of Tejas Express proved to be useful to passengers who did not wish to travel either by air or by road. Further, the train reached the destinations speedily and was beneficial to passengers from different districts. Mr. Thiruvanukkarasar urged the railway administration to continue operation of the train taking into account public welfare and not profit-loss angle. The MP said he had written letters to the Railway Ministry, Chairman, Railway Board, and Southern Railway General Manager in this connection. The Air, Rail and Road Travellers Federation here appealed to the Railway Board, New Delhi, to postpone the cancellation. Memorandum In a memorandum submitted to the Railway Board, New Delhi, Federation president M. Sekaran attributed the poor patronage to the pandemic. The trains had at least 30% occupancy and enjoyed full patronage before the pandemic. Mr. Sekaran pointed out that the government had asked the people to desist from travelling and undertake journeys only for essential purposes. He appealed to the Railway Board to postpone cancellation of the train up to January 20, taking onto consideration the coming Pongal festival when the movement of public would be high.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cancellation-of-tejas-express-draws-flak/article33467601.ece

Speaking at the release of Potential Linked Plan (PLP) for Thanjavur district for the financial year 2021-22 by Collector M. Govinda Rao here, District Development Manager, NABARD, Thanjavur, K. Balamurugan said that considering the need to promote capital formation in agriculture and allied sectors, the bank had estimated an overall credit potential of Rs. 1,170.88 crore. In order to achieve this, the DDM said it was important to create awareness of various investment opportunities in areas such as farm mechanisation, dairy farming, sheep/goat farming and poultry by the departments concerned to realise the credit potential. It was also important to promote sustainable agriculture by encouraging rainwater harvesting practices and use of water-saving devices such as sprinklers in agriculture/horticulture operations, he added. As far as credit requirements for cultivation activities during the next financial year, the bank had projected Rs. 4,594.20 crore considering the likely area of cultivation and scale of financing of crops. Thus, the bank had projected an overall credit outlay of Rs. 5,765.08 crore for agriculture and allied sectors out of the total PLP of Rs. 9,027.44 crore for Thanjavur district. Releasing the PLP, the Collector pointed out that a coordinated approach of all stakeholders — bankers, government departments, research institutes, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, non-governmental organizations and farmers — had to be solicited to achieve the credit potential estimated in the PLP since agriculture and rural development were a multi-disciplinary subject.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/create-awareness-of-capital-investment-in-agriculture-sector/article33467599.ece

Gowri, Vice-Chancellor, University of Madras          Many of the changes in the education sector, brought about by COVID-19 in 2020, are here to stay. With the possibility of regular classes resuming sometime in 2021, the year will see the education sector adapting to a blended approach, by combining online and regular classes. Online classes can provide greater flexibility for students and teachers. As we move to this new realm, we need to focus on ensuring equal access to education for all. One of the problems I am seeing is the lack of interactiveness in the online mode of education. I hope 2021 will bring more technological interventions to address such problems effectively. When I was Director of the Educational Multimedia Research Centre at Anna University, we produced hundreds of high-quality e-learning content on a variety of subjects. They were made freely available on the government’s Swayam portal. I have often felt disheartened about e-learning not taking off in a big way. But COVID-19 has forced the education sector to experience transformative changes in an accelerated manner. Both teachers and students adapted to the online mode of education, fairly easily, despite the concerns expressed initially from various quarters. The online mode of examinations has become a reality now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/blending-online-regular-classes-is-key/article33467626.ece

01 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||South runway of Bengaluru airport is CAT IIIB compliant||The south runway of Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) has been upgraded to CAT III B compliant with effect from Thursday (December 31). This helps the airport to operate flights during inclement weather conditions and poor visibility. A release from the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), the operator of the KIA, states that the south runway can facilitate aircraft landing with a Runway Visual Range as low as 50 metres and take-offs at 125 metres. Until now, the permissible visual range was 550m and 300m, for landing and take-off, respectively. “Aiding smooth operations during low visibility are the newly-installed advanced Instrument Landing System (ILS), Airfield Ground Lights (AGL), meteorological equipment such as Transmissometre, Automatic Weather Observatory Station (AWOS), Surface Movement Radar (SMR) and other navigational aids,” states the release. The BIAL said the Bengaluru airport is the sixth airport in the country and the only one in South India to have a CAT III B compliant runway. “BLR airport has obtained regulatory approvals to operationalise the runway with successful completion of both trial and calibration flights followed by an inspection by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Airlines are required to deploy crew trained for CAT-III operations to make the optimum use of the facility,” the release states. In 2019, the Bengaluru airport signed an agreement with Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) to conduct a collaborative study on atmospheric conditions in the vicinity of the airport. This four-year study is currently under way to develop a Numerical Simulation Tool capable of predicting the onset of radiation-fog over the airport region. North runway The release also states that the rehabilitation of the north runway, which has been closed for operations from June 22, 2020, is under way. The rehabilitation includes strengthening and resurfacing of the runway as well as installation of LED Runway Centre Line lights and Runway Edge Lights. These enhancements will offer flexibility to operate in low visibility and adverse weather conditions, the release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/south-runway-of-bengaluru-airport-is-cat-iiib-compliant/article33468109.ece

All the nurses who will be going in the first batch will be trained in all aspects of their profession, including communication skills through Karnataka Vocational Training and Skill Development Corporation (KVTSDC). The government of Britain has fixed an annual salary package of Rs. 20 lakh for those who get employed. Agreement This deal is the result of an agreement that was entered between the Department of Skill Development of the State, National Health Services (NHS) & Health Education England (HEE), he said. The government has established an International Immigration Centre with the objective of providing employment in foreign countries. The present batch of nurses is being sent to Britain through this centre. This centre will be in seamless contact with these nurses and will hear their grievances. The department of Skill Development, Entrepreneurship & Livelihood has entered into an MoU with Public Affairs Centre to provide guidance, technical support, and other aided services for those who are ready to go to foreign countries to get employed, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/1000-skilled-nurses-from-state-set-to-go-to-britain/article33467725.ece
01 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Renaming of 11 roads stokes controversy||The renaming of 11 roads in Padarayanapura ward to honour social workers and leaders belonging to the minority community has stoked a controversy. Following objections from sections of citizens and several BJP leaders, including MPs Anantkumar Hegde and Tejasvi Surya, civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad wrote to the government recommending dropping the renaming proposal. Ironically, though maximum opposition came from the BJP, it was the BJP-ruled BBMP council that approved the proposal to rename the 11 roads. The subject was among the many that were approved without any discussion in the council two days before the term was to end. The issue came to light only when BBMP Joint Commissioner (Revenue) issued a notification calling for objections to the renaming proposal. In his letter to Mr. Prasad, Mr. Hedge has said that renaming the roads after persons belonging to one minority community was “inappropriate” and recommended that the roads and streets be named after freedom fighters and national leaders instead. Mr. Surya wrote to the civic chief saying that naming roads in a locality dominated by the minority community “reeks of the same communal mentality as two-nation theory”. Former mayor M. Goutham Kumar, who approved the subject in the council, and former Ruling Party Leader K.A. Muneendra Kumar, who proposed it, have also raised objections. Mr. Goutham Kumar admitted that the subject was approved without full details of what was being proposed. “The subject was added at the last minute and was approved even before we could go through the annexure for complete details,” he said and alleged that it had been brought to their attention that some of the roads have been named after living persons and others who were not social workers. As per BBMP rules, roads cannot be named after living persons, he said and added that he too had written to the BBMP Administrator and Commissioner urging them to drop the proposal. Mr. Prasad has cited certain sections of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, while recommending to the government that the proposal be dropped. However, even this has come under fire from civic activists. S. Amaresh, managing trustee of RTI Study Centre, said the decision could have been revoked by the Administrator by exercising powers under the business rules of KMC Act. He blamed the BBMP’s legal cell for not recommending to the Commissioner to cite a stronger section for the decision to revoke the proposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/renaming-of-11-roads-stokes-controversy/article33467719.ece
01 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah ridicules CM for claim on GP results||Political leaders indulged in a war of words on Thursday over the the results of the gram panchayat elections. While Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa claimed that BJP-backed candidates had won the most number of seats, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah slammed him and claimed that Congress-backed candidates had performed well. Attacking Mr. Yediyurappa for claiming victory of party-backed candidates in 3,800 gram panchayats even before the panchayats were formed, Mr. Siddaramaiah questioned the basis for the claim, even as he stated that Congress-backed candidates had won in big numbers. “It is the Congress that is number one in terms of gram panchayat results, not the BJP. The BJP did not even have its candidates in several panchayats. The BJP has hijacked our candidates,” he said. Claiming that Mr. Yediyurappa was daydreaming, he said, “His position as Chief Minister has become shaky and he wants to safeguard his chair. That is why he is claiming that the BJP has won more number of seats.” He also alleged that the saffron party was enticing Congress-backed candidates with money. Expressing satisfaction over the performance of Congress-backed candidates, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar said he would seek reports from district committees on the party’s performance. “I do not know what internal problems ail the BJP that they are claiming victory. Once the panchayats are formed, it will be clear who has won,” he said. Meanwhile, JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy claimed that despite the muscle power of the national parties, the regional party had done well. Taking to Twitter, he thanked voters for reposing faith in JD(S)-backed candidates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-ridicules-cm-for-claim-on-gp-results/article33467890.ece

01 January 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Delay in appointing guest faculty hits students, permanent staff||The State government has not appointed guest faculty for first-grade colleges, making it difficult for students and permanent staff, who alone cannot cover the entire syllabus. The students are worried about appearing for the examinations, without attending classes on many papers in the current semester. The academic year for the third semester students began on September 1 this year in colleges affiliated to University of Mysore. The teachers were asked to conduct classes online. The last day of working for these semesters would be February 28, 2021, as per the revised calendar of events released by the university. In most of the colleges, only final year students are attending offline classes while the rest have been instructed to attend online classes. However, they also can visit colleges to consult the teachers individually. In the absence of guest faculty, the permanent faculty are finding it difficult to handle the subjects. In some colleges, there is only one permanent faculty against a workload of 100 hours per week. An assistant professor of Commerce in a college in Hassan district, who wished not to be quoted, said he was the only teaching faculty for a workload of 100 hours, including postgraduate classes, in a week. “Going by the workload, we need at least 10 guest teachers or five permanent staff. One person can't cover the entire syllabus,” he said. As per norms, an assistant professor is assigned 16 hours of teaching hours in a week. 14,000 guest faculty Almost all first-grade colleges in the State depend on guest faculty to handle the workload. “We have the staff to cover only half of the subjects prescribed in the final year. Whether it is online or offline, one person cannot teach all subjects at a stretch,” said another assistant professor. In some colleges, there is only one faculty to teach English. The teacher has to handle language classes for first and second-year students, besides taking classes for those students who have taken English literature as one of the core subjects. Pradeep P., Commissioner of Collegiate Education, told The Hindu that the department had sent a proposal for the appointment of 14,000 guest faculty. “We sent the proposal about 25 days ago. It has to be approved by the government for further process,” he said. The Department of Higher Education has sent the proposal for recruitment of 900 guest faculty for polytechnic colleges and 280 for engineering colleges, he added.  I’m the only teaching faculty for a workload of 100 hours, including postgraduate classes, in a week. Going by the workload, we need at least 10 guest teachers or five permanent staff.

01 January 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||They managed to win without spending a single rupee||Amid reports of candidates spending lakhs of rupees to lure voters in the gram panchayat elections, a few candidates have stood out by winning without distributing gifts, cash, or liquor. Among them is 28-year-old Naveen Kumar A.N., of Niduvale in Mudigere taluk. Mr. Naveen decided to contest the election three months ago. After offering prayers to a deity, he took a vow not to wear slippers till the election was over. He chose a pair of slippers as a symbol in the election and campaigned barefoot. To popularise his symbol, he pinned a specially made slipper of small size to his sling bag, which he carried during the campaign. He has now won by securing 496 of the total of 952 votes polled. “I am thankful to the people who elected me. I did not spend even one rupee to lure voters during the campaign,” he told The Hindu . Vasudeva, a postgraduate and district president of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, has won from Kalkere GP in Channarayapatna with a margin of 252 votes. Two of his friends, who contested for other seats in the village, have also won by following the same example. “We resolved to set an example and succeeded. The villagers also cooperated with us,” Mr. Vasudeva said. All six candidates contesting for two seats of Honnetalu in Thirthahalli had taken an oath in a temple, in the presence of villagers, that no one would distribute liquor or cash to lure voters. In fact, they all campaigned together, setting aside the fact that they were rivals. After the counting of votes on Wednesday, Manjunath and Geetha Dinesh Poojary won and the defeated candidates were the first to congratulate them. Ms. Poojary visited the house of her opponent Jayashree Nityanand and took the blessings of elders. All eight candidates contesting for two seats of Haralimath of Harogolige GP in Thirthahalli also had taken an oath not to lure voters. They campaigned together without spending money, and Indira Shivanna and H.A. Maiddin were elected. The defeated candidates have assured their support to the winners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/they-managed-to-win-without-spending-a-single-rupee/article33467889.ece
01 January 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Dharwad gets Rs. 9,473-crore Potential Linked Credit Plan||A Rs. 9,473-crore Potential Linked Credit Plan prepared for Dharwad District by NABARD was released by Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil in Dharwad recently. The credit plan has been prepared with the theme, Collectivisation of agricultural produce for enhancing farmers income. Mr. Patil released it during the District Level Review Committee (DLRC) meeting. Under the credit plan, 57.23 % has been set aside for agriculture sector, 34.07 % for micro, small and medium enterprises, 7.83 % for export, education and housing. Three language policy Chairing the meeting, Mr. Patil asked bankers to learn the local language to draw more people to banking. He asked bankers to print all forms and challans in three languages, including Kannada, and use Kannada at the top in all name boards. Referring to complaints by bank customers, particularly in rural areas, about bank staff not being able to use the local language Kannada for bank transactions, Mr. Patil said that it was mandatory to follow the three language policy and Kannada should be compulsorily used in banks. He also asked bankers to take action against those not following the policy and also inform all other branches about the action taken. Such a step would help create more awareness on the use of local language, he said. On loan adjustment, Mr. Patil asked the bank officials not to adjust the compensation towards crop loss and house damage credited to farmers accounts with loan repayments. There were also complaints about MGNREGA wages being adjusted with loan repayment, which, he said, should not be done. Such adjustments would force the rural residents to stay away from banking and they would finally end up in the clutches of moneylenders, he added. Chief Executive Officer of Zilla Panchayat B. Susheela too emphasised on the need for banking staff to converse in local languages and said that bankers had a greater responsibility in successfully implementing government schemes. District Lead Bank Chief Manager R. Annaiah said that priority should be given to use of Kannada in daily banking works and opportunities should be provided to banking staff from other States to learn the local language. This apart, help desks should be set up in all banks to assist customers. Regional Manager of Bank of Baroda Mati Chakravarthi, Deputy Chief Manager of NABARD Mayur Kamble and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dharwad-gets-rs-9473-crore-potential-linked-credit-plan/article33467707.ece

He told the council of the corporation in its meeting that the service providers should remove such hanging cables posing danger to pedestrians and vehicles, on their own by January 6. If not, the civic body will jump into action. The corporation commissioner said that the service providers have been given time till January 6 to provide details on the overhead cables drawn by them. The civic body will assess later how many of them are authorised ones. Earlier, councillor Naveen R. D’Souza told the council that some service providers, including telecom operators, have tied (drawn) their cables to the electricity poles without the permission from the civic body. They should have obtained no objection from the corporation for them as the hanging cables posed danger to the lives of people in many places. On the other hand, the civic body too has lost revenue as the service providers have drawn their lines free. Mayor Diwakar said that he will call a meeting on January 11 to discuss issues pertaining to traffic management in the city. Senior police officials too will be invited to the meeting to address the issues. Councillors said that some building owners have allotted space reserved for parking to run commercial activities. Parking space in such buildings should be restored. Replying to this, the Mayor said that when the authorities are removing such commercial stalls, none of the councillors should intervene to prevent the eviction drive. The Mayor said that another meeting will be called to discuss the issues related to digging roads and roadside spaces multiple times by various service providers to lay underground utility lines. The meeting is aimed at facilitating co-ordination among service providers to lay their utility lines together with mutual co-ordination to prevent digging roads multiple times. Sudhir Shetty Kannur, a councillor, said that New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT) has taken steps to reserve five acres of land to build a gou shala to house stray cattle, especially in the Panambur area. Earlier, some members expressed concern that stray cattle in the Panambur area are coming in the way of traffic safety especially on the National Highway 66.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/service-providers-told-to-remove-dangerous-cables/article33468270.ece
01 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||From biometric glitches to EPFO visits, life certificate issues haunt pensioners||Seventy-year-old Kavita D’Souza (name changed) from Gorigudda in the city recently gave her fingerprint on the biometric device with the postman who arrived at the house for updating her life certificate for receiving pension. However, a month after she gave the fingerprint, the senior citizen received an SMS from her bank stating that her life certificate has not been updated yet. When her son visited the bank to enquire about it, the officials concerned asked him to bring his aged mother to the branch at Valencia stating that her life certificate has not been updated. He told The Hindu that it was strange to hear from the bank which is not a pension granting authority that the records had not been updated. “As my mother was not in a position to go out due to COVID-19 restrictions, I had to insist that the bank officials visit the house from where they took her signature,” he said. Patrick Lobo, a retired teacher from Puttur, said that he was asked by his bank officials to get the pension form from outside and submit it. “I refused to do so and made the bank officials give the form,” he said. The process of submitting life certificate at branches of banks where senior citizens received their pension was smooth during pre-COVID-19 days. This process had to be completed by November every year. In the light of COVID-19, the Employment Provident Fund Organisation has extended the time limit for submitting the life certificate till February 28, 2021. Apart from visiting pension disbursing bank branches, life certificate can be submitted at Common Service Centres or by taking the services of postmen on pensioners’ doorsteps. The EPFO has said that pension will not be stopped during this extended period. Retired lecturer H. Rajeeva Shetty said that like many other senior citizens, his fingerprints were not recognised by the device in his pension bank branch in Hebri. “The bank personnel verified my signature and completed the process,” he said. But not all bank staff have consideration for senior citizens and they force them to visit EPFO, the Common Service Centres or the post office to complete the process amid the risk of contracting COVID-19, said Vittal Shetty, president of Pensioners Welfare Association in Puttur. A spokesperson from EPFO, Mangaluru, told The Hindu that it is the primary responsibility of the pension disbursing bank to facilitate smooth submission of life certificate. “If the fingerprint is not recognised on the device, the bank should use an iris scanner. The banks should help in completing the process and not shift their responsibility on other agencies. We pay service charges to each bank,” he said. Dakshina Kannada District Lead Bank Manager Praveen M.P. said that in the case of a senior citizen’s fingerprints not being read by a biometric device, the Union and State governments have permitted bank managers to take signatures of senior citizens and complete the process of issuing life certificate. “But this option is not given by EPFO to its pensioners and banks are forced to send such senior citizens to Common Service Centres and EPFO,” he said. Banks fear that the use of the iris scanner may scale up the chances of spreading COVID-19. Mr. Praveen said that he will shortly take up the concerns raised by senior citizens with representatives of the five nationalised banks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/from-biometric-glitches-to-epfo-visits-life-certificate-issues-haunt-pensioners/article33467714.ece
01 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Results show our capacity to win more than 150 Assembly seats’||The performance of candidates supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the gram panchayat elections signals the party’s capacity to win more than 150 seats in the forthcoming Assembly elections, said Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel here on Thursday. Talking to reporters, Mr. Kateel said that more than 55% of the total seats in the gram panchayats in the State have been won by candidates supported by the BJP. “This performance shows that the party is no longer just the face of urban areas but also that of rural region. This performance is far more than we expected and it shows the strong organisational presence of the party in the rural areas,” he said. Mr. Kateel said that the candidates supported by the party have done well in regions such as Kanakapura, Mandya, Hassan and Kolar, where the party was considered to be weak. The party has won 13 of the 15 Assembly seats in the recent by-elections and also done well in the Legislative Council elections. “The gram panchayat polls results are sending out a message on our capacity to win more than 150 Assembly seats (in the forthcoming elections),” he said and added that the results show the trust villagers have in the B.S. Yediyurappa and Narendra Modi’s governments. Dakshina Kannada district president of the BJP Sudershan Moodbidri said that of the 220 gram panchayats in the district, BJP-backed candidates will rule in 145 gram panchayats, while Congress-backed candidates will rule in 44 gram panchayats. In the remaining 27 gram panchayats, BJP-backed candidates hope to rule in a majority of them with support from a major portion of the 106 Independent candidates, he said.  Performance shows that party is no longer just the face of urban areas but also that of rural region, says State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/results-show-our-capacity-to-win-more-than-150-assembly-seats/article33468281.ece
01 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Corpn. seeks 10 acres for additional water supply infrastructure||Considering the increasing demand for water in the city, Mangaluru City Corporation has urged the State government to allot it 10 acres of government land (river paramboku land) on the banks of the Netravathi at Adyar to have its additional water augmentation and water supply infrastructure there, as it has in Thumbe. The land has been sought either to build a new jackwell to lift drinking water for the city, house its pumping station or to have a water storage facility as a new bridge-cum-barrage is now being constructed across the Netravathi on the downstream of the Thumbe vented dam at Adyar. Speaking at a meeting of the council of the corporation here on Thursday, commissioner of the corporation Akshy Sridhar said that he wrote to the Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner on December 22 requesting reservation of 10 acres on survey number 57. The land is required to set up facilities to meet the future demand of water in the city. Hailing the action of the corporation commissioner, Whip in the council Premananda Shetty said that the civic body should seriously think of finding additional sources of water to meet future requirements. The focus should not be only on expanding the water distribution network. The bridge-cum-barrage coming up at Adyar could be used as another source of water supply in addition to the existing vented dam at Thumbe. The corporation commissioner sought the land after obtaining a technical opinion from K.P. Jayaram, Individual Consultant, Regional Project Management Unit, Karnataka Integrated Urban Water Management Investment Program (KIUWMIP), under Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC). The consultant in his report said that a scheme for augmentation of bulk water supply is most essential within next 10 years to meet shortfall in bulk supply to sustain the on-going round-the-clock drinking water supply scheme in the city and to manage it. KUIDFC has already taken up Jalasiri project in the city for the corporation for round-the-clock water supply. Mr. Sridhar told the meeting that the civic bodies of Ullal and Mulky owed the corporation Rs. 1.5 crore and Rs. 75 lakh, respectively, as user fee for using water from Thumbe.  ‘A scheme for augmentation of bulk water supply is most essential within next 10 years to meet shortfall in bulk supply to sustain the on-going round-the-clock drinking water supply scheme in the city and to manage it’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/corpn-seeks-10-acres-for-additional-water-supply-infrastructure/article33468271.ece

At a virtual press conference in Bengaluru on Thursday, SCDCC president M.N.

01 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||MUDA all set to crack down on fraudulent transactions||The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) will establish a separate cell to confirm that the property documents are authentic so as to curb fraudulent sale of property based on bogus documents. This was stated by MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev here on Thursday. The new cell will come into being in due course and all purchasers will be advised to get the confirmation or authentication from the MUDA before proceeding with the transaction. He said this was imperative in view of the rise in fraudulent sale of properties by creating bogus documents one of which came to light only recently. Hard-earned money goes down the drain leaving the family in distress and hence the MUDA has decided to take this measure, said Mr. Rajeev. Properties allotted prior to 1987 will be verified within 15 to 30 days and properties allotted post-1991 will be authenticated and verified within a week. The MUDA Chairman said financial institutions including banks that give loan for housing and purchase of property have been apprised of advising their clients to get the documents verified and authenticated by the MUDA before processing the loan applications so as to help curb fraudulent sales. The proposed task force to deal exclusively with fraudulent transactions in properties and encroachment of land and get them cleared, is also set to be a reality in the coming months and has received in-principle approval from the authorities. The MUDA had proposed the task force in November and the Ministry concerned and the authorities have agreed for its creation on the lines of the task force in the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA). Mr. Rajeev said the dedicated task force can help expedite the investigations pertaining to illegal transactions and even clear encroachments of MUDA property on a priority basis. “We recently met the Minister concerned and senior police officials who have agreed to expedite the constitution of the task force’’, said Mr. Rajeev, expressing confidence that a government notification or order in this regard would be issued in due course. The MUDA has also taken measures and projects to ensure that drinking water is supplied to the newly created layouts and has committed itself to fund partially the Haleunduwadi drinking water project. The MUDA’s contribution to the entire project has been pegged at Rs. 75 crore against which it has set aside Rs. 25 crore in the 2020-21 budget. It has also released Rs. 5 crore for establishing drinking water treatment plant for Kabini 2nd stage project. Mr. Rajeev said MUDA has also decided to appoint retired engineers from KPTCL and KUWSDB to harness their expertise and experience on water supply and power projects in MUDA layouts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/muda-all-set-to-crack-down-on-fraudulent-transactions/article33467878.ece
01 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Anti-tobacco cell cracks the whip||The Mysuru District Tobacco Control Cell has come across a large quantity of smuggled brands and illegal advertisements by tobacco product companies during its enforcement drives across the city. The enforcement drives, which had been suspended due to COVID-19, resumed last week after the District Tobacco Control Cell (DTCC) obtained permission from the police to carry out surprise inspection of shops, tea stalls, kiosks and other commercial establishments for enforcement of Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) 2003. Due to lax enforcement during the pandemic, publicity material advertising the products of tobacco companies had proliferated across shops, tea stalls and kiosks in violation of Section 5 of COTPA 2003 that prohibits display of advertisement of cigarettes or any other tobacco product. Also, the menace of smuggled cigarettes had risen considerably during the period with the contraband cigarettes available easily in shops. The smuggled cigarettes not only come without pictorial warnings on the packets, but also cost far less than the regular cigarettes available in the market. The DTCC officials are having the publicity material of tobacco companies removed from the shops and warning the shop owners of penal action if such advertisements are put up again. With regard to the availability of the smuggled cigarettes, the officials have drawn up a plan of action, which will be implemented in the coming days. Meanwhile, Shivakumar G., Consultant for Mysuru District Tobacco Control Cell, told The Hindu that they had carried out enforcement drives in 10 out of the 18 police station limits in the city during the last one week. Till Wednesday, the DTCC had booked a total of 325 cases for violation of Section 4 of COTPA dealing with smoking in public places, Section 6 A and 6 B, which deal with selling tobacco products to minors below 18 years of age and sale of tobacco products within a radius of 100 metres from an educational institution respectively. A total fine of Rs. 47,250 had been collected from the 325 cases. On Thursday, the DTCC drive had yielded Rs. 7,750 in penalty from 65 cases booked in Udayagiri and Lashkar police station limits till evening, Mr. Shivakumar said. Most of the penalty had come in form of cases booked against smoking in public places. “We are booking both smokers as well as the shop and tea stall owners. The tea stall owners, who do not put up the specified signages of No Smoking, are also booked”, he said. The enforcement drives by the DTCC teams comprising officials from Health and Police departments will continue till the areas in all the 18 police station limits of the city are covered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/anti-tobacco-cell-cracks-the-whip/article33467882.ece

Karanth Road”. They said Rangayana is mainly accessed through the main gate on the road that leads to Kukkarahalli Lake junction and all visitors to the repertory make use of this entry though there is an access way from the main entrance of Kalamandira on Hunsur Road. In the letter, Rangayana said B.V. Karanth was known as “Ranga Bheeshma” in Indian theatre. His contributions to Kannada theatre were immense. The contributions and services of Karanth to Mysuru, Mysuru Rangayana, Mysuru theatre artistes were invaluable. Every theatre person reveres him today because of his work to the growth of theatre. In his memory, the road from Kalamandira Circle till Kukkarahalli Lake Circle should be named after him, demanded many theatre artistes who had assembled at the meet. Some theatre artistes who were in the campaign said the contributions of Karanth were key for theatre movement in the State and the Rangayana has now emerged as a premier theatre repertory because of his vision. The road was developed only after Rangayana was founded, they said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rangayana-wants-mcc-to-name-road-after-bv-karanth/article33467880.ece

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Decoding 2021: Experts’ view on the road ahead||As we bid an eager goodbye to a pandemic-hit year that was marked by tragic deaths, major health implications, drastic changes in the way we live and work, job losses and pay cuts, and labour crisis, 2021 will be anything but a smooth ride. A variant of the coronavirus poses a new threat, even as more sectors reopen cautiously. Experts tell us what to expect this year, and what we can do to mitigate the fresh bout of challenges. HEALTH  Giridhara R. Babu, professor, Head-Lifecourse Epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bengaluru. He is a member of State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee  I hope in 2021, the State allocates at least 5% of the State GDP to address health promotion and disease prevention, including strengthening surveillance and outbreak response. The State should employ better-trained workforce in public health, and provide clinical services by creating separate cadres and increasing the salary comparable to CGHS scales. Increased emphasis on research and technical reviews of ongoing programmes should guide the implementation of the public health programs. Instead of adhocism to seek expert advice, the State should constitute an autonomous public health committee and regulate the programmes’ implementation. I hope the outlook to manage health changes, from sickness resolving approach to truly empowering social change, facilitated by the government as a catalyst. ECONOMY  Narendra Pani, professor and dean, School of Social Sciences, National Institute of Advanced Studies  The year 2021 will reveal just how much Karnataka has learned from the pandemic. Some of the lessons could be very positive. The information technology companies that are able to arrive at the right mix of work-from-home and attendance in office could develop noticeable cost advantages. The more difficult lessons would be in manufacturing. As workers come under pressure to step up productivity or accept lower wages, or both, much would depend on how they react. And if the overall socio-political climate is one that encourages violence of different kinds, it would be futile to expect the workplace to be immune from the larger emerging culture of aggressive intimidation. EDUCATION  Rishikesh B.S., associate professor, Azim Premji University  Schools have already begun to commence in a phased manner, but until the pandemic is over, we should expect short closures for sanitising every time positive cases are detected. Decentralised decision making at the panchayat level is the key. The inadequacy of online learning has led to some State Education Departments adopting more direct teaching-learning processes such as Vidyagama in Karnataka. This will be the way forward till the pandemic is under control. The key issue to tackle will be ‘loss of earlier learning’ or ‘academic regression’ – and as with anything else impact will be deeper for disadvantaged groups. As suggested by NEP 2020, the time is apt for curriculum revision such that the focus is on the core essentials in every subject. This is an educationally sound way to move forward than attempting to finish syllabus. There is also the possibility of many children dropping out of school altogether. Schools will have to understand this and help children through it. LAW AND ORDER  S.T. Ramesh, former Director General and Inspector General of Police, Karnataka  The police should be watchful of fresh waves of the pandemic. It is inevitable that they will be involved in the entire gamut including vaccination work such as transport, storage, distribution, and manning of vaccination centres. The economic downturn caused by the pandemic will have its fallout in higher crime rate particularly cyber, white collar and economic crimes, and those with newer modus operandi. If contentious national issues like the farmers’ and doctors’ agitations gain momentum, they may have to be handled with patience. 2021 is likely to be anything but easy for Karnataka police. ENVIRONMENT  Siddhartha Krishnan, sociologist and historian of conservation and sustainability, faculty at ATREE, Bengaluru  Urban oriented economic growth is inequitable and risky, we learnt this pandemic year. Lockdowns forced a painful retreat of rural migrants. But they also curtailed emissions and pollution; and pleasantly enhanced wildlife presence. But 2020 is also an unlearning watershed. We should expect to discard some policy and personal habits in 2021. We expect State governments to stop treating rural migrants as cheap and needy labour source to build and service unsustainable cities like Bengaluru, and that they legislate dignified earning and living opportunities. Another prospect is decongesting cities through hybrid work from office and home arrangements. This pollution reducing effort must be alert to domestic abuse, as men spend more time at home. TRAVEL AND TOURISM  Sanjar Imam, president, Karnataka Tourism Forum  Will people want to travel again and go on holidays? Yes, surely. One thing is certain; we won’t be able to travel as freely as we used to. Group travel itself, whether to make acquaintances or save money, will reduce as travelling with strangers will always seem suspect. Large-scale conferences and conventions will also go through a transformation and perhaps give rise to a different model of congregation. Selecting an airline will not just depend on airfare, but also hygiene, seating configuration, and preventive procedures. The role of travel advisors will become increasingly important as travellers will seek updated information and guidance. TRANSPORT  Ashish Verma, associate professor, Transportation Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru  As economic activities inch closer to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2021, traffic congestion and connected externalities of tailpipe emissions are also expected to reach pre-pandemic levels. Adding to the problem, automobile sales are likely to spike due to perception of higher virus risk on public transport. On the brighter side, government initiatives and policies on promoting walking and cycling will scale up and will lead to some modal shift towards them. However, public transport undertakings are likely to continue their struggle in regaining ridership at least till first half of 2021, after which and based on vaccination status, commuters confidence in using public transport may return. AGRICULTURE  Prakash Kammaradi, retired professor of agricultural economics, UASB; former chairman, Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission, GoK  To gauge livelihood status of farmers instantaneously, an innovative Farmers’ Livelihood Index may be thought of. A fully empowered and statutory body such as Farmers Income Commission should be established immediately. Withholding of formalising farm Acts and a special Parliament or Assembly sessions for threadbare discussions on all aspects of farm economy and farmers livelihood security may be best face-saving option for BJP-headed governments in the Centre and the State. Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission, in its report submitted to government during 2018, recommended an elaborate road map to ensure a minimum 50% profit margin while announcing MSP, as recommended by National Commission on Farmers headed by M.S. Swaminathan. Utilisation of procured farm commodities for public distribution, various ongoing welfare programmes is a win-win solution for farmers and poor consumers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decoding-2021-experts-view-on-the-road-ahead/article33467711.ece

In a press meet at Thodupuzha on Thursday, Mr. Surendran said those who passed the resolution against the farm laws passed in Parliament were the ones who had passed a resolution to release People’s Democratic Party leader Abdul Nasir Maudany from jail. He questioned the rationale of the State Assembly passing a resolution on what he termed a politically motivated agitation in New Delhi. People considered the Assembly as a respectable place and they would realise those who misused it for narrow political gains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/surendran-flays-house-resolution/article33467822.ece

Chandran Madayan to continue pooja. In the order, P. Mohanadas, judicial member of the commission, said efforts to end worship at the temple would not be allowed under any circumstances. The order was issued on a complaint by Chandran Madayan that a few people had been taking law into their own hands and attempting to disturb the daily affairs of the temple. The SHRC made it clear that in case of a dispute over the temple, it should be settled through a civil court, mediation, or Adalat. The Commission also ordered that police protection should be given for the temple festival scheduled to be held on January 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shrc-orders-police-protection-for-festival/article33467747.ece
01 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fort Kochi witnesses a lull in New Year revelry||The noticeable lull in tourist arrivals owing to the pandemic situation, especially to Fort Kochi, hitherto the hub for New Year celebrations in the district, has been further dampened by the slow progress of work undertaken by Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) in the heritage zone. With pre-cast slabs and other concrete structures being stacked on footpaths and many other open spaces in the area for the past several months, residents and tourism stakeholders are in a fix, unable to freely move around or take the few guests who arrive on walking tours. So much so that the area where ‘Pappanji’ was burnt in effigy (as part of the annual Cochin Carnival celebrations) on New Year Eve of 2019, too has such items in abundance. “We appreciate all the road and drainage improvement work that is on at the locale. But the inordinate delay in completing them and concrete structures lying around the famed heritage streets are dissuading people from venturing out,” said a prominent hospitality stakeholder. Meanwhile, CSML sources said the delay in completing work and pre-cast materials remaining stacked beside roads occurred due to a host of reasons. “We had no alternative storage space. Delay on the part of a contractor in completing work further upset our schedule. In addition, we had to substitute conventional slabs with cobble stones in locales like Vasco Da Gama Square, after heritage agencies insisted on it,” they added. The other reasons include a section of house owners opposing laying of pre-cast drains in front of houses. Many were worried about the safety of heritage buildings that abutted the road, while there were several who had encroached on the drainage space and roads. A stop memo issued by the Archaeological Survey of India for work near St. Francis Church in Fort Kochi and the Dutch Palace in Mattancherry, which was later lifted, too caused delay. The cancellation of the Cochin Carnival owing to the pandemic too contributed to the New Year losing its conventional sheen in Fort Kochi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fort-kochi-witnesses-a-lull-in-new-year-revelry/article33468239.ece
01 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Left Front wins Vazhakkulam||The Left Democratic Front (LDF) added one more block panchayat to its kitty, thus striking parity with the United Democratic Front (UDF) after both its president and vice president candidates emerged victorious in the elections held in Vazhakkulam block panchayat on Thursday. K.M. Anwar Ali of the CPI(M) was sworn in as president and his party colleague Aji Teacher as his deputy. Both fronts now hold the reigns of power in seven block panchayats each. Elections in Vazhakkulam block panchayat had to be postponed on Wednesday owing to lack of quorum. The LDF has six members, UDF five, and Twenty20, the Kizhakkambalam-based corporate outfit, four members in the Vazhakkulam block panchayat. Twenty20 stays away As in the previous day, Twenty20 members stayed away, leaving the winning candidates from the LDF with six votes each against five votes bagged by the UDF. The UDF members who boycotted the poll on Wednesday had a change of heart, as they fielded Shemeer Thugalil of the Congress and Shajitha Naushad of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) as the presidential and vice presidential candidates respectively. The UDF had initially boycotted the election, alleging that the LDF had resorted to a similar ploy in Vengola panchayat, where it was in line to emerge the winner, after Twenty20 members had chosen to stay away. In Vengola panchayat, the UDF has nine members to eight members of Twenty20, and six of the LDF. Following the imbroglio, the election in Vengola also had to be postponed on Wednesday for want of quorum. Eventually, the UDF emerged victorious in the panchayat when the election was held on Thursday but not without some drama. Members of the LDF and Twenty20 stayed away from the polls. While presidential candidate M.D. Hameed of the Congress romped home with all the nine UDF votes, the winning vice presidential candidate Shamla Nazeer from the IUML received one vote less after the party-backed Independent candidate Nazeema Rahim stayed away from voting. Issues in IUML At one point, internal bickerings in the IUML were such that the Congress fleetingly toyed with the idea of taking over the post if its ally could not reach a consensus. In Vazhakkulam grama panchayat, Gopalakrishnan of the CPI was elected unopposed as president, since the UDF, despite having a majority of 11 members to the LDF’s nine, had to forego the post, since it did not have an eligible candidate for the post reserved for the Scheduled Caste (General) category. The UDF’s Shajeena Hydrose was elected vice president on Wednesday but could not take oath since the president who is supposed to administer oath could not be elected for want of quorum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/left-front-wins-vazhakkulam/article33468241.ece

The Kochi-based public sector undertaking focuses on inland water transport, coastal shipping, and tourism. The revenue from Nefertiti , the luxury cruise vessel owned by KSINC, went up from Rs. 69.84 lakh to Rs. 2.4 crore in the last fiscal. It could not meet its expected annual revenue owing to lockdown restrictions. Sagararani , a deluxe mini cruise vessel, which offers trips up to the Arabian Sea, is also generating substantial income for the agency. Mr. Prasanth said with a targeted revenue of Rs. 50 crore in the current financial year and Rs. 100 crore for the next, KSINC was fast approaching the completion of various tourist boat and allied construction ventures like Malabar-Malanad River Cruise Circuit (Rs. 4.69 crore), Ashtamudi Lake Circuit (Rs. 2.37 crore), Kumarakom, Changanassery and Kodimatha water sports (all three at Rs. 83 lakh each). “The boats for the prestigious Malabar-Malanadu River Cruise Circuit will be ready for operation by the first week of February 2021. The construction of high-speed watercraft, a six-seater water taxi, is in the final stages, and it will be operational by the second week of February. Five boats, including a water taxi, two family cruise vessels, and a pair of thematic cruise services, will be operational by the first week of May 2021,” he added. Thirty-six kayaks were supplied to the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) Kottayam, and the construction of Shikkara boats is in progress. Their delivery is scheduled for March. In addition, trials are scheduled for January for jet skis (for Kollam DTPC) and four-seater speed boat for Neyyar Dam (DTPC Thiruvananthapuram). The construction of the 48-seater catamaran boat for Kollam and a 25-seater for Neyyar dam are progressing. The expansion of the business operations of KSINC to Odisha, Bihar, and Lakshadweep too is making progress after relaxation of lockdown restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksinc-poised-for-growth-despite-setback/article33467823.ece

01 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Helping jumbo herds re-establish contacts across manmade barriers||The isolated elephant population of the Anayirangal area may soon walk along road overpasses to cross the Munnar-Bodimettu stretch of NH 85 and re-establish contacts with the herds elsewhere. The Kerala Forest Department has proposed three such facilities, two at Anayirangal and one at Lockhart Gap, to allow the movement of wild animals, especially elephants. The elephant corridors in the area have been disrupted due to land use changes and blocking of passages. The construction of resorts and developments taking place along the NH stretch have been identified as major hazards. The disruptions in the corridors have led to frequent human-elephant conflicts. As many as 23 persons have lost their lives in human-elephant conflicts since 2010. The Forest Department had paid Rs. 15.6 crore as compensation to the victims in the Munnar division between 2011 and 2019, and a lion’s share went to the victims from the Anayirangal region. Incidents of retaliatory killing of elephants were also reported at Anayirangal, the report pointed out. The “elephant population in the Anayirangal region is gradually becoming disconnected from other habitats” and the area supports around 28 to 32 elephants, which are actively breeding. The population is likely to increase further, predicts the report prepared by M.V.G. Kannan, Divisional Forest Officer, Munnar. The Rs. 28.64-crore mitigation proposal, said Surendrakumar, which was prepared at the instance of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, had been submitted for approval. The widening and associated developments along NH 85 have impeded the elephant movements towards the Mathikettanshola National Park and further south. There were four major crossings with the shortest connection between Anayirangal and the Mathikettanshola National Park, it was pointed out. If two major connections are established across the NH without any disturbances, the elephants can be directed towards these locations through funnelling systems by setting up effective barriers in other areas. Elephant movement can be channelised at these locations either through underpass or overpass with effective sound and visual barriers, the report said. Once approved, the National Highways Authority of India will undertake the project, said Mr. Kannan. Creation of artificial ramps to aid elephants cross the roads at places where sharp vertical retaining wall or sharp cuttings were constructed, relocation of settlements in elephant corridors and re-establishment of habitat connectivity have also been suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/helping-jumbo-herds-re-establish-contacts-across-manmade-barriers/article33467841.ece

The incident occurred in early November. According to the police, Ratheesh has been serving as warden since 2014 and has no criminal antecedents. They did not divulge further details, citing orders from the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. “We arrested the accused within 24 hours of receiving the complaint, and he is now behind bars. Two separate cases were registered following complaints of sexual abuse of two minor boys,” police sources said. ‘Smear campaign’ Meanwhile, officials at the children’s home said a politically motivated smear campaign was under way on social media against the institute by deliberately creating the impression that the incident happened only the other day, while it took place nearly two months ago. “The warden was ousted since then, and the two victims have been shifted to another institute. It was the first such incident to be reported since we started functioning in 2005. We have all along complied with all regulations as required under the Juvenile Justice Act as per which the institute has been registered,” said an official with the children’s home. The Child Welfare Committee and the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) had intervened in the matter and recorded the statements of all residents, including the two victims, of the institution. It was based on the DCPU’s report that the police registered a case. The children’s home originally accommodated 30 boys aged between five and 17, including orphans, homeless, and those from impoverished families. However, the number has since dropped to 16 after some residents who returned home on vacation were allowed by the DCPU to stay put, if that helped them pursue their online classes in the wake of the pandemic.  Two separate cases were registered following complaints of sexual abuse of two minor boys, say police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/warden-arrested-on-sexual-abuse-charges/article33468242.ece

Biju, 46, wife Ambily, 40, and their 15-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son were found hanging in two different rooms. The family used to sell milk, and the incident came to light when a woman from the neighbourhood came to collect milk found an empty milk bottle and the door closed. There was no response despite repeated knocks on the door, and it was then that the woman noticed a note kept beneath the empty bottle. The note reportedly said there was no milk for the day, and that “the family was going to die.” It also referred to debts and the amount owed by the family. Subsequently, the woman mobilised people from the neighbourhood who broke open the door, only to find the family members dead. They alerted the Perumbavoor police who rushed to the scene. Financial issues faced by Biju after a chit fund he used to run had gone bust reportedly drove the family to the extreme step. It is learnt that Biju had asked his debtors to drop in at his home to get the dues cleared on Thursday. The police found two separate notes addressed to two women in the immediate neighbourhood with whom Ambily used to have close contact. Biju, it is learnt, had been to Thodupuzha reportedly to raise funds, probably to pay off debts. Scribblings found on the walls of the house mentioned a few names, reportedly of the family’s relatives, with a message not to let them see the dead bodies. The police said the family was not in good terms with their relatives. Forensic experts inspected the house. The bodies were shifted to Government Medical College, Kalamassery.

Besides, Mayor Beena Philip has also the responsibility to complete Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Rural Transformation (Amrut) projects of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development. Kozhikode is one of the cities that lags behind in the implementation of Amrut schemes among the nine civic bodies in the State. The State average on expenditure is 41.67% whereas Kozhikode’s average spending is 34.20%. Projects are being implemented in areas of water supply, sewerage and septage management, stormwater drainage, urban transport, and green spaces and parks. The revised cost of the 50 projects is Rs. 284.64 crore. As many as 30 of the projects had been completed during the previous tenure of the council. Technical sanctions had also been secured for unfinished projects. Main challenge A challenging task is implementing the three schemes under sewerage and septage management. So far, tenders have been awarded for one of them. The allocation for the three schemes is estimated at Rs. 130.62 crore. The scheme in urban transport has been completed. Twenty-two out of the 28 schemes in water supply, two out of the 10 stormwater drainage projects and five out of the eight green space and parks have been completed. All the 28 projects in the area of water supply worth Rs. 65.58 crore implemented by the Kerala Water Authority have been completed. The urban local body is the implementing agency in four sectors. Only 18.16% spending has been done in these categories till now. Usually, civic bodies go through an uncertain phase towards the end of the financial year while implementing Plan projects. The COVID-19 lockdown and local body polls have caused a delay in execution of projects. Mobilising resources will be a challenge for new district panchayat president Kanathil Jameela to implement Plan projects in the three-tier local bodies in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plan-amrut-projects-completion-a-big-challenge-for-new-heads/article33467751.ece

All tourism destinations, including beaches and parks, remained closed after 6 p.m. on Thursday. Those who visited the Kozhikode beach before the deadline were asked to go back after 7 p.m. The entry of children below the age of 10 had already been banned. Adhering to the health protocol, hotels and event management teams did not host any special New Year events with mass participation. Only special buffets and a few music concerts were hosted instead of the usual DJ parties and dance events. The number of participants was also restricted. Open concerts in public places and auditoriums were also not held. However, the vacuum was filled with small family gatherings and cake-cutting ceremonies. Officials said restrictions would be in place on the New Year Day as well on account of public safety. Unlike the previous year, the number of tourists from abroad and other States were minimal. Flash inspections The police had already asked resort and homestay owners to communicate in advance the details of such visitors and keep a record of their whereabouts. Police sources said they had been working for over a month to prevent all drug and liquor parties during New Year celebrations in tourism spots. Flash inspections had been conducted in many locations to check the storage of smuggled liquor and narcotic stuff. National and State highways and check-posts had been under the surveillance of special patrol squads by police and excise departments. Officials with the District-Level Anti Narcotic Special Action Force said they could seize nearly 75 kg of ganja and other narcotic substances during the special checking conducted within the past three weeks. The local police also had helped conduct surprise inspection of inter-State vehicles, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/curbs-in-place-for-new-year-revelries/article33467746.ece

A satellite station within the city limit is also under consideration of the government. According to Fire and Rescue Services officials, the new fire stations will come up in Ramanattukara, Mavoor, Puthuppadi, Chelannur and Kozhikode city. Land for constructing the new station buildings is already available in all locations except in Ramanattukara. Here, the new municipal administration is likely to address the issue soon. Kozhikode district now has nine fire units at Kozhikode beach, Meenchanda, Narikkuni, Vellimadukunnu, Mukkom, Perambra, Vadakara, Nadapuram and Koyilandy. The new stations will have high-end firefighting equipment and required staff strength. The existing stations will also be equipped with modern machines. Fire officials say the sanctioning of a station at Puthuppadi has been a long-pending demand of villagers hit by natural calamities. Reaching out to such locations on time during calamities has been a strenuous job for rescue operators from other stations, they add. Officials say underwater rescue facilities will also improve in the district with the opening of new stations. The satellite fire station to be opened near the railway station will mainly function as the first respondent to rescue calls. It was in 2015 that the proposal for such a facility was first placed for the consideration of the State government. The main concern then was the frequent fire outbreak on S.M.

Mr. Vijith was found hanging in the early hours of Thursday. He was immediately rushed to a private hospital, from where he was shifted to the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode.

01 January 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||LDF expels Ranni panchayat president from coalition||A day after her election as president of the Ranni grama panchayat with Bharatiya Janata Party support, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Thursday decided to expel Sobha M. Charley, a member of the Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)], from the coalition. The decision to expel Ms. Charley from the five-member LDF parliamentary party of the panchayat followed her refusal to step down from the post despite repeated demands. Earlier, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] had demanded that the KC(M) seek the resignation of Ms. Charley, in vain. The latest move, however, is not going to have any significant impact for the time being as the successful adoption of a no-confidence motion against the incumbent president will also require the support of the United Democratic Front (UDF) members in the local body. Further, the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 stipulates that no motion seeking want of confidence be accepted within six months of the assumption of office by a president, said a top CPI(M) leader. In the 13-member grama panchayat, both the UDF and the LDF have five members each while the BJP has two members. The remaining member is an Independent. In the election, UDF candidate K.R. Prakash had received six votes against the seven votes to Ms. Charley. However, the UDF nominee Sindhu Sanjayan later defeated the LDF to become the local body’s vice president. In a quandary The election of Ms. Charley with BJP support put the LDF in a quandary as its presidents in at least four grama panchayats across the State had already stepped down citing that they did not wish to hold the posts with the support of the Social Democratic Party of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-expels-ranni-panchayat-president/article33467762.ece

01 January 2021||S. Anil Radhakrishnan,KERALA||FASTags to be made mandatory from Feb.15||Though the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to defer collection of user fee at toll plazas only through FASTags till February 15, 2021, the NHAI is to keep up the momentum and improve electronic toll collection for seamless movement of vehicles. The NHAI decision to begin user fee collection through cashless mode only from February 15, 2021 came on Thursday when the authorities were gearing up to enforce user fee through FASTag from Friday. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) had earlier made FASTags mandatory on all four-wheelers in the country from January 1, 2021. Now, the NHAI had asked its regional officers and project implementation units to carry out trial runs frequently at toll plazas and educate and convince road users to adopt the FASTag and carry out frequent checking of the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) equipment to ensure maximum collection of the user fee using FASTag. The deferment came when the authorities were to deploy marshals for lane management and set up kisoks with POS to purchase FASTag on the approaches to the Pampampallam, Ponnarimangalam, Paliyekkara, and Kumbalam toll plazas under the NHAI from Friday. As the plan was to avoid collection of user fee in cash at the toll plazas, those without FASTags and those vehicles that were not having sufficient balance was to pay double the user fee to cross over toll plazas.  Vehicle insurance To ensure full compliance, MoRTH had made FASTags mandatory for vehicle insurance. A new third-party vehicle insurance from April 1, 2021 will be issued only if the vehicle has a valid FASTag. Official sources in the NHAI said the local residents within 10 km of the Paliyekkara toll plaza will have to take a monthly pass for Rs. 150 and those near the Pampampallam, Ponnarimangalam, and Kumbalam toll plazas, a Rs. 275-pass to cross over. Toll plazas never offer free rides and the State was not ready to share the cost of the user fee of the local people as agreed with the NHAI, he said. Two more toll plazas are getting ready under the NHAI in the State — Kollam NH 66 bypass and Kazhkuttam-Karode NH 66 bypass. User fee at the Kollam bypass would be collected from the road users in one or two weeks, he added. A flagship initiative of the MoRTH, passive radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is used for collection of the user fee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fastags-to-be-made-mandatory-from-feb15/article33467843.ece
01 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||BJP lands in a predicament in State||The State unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) scrambled to contain the fallout of the arguably major "political gaffe" by its lone legislator O. Rajagopal in the Assembly on Thursday. Mr. Rajagopal seemed to put the BJP in a predicament by appearing to join ranks with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition during the voting on the resolution condemning the contentious farm laws passed by Parliament. Mr. Rajagopal expressed his reservations about the wording of the motion but did not register his dissent during voting. He said the laws had at a stroke eliminated farmer exploitation and defended Prime Minister Narendra Modi's outreach to farmers in the face of strident attacks against the Central government from either side of the aisle. At a press conference soon after, Mr. Rajagopal appeared to contradict himself. He gave the impression that he subscribed to the "consensus" in the Assembly that the Centre should repeal the laws that had pushed farmers on the warpath against the Narendra Modi government. He said "compromise and consensus" and not obstinacy guided democracy. "I support the resolution. I saw no issue," he said. Treasury and Opposition benches attacked Mr. Modi for muscling the laws through both Houses of Parliament without due diligence or discussion. However, the voting that brought the curtains down on the extraordinary one-day session saw Mr. Rajagopal not voting against the resolution. Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan said the House had adopted the motion unanimously. BJP State president K. Surendran was at a loss to explain Mr. Rajagopal's legislative conduct when journalists pressed him in Thodupuzha. Mr. Rajagopal's position appeared to have caught other BJP leaders by surprise. Mr. Rajagopal clarified later that he did not oppose the "Central law or Central government". He had vehemently opposed the State government's resolution. The Speaker had violated custom by not asking whether any person opposed the motion, the MLA said. The LDF portrayed the "unanimous passage" of the resolution damning the Central laws as a moral victory. However, Mr. Surendran said the government's claim rang hollow, and Mr. Rajagopal had held the party's line in the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-lands-in-a-predicament-in-state/article33467846.ece

The motorists need not have to reach the MVD offices for renewal of driving licence, change of address, duplicate driving licence and international driving licence permit. The applications can be submitted online and payments too. The original documents from the MVD will reach the doorstep of the applicant by post. Non-Resident Keralites can renew their driving licence by remaining abroad itself. International driving licence permit can also be taken from abroad itself. Keralites staying in other States can also seek these services online. With this, the practice of collecting stamped covers for sending documents to the applicants has been put to an end. Smart RCs Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran said the work to make available the registration certificate (RC) of motor vehicles and driving licence in smart card was in the final stages. The MVD has entrusted the Kerala Books and Publishing Society with the job and it will be rolled out in two weeks.  The existing practice of issuing the RC and driving licence from the MVD offices would come to an end once the smart cards were provided, he added. All MVD offices would become e-offices from January 1, 2021 as part of paperless offices. Pollution testing centres had gone online as part of providing tamper-proof PUC certificates through genuine checking. Steps for linking the check-posts manned by the MVD in the State online was on, he added. Bus fare Replying to questions, the Minister said the proposal to reduce the bus fare was not under the consideration of the government now. It needed consultation with the stakeholders as it would cause a dip in revenue from the fleet, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/driving-licence-services-go-online/article33467838.ece

While numerous people thronged beaches and other places since afternoon, stringent curbs were imposed for the festivities with the district administration prohibiting celebrations after 10 p.m. At Kovalam The beaches at Kovalam, which normally teem with visitors when the clock strikes midnight and beyond, witnessed several visitors dismayed at being directed to leave the premises at 10 p.m. soon after a firework display. Following microphone announcements advising the revellers to leave the beach, a sizeable police team spread to different directions to vacate the public and traders who hoped to make up for the lack of business during the lockdown and the period until the reopening of the tourist destination. Barring a few, almost all hotels had decided to skip the usual New Year parties that used to have DJ concerts and other attractions.

01 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Let campuses be cradles of democracy: Pinarayi||Stating that student activism was key to the democratic process, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that it remained the responsibility of society to uphold such practices. Educational institutions should remain the cradles of democracy by imparting lessons on parliamentary democracy and social consciousness, he said. He was speaking while inaugurating the valedictory ceremony of the golden jubilee celebrations of the Students Federation of India (SFI) here on Thursday. Bastions of secularism Mr. Vijayan said the State’s campuses had remained bastions of secularism at a time when communal groups had been spreading their influence across several institutions in the country. Besides crediting the campuses as the guardians of secular ideals, he also credited the SFI for making unparalleled contributions to society by moulding civic-minded citizens who had gone on to excel in various avenues, including arts, literature, media, cinema and governance. He opined that student organisations should not restrict their role to contributing leaders and activists to the political arena. Tireless workers “They should also nurture public workers who render yeoman service in various avenues and are capable of leading from the front. The SFI has created many such tireless workers who continue to strive for the welfare of various sections,” he said. Tracing the growth of the CPI(M)-feeder organisation since its inception in 1970, Mr. Vijayan said the SFI had made crucial interventions that had become milestones in the State’s progress. “The organisation has been at the forefront of several struggles, including those against the neo-liberal policies in the education sector, opening up of the education sector to self-financing colleges, denial of financial assistance by banks, granting approval to private polytechnic colleges and the privatisation of medical education,” he said. More emrolment He added that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government had been able to reverse the trend seen elsewhere in the country by ensuring that enrolment in public institutions was on the rise. He said 6.8 lakh students had secured admissions in public schools since the launch of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission in the State. Efforts were also being made to enhance facilities and opportunities in the higher education sector, Mr. Vijayan said. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, Thiruvananthapuram Mayor Arya Rajendran, Left Democratic Front convener and CPI(M) acting State secretary A.

The Vengapotta-based Kazhakuttam-Karode Bypass Action Council’s secretary S. Manirao, treasurer G. Chandran and 25 others who approached the High Court for enhanced compensation and rehabilitation package have got a favourable order, with the court observing that most of those who surrendered land were not paid compensation before December 2014. The petitioners are of the view that the landowners have the right for enhanced compensation as land is taken over for public purpose. The enhanced compensation is being sought under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. While the 2013 Act was under the consideration of the President, the District Purchase Committee entered into an agreement with the owners who surrendered land. The land was acquired by giving only 30% of the price fixed by the District Purchase Committee. The council had demanded Rs. 5.25 lakh a cent for category A land and 10% less for other four categories of land. An arbitrator was appointed following a stir by the council demanding higher compensation for the land. Hike by arbitrators A 15% hike in the compensation and 9% interest were announced by the then arbitrator and District Collector N. Venkatesapathy for 165 persons. Mr. Venkatesapathy’s successor K. Vasuki sanctioned 50% more compensation and 9% interest from the date of notification of land acquisition to 185 persons. But, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) appealed against the decision of the arbitrator. However, the NHAI did not oppose the hike announced by Mr. Venkatesapathy. V. Sudhakaran, chairman of the action council, said the NHAI unnecessarily dragged to court the persons who surrendered their land. The earlier price fixed for the land along with the enhanced compensation declared by the Collector is on par with the price fixed by the District Purchase Committee, which was approved by the NHAI, he says. The council chairman said many others who had surrendered land from the five villages for the Reach II had gone to the court seeking enhanced compensation and rehabilitation packages. Enhanced compensation should be given to all as some lacked the resources to go for litigation, Mr. Sudhakaran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bypass-better-compensation-likely/article33468360.ece
01 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Posters on COVID-19 norms to be pasted in schools||The General Education Department on Thursday released posters on COVID-19 guidelines that will be put up in schools for the benefit of students. Guidelines for use and storage of sanitisers in schools were also issued on Thursday. The Health Department also issued guidelines to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 as students return to school. All students, teachers, and other school staff should wear masks that adequately cover nose and mouth. Masks should not be lowered while speaking. Avoid touching nose, mouth or eyes with hands. Physical distancing should be ensured at all times. Doors and windows of classrooms should be left open. This is because the virus can spread quickly in enclosed spaces. Crowding should be avoided outside classrooms. Students should avoid sharing stationery, lunch or drinking water with others. Hands should be periodically cleaned using soap and water and sanitisers. No one with symptoms of cold or cough or in contact with people with these symptoms should come to school. Focus areas for exams Meanwhile, the Directorate of General Education published the ‘focus’ areas in each subject that would help in clearing of doubts and revision as part of exam preparations. These focus areas have been prepared by the State Council of Educational Research and Training’s subject experts for class 10 and 12 students. This follows the State government’s decision not to reduce the syllabus so that students do not find it more difficult in higher classes next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/posters-on-covid-19-guidelines-released/article33467824.ece
01 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Tree Walk shares concerns to Mayor||Tree Walk, a campaign to protect trees and environment, has urged Mayor Arya Rajendran to formulate a development plan for the city without compromising on the environment. In an open letter on Thursday, Tree Walk, while seeking immediate attention to some grey areas that often get overlooked by planners and decision makers but which have tremendous value to the life of people and communities, has said the focus of the Mayor should be “human welfare on a long term sustainable basis”. “There will be many to advise and direct you. The same quality of being young that is being celebrated all over may soon become your bane. We feel that you can form an independent advisory council of concerned citizens with expertise and experience on all areas that affect human life surpassing the limitations of party politics and other vested interests,” Anitha S., Coordinator, Tree Walk has said. With the help of this team, the Mayor can formulate the Comprehensive Development Plan. ‘Suffocating soil’ Tree Walk has also highlighted specific issues like the haphazard development of the government schools under the city Corporation. As part of modernization, the trend is to lay tiles and suffocate soil and open spaces. It has been proven that exposure to soil and greenery will improve the physical and mental health of children. Along with smart classroom, schools need a steady supply of water, clean toilets, and nutritious mid-day meals. Many spaces in schools are being diverted for purposes other than education. The space in Government Girls High School, Chala, being handed over to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan for a building is a classic example of how a school’s future development has been stopped. Threat to waterbodies The ponds, lakes and wetlands in the city are under threat. The Charachira pond, the Aakulam lake, the Technopark campus are all being concreted in the guise of renovation. Indiscriminate permission for high rises will impact the groundwater table. The greenery in the deserves attention. “In these times of climate change and Urban Heat Island effect, you should initiate a tree health card with the help of a scientific institution,” the letter says. The cutting of the Ficus tree to make space for a new gateway of the city Corporation and the clearing of the Water Works compound for a 1.92-crore children’s park find mention in the letter. It cites waste management as the most important problem. Single-use plastic should be banned and burning of unsegregated waste should be stopped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tree-walk-shares-concerns-to-mayor/article33468345.ece
01 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Govt. adopted appropriate response to Governor: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday denied a United Democratic Front (UDF) charge that the State government had practically kowtowed before Governor Arif Mohammed Khan after the latter denied permission to hold the Assembly session on December 23 to discuss the farm laws. Mr. Vijayan asserted that the Governor could employ discretionary powers only in certain situations and not in all matters. In convening the Assembly, if a government which enjoyed a majority recommended it, the Governor cannot use his discretionary powers, the Chief Minister said on Thursday. He maintained that the State government had adopted the appropriate response to the Governor's decision. UDF leaders were sharply critical of Mr. Khan's decision to turn down the recommendation to convene the Assembly session on December 23. They blamed the government of responding mildly to the Governor's decision. K.C. Joseph of the Congress said the government should have vehemently protested when its constitutional right was violated. “It was most unfortunate. This is not a question of charity. It is the right of an elected government. The response to it was surprising,” he said. He was also highly critical of the government's decision to send Ministers A.K. Balan and V.S. Sunil Kumar to Raj Bhavan to hold talks with Mr. Khan, saying that the government practically fell at the Governor's feet. Anoop Jacob of the Kerala Congress (Jacob) said the Assembly should record its protest against the Governor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-adopted-appropriate-response-to-governor-cm/article33467849.ece

New loans will be available at a base rate of 8%. This is the first time in the history of the KFC that loans are being provided at such a low interest rate. Tomin J. Thacahankary, chairman and managing director, KFC, said on Thursday that the aim was to disburse special loans worth Rs. 1,600 crore over the next three months. Special arrangements had been made to expedite the disbursement of such loans based on project reports. No prior licences or permits were required. Those securing the loan would have to produce the licences within three years. The applicant would get a quick decision on the loan after conducting a face-to-face interview with the top officials at the headquarters via videoconference. Securities which had been twice the amount of the loan were earlier reduced to half now. Instead of the security requirement of Rs. 1 crore to take out a contractor loan, security worth Rs. 50 lakh would be enough. New law The new law requires that buses plying in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, and Kozhikode be converted to CNG-powered or electrical vehicles if they are to run for more than 15 years. “Loans up to Rs. 5 lakh will be provided for older buses depending on the number of cylinders for converting to CNG,” the CMD said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kfc-slashes-interest-rate-for-entrepreneurs/article33467860.ece

With the completion of admission proceedings this year, there will be a further increase in the student strength. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was quoted in the statement as saying that the increase in number of students in State schools was the result of improvement of school infrastructure and quality of education as part of the rejuvenation mission. Public schools had been equipped with digital facilities of international standards. Teachers, parents, and the public too had extended support for the mission. This had helped kick-start a comprehensive change in the State’s education sector, the Chief Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-schools-record-175-lakh-admissions/article33467844.ece

The commission has suggested that members of standing committees be elected before January 12. Elections can be held on either January 7, 8, 11, or 12, it was recommended. The district secretariat of the CPI(M) will soon meet to discuss allocation of chairpersons’ posts among the front constituents. State committee members of the party, including district secretary C.N. Mohanan and Dinesh Mani, will return to Kochi after the two-day State committee meeting, which will begin on January 2. Formal discussions on power-sharing will begin after the State committee meeting, indicated a senior leader of the party. The standing committees in the Kochi Corporation include development, welfare, town planning, works, tax appeal, education, finance, and health. The LDF, which has a strength of 34 members, had wrested power from the United Democratic Front (UDF) with the support of two Independents — T. K. Ashraf and J. Sanilmon. Since the support of the two Independents is crucial for the front to continue in power, both may be offered the posts of chairpersons of standing committees. The CPI(M) is understood to have offered Mr. Ashraf the post of health standing committee chairperson, which he had held five years ago. Mr. Sanilmon will also have to be accommodated, considering the wafer-thin margin of the front in the 74-member council and the coalition dynamics, said a party leader. The Janata Dal, an LDF constituent, is also likely to be allotted one standing committee, and Sheeba Lal, the lone representative of the party, will head a committee. The finance standing committee is headed by Deputy Mayor K.A. Ansiya, a CPI nominee. The party may exert pressure on the LDF for one more post. With 31 members of the Congress and the support of one Congress rebel, the UDF can legitimately hope to get two standing committees. However, it could be reduced to one through careful division of councillors in the eight standing committees, hinted a ruling front leader. It is to be seen how the CPI(M) will accommodate its senior councillors in the remaining committees. A few senior leaders of the party had returned to the council this time after taking a break.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-power-sharing-talks-soon/article33468240.ece

01 January 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Govt. trying its best to bail out ryots’||Even as the coronavirus pandemic and heavy rains delivered a blow on the farmers in the State, the government has been trying its best to bail them out, State Agriculture Commission Vice-Chairman M.V.S. Nagi Reddy has said. The unprecedented rain in several spells across the monsoon season and beyond, which culminated in the incessant precipitation under the influence of Cyclone Nivar sank all the hopes of farmers as crops in lakhs of acres were damaged. Farmers had a tough time in selling their produce owing to the slowdown induced by COVID-19 pandemic. “However, the government did its best to alleviate the sufferings of the farmers amid adverse climatic and market conditions,” said Mr. Naggi Reddy. Farmers got the much-needed relief as the State government had launched market intervention for the farmers cultivating tobacco, turmeric and jowar among other crops, who were left to fend for themselves, he says.  “Paddy growers alone got a benefit of Rs. 15,000 crore, thanks to the market intervention scheme. Bengal gram growers received benefits to the tune of Rs. 966 crore. Further, the government provided input subsidy of Rs. 945 crore to 12 lakh farmers who lost their standing crops in 16.42 lakh acres between June and September, again in October, November-end,” said Mr. Naggi Reddy. He alleged that the previous TDP government had provided the relief to farmers a year or two latter. Further, the government, which was of the view that debt waiver was not a permanent solution to the problems being faced by the farmers, provided a financial benefit to the tune of Rs. 18,900 crore, including capital subsidy of Rs. 13,100 crore to more than 51.59 lakh farmers, he explained. Sectoral growth Despite odds, the State registered a growth rate 16.03% in the agriculture and allied sector in 2020 as against 6.54% in the previous year. The sector had registered a negative growth of 10.54% during the fifth year of the TDP regime, he said quoting a socio-economic survey report. Thanks to the wet spell, the State produced 158 lakh tonnes of food grain during the year, 26.59 lakh tonnes more than the previous year. Despite the best efforts of the government, 82 farmers ended their lives in the State during this fiscal as against 286 in the previous fiscal. The count was far less when compared to 900 during the TDP regime, he said. The YSRCP government had ensured an enhanced compensation of Rs. 7 lakh to the bereaved farmers’ families as against Rs. 5 lakh provided earlier, said Mr. Naggi Reddy. Free power Asserting that the government was committed to providing free power to farmers, Mr. Naggi Reddy said a sum of Rs. 17,430 crore had been spent for the purpose, including clearing arrears of Rs. 8,655 crore that was pending. “The State government has pressed the Markfed into the tobacco sector this year. As a result, farmers in traditional tobacco growing areas in Prakasam district were benefited by Rs. 150 crore,” YSRCP farmers wing district president Mareddy Subba Reddy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-trying-its-best-to-bail-out-ryots/article33467576.ece

The concerned Assistant Commissioner of Police, Inspector and other senior officers shall be visiting a police station a day and will discuss various issues among themselves. “It is seen that those who are honest and sincere, at times, do not want to act against corruption due to various reasons, whereas those who are effective often indulge in corruption. Both situations are unhealthy. Therefore, it is decided to run this campaign with an idea to push the honest persons to work in a time-bound manner and to ensure that a person who is corrupt keeps away from such activities,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizag-police-embark-on-anti-corruption-drive/article33468330.ece

01 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Auto drivers demand scrapping of G.O. no 21||Auto-rickshaw workers staged a protest near the APSRTC Complex on Thursday demanding withdrawal of G.O. 21, alleging that it would result in steep penalties being levied on them. CITU Greater Visakha Committee president R.K.S.V. Kumar said that while on one hand the YSRCP government has extended a financial assistance of Rs. 10,000 to auto-rickshaw drivers under the ‘Vahana Mitra’ scheme, on the other hand, steep penalties would be levied. He said that the drivers had not sought financial aid of Rs. 10,000 a year but had instead sought cancellation of third-party insurance. Mr. Kumar alleged that auto-rickshaw drivers were being victimised whenever accidents took place, irrespective of whether or not it was their fault. Online penalties by the Transport Department and police were financially crippling the drivers, he said, adding that once the new G.O. comes into effect from January 1, the drivers would be left with no choice but to dispose of their vehicles and live in penury. The CITU leader demanded immediate cancellation of the G.O. failing which the auto-rickshaw unions would stage a massive agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/auto-drivers-demand-scrapping-of-go-no-21/article33468326.ece

01 January 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||After 38 years, kin of naxal violence victim seeks help||Exactly 38 years after his father was allegedly killed by People's War Group (PWG) naxalites at Anjubaka in Dummugudem mandal, Mullapudi Gangadhar Rao, a 49-year-old farmer of Laxminagaram is pinning his hopes on the State government's help to enable his son M Satya Sai Vardhan, 19, to get an MBBS seat under the Central pool quota for spouse and children of civilian victims of terrorism. M V V Satyanarayana, father of Gangadhar Rao, was allegedly hacked to death by PWG naxals in his paddy field at Anjubaka village in Dummugudem mandal on November 14, 1982. A case was registered (18/1982) in this regard at the Dummugudem police station the same year. Gangadhar Rao was eight years old then. The family of the deceased had neither availed financial assistance nor got a job to date, sources said. Though the family was offered Rs. 5 lakh ex gratia a couple of years later, it refused to take the amount, official sources said. Gangadhar Rao's application dated February 22, 2010, for a government job on compassionate grounds was rejected by the district administration for the reason that he had crossed the age limit. Rao's son Satya Sai Vardhan, who passed Intermediate with 97.3 % in 2019, secured 493 marks (93.2 percentile) in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-2020). In November this year, Rao approached the district administration seeking its help to ensure nomination of his son for allocation of MBBS seat from the central pool for spouse and children of the victim. The district authorities sent a report to the State authorities for clarification. "Our family struggled a lot after losing our main breadwinner when I was eight year old," said Gangadhar Rao. Talking to The Hindu , he said, "Neither I nor my family members availed any financial assistance or employment from the government." "I appeal to the State government to help my son get an MBBS seat under the Central pool to enable him to become a doctor and serve the needy," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/after-38-years-kin-of-naxal-violence-victim-seeks-help/article33468228.ece

01 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||City rings in 2021 amid COVID restrictions||Hyderabad welcomed the New Year with vim, verve and vigour that appeared impossible only a few days back. Boomboxes on the streets outside bakeries. Fairylights decorations outside shops, temples and churches. Long queues outside liquor shops. Shopping districts lit up brightly. Hyderabad appeared to have discovered its mojo lost during the long COVID lockdown months. Except for bottles of sanitisers and masks outside entrances to churches and kiosks by the roadside, the pandemic appeared to have vanished into thin air by evening. “The masks work 100%. We are following scientific advice with a strict no mask no entry system, we have sanitiser counters manned by 25 young people and social distancing inside the church,” said Father Charles Kandula, the parish priest of St. John Maria Vianney Church in Bhoiguda before he led special prayers. Thanksgiving worship and midnight mass took place as scheduled in the church. “We informed the police that we will follow the COVID guidelines,” said Fr. Charles. Other churches in the city too held special midnight masses, changing earlier plans for a 7 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. service. Temple servitors also prepared to welcome devotees in many parts of the city. Temples dedicated to Lord Venkateswara were decked up for January 1 morning darshan. Many devotees make it a point to visit temples on the first day of the New Year. Planning for New Year’s eve began early in the city with citizens rushing out to make last minute purchases. “All the chips packets are over. People are buying cartloads of cocktail samosas, French fries and other finger foods, in the supermarket. People are mobbing even hot chips stores in Sainikpuri area,” said a resident of R.K. Puram. Though liquor shops have been allowed to stay open till midnight, most of them were crowded right from evening. Hyderabad City Police’s witty message of “So... What are your plans tonight. Will Meet you at Spl. Drive on Drunken Driving,” didn’t go down well with citizenry. Social media users picked out the government memo issued on Wednesday that allowed pubs and bars to stay open till 1 a.m. on January 1 to troll the city police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/city-rings-in-2021-amid-covid-restrictions/article33468192.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Disputes, hurdles dot happening irrigation sector||In literal terms of irrigation, the calendar year 2020 was most blessed with almost every source getting copious water allowing the farming community raise two assured crops not only under projects and tanks but also with the help of groundwater, the average level of which has been less than 5 meters below ground level. However, the year that just went into oblivion has been the most happening one in terms of disputes with neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The dispute over AP’s plans to divert over 8 tmc ft of Krishna water every day from Srisailam reservoir, one of the two major common storage facilities for the two Telugu States as per the provisions of AP Reorganisation Act, by taking up new Rayalaseema Lift Scheme and expanding the water drawal capacity of existing Pothireddypadu Head Regulator kept lingering throughout the year. Although, the second meeting of the Apex Council was held after a gap of four years in October first week to discuss and resolve the outstanding issues, it has failed to cut much ice between the two States. There has not been much headway even on the issues which were agreed upon at the meeting such as submitting the detailed projects reports (DPRs) of all “new projects” to the two river boards established, also under the provisions of APRA. On the flip side, a major accident has shadowed the achievements in the irrigation sector such as giving water to the entire ayacut under all projects and taking the water of Kaleshwaram project till Kondapochamma reservoir. On the afternoon of October 16, a technical snag in the third motor of the Yellur (first) pump-house of Kalwakurthy lift irrigation scheme caused its submergence threatening the irrigation and drinking water needs in the areas depending. However, the irrigation department worked hard to revive the pump-house in time, with three of the five pumps put back in operation so far, to ensure water to about 4.25 lakh acres ayacut and also for meeting the drinking needs in 336 villages of Kollapur, Nagarkurnool, Achampet, Wanaparthy, Kalwakurthy and Jadcherla constituencies. A few other minor hiccups such as breaches to canals and reservoirs were also witnessed during the year but they were of less consequence. Another aberration for one the most happening sector in spite of the Covid-19 pandemic impact has been the Centre’s directions to the State not the carry on the works pertaining to the lifting of third tmc ft water in Kaleshwaram project till it is appraised by the authorities concerned. Explaining the brighter side of irrigation sector in 2020, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy said: “Water was given to about 12 lakh acres in the combined Mahabubnagar district in the Vanakalam season and in the Yasangi over 8 lakh acres of ayacut is planned to be given water”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/disputes-hurdles-dot-irrigation-sector/article33468219.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A year of consolidation on the industrial front||Telangana remained focussed on growth through industrial development in 2020 by facilitating operations at units allowed to function during lockdown, hand holding others when Unlock began while continuing to attract fresh investments. A frontrunner with a progressive, pro-industry approach, the State unveiled a clutch of policies, including one to generate more employment opportunities for locals, and readied a few more. “Most dominant thing was the pandemic. People appreciated the way we responded to [needs of] industries and IT sector,” said Jayesh Ranjan, Industries and IT Secretary. Telangana example was cited at the national level, how it ensured least amount or practically zero inconvenience during the lockdown to ensure functioning of pharma and other industries permitted to operate as well as the switch to work from home in the IT sector. “All paperwork was liberalised, no one was required to run around,” he said, adding once lockdown restrictions were relaxed the focus shifted to ensuring resumption of operations at other industries. Efforts were made to reach out to MSMEs and make them aware how they can benefit from Atmanirbhar Bharat as well as schemes of the State government. In partnership with companies, the State pushed for technology adoption by MSMEs. Enterprises, big or small, the “more digital tools they use, better their recovery process will be. MSMEs in Telangana are still not completely integrated with the digital world. So we took special steps to convince all companies and brought lot of digital tools,” he said. As a measure to help to small IT firms hit by the pandemic, the government decided to give them work such as development of portals and dashboards of its departments. Likewise, startups with products relevant to the government would be considered. On policy initiatives, the senior official said during the year policies on electric vehicle and energy storage; the GRID policy to promote growth of IT industry in rest of Hyderabad, especially eastern parts; and another to encourage local employment through additional incentives for investors were launched. For the IT industry, policies on Drones and Cloud Adoption were unveiled. Food Processing, Logistics, Grassroots Innovation and Social Innovation policies are likely to be launched by this fiscal. In terms of investments, Telangana received its largest FDI when cloud platform Amazon Web Services announced Hyderabad as its second AWS region in India, a decision involving setting of data centres at an estimated investment of $2.77 billion (Rs. 20,761 crore). Other prominent investment commitments received during 2020 include those from automotive major Fiat Chrysler Auto mobiles (FCA) on a $150 million global digital hub as well as from Medtronics, Goldman Sachs, drugmakers Granules and Laurus Labs, EV makers and RE firms Mytrah, Olectra and Eto. “If you compare, previous two years the numbers were much higher. This year was also good given the situation we were confronted with,” Mr. Ranjan said. While the pandemic could have brought everything to a standstill, it did not happen. “Some good investments came our way, we used the time to clear pending policies and ending the year on a very satisfied and optimistic note, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-year-of-consolidation-on-the-industrial-front/article33468233.ece

Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar visited at least half a dozen special enforcement checkpoints and briefed the field level officers. He said that stringent action would be taken against those involved in drunk driving. Recently, Mr. Sajjanar equated a drunk driver to a ‘terrorist’ mindlessly mowing down precious lives.

01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ramky to handle garbage transport||Unrest is brewing in GHMC over the decision to hand over major part of the garbage transport operations to Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited (REEL), the concessionaire partner for Solid Waste Management (SWM) under the Private-Public-Partnership mode. Workers involved in the garbage transport, along with drivers of the vehicles engaged in the operations, are up in arms against the move, while the contractors of hired vehicles too have something to complain about. According to information obtained from confidential sources, the duration for the hired vehicles has ended on December 31, after which there are no fresh attempts by the GHMC’s Transport Wing to renew the hire agreements. Instead, the contractors are being asked to sign a fresh agreement with the concessionaire agency, till the latter procures its own vehicles. “A meeting was convened on Thursday during which we were asked to enter into an agreement with REEL for garbage transport from transfer stations up to Jawahar Nagar dump yard. Some of us agreed, while some have opposed the proposal due to apprehensions about payment,” a contractor shared. The contractors have asked for a minimum of one year’s security for the contract, while REEL agreed for six months. The contractors’ demand that the concessionaire agency bear the diesel expenditure was rejected. Payments are pending for hired vehicles for the past three months, and contractors could not oppose the move vocally as they feared that the payments would be withheld, he said. “We sought two days’ time to discuss among ourselves and get back to them,” he said. On the other hand, workers are opposing the move tooth and nail, for fear of job loss. “We stalled the Ramky vehicles at the Lower Tank Bund transfer station a few days ago. Those vehicles will come over our dead bodies. This move by GHMC will cost jobs for over 2,500 GHMC’s own workers employed as drivers and labourers,” says Udhari Gopal, president of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Employees Union. He says city’s garbage transportation cost GHMC mere Rs. 160 crore when the corporation’s own workers were involved in it, which has grown to Rs. 600 crore now, after Ramky’s entry and deployment of hired vehicles. “With this fresh move, the financial burden is only going to increase. We will announce our plan of action against this decision very soon,” Mr. Gopal said. Enquiries with the Additional Commissioner (Transport) Viswajit Kampati have not yielded any response. The agreement signed 12 years ago with REEL for solid waste management included the whole cycle of door to door collection, segregation and transportation, besides treatment of the waste. Vociferous protests by the workers, however, limited the concessionaire to mere waste processing at Jawahar Nagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ramky-to-handle-garbage-transport/article33468207.ece
01 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Three drug peddlers arrested||Continuing their crackdown on drugs ahead of New Year celebrations, the Hyderabad police on Thursday busted a drug racket and arrested three peddlers. They seized 10 grams of MDMA, 70 LSD blots, 60 ecstasy pills, 1.4 kg of hash oil, 11 kg of ganja worth Rs. 10.18 lakh from the possession of the accused. Police also seized three mobile phones. Acting on a tip-off about the contraband, Commissioner’s Task Force (West Zone) team led by inspector B Gattu Mallu raided an apartment in East Marredpally and apprehended Nikhil Shenoy, 32, a former DJ, Faiz Mevati, 20, and Meroz Khan, 31, both private employees. The gang was selling drugs to the needy customers, Task Force DCP (OSD) P. Radha Kishan Rao said. “As per the instructions, Nikhil, Faiz used to go to Mumbai to procure MDMA and in the meantime the former also came in contact with Faisal who was supplying hash oil, ecstasy pills and LSD blots -- smuggling them into the city from Goa,” he said. One Govind from Indervelly in Adilabad was supplying Ganja to the prime accused. Nikhil purchased the drugs and sells them to needy customers at higher price through Faiz and Meroz to make a quick buck, Mr. Rao said. The gang procured 1 gram MDMA for Rs. 2,000 and sold the same for Rs. 6,000, while they got 1 LSD blot for Rs. 1,000 and sold the same for Rs. 1,500. Similarly, the accused purchased 1 ecstasy pill for Rs. 1,000 and sold it for Rs. 1,500 and they sold 4 grams of hash oil for Rs. 2,000 after getting a kg for Rs. 80,000, Mr. Rao said, and added that Nikhil procured 1 kg of marijuana for Rs. 5,000, and sold it for Rs. 10,000.

The accused along with seized material were handed over to Tukaramgate police station for further investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/three-drug-peddlers-arrested/article33468211.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Low COVID caseload could be due to antibodies||The SARS-COV-2 causing the coronavirus case load in Telangana and also across the country for the past two months, markedly from December onwards, could be because of the proportion of population with discernible antibodies to it, observe public health experts. “Yes, it is true. Hospital beds are not under stress anywhere in the country, despite elections in Bihar, and Telangana and major festivals of all communities. While it is difficult to pinpoint a single reason, a number of reasons may have contributed,” says Public Health Foundation of India’s Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) - Hyderabad director Dr. G.V.S. Murthy. Recently published data in Lancet showed 54.1% of sampled population from Mumbai slums against 16.1% of sampled population from non-slum habitations were positive for past infection with coronavirus. Another study from Karnataka conducted in July/August found that the proportion of urban populations exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past was 53.8% and in rural areas it was 44.1%. “This is very different from the low prevalence of 0.73% across 21 States in May/June. So, it is likely a significant proportion of the population was infected by September, with most suffering minor infections. The virus needs a susceptible population to spread and if one out of every two people in the community have already been infected earlier, the transmission potential gets reduced,” he explains. The Mumbai study has other implications too. In overcrowded, poorly ventilated populations, the infection would have spread very rapidly in the initial 3-4 months while in less densely populated, higher socio-economic strata adherence to personal protection measures like masking, physical distancing and sanitisation, may have played a role, says Dr. Murthy Caseload reduction also means it is likely that the ‘herd immunity’ required to halt transmission with SARS-CoV-2 may be between 50-60% or even lower, which seems to have already been achieved in the lower socio-economic strata. However, “it is absolutely essential governments invest resources to conduct sero-prevalence studies on a sample population at periodic intervals to help in tracking the spread and control of the infection better,” insists the director. Peak earlier Dr. Murthy is of the opinion that Telangana’s COVID caseload reached a peak earlier than seen across the country. The number of new cases peaked between August 26-30 when the average daily new cases were 2,880. This dropped to an average daily new case load of 1,600 by November 2 and further to 413 from December 24-29. “This is a drop of 86% compared to the peak in August and this is an even more significant reduction than seen in the national figures. This seems a valid trend,” he maintains. “It is also quite possible to under-report cases either through not releasing data or by low testing, but it is next to impossible to hide a large number of deaths. So, the falling death count, which has been less than five per day in Telangana since November 19, is a reliable indicator that the severity of COVID has reduced due to early recognition and prompt initiation of appropriate treatment,” he says. Across the country, from more than 90,000 new cases every day in September second week, cases dropped to less than 50,000 new cases per day consistently in the last week of October to less than 25,000 from December 20. This is a huge drop of more than 75% from the peak. Such a consistent decline despite winter and festivals augurs well, adds Dr. Murthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/low-covid-caseload-could-be-due-to-antibodies/article33468191.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A walk in the right direction||When Ronit Ranjan, life coach, NLP practitioner, author and fitness expert, all rolled into one, was on a transit halt in the city en route to his final destination, the indomitable spirit was palpable. And, Ronit started a campaign asking the Ministry of Education to incorporate the mandatory mental health curriculum in Indian schools (Standard 9-12). “The curriculum (non-graded) is not about adding more syllabus, but rather educating and sensitising students through dialogues, discussions, activities, feedbacks, exercises, and skill training,” he says. “It’s high time that the trend of ‘observing’ a ‘mental health week/day’ in schools once a year changes to all-year round curriculum,” the 23-year-old added. Ronit, whose career with the National Defence Academy (NDA) ended because of a spinal injury in 2017, says that mental health is a hushed matter within the walls of several households. “With COVID, depression has further skyrocketed in our society. Help is available but hardly availed. This is because we are never educated to recognise the signs and seek care. While there are conversations around mental health on social media sometimes, the ground level reality is abysmal,” he explained. His walk, covering about 4,000 km from Kanyakumari to Leh, started on November 16 this year and in his journey, he will be meeting various government officials, making pit stops at schools, local government bodies, private institutions, and social activists, getting petition signatures, spreading awareness and working towards his cause. “My objective is to ensure that mental health should be accessible to all. As of now, I have covered 1,250 km, visited over 20 schools and colleges and have met 10 government officials from different districts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and AP. I am currently in Hyderabad,” Ronit said. Currently, the spirited ‘walker’ could get 18,641 petitions signed by citizens and his target is one lakh. “Once I reach Delhi, I will approach Union Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal to present the petition. I would love to see the day when any (every) Indian teenager can openly talk about their issues, seek support from their parents and peers without being judged, build their ‘mental muscle’ and enhance not only their well-being but that of the entire Indian society,” he concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-walk-in-the-right-direction/article33468183.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||ACB sets a new bench mark in probing corruption cases||Catching government employees indulging in corrupt practices is Anti-Corruption Bureau’s regular work. This had been going on for past several year. But Telangana State’s anti-graft wing set a new bench mark in year 2020 by going beyond this regular work. It is no exaggeration to say that the ACB has set a new bench mark by tracing crime proceeds in several cases and arresting civilians aiding government servants. The case of Malkajgiri ACP Y. Narasimha Reddy in Rachakonda Commissionerate is a classic example. A case of acquiring assets disproportionate to his known sources of income was registered against him on September 23, after raiding his office, residence and houses of his close relatives and acquaintances. The next step would be to gather documentary evidence to prove in the court of law that he amassed that wealth illegally. In Narasimha Reddy’s case, the ACB sleuths did not confine to this. digging deeper into the ACP’s alleged corrupt actions, the ACB arrested eight civilians accused of aiding and abetting him in securing a high value property, nearly1,960 square yards of land before Hi-Tec city in Madhapur. Fake documents Investigators unravelled how these civilians created fake documents as owners of the 1,960 square yards of land, which actually belonged to the government. Four of them transferred the property to their legal heirs through gift deeds. Another interesting cases are arrest of Shaikpet tahsildar Ch. Sujatha, Banjara Hills SI A. Ravinder and Revenue Inspector K. Nagarjuna for demanding bribes to update details of a property in a prime locality of Banjara Hills. During the probe, the ACB authorities realised that Khalid, complainant in the case, presented fabricated documents to usurp government land measuing nearly one acre and valued at several crores of rupees. They passed on the information to Hyderabad police who arrested Khalid for attempting to grab government land using fake documents. The arrest of Keesara tahsildar E. Balraju was another curious case of disproportionate assets probed by the ACB in year 2020. It was widely discussed in the State for different factors like seizure of Rs. 1.10 crore following raid on the tahsildar’s house and Mr. Balraju’s suicide in prison later. Even as Mr. Balraju was in prison, investigators booked another case against him after finding that he helped some persons illegally grab lands of others. The news of he hanging himself to death with a towel to the window grill bar kicked off serious speculation about causes behind his death. Even before the tahsildar’s death receded from people’s memory, a private person arrested in the land transfer deals, Dharma Reddy, hanged himself to death in an open area. The ACB authorities, with the same strength and infrastructure they had earlier, went beyond the corruption charges attempting to bring on records all persons connected to the corrupt practices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/acb-sets-a-new-benchmark-in-probing-corruption-cases/article33468203.ece

01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||At Singhu, farmers refuse to budge till Centre repeals laws||Even as two out of four issues were resolved after talks with the Centre, the farmers protesting at the Singhu border on Thursday refused to “move an inch” unless all their demands are met. Several farmers, who have been a part of the agitation for over a month now, explained that the two resolved issues were not the primary demands. They said the legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) and repealing of the three farm bills hold more importance. The Centre on Wednesday agreed to amend the ordinance on air quality in the Capital, to remove penal provisions in stubble burning cases and also withdraw the draft Electricity Bill. Harmesh Singh Dheshi, a 58-year-old farmer from Punjab’s Hoshiarpur district, said: “Considering the government didn’t call for a parliament session means that those two points would have anyway fallen through. We want a legal guarantee for MSP and to repeal the three farm bills.” Stating that the Centre was “testing” the strength and will of the farmers, Mr. Dheshi said, “Even though there is another round of negotiations on January 4, it looks highly unlikely that things would be resolved by then because of the government’s attitude. None of the laws and policies that this government has brought in, including demonetisation, GST and CAA-NRC, met with as much resistance as this movement. We shall continue this fight.” Fight for rights Ranjit Singh, a 78-year-old farmer added, “I have been here from the first day. We will not move an inch unless our demands are met. We are here to fight for our rights and till the fight is over we cannot afford to rejoice over anything.” Jagbir Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Tarn Taran district said, “We are not going to leave the Singhu border unless the laws are repealed. Even though talks with the government on Wednesday were positive, we cannot get complacent. It is a step-by-step process that we shall follow and also remain here unless our demands are met.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/at-singhu-farmers-refuse-to-budge-till-centre-repeals-laws/article33467903.ece
01 January 2021||New Delhi,||Delhiites breathed better air in December this year than 2019||The air quality of December this year was better than last year in terms of the number of days of “severe” air pollution and average daily air quality index (AQI), according to an analysis of the Central Pollution Control Committee (CPCB) data. In 2019, there were eight “severe” pollution days in December, but there were only four “severe” pollution days during the same period this year. Also, the average daily AQI in December was slightly less this year, compared to last year. This year the value was 331.8, while the same was 337.29 in 2019. A higher value of AQI indicates more pollution. “Measures taken in the past few years such as closure of Badarpur Thermal Power Plant, opening of Eastern Peripheral Expressway and converting industries to PNG has led to the decrease in pollution,” CPCB chairman Shiv Das Meena told The Hindu . Due to the lockdown-related restrictions, initially, lesser number of vehicles were on the road and most of the industries were closed. This had led to better air quality, but the gains did not last long. Polluted November For instance, the air quality of Delhi in November this year was worse than 2019. November this year had more number of days on which the air pollution was “severe” compared to 2019 and 2018. Apart from the amount pollutants, meteorological factors such as wind speed, temperature, and mixing layer height heavily affects the air quality. The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram and Noida was “very poor” on Thursday, as per CPCB data. The national capital’s air quality is expected to deteriorate to “very poor to severe” on Friday. “Very poor to ‘severe’ AQI is forecast on January 1. Calm wind-low ventilated condition is likely to extend for the first two days of New Year. A fresh western disturbance is very likely to affect the region by January 3. Improved surface winds speed, ventilation and rainfall are likely to bring relief,” said a statement by the government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhiites-breathed-better-air-in-december-this-year-than-2019/article33467894.ece
01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Probe bio-decomposer scam, says Cong.||The Delhi Congress on Thursday alleged that the Delhi government had spent Rs. 10 crore on publicity and Rs. 23 lakh on the distribution of Pusa bio-decomposer to 310 farmers and demanded a CBI probe into the alleged scam. AICC spokesperson Pawan Khera said that according to information accessed through an RTI, though over 1,200 farmers had registered for the bio-decomposer, only 310 farmers from 39 villages in Delhi were given the decomposer capsules, on the premise that four decomposer capsules are required per hectare, and accordingly, 3,200 capsules were required for 800 hectares of paddy cultivation in the villages of Delhi. However, according to an RTI reply, 8,000 capsules were purchased, raising the question as to why the Delhi government had purchased around 4,800 capsules more than the required number, Mr. Khera said. He added that instead of four capsules, 10 were used to decompose the paddy residue to mislead the farmers, and the report of the 15-member committee constituted by the Delhi government points to a major scam. Mr. Khera said that when the Congress was in power in Delhi for 15 years, it never used the word “ parali ” burning but for the past seven years, the Arvind Kejriwal government has been attributing the main cause of air pollution in the Capital to “ parali ” burning, though the real reasons are traffic pollution, dust from demolition and construction sites. He added that the AAP government, which is now trying to champion the cause of the farmers protesting on the Delhi borders, demanding the repeal of the three agricultural laws passed by the Central government, had blamed the farmers till a few months ago for the contribution of the worsening air quality in Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/probe-bio-decomposer-scam-says-cong/article33467899.ece

While the cold wave is likely to continue on Friday, The India Meteorological Department said that a fresh active western disturbance is likely to affect Western Himalayan Region and adjoining plains from January 3 onwards and is very likely to interact with easterlies from the Bay of Bengal to bring scattered to fairly widespread rain, accompanied with thunderstorm/hailstorm at isolated places over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, north Rajasthan, west U.P. and northwest Madhya Pradesh between January 2 and January 5. This would bring relief from the cold wave and cause a rise in temperatures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cold-wave-continues-to-grip-city/article33467897.ece
01 January 2021||New Delhi,||‘Examine condition of 25-week pregnant woman’||The Delhi High Court has directed the Medical Superintendent of All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) to constitute a medical board to examine the condition of a 25-week pregnant woman, whose foetus is suffering from serious abnormalities. A Vacation Bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru asked the Medical Superintendent to submit his report by January 4 on the condition of the foetus and also the possibility of the foetus not surviving the term of the pregnancy. The court’s direction came while hearing a petition by a woman seeking permission to undergo medical termination of her 25-week pregnancy on the ground that the foetus was suffering from Bilateral Agenesis and Anlyaramni. In India, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act stipulates a ceiling of 20 weeks, for termination of pregnancy, beyond which abortion of a foetus is statutorily impermissible. The plea said during an ultra sonography, conducted on the woman at the gestational age of 25 weeks, it was discovered that the foetus suffered from Bilateral Renal Agenesis (both kidneys absent) thereby making it incompatible with life. Since pregnancy had crossed the 20 weeks mark and medical termination of pregnancy now prohibited, the woman approached the court. The woman’s counsel said that the foetus would not survive till childbirth as both the kidneys have not developed as yet. The counsel said in the circumstances it would be futile to compel the woman to undergo the full terms of pregnancy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/examine-condition-of-25-week-pregnant-woman/article33467893.ece

01 January 2021||Chandigarh,||Haryana govt. has lost trust of people: Hooda||Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda said on Thursday that in the last two months, the ruling BJP-JJP government has suffered two major setbacks, making it evident that they have lost the trust of the people.  ‘Crushing defeat’ “After its loss in the Baroda Assembly by-election, the BJP-JJP has also suffered a crushing defeat in the recent local bodies elections. The Congress candidate registered the biggest victory in the Sonipat municipal corporation poll while pro-Congress candidates also won in Uklana, Sampla and Dharuhera by defeating the BJP,” he said. “It is clear from these results that after the rural voters, now the urban voters have also rejected the BJP-JJP alliance. After the Baroda poll, results of the local bodies make it very clear that the people of the State are now in a mood for change and the BJP-JJP government is going from Haryana,” Mr. Hooda said. Resolution on farm laws The Haryana Congress Legislature Party on Thursday passed a resolution in support of the agitating farmers against the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws. At the CLP meeting held here, a two-minute silence was also observed as a mark of respect to all those farmers who had lost their lives during the ongoing farmers’ agitation. After the meeting, Mr. Hooda told journalists that farmers have been agitating for the past 36 days now at the Delhi border and other parts of the State in bitter cold and at least 42 farmers have lost their lives and hence it is important to discuss the issue of farmers. “On December 7, we wrote to the Governor demanding a special session of the Assembly but the Governor has not accepted that demand till date,” he said. He added the resolution passed by the CLP asserted the demands of the farmers were completely valid.  ‘Responsible Opposition’ “While the farmers’ organisations are leading the movement, all Congress MLAs and the party support the farmers as a responsible Opposition,” said Mr. Hooda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/haryana-govt-has-lost-trust-of-people-hooda/article33468171.ece

Mr. Gautam said the incident of attack on the BJP workers during birth anniversary celebration event of former Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Bathinda last week has exposed Congress party’s intentions. “The Punjab police unfortunately is playing a partisan role and is allowing protesters to picket outside residences of our workers and leaders,” alleged Mr. Gautam. The protesters supporting the ongoing farm agitation had been staging ‘dharnas’ outside residences of several BJP leaders for the past many days. “Unfortunately, the Congress has a long history of creating disharmony in the country whether it was the partition of this great country or the very recent 1984 riots in which thousands lost their lives,” said Mr. Gautam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punjab-govt-encouraging-hatred/article33468163.ece

The election was held on December 27, which was a Sunday. Besides on December 25 and 26 were holidays. Many people had gone on vacation, several among them were pro-BJP,” said Sanjay Sharma, a party spokesperson.  Demand with EC Mr. Sharma said he would soon raise a demand with the Election Commission to ensure that elections are not scheduled to be conducted during the holiday season. “Whenever there are a few holidays together the people have a tendency to go on trips.

01 January 2021||Guwahati,||Cong. slams BJP for police assault on women farmers||The Congress in Assam slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government for alleged police brutality on the State’s women farmers for resisting the takeover of their farmlands. Reports from Bamuni Mikirgaon in central Assam’s Nagaon district said the police cane-charged some women who were protesting the government’s bid to evict them from their farmlands on December 29. The government allegedly wants the land to be handed over to some private firms, the villagers said. “At a time when the entire country has been standing with the farmers, the BJP government in Assam has started violent attacks on farmers without even sparing the women in Nagaon,” Congress spokesperson Bobbeeta Sarma said on Thursday. About 100 indigenous farmers have been cultivating rice and bean on a sizeable chunk of land in the village for more than 20 years and according to the local unit of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP), they have been paying revenue to the government. AJYCP flays action “We will not tolerate such atrocities on peasants at a time when farmers are demanding the repeal of anti-farmer laws brought about by the Centre,” local AJYCP leader Deep Moni Bora said, adding that the police cane-charged the protesters — many of them women — without any provocation. The district police, however, blamed the farmers for the violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-slams-bjp-for-police-assault-on-women-farmers/article33468166.ece

The mass death of crows was also reported recently from Jodhpur. The Jhalawar Municipal Council has ordered closure of all poultry and egg shops in the city and sanitised the affected area near the Radi Ke Balaji temple. A joint team of Wildlife and Animal Husbandry Departments inspected the area and sent samples to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, for testing. Jhalawar Collector Ngikya Gohain said the prohibitory orders clamped under Section 144 of Cr.P.C. would help contain the spread of the disease. “A rapid response team will also ensure strict compliance with the Avian Influenza Action Plan-2015 and collect samples from the nearby poultry farms and shops,” he said. Culling orders The district administration has informed the owners of poultry farms that if the bird flu was found to have infected the fowls reared for eggs and meat, they would be culled and a suitable compensation given.

01 January 2021||Mumbai,||BJP, MVA lock horns over State DGP’s transfer as CISF chief||The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) on Thursday engaged in a war of words over Maharashtra Director General of Police (DGP) Subodh Kumar Jaiswal being appointed the Director General (DG) of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). Devendra Fadnavis, former chief minister and Leader of the Opposition, said Mr. Jaiswal chose a deputation in the Central services over his position as the State police chief as he was frustrated with the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government’s functioning. Addressing reporters, Mr. Fadnavis said, “Mr. Jaiswal is a competent officer. But he was frustrated with the manner in which the State government has been functioning over the last few months. He was never taken into confidence. This has happened for the first time in the State.” Mr. Fadnavis claimed that instead of supervising the functioning of the police department, the Chief Minister and the Home Minister were unnecessarily interfering even in small transfers. “This will impact the mental strength of the force. We have given independence to the force and ministers should only play supervisory roles,” he said. Meanwhile, sources in the MVA government denied any possibility of Mr. Jaiswal being unhappy with the current dispensation. The source said Mr. Jaiswal had been seeking a deputation in the Central services over the past months. “The State government had given its consent more than a month ago,” the source said. Over the past few months, Mr. Jaiswal had disagreements with the MVA government over the transfers of some IPS officers in his department. Recent transfers in the police department had therefore come under scanner. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet had approved appointment of Mr. Jaiswal to the post of Director General of CISF from the date of joining the post and up to September 30, 2022, i.e. date of his superannuation. On Thursday, Mr. Thackeray held a meeting with officials from the Home Department to pick the next State DGP. The top contenders include Bipin Bihari (1987 batch) DG Maharashtra State Police Housing Corporation; Hemant Nagrale (1988 batch); Sanjay Pandey (1986 batch), DG Home Guards; and Rashmi Shukla (1988 batch), DG Civil Defence Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-mva-lock-horns-over-state-dgps-transfer-as-cisf-chief/article33467812.ece
01 January 2021||MUMBAI,||Mumbai sees record home sale deed registrations||Mumbai recorded historic registrations of apartment sale deeds in December, with 18,854 units getting registered till Wednesday, as per data procured by Knight Frank India. Sales peaked in the last days of the month, with 3,059 units being registered between December 28 and 30. Registrations rose sharply as stamp duty is set to increase by 1% starting January 1, 2021. The daily average units registered in December was 585 till December 25. The figure nearly doubled to 1,019 units in the last week between December 27 and 30. The total revenue realised by the State exchequer in 2020 from home registration was estimated at Rs. 3,107 crore, the consulting firm said. “Of the total revenue, nearly 43% (Rs. 1,350 crore) was realised in the period between September 1 and December 30, 2020. This can be seen as a clear indication of the strong impact the cut in stamp duty rates had on the revenues. The reduction in stamp duty has created beelines for sales and registration of homes, with Mumbai witnessing the best sales periods in history,” Knight Frank India said. Steady rise in sales Since the announcement of the reduction of 300 basis points starting September 1, 2020, homes sales have continuously risen month on month. Between the period September 1 and December 30, Mumbai recorded registrations of 41,681 units, with numbers growing incrementally month on month, it said.  In December 2020, the figure grew two times over the same period last year.

01 January 2021||London,||Britain leaves Europe’s single market||Brexit becomes a reality on Thursday as Britain leaves Europe’s customs union and single market, ending nearly half a century of often turbulent ties with its closest neighbours. The U.K.’s tortuous departure from the European Union takes full effect when the Big Ben strikes 11:00 p.m. in central London, just as most of the European mainland ushers in 2021 at midnight. Brexit has dominated British politics since the country’d narrow vote to leave the bloc in June 2016, opening deep political and social wounds which remain raw. But both sides are now keen to move on to a new future. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called Brexit “a new beginning in our country’s history and a new relationship with the EU as their biggest ally”. The British pound surged to a 2.5-year peak against the U.S. dollar before the long-awaited departure from the single market. Legally, Britain left the EU on January 31, but it has been in a transition period during fractious talks to secure a free-trade agreement with Brussels, which was finally clinched on Christmas Eve. Once the transition ends, EU rules will no longer apply, with the immediate consequence being an end to the free movement of more than 500 million people between Britain and the 27 EU states. Customs border checks will be back for the first time in decades, and despite the free-trade deal, queues and disruption from additional paperwork are expected. Britain — a financial and diplomatic big-hitter plus a major NATO power — is the first member state to leave the EU, which was set up to forge unity after the horrors of World War II. The EU has lost 66 million people and an economy worth $2.85 trillion, but Brexit, with its appeal to nationalist populism, also triggered fears that other disgruntled members could follow suit. “It’s been a long road. It’s time now to put Brexit behind us. Our future is made in Europe,” Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday, as she signed the trade pact. In the short term, all eyes will be closer to home and focused on how life outside the EU plays out in practical terms. British fishermen are disgruntled at a compromise to allow continued access for EU boats in British waters. The key financial services sector also faces an anxious wait to learn on what basis it can keep dealing with Europe, after being largely omitted from the Brexit trade deal. Northern Ireland’s border with EU member state Ireland will be closely watched to ensure that movement is unrestricted — a key plank of a 1998 peace deal that ended 30 years of violence over British rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/britain-leaves-europes-single-market/article33467475.ece
01 January 2021||Karak,||26 held for attack on Hindu temple in Pakistan||At least two dozen people, including several Muslim clerics, were detained on Thursday after a mob attacked and set fire to a Hindu temple in northwest Pakistan, police said. Around 1,500 Muslims on Wednesday descended on the temple — which was destroyed under similar circumstances in 1997 — after staging a protest against renovations at an adjoining building owned by Hindus. The temple is located in a remote village in Karak district, some 160 kilometres (100 miles) southeast of Peshawar. “We have arrested 26 people including local clerics for destroying a place of worship and inciting people to riot,” said local police official Fazal Sher. He added that police were looking for 50 other people identified from videos of the attack. Irfanullah Khan, the district police chief, also confirmed the arrests. He told AFP that a house adjacent to the temple was recently bought by the Hindu community and was being renovated, which offended locals. Hindus have not lived in the area since the partition of British-ruled India in 1947 when Pakistan was created, but Hindu devotees occasionally visit the temple and the tomb of the Hindu saint Shri Paramhans, who, according to Hindu faith, died in the village in 1919.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/26-held-for-attack-on-hindu-temple-in-pakistan/article33467483.ece
01 January 2021||Washington,||U.S. police shoot man dead during traffic stop||Police in Minneapolis shot a man dead during a traffic stop on Wednesday, seven months after the killing of George Floyd by an officer in the same U.S. city. The incident comes amid a rise in violent crimes in the Midwestern city, which was convulsed by protests following Floyd’s death. No details about the shooting victim, or the officers involved, were immediately available. “Initial witness statements indicate that the subject involved in this felony stop fired first at Minneapolis police officers, who then exchanged gunfire with the suspect,” said Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo. Body cameras were activated during the incident and the footage would be released on Thursday, he said. People gathered at the site outside a gas station in the southern part of the city after the shooting. Police urged people to avoid “destructive criminal behavior”. “We want to do everything we can to protect everyone’s First Amendment rights to freely assemble and demonstrate but I say again, we cannot allow for destructive criminal behavior. Our city has gone through too much,” Mr. Arradondo said. A passenger in the car with the man who was shot was unharmed, as was the police officer involved. Floyd died on May 25 when now-fired officer Derek Chauvin held his knee to Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes. The incident had sparked nationwide unrest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-police-shoot-man-dead-during-traffic-stop/article33467473.ece
01 January 2021||Tehran,||Iran honours ‘martyr’ Soleimani||Iran this week honours military commander Qasem Soleimani, who was killed a year ago by the United States, an arch enemy. He is revered as a heroic warrior across the Islamic republic. Since his death in a drone strike in Baghdad on January 3, the “martyr” Soleimani has entered the ranks of Iran’s glorious generals, immortalised in portraits, sculptures, ballads and an upcoming TV series. The strike had sparked mourning across Iran. The commemorations on Sunday come only weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump, who ordered the killing, leaves the White House, and Joe Biden takes over, offering hopes of a somewhat less bellicose relationship. Soleimani’s killing at the age of 62 sharply heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran, whose decades-old animosity had deepened when Mr. Trump withdrew from Iran’s nuclear deal and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign to isolate Iran. Within days, Iran retaliated to the killing of the military leader who was deemed untouchable, by firing rockets at Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces. Though the attack claimed no lives, it caused injuries and preceded a tragedy. In the hours that followed the strikes, when it appeared that the conflict could escalate further, Iran accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane near Tehran, claiming the lives of all 176 aboard. A year on, Iran is preparing to honour Soleimani, whom the U.S. had labelled a “terrorist” in 2005, but whose portrait has been displayed by supporters in Gaza, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Syria and Yemen. The anniversary comes as sanctions-hit Iran remains in the grip of the region’s worst outbreak of COVID-19, which has killed more than 55,000 of over 1.2 million people infected in the country. Soleimani headed the Quds Force, the foreign operations arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which directly answers to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A veteran of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, he went on to oversee Iran’s military operations in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. In the eyes of many Iranians, the country’s projection of power beyond national borders under Soleimani saved the multi-ethnic nation from the conflict suffered by Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Mr. Khamenei had already declared him a “living martyr” before his death, and in 2019, Soleimani became the only recipient of the highest military honour, the Order of Zolfaghar, since the revolution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-honours-martyr-soleimani/article33467481.ece

Gulshan Abbas vanished into detention two years ago, but her relatives told a U.S. congressional committee on Wednesday that the 58-year-old had been sentenced to 20 years in prison because of activism on behalf of Uighurs. Rights groups say an estimated one million Uighurs and other Turkic minorities languish in detention camps in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region in prison-like conditions. China insists that they are “vocational training centres”, but activists say inmates face torture and forced labour. ‘According to law’ “Gulshan Abbas has been sentenced according to the law by Chinese judicial organs for taking part in organised terrorism, aiding terrorist activities and seriously disrupting social order,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters. He did not give further details of her alleged crimes. “We urge U.S. politicians to respect facts, stop fabricating lies to smear China, and stop using the Xinjiang issue to interfere in China's domestic affairs,” he added. A retired doctor , Ms. Abbas was detained in September 2018, according to the testimony her sister Rushan Abbas provided to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year.

01 January 2021||Beirut,||Syria war killed 6,800 in 2020 in lowest annual toll||The Syrian conflict claimed the lives of at least 6,800 people in 2020, the lowest annual death toll since it began nearly a decade ago, a war monitor said on Thursday. According to figures compiled by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 10,000 people were killed in the conflict in 2019. The deadliest year was 2014, when more than 76,000 people died, according to the U.K.-based organisation, which has an extensive network of sources on the ground. The overall tally since the start of the conflict has crept up to 3,87,000, including 1,17,000 civilians. The fighting, which erupted in 2011 after the brutal repression of anti-government protests, has largely abated in 2020 as a ceasefire was held in northwestern Syria and attention turned to containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Violence continues However, violence continues to claim lives every week. On Wednesday, fighters from the Islamic State jihadist group ambushed soldiers in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, killing 37 of them. The attack was one of the deadliest by the organisation since the end of its so-called caliphate in early 2019. Almost 10 years of war have devastated Syria’s infrastructure, crippled the economy and led to the displacement of more than half of its pre-war population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/syria-war-killed-6800-in-2020-in-lowest-annual-toll/article33467484.ece
01 January 2021||Washington,||More U.S. tariffs on French, German goods||The United States announced on Wednesday that it will impose additional tariffs on French and German products as part of a long-running dispute over subsidies for aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing. The tariffs are on “aircraft manufacturing parts from France and Germany, certain non-sparkling wine from France and Germany, and certain cognac and other grape brandies from France and Germany”, which will be added to the list of products taxed since 2019, according to a statement from the U.S. Trade Representative. It said the move was in retaliation to tariffs imposed by the European Union which it considers unfair. The decision is the latest twist in the 16-year trade battle over aircraft subsidies that turned increasingly sour under the protectionist instincts of U.S. President Donald Trump. The EU was authorised this year by the World Trade Organization to levy additional customs duties on American products.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/more-us-tariffs-on-french-german-goods/article33467487.ece

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Unmasked, reflections on the pandemic and life||Masked living for the last 10 months to stave off the novel coronavirus has raised questions: of the purpose and the meaning of life. Some of the most memorable moments of life flow from connection. But we covered our mouth and nose and kept a distance from others for most part of last year. Is survival and doing some work for it the sole purpose of life? The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to live restricted lives for most part of the last year. Reflection is more conscious during such confinement. I too underwent isolation and reflection. What is the purpose of life and is there meaning to the way we are living? Such questions filled our minds. Life has been unmasked as we masked ourselves to survive. On the purpose of life The purpose of life is to be happy, said the Dalai Lama. But what is happiness and how does one attain that state and stay put? In our quest for life, besides wearing masks and maintaining a safe distance, working from home became an integral part of the universal COVID-19 culture that emerged last year. But is work the only purpose of life and source of happiness? Nothing gives a person a sense of purpose than a distinct understanding of what she does. Are we so enlightened to pursue work without being conscious and concerned about the results and find meaning in it? If work is a means of survival, are we finding meaning in it? Life is a battle against uncertainties and challenges. As the most evolved of living organisms and living in the most complex order of economic, scientific and technological interconnectedness, humanity has witnessed a heightened share of such battles during 2020, the year of the pandemic. How does one cope with such a situation and live with equanimity and balance? The pandemic has unleashed an internal churning about the purpose and meaning of life as we all pressed a pause button. It dawned on us that life cannot be on the highway all the time. Philosophical reflection was forced on us. Plato said philosophy is a process of constant questioning that takes the form of dialogue. While coping with modern life, we have stopped talking to ourselves. The pandemic forced us to think about the way we are living and ought to live. It has underlined the need to revisit and, if required, redefine the purpose and meaning of life. This is all about reorienting our mindsets as the pandemic taught us a few lessons of life. A journey as challenge There is no objective meaning of life written in the stars, in a holy book or in sequences of DNA. Birth and death are not subject to our volition. The principal challenge is to navigate the journey in between these two points, defining its purpose and finding a meaning. The pandemic has shattered the arrogance of humans of being supreme and the master of all living and non-living forms around. The principal lesson learned is that we are only part of a larger design and have got to live that way, and not at the expense of others. The forgotten ideas of oneness, interconnectedness and the intelligent laws that govern the universe have come to the fore once again. The regular outbreak of viruses including the latest one in Wuhan city has brought out the consequences of growing interference with nature, with attendant disturbances in the habitations of the different living forms. The wild is forced to have an eye on human habitation. Humans are only a part of the incredible scheme of coexistence that we call nature. The issue is not about saving nature. It is more about aligning with it and understanding how we are one. In the troubled order of uncertainties of various kinds, the major challenge for individuals is to correct confusion and puzzlements about oneself and the world. The philosophy of life is an overall vision and attitude towards life and the purpose of it. It helps one in building principles in fighting the adversities of life and living in happiness. Happiness means different things to different people and it is an individual’s call. Seneca in his Moral Letters said philosophy offers counsel. It strengthens one’s ability to remain steady in the chaos and rush of life. A specific purpose of life determines the choices one makes and influences behaviour toward the surroundings. These choices and behaviour determine the happiness that life should aim at. Choices include those we are willing to give up to remain sane and purposeful. The personal experience During the COVID-19 enforced confinement, and more so during the post-infection isolation, I reflected on my journey so far. I have assessed the journey till now, its vicissitudes, how I have handled different situations and whether I could have been different and done better in different contexts. I did find that life was at a fast pace, was too involved in work and should have spent a little more time with the family. I could have struck a different life-work balance. I have evolved and grown with the times and the experiences that came along. I too have had my share of testing times and handled them in my own ways. Spiritualism came in handy on many occasions to find solutions and happiness when tested. It sprung from within that I should focus more on social service after a long innings in politics and networking change agents for further galvanising the change. One’s contribution is key We have an individual form for a limited time like a wave. We live only once and have to live in the best possible manner. Human nature to be happy leads us to search for peace both within and without. Evolution from selfishness to self-realisation promotes common good. Living in moderation is the best lesson of the experience of the pandemic. Living with equanimity and harmoniously with all beings, our surroundings and society is ideal living. We need to talk to ourselves and define the purpose and meaning of life based on the lessons of the last several months and individual predilections. One is the master of one’s life and the path to its meaning. The meaning of life lies in contributing to the flourishing of humanity and the nature around for common welfare. Sharing and caring is the essence of our age old ethos. This confers a certain meaning to life. The Bhagavad Gita says of life; “Whatever happened, happened for the good; Whatever is happening, is happening for the good; and whatever will happen, will also happen for the good.” This warrants us to evolve to find equilibrium to face the unending uncertainties. A new strain of the novel coronavirus is being talked about even as we are coming to terms with the parent. Uncertainties never cease. We need to tune ourselves to face them with stillness to stay in a happy state of mind and live with a purpose from which the meaning flows. The spin-offs The handling of the pandemic during the dark year, 2020, annus horribilis , has some positives. While it normally takes several years to come up with a vaccine, the scientific community has succeeded in finding some candidates for COVID-19 in less than a year, much to the relief of all. The vaccine has begun to be administered already in some parts of the world. Vaccinating people all across the globe is the next big challenge. India has risen admirably as a nation to fight the pandemic. A parliamentary panel that examined various aspects of its handling has appreciated the grit and the determination that underlined this massive national effort and has complimented all stakeholders for the same even as it chronicled the hardship caused. The way the spread of virus and mortality has been kept under check are no mean achievements. The need of the hour is to draw the right lessons from the experiences of the last several months as both individuals and a collective so as to usher in annus mirabilis , by wiping out the pandemic and the havoc it has brought on us. Constant vigil is needed till the fight is finally won decisively. Learning to live with a purpose and meaning is the biggest takeaway of the year that has gone by. M. Venkaiah Naidu is the Vice-President of India||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/unmasked-reflections-on-the-pandemic-and-life/article33467459.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Has the Special Marriage Act failed to protect inter-faith couples?||The Special Marriage Act (SMA), 1954, is seen as a progressive law enacted to help inter-faith couples. But with States such as Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh framing laws that target inter-faith marriage, the procedural requirements of the SMA — such as the need to give prior notice, and allowance for ‘objections’ — seem to be undermining its original intent by opening the doors to violent moral policing by vigilante groups. Can the SMA come to the rescue of inter-faith couples, who, in addition to the old challenge of parental opposition, today also have to contend with the bogey of ‘love jihad’? Faizan Mustafa and Veena Gowda explore this question in a conversation moderated by G. Sampath . Edited excerpts: Why was this legislation needed in the first place? Faizan Mustafa:The original Special Marriage Act was enacted in 1872. It was moved by an eminent jurist and Legislative Council member named Henry Maine. It was enacted following a campaign launched in 1860 by Brahmo Samaj, especially Keshab Chandra Sen, for simpler marriage ceremonies. But it had one problem: it required that two people of different faiths who wish to get married must renounce their respective religions. By 19th century standards, the mere fact that this law paved the way for inter-faith marriages was a good first step. But its requirement of renouncing one’s religion was not compatible with modern ideas of liberalism, individualism and autonomy of the individual. So the 1954 law replaced this 1872 Act, and the requirement to renounce one’s religion was removed. Basically, this law was the first step towards a Uniform Civil Code. The thinking was that if you wanted a liberal, modern, secular and progressive law, let us start the experiment on a voluntary basis. So, those going for an inter-faith marriage, as well as others, could register under the SMA. The effect of the SMA is that once your marriage is registered under it, your religion’s personal laws won’t apply. How would you assess the SMA’s impact so far? Veena Gowda:It has not been sufficiently used. It is often used when people are going abroad. For two Hindus married under the Hindu Marriage Act, the certificate used to be called a ‘Memorandum of Marriage’, which was not recognised by certain countries while issuing a visa. So, people would then register their marriage under the SMA. Also, earlier, under the Indian Divorce Act, applicable to Christians, mutual consent was not available. Only registering one’s marriage under the SMA gave them the right to divorce by mutual consent, so they would be advised to register their marriage under the SMA. The SMA was also used for inter-religious marriages, but not so often. I think the process and procedure are seen as tedious. FM:The SMA did not achieve the kind of success it was intended to achieve. But that is a comment on how unprepared we are, as a society, when it comes to uniform laws. The fact that very few marriages get registered under the SMA demonstrates that society is not yet ready to involve public institutions in what are purely private relationships. At the same time, if someone wants to use the SMA for the purpose of inter-faith marriage, the state has no business asking them to put up a notice informing the whole world whom they want to marry. When the SMA was enacted, the notice requirement was meant to ensure that the man did not already have a spouse and does not marry a minor. But now it has become an invitation to moral policing by right-wing groups. The Supreme Court has finally admitted a petition where the constitutionality of this provision will be examined. If the right to privacy judgment is taken into consideration, there is no way this notice requirement can be sustained as constitutional. VG:I would say, rather than uniformity, equality is the real issue. For instance, what are the matrimonial rights that women have within a marriage? It’s just a right to maintenance, and given the manner in which courts pass these orders, it is usually Rs. 500 or Rs. 1,500. And we have still not progressed towards what we would like as matrimonial property. The state should focus on what rights women can get within a marriage, and aim for a more equal, progressive law and not engage itself so much with the manner in which marriages are performed. How I wish to legalise my marriage should be of no concern to the state. Can the SMA do a better job of protecting inter-faith couples? VG:A marriage is a civil contract. Civil law is not meant to protect people against violence or against societal reaction. What does the SMA provide for? It says that if you follow the procedure and register your marriage, the consequences of the marriage will be determined by the SMA. It is not there to protect you. But the situation has changed, and people seem to be watching and observing who’s marrying whom, but the law did not anticipate this. Also, this need for protection is not merely in the case of inter-faith marriage, it’s there in the case of inter-caste marriages as well. If a so-called higher caste person is marrying someone from a marginalised caste, then, there have been writ petitions filed over the years, asking the court for protection because the family will react, and there could be so-called honour killings. But offering this kind of protection is not the role of civil law, as it then becomes criminal law, and the state must provide protection. On the contrary, with the SMA, the state seems to be saying we’re going to increase surveillance on inter-faith marriages. How so? VG:What does the SMA actually envisage? If I’m getting married to somebody, I’ll go fill a form, I give a notice. If these essentials are complied with, then they have to register it. But over a period of time, certain States have decided that if it’s an inter-religious marriage, then the parents will be informed. Today, what do the ‘love jihad’ ordinances do? If it’s an inter-religious marriage, and I want to convert, then I have to fill a declaration form, go before a magistrate, and the magistrate will conduct an inquiry. In the form, you have to fill in all the details about your age, address, etc., which makes inter-faith couples extremely insecure. So, the spirit of what the SMA was meant to be is not only being diluted, these ‘love jihad’ laws are completely contrary to it. But isn’t it the other way round — that it’s only because the SMA is unable to do its job in cases of inter-faith marriage that one party ends up converting so that they can marry under a personal law? VG:As they say, in India, you don’t just marry your partner, you marry the family itself. But when it comes to rights, then you’re married only to the partner! So it’s not only about the procedure of the SMA. Society itself is so patriarchal that whether a marriage is inter-caste or inter-religious, it is always the woman who’s adjusting to the family that she is going into – it’s the woman who leaves her natal home to go into the matrimonial home. So, in that sense you are always accommodating the family that you are marrying into. So the SMA is not the only problem. FM:People look down upon SMA marriages as ‘sarkari’ marriages. That’s also why many do not register their marriages and just go for a private Hindu ceremony or a nikah. The acceptance of the involvement of a state institution in marriage is still very low in our society. People think marriage is a personal matter. Today, however, the state is trying to dictate terms in this purely personal matter. Which religion one believes in, and whether one changes religion — it’s none of the state’s business to know or monitor. One may convert to another religion because of marriage, or even for no reason. There is no authority under our law available to the state to examine the cause or rationality of somebody’s conversion. Yet, strangely, more than half a dozen States in India have these anti-conversion laws, and they all have titled these ‘freedom of religion laws’ even though they curtail religious freedom. Moreover, hardly any convictions been reported under these laws. The word “propagate” in Article 25 of the Constitution was inserted to assure Christian minorities. For them, it is an article of the faith to take the gospel to the other people. But we then got a regressive Supreme Court judgment in Rev. Stanislaus (1977) in which the Court held that you cannot convert because ‘propagation’ of a religion does not extend to conversion. In fact, India’s foremost constitutional expert H.M. Seervai said that this judgment is “productive of great public mischief” and must be overruled. This judgment should be reviewed as it is now contrary to the privacy judgment  . The SMA is a Central law, and the anti-conversion ordinances are happening at the State level. Don’t they conflict with each other? VG:Whoever chooses to register their marriage under the SMA may continue to do so. The anti-conversion laws occupy a different space: they talk about conversion, which the SMA does not concern itself with. So, there is no conflict. Is it possible to amend these anti-conversion laws so that they cease to be patriarchal and anti-women? VG:We know the history of conversions in our country. They were, in a way, also to get away from very oppressive situations. So, these laws ought to go. FM:This whole bogey of ‘love jihad’ is now almost 90 years old. It was in the 1920s that people in U.P. started writing that there is a concerted conspiracy by the Muslims to outnumber Hindus by marrying Hindu women and then producing a great number of children. This is the work of right-wing organisations. Though there have been some progressive judgments of the divisional benches of the Allahabad High Court, protecting the rights of adult individuals to marry whoever they want, the U.P. government promulgated an ordinance that undermines constitutional rights, particularly of Hindu women. The primary purpose of these ordinances is to discipline Hindu women and control their bodies and sexuality. It undermines their agency. Also, it is problematic to have this notion of “sanctity of marriage” incorporated into law. It’s there even in the SMA. There is a provision under Section 29 of the SMA, which says that you cannot file a petition for divorce within one year of your marriage except when there is extreme hardship. If marriage is a civil contract, and if parties think that they cannot live together because they are not compatible, why have this restriction? Under the influence of the ‘sacramental’ nature of Hindu marriage, our courts have been over-emphasising this element of “saving” a marriage — this should not be the sole objective. Their goal should be to ensure that two individuals happily live together, and if they cannot happily live together, let them gracefully walk out of a painful marriage. Sustaining a marriage should not be the concern of the public authorities, the courts, or of the law. VG:We have to think about where our legal system is moving. On the one hand, we were thinking of the possibility of same sex marriages, of making marriages contractual, and if we can have matrimonial property. On the other, we are getting laws that control which religion you follow when you intend to marry, and decide for you who you can fall in love with and who you can’t. This is not two steps back but hundreds of steps back.  People think marriage is a personal matter. Today, however, the state is trying to dictate terms in this purely personal matter.

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A leopard count with a missing benchmark number||“India’s leopard population increases by 60% in 4 years” [since 2014] is what most newspapers highlighted when a first-of-its-kind report on leopard numbers in the country was released recently. Unlike the fanfare and debates that would have rolled out with tiger numbers, there was hardly any discourse about this species. Like always, the leopard loses out to its larger cousin. However, to get a population estimate of an elusive carnivore at the geographical scale of 21 States in India is tricky and requires colossal effort. On this front, the entire research team has to be congratulated for completing this massive task. What is needed Most times, the goal of species conservation is to protect and increase the population of the species of interest. In this direction, scientific monitoring of their current numbers, and an increase or a decrease in numbers over the years will determine whether the conservation efforts undertaken to preserve the species are bearing fruit. To achieve this, a solid, authentic benchmark is very essential and critical. Though the report ‘Status of leopards in India, 2018’ (https://bit.ly/3rJG0nu) distinctly mentions that the figure is the ‘minimum number’, the way it was launched has depicted that the country has 12,852 leopards. If we go by these figures, I feel this is an underestimate by at least 40%. In my opinion, India may have over 20,000 leopards. By-product of tiger estimate This study focused mostly on forested habitats where tigers are found, as it was a by-product of the all-India tiger estimate. Hence other leopard habitats such as rocky outcrops, smaller dry forests, higher elevation habitats in the Himalayas, agricultural landscapes (coffee, tea, arecanut, sugarcane plantations) where leopards are known to be found in good numbers were not a part of this exercise. Similarly, much of Northeast India was excluded from the study. Hence the area studied by itself does not represent a true pan-India leopard population. Though a very coarse scale map is made available in the report, it clearly depicts that vast stretches of leopard habitats have been excluded from the study. I think this is a key factor that has kept India’s leopard numbers lower than the true picture. It requires enormous resources and time to carry out a study on the scale of a large nation such as ours. If this study had included leopard population estimates from other research organisations (for the same study period and which had used camera trapping as a methodology) from the areas that were not covered (by this study), it could have added significant information and leopard numbers to the current estimate of 12,852. In Karnataka My work on leopards is focused on my home State of Karnataka. Hence I will use this as an example to draw parallels on the all-India leopard numbers. Our camera trapping exercise in the BRT-MM Hills-Cauvery-Bannerghatta protected areas revealed a leopard population of 267 individuals. This protected area complex, of an area of 2,825 square kilometres, possibly represents less than 6% of leopard habitat in Karnataka. This landscape also has two competing large predators — the tiger and the dhole — who keep leopard numbers under check. Even in small, natural habitats such as the Devarayanadurga Reserved Forests and its adjoining areas, our studies showed a population of 15 leopards in a small area of 70 square kilometres. Small rocky outcrops such as Devarayanadurga can potentially have high leopard numbers. Hence it is critical that such habitats are included when the population figure for an entire nation is projected.  Misleading picture The claim that “leopard numbers increased by 60%” also needs to be closely looked into. In 2014, the study estimated a minimum leopard population of 7,910 individuals from 18 different Indian States covering a study area of 92,164 square kilometres. In 2018, the study was expanded to 21 States with a study area of 121,337 square kilometres, which shows a spatial increase in the size of the study area by 25%. Even the number of camera trap locations has increased by nearly threefold (9,735 to 26,838 camera trapping locations). So, comparing results from 2014 with 2018, and hailing it as a 60% increase is quite misleading. It simply means that we covered more area and put in more camera traps to count leopards, which resulted in higher leopard numbers. It is like carrying out human population estimates in 18 States, and the next year we conduct a similar exercise but in 21 States. Obviously, the count will result in a higher number of people, but to claim that population figures have increased would be fallacious. The main threats Overall, we need a benchmark number against which we can evaluate the trend in leopard numbers and threats to this carnivore. In general, habitat loss due to mining and quarrying, poaching for body parts, mortality due to vehicular collisions, retaliatory killing due to human-leopard conflict and accidental deaths due to snares set for catching wild prey all seem to be impacting the conservation of this rosette-patterned cat. If we can assess leopard numbers in a few selected sites and monitor the area occupied by them over large swathes, it will perhaps give us a better overview of leopard conservation efforts.

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Acclimatising to climate risks||Several parts of north India are in the grip of a severe cold wave. While winter may be longer and harsher in some regions due to La Niña, forecasters suggest that 2021 would still be among the Earth’s hottest years recorded. Rising temperatures have led to a sharp increase in climate extreme events in recent years. A recent report by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water found that 75% of districts in India, home to over half the population, were vulnerable to extreme climate risks. While India witnessed 250 extreme climate events between 1970 and 2005, the country recorded 310 extreme climate events after 2005 alone. Further, between 1990 and 2019, India incurred losses exceeding $100 billion. Also, the intensity of floods increased eightfold and that of associated events such as landslides and heavy rainfall increased by over 20 times since 1970. Drought-affected districts have increased by an yearly average of 13 times over the last two decades. The frequency of cyclones has also doubled. Over 40% of Indian districts now show a swapping trend: flood-prone areas are becoming drought-prone, and vice-versa. At the recent Climate Ambition Summit, the UN Secretary-General underscored the importance of adaptation and resilience to mainstream climate actions, and tagged 2021 as a “make it or break it” year. What should India do in 2021 to enhance its resilience and adaptive capacity against extreme climate events? Building climate resilience First, India should create an Environment and Health De-risking Mission to increase emergency preparedness, secure critical resources and build resilient infrastructure and governance systems to counter the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme climate events. The Mission should also focus on democratising local climate-related and weather-related data along with integrating risk projections in national, sub-national and district disaster and climate plans. Another priority would be restoration, revival, and recreation of traditional climate-resilient practices, with a special focus on indigenous communities, often on the front lines of ecosystem conservation. Second, India needs a comprehensive Climate Risk Atlas to present a risk-informed decision-making toolkit for policymakers at the national, State, and district level. Such an Atlas should identify, assess and project chronic and acute risks at a granular level to better prepare against extreme climate events, urban heat stress, water stress, crop loss, vector-borne diseases, and biodiversity collapse. The Atlas would also help in assessing the resilience and adaptation capabilities of communities and business. Further, it would help in climate-proofing critical infrastructure. Third, to finance climate action at scale, risk financing instruments and risk retention and identification tools should be supplemented by contingency and adaptation funds such as the Green Climate Fund. This will enhance the public finance pool and gear up efficient allocation across sectors at risk by mobilising investments on critical infrastructures and resilient community actions. The Climate Ambition Summit also called for enhancing adaptation financing by 50% versus its current share of 20% of the total pool of climate financing. Finally, as the permanent chair of the recently formed Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, India should play a pivotal role in attracting private investments into climate-proofing of infrastructure. It should also promote adaptation-based infrastructure investment decision making in these countries. Further, an equal focus should be on championing a culture of localised risk assessments among members from the Global South. Ignoring low probability risks could be catastrophic for the economy as well as society. This year, policymakers, industry captains and common citizens must make climate proof choices.

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Ending the deadlock||Farmers protesting against three agriculture reform laws, and on related issues, have reached a partial agreement with the Centre on Wednesday, but the main points of contention remain unresolved. The government has agreed to not penalise farmers for stubble burning and to safeguard power subsidies. Farmers have decided to continue the agitation until the three laws are repealed and their demand for a legal guarantee for MSPs for farm produce is met. Farmer leaders will meet with Central Ministers again on January 4. Flexibility by farmers and a reconciliatory approach by the government led to the partial agreement, but the core concerns regarding the laws and MSP are not amenable to easy resolution. The government has continued to propagate the laws — the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act — as measures that will enhance agriculture incomes. The Centre is so sure of the promise of these reforms that it did not even attempt to build a political consensus around them beforehand. Subsidised power and lopsided incentive structures have built cropping patterns that are no longer sustainable. Large sections of farmers meanwhile continue to languish in debt and fear. Farmer concerns are not uniform across India. The ongoing agitation is being spearheaded by farmers from Punjab and Haryana, who have been big beneficiaries of government procurement. The current agitation, its apparent energy and resolve notwithstanding, is geographically and programmatically limited. It now faces the risk of losing steam or spinning out of control. At least some groups that are part of the agitation currently might favour more flexibility. The government is reluctant to agree to a legal guarantee of MSP because the demand is unrelated to the laws. The government is also hoping to tire out the agitators. Finding a way out will be better for both sides. Though a completely satisfactory resolution of all issues raised by the farmers is not possible immediately, the government must reassure them that honest efforts will continue to address them even if the protests are formally ended for now. Reforms are necessary to ensure that India has a productive, sustainable and remunerative agriculture sector. While all stakeholders appear to agree on this principle, they diverge on questions of detail. The reports of the National Commission on Farmers, chaired by Prof. M.S. Swaminathan, and other government committees have suggested solutions. The Centre must engage with the farmers, political parties and States on the economic and environmental issues at stake. That is the best route to effective reforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ending-the-deadlock/article33467454.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A constant vigil||In less than a month, it will be a year since India confirmed its first SARS-CoV-2 cases in Kerala. From then and now, India looks infinitely more prepared in terms of testing capacity, vaccine candidates in development, public awareness and the kaleidoscopic experiences of those who have been exposed to the virus. However, the report of the new variant from the U.K. and confirmed in at least 25 travellers from there puts India back at the base of a new learning curve. First reported to WHO on December 14, the SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, or the ‘U.K. strain’, was detected only following an unexpected case spike in South East England. The U.K.’s consortium of labs periodically sequences 5%-10% of the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the population. From October 5 to December 13, over 50% of isolates were identified as the variant strain in South East England. This variant has at least 14 significant mutations, which could affect healthy cells or worsen compromised immune systems. Studies show that the virus variant, while not linked yet to increasing mortality, is more transmissible than other variants, thus indirectly contributing to a higher death toll. Even though the world has only now woken up to this variant, it may have been circulating in the U.K. as early as October, and with people flying on the U.K.-India route, it is quite likely that this may have already caused its circulation in India. This puts the country right back to January and February when attention was trained towards possible carriers from China and SE Asia, when it was travellers from West Asia and Europe who led to the case explosion after March. Then, India was just about figuring out how to mass produce and, more importantly, distribute RT-PCR kits and paraphernalia required for detection. Now, Indian scientists have to grapple with a new beast called mass genomic surveillance. For some years now, India has had genome sequencing machines and the personnel to track and identify new variants. However, like in the early days of RT-PCR, there are not enough of them to sequence the 4%-5% of isolates in the population like what the U.K. does. India has genome sequenced around 5,000 isolates compared to the U.K.’s 137,000. That India has formed a consortium of leading genomics labs to make genome surveillance a routine continuous exercise is to be welcomed. With 2021 likely to be the year of the vaccine, with a rollout at an unprecedented scale, scientists have already warned that it is possible that some virus strains, or escape mutants, may change enough to evade the vaccine’s immune response — as observed in the case of hepatitis B. Therefore, continuous monitoring and developing suitable detection kits are the only way India can shore up its defences against this pandemic and those of the future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-constant-vigil/article33467455.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Chasing a superstar||It was one of the most awaited events of the 1996 Assembly election in Tamil Nadu. With just a week remaining to conclude the campaign, Rajinikanth was returning from the U.S. to Chennai on April 20, with an overnight stopover in Mumbai. He was expected to make a big statement. I had just returned to my desk after witnessing the election campaign across Tamil Nadu for more than a week, touching several districts — a rare opportunity for a city-bound journalist. I was set to plunge back into work. Then came the assignment. Rajinikanth was to arrive in Chennai the next day. Rush to Mumbai by a late evening flight, and return with him, so we would have an exclusive story. A ticket was purchased by the night flight, including the return leg that Rajinikanth would take, with the aviation correspondent tracking his movement. I prepared for a red-eye mission because the task involved many things: finding out where the actor would be staying between flights to ensure that nothing was missed, tailing him, and buttonholing him on the plane. It was not hard to discover that he would be staying at the airport VIP lounge. Sure enough, he arrived from Las Vegas and was whisked off. There were a few hours for the Air India flight to Chennai, and there was nothing to do but maintain vigil. Rajinikanth would obviously not join the check-in queue and it was almost time to get the boarding card. Suddenly, I noticed a fellow journalist from Chennai going up to AI’s first class counter. My heart sank as I realised that I had been given an economy class ticket, which would take me no closer to the actor than any of the others in the rear of the plane. Disaster loomed, with the prospect of ignominy that a rival would have an exclusive story, and I would have only an excuse. Making a dash to the counter, I told the attendant what the purpose of the visit was and no matter what, I had to be on a seat next to Rajinikanth. It meant paying to upgrade, which, miraculously, was possible. But the adjacent seat was already taken by the other journalist. The one behind was available, and I got it. Close to boarding time, the star emerged early in the morning. By now, a couple of Mumbai journalists, obviously tipped off by airport or Chennai sources, had also arrived. But no comment was available from the ‘thalaivar’. I spent the hour-and-a-half on board standing, craning to hear every word he was saying. A foreigner in the seat next to mine showed his irritation, remarking, “You must be in love with him!” Rajinikanth was charming, exhibiting no resentment that he had been ambushed and cornered inside the plane. He kept talking, but politely declined sharp political questions. At the Chennai airport, there was a media throng. Rajinikanth announced that the DMK-Tamil Maanila Congress combine would get an absolute majority. The Hindu carried a front-page story the next day, also describing the atmosphere on the plane. Rajinikanth had said on the flight, “God is there, he will see me through” on how he would manage the thick of politics, and “Let me finish this five-year project” to advance the electoral prospects of the DMK-TMC alliance. I had no byline, but Rajini fans across the office were awestruck that I was with him on the plane.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/chasing-a-superstar/article33467464.ece

01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fiscal deficit shoots up to 135% of target||India’s fiscal deficit shot up to 135.1% of the Budget target of nearly Rs. 8 lakh crore for 2020-21, in the 8 months from April to November 2020, as per data released by the Controller General of Accounts on Thursday. The figure had stood at 114.8% a year earlier. Revenue deficit, which had crossed 125% in the first half of the year, almost touched 140% of the Budget target by November, with just about 40% of the annual estimated revenue receipts coming in. The fiscal deficit had reached 120% of the year’s target, or Rs. 9.53 lakh crore by the end of October. It rose to Rs. 10.8 lakh crore in November. Government spending, including capital expenditure considered critical to revive the economy, remained lower than a year earlier, though there was a month-on-month uptick in November. Only 62.7% of the budgeted expenditure for the year had been spent by November, lower than the 65.3% recorded a year earlier. Capital expenditure fared even worse, touching 58.5% of target by November, compared to 63.3%. “With four months to go in the year, a lot depends on how the government manages its expenditure,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings. “If all the allocations mentioned in the Atmanirbhar programmes are executed, then fiscal deficit will increase to around 9% of GDP — a deficit of around Rs. 17-18 lakh crore.” ICRA principal economist Aditi Nayar said the fiscal deficit for the year will reach Rs. 14.5 lakh crore or 7.5% of its nominal GDP estimate; she saw some encouragement from public spending in November. Monthly outgo expanded year-on-year by “32% for revenue expenditure and nearly 250% on a small base for capital expenditure. A sustenance of this trend will bolster economic activity, and help the Indian economy exit the recession in the coming quarter,” she said. Mr. Sabnavis said higher government spending was seen in the health and consumer affairs Ministries, but several allocations announced may not finally be invoked this year, which can lower the deficit by Rs. 1 lakh-Rs. 2 lakh crore. “We do not expect compensations on the revenue side where tax revenue at best is maintaining the monthly target.” Lower receipts to blame Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings and Research — which expects FY21 fiscal deficit at 7% of GDP: “The expenditure pattern suggests that expansion in fiscal deficit is not due to increased expenditure which has been muted so far. The higher fiscal deficit is primarily originating from lower receipts.” Corporate tax collections were Rs. 1.03 lakh crore lower year-on-year and income tax collections were down Rs. 33,000 crore. Non-tax revenue has also been lower so far at just about 32% of budgeted amount, Mr. Sabnavis pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fiscal-deficit-shoots-up-to-135-of-target/article33467439.ece
01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘India must raise the bar on anti-money laundering systems’||With the global money laundering and terror funding watchdog expected to undertake a review of India’s mechanisms to deal with suspicious transactions and financial crimes in 2021, State Bank of India’s compliance head has stressed the need for financial institutions to raise the bar on monitoring such activity. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) had deferred its once-a-decade evaluation of India’s anti-money laundering regime scheduled for this year, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, and indicated that the onsite review to be conducted by global experts may now take place in early 2021. The FATF undertakes peer reviews of each member on an ongoing basis to assess the implementation of its recommendations and provides a detailed analysis of each country's system for preventing criminal abuse of the financial system. “The FATF review of India will happen [in 2021]. That is all the more reason why we should get our act together. We want to have a good image of India when the FATF [review] happens,” SBI’s group compliance officer and deputy MD Soma Sankar Prasad said at a conference on anti-money laundering and combating terror financing on Tuesday. A major challenge in identifying suspicious transactions was the sheer volume in India’s banking system, he pointed out. “SBI itself has 43 crore accounts, so the number of transactions is 15 crore to 20 crore a day. The load is immense, so the quality of transaction monitoring does suffer. Going forward, it is inevitable as technology develops, that we dig deeper so as to play a more effective role against money laundering,” he said. India’s banks, he said, had already begun using artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to identify transactions that don’t follow the usual pattern. They are also trying to improve the compliance culture among frontline staff who often fail to get details under the Know-Your-Customer norms. FATF worked on Pak. The SBI official said the FATF’s work had been ‘fantastic’ as it had been able to do what UN Security Council resolutions had failed to achieve in terms of taming terror activities in Pakistan. “The FATF has been really successful in putting Pakistan on a tight leash. After the FATF put restrictions, Pakistan was forced to take a number of steps including putting the main terrorist leaders behind bars. Maybe it was a cosmetic measure, but they were forced to undertake it because they would have been in a huge financial problem otherwise,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-must-raise-the-bar-on-anti-money-laundering-systems/article33467433.ece
01 January 2021||COIMBATORE,||Anti-dumping duty on viscose yarn proposed||The designated authority under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has recommended the levy of anti-dumping duty on viscose spun yarn imported from China, Vietnam and Indonesia. The Indian Manmade Yarn Manufacturers Association had sought the levy as import of viscose yarn from these countries was hurting domestic manufacturers. After an investigation, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies has recommended the move. According to industry sources, if anti-dumping duty were levied on viscose yarn, domestic yarn manufacturers would benefit. However, it would impact weavers and garment producers as domestic viscose yarn prices were already ruling high. The government should remove the anti-dumping duty on viscose fibre for the entire value chain to benefit, they said. M.A. Ramasamy, chairman of Powerloom Development and Export Promotion Council, said the Council would write to the Centre against the proposed levy. According to M. Senthil Kumar, chairman of the Palladam Hi-Tech Weaving Park, there were several technical textile products that were viscose-based and their production would be affected. The duty would impact the Centre’s production-linked incentive scheme. Also, prices of viscose fabric would rise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/anti-dumping-duty-on-viscose-yarn-proposed/article33467437.ece

However, the shortage of raw material and components has meant that bicycle makers are struggling to fulfill surging demand, Hero Cycles said in a statement.

01 January 2021||Melbourne,||Rohit begins tune-up for Sydney||Joining the Indian team after completing his mandatory 14-day quarantine, star batsman Rohit Sharma on Thursday went through his first practice session in Australia under the watchful eyes of batting coach Vikram Rathour. The prolific opener is expected to play the third Test in Sydney from January 7. “The engine is just getting started and here is a quick glimpse of what lies ahead. #TeamIndia #AUSvIND,” BCCI tweeted with two pictures of the batsman. While he trained, the rest of the squad took a brief two-day break. The 33-year-old Mumbaikar, who had missed the limited-overs series as well as the first two Tests against Australia due to a hamstring injury that he sustained during the IPL, was seen taking catching practice. Three throw-down experts were in attendance to assist Rohit. Meanwhile, it is learnt the Indian team management is likely to prefer Shardul Thakur over left-arm pacer T. Natarajan in place of the injured Umesh Yadav. Senior pacer Umesh, who suffered a calf muscle tear during the second Test, is heading home for rehabilitation after being ruled out of the third and fourth Tests. “Shardul was really unfortunate that his Test debut against the West Indies ended abruptly due to injury even before he could bowl an over. He has been shaping well and might replace Umesh in the playing XI,” a BCCI source told PTI on Thursday. The final call will be taken by the head coach Ravi Shastri, stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane and bowling coach Bharath Arun after reaching Sydney. Shardul has 206 wickets from 62 First Class games. Another aspect that India would like to address ahead of the Third Test is a long tail that has affected the team. Shardul has six First Class half-centuries and during his stint with the national team in white-ball games, he has proved to be a decent batsman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohit-begins-tune-up-for-sydney/article33467549.ece
01 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Sindhu set to unleash new weapons from her armoury||World champion P.V. Sindhu promises to surprise her opponents with a couple of new weapons in her armoury even as she insists that she is much more solid defensively now thanks to her training in the UK for the past two months. The 25-year-old Sindhu told The Hindu that it has been a different kind of a training programme from what she undertook back home. “Different coaches have been working on my game under the guidance of former international Rajiv Ouseph. Being a world class player himself, he knows what exactly I need to be at my best,” Sindhu said. “Interestingly, coaches taking positive notes on an individual from different players in the camp has really helped many of us to fine-tune a few more aspects of the game,” the Rio Olympics silver medallist said. Best move “Travelling to the UK has been one of the best moves I should say, especially, because of the pandemic break in India. Despite the weather being extremely cold here in the UK, I enjoyed the high-intensity training sessions,” she said. “Hopefully, we will start playing in the Toyota Thailand Open (January 19-24) and the prestigious HSBC BWF World Tour Finals which is rescheduled for January 27 to 31,” Sindhu said. “I am really looking forward and excited for my first tournament in Thailand after the 2020 All England championship in March. “ The mental aspect is the key. One needs to be very patient after such a long break,” she said. “One might not get into rhythm straight away after such a long break, but I am sure I will get it soon,” Sindhu said. “I am pretty confident I can and will do well. I want to be positive,” she said. “I am looking forward to 2021, which is also the Olympics year. I am sure to have a great year with a winning start in Thailand,” Sindhu said. Challenges Commenting on the challenges ahead, she felt consistency and getting her confidence back were two important aspects. The World No. 7 said the immediate target would be winning a couple of tournaments, training hard to be in the best frame of mind for the Olympics and most importantly winning another medal there. “Being in the UK, I definitely missed my parents as they have always been so supportive. “Longing to be back home as and when there is a break,” Sindhu concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-set-to-unleash-new-weapons-from-her-armoury/article33467730.ece
01 January 2021||Christchurch,||Williamson goes to the top||New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson has overtaken Australia’s Steve Smith and India captain Virat Kohli to be the No. 1 Test batsman in the world in the latest ICC rankings released on Thursday. Williamson leaped from third to first after his Player-of-the-Match effort leading the Black Caps to a 101-run victory over Pakistan on Wednesday, scoring 129 in the first innings and a rapid 21 in the second when New Zealand was building a lead before declaring. The New Zealand skipper described it as “humbling” to overtake Smith, who held the top spot for 313 days this year, and Kohli, who was No. 1 for 51 days. Smith slipped to third in the rankings behind Kohli following scores of nought and eight in Australia’s second Test against India while Kohli was on paternity leave. “They are incredible players of our generation,” Williamson said as he arrived here ahead of the second Pakistan Test which starts on Sunday. “Those two players are the best so for me to sneak up perhaps in some way, is very surprising and humbling.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/williamson-goes-to-the-top/article33467547.ece
01 January 2021||Chennai,||How the Indians plotted Smith’s dismissals||Behind the Indian resurgence in Melbourne after the winter of 36 were quiet resolve and meticulous planning. Beneath stand-in captain’s Ajinkya Rahane’s harmless exterior lurks a ruthlessly attacking captain who does not miss a trick, with his aggressive bowling changes and field placements. If we go to the specifics, the manner India dismissed Steve Smith in both the innings is testimony to its think-tank. Undercutter does him in In the first Test at Adelaide Smith perished to an under-cutter from the impressive R. Ashwin; it was a delivery of side-spin that went through straight when Smith played for turn. This dismissal was obviously playing on Smith’s mind when he faced the ace off-spinner at Melbourne in the first innings. Rahane had a ring of fielders around the bat for Smith. Among the catchers, crucially, was a leg-slip. This time, Ashwin spun one across Smith; it was a top-spin delivery. Smith, instinctively, played with the turn, and was picked up at leg-slip. In the second innings an inspired Jasprit Bumrah dismissed Smith, who once again fell early. Now a batsman’s strength can also be his weakness. Smith has gathered a mountain of runs in his career by walking on to the off-side, leaving his leg-stump open — it is a bait for the bowlers — and when they attempt to knock the leg-stump, the Aussie picks them up for runs with whips and drives. Worse, with the line being leg stumpish, the pacemen in particular find it hard to shift back to off-stump. By the time they accomplish that, Smith would have dug in deep. Now, how Bumrah got Smith out in the second innings at the MCG was all about precision and a little bit of trickery. Once again, Smith moved towards the off-side, offering a clear view of the leg-stump, but Bumrah’s delivery was on a good length, so the Aussie couldn’t whip or drive and the ball was also a tad slower. Smith missed and the sphere clipped the leg-stump bail. A decisive moment. Ashwin’s magic In the absence of David Warner much for Australia hinged on Marnus Labuschagne and Smith. And Labuschagne was removed by Ashwin in the second innings with a little bit of sorcery. This was again an under-cutter, angled across Labuschagne. The side-spinning ball hissed off the surface, took the nick and settled into slip’s hands. Bowlers are the key There was a fighting hundred from Rahane, a classy debut by Shubman Gill, but it is the bowlers who eventually win you Tests. And spare a thought for debutant paceman Mohammed Siraj, who moved the ball away, got it to nip back at a sharp pace and bowled his heart out. And Ravindra Jadeja pulled his weight as an all-rounder. This series now is wide open.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/how-the-indians-plotted-smiths-dismissals/article33467552.ece
01 January 2021||BENGALURU,||KSLTA announces State-ranking Tour||The Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association (KSLTA) announced a State-ranking Tour that aims to provide opportunities for players across age groups and levels to experience a competitive tennis environment. It will be quantified by State-ranking points and a monthly roll-over ranking system which will culminate in a year-ending State Championship. The Junior Tour will be held in five age groups (U-10, U-12, U-14, U-16, U-18) while the Pro Tour will have the men’s and women’s categories. There will also be five senior categories (35+, 45+, 55+, 65+ and 75+). Events for wheelchair tennis players will be held in the U-18, men’s and women’s categories. Pro Tour competitions will carry prize money in the range Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 2 lakh per event. KSLTA also announced a plan to bring all the tennis players, academies and coaches under one umbrella. To that affect, KSLTA launched a registration drive on Wednesday with Rohan Bopanna becoming the first player to register. “KSLTA’s developmental Tour is a shot in the arm for all aspiring players,” said Bopanna, also a joint vice-president of KSLTA. “The registration process will bring each and every player under one umbrella and start one big family,” he added.

01 January 2021||Melbourne,||Warner may play third Test even if not 100% fit||A struggling Australia is prepared to risk playing seasoned opener David Warner in the third Test against India even if he is not 100% fit, assistant coach Andrew McDonald said on Thursday. The third Test is scheduled to be played in Sydney from January 7-11. In the absence of Warner, who was recovering from a groin muscle tear, Australia’s batting failed miserably in the first two matches. “That’s a real, clear option. He may not be 100% — who is, coming off an injury! You never know until you get out there,” McDonald said during a virtual press conference. Warner has been named in the squad along with Victorian young gun Will Pucovski for the third Test as Australia looks to bounce back from the eight-wicket loss in the Boxing Day Test here. Puckovski’s history of bouncing back strongly from concussion-induced breaks gives McDonald confidence in the young opener. Pucovski, who was primed to make his debut in Adelaide, was ruled out of the first two Tests after being hit on the head in the first warm-up game. That was the 22-year-old’s ninth concussion, not all from cricket. “We do know with the history that Will has had, and with my time with him at Victoria. He had a pretty good track record of performing when he has returned,” McDonald told Australian Associated Press.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/warner-may-play-third-test-even-if-not-100-fit/article33467550.ece
01 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Dubov stuns Carlsen on day of upsets||In a sensational display, Daniil Dubov knocked out Magnus Carlsen with a checkmate in the third game of the second set for a 2.5-0.5 verdict on the way to the semifinals of the $200,000 Airthings Masters online rapid chess tournament. The young Russian, who drew the opening game of the first set in the semifinal against Azerbaijan’s Teimour Radjabov on Thursday, won twice with white pieces in the second set to end Carlsen’s campaign. In the first set, Dubov had hit back in the third game to force a 2-2 draw. The day also saw the other three pre-match favourites — Hikaru Nakamura, Tour leader Wesley So and Ian Nepomniachtchi follow Carlsen out of the tournament. Armenia’s Levon Aronian, winner of the opening game of the semifinal against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, blanked Nakamura 2-0 to close the second set, having won the first. Vachier and Radjabov followed a similar course to the semifinal. In their decisive Armageddon games, Facing So, Vachier drew with black pieces, much like Radjabov did against Nepomniachtchi.  The results: Semifinals: Set One, Game One: Teimour Radjabov (Aze) drew with Daniil Dubov (Rus); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra) lost to Levon Aronian (Arm).   Quarterfinals Set Two: Dubov bt Magnus Carlsen (Nor) 2.5-1.5 (Dubov wins the match 1.5-0.5); Radjabov drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus) 2-2 and 1-1 in blitz games; Radjabov wins the match after drawing the Armageddon game with black pieces); Aronian bt Hikaru Nakamura (USA) 2-0; (Aronian wins the match 2-0); Wesley So bt Maxime Vachier-Lagrave 2.5-1.5; (Vachier wins after drawing the Armageddon game with black pieces, following two drawn blitz games) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dubov-stuns-carlsen/article33467771.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Labuschagne doffs hat to the wily Ashwin||Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne were tipped to be the main batsmen for Australia in the ongoing Test series but the Indian bowlers — in particular R. Ashwin — have found a way to keep the two players quiet. Labuschagne conceded that the wily off-spinner has come prepared and won the initial battles so far after Ashwin dismissed Smith and him twice in the first two matches. “I have never faced Ashwin until this series so I don’t have a comparison to other series but you don’t have the stats that Ravi has without being a great bowler and also a great thinker,” Labuschagne said when asked to assess what Ashwin was doing differently in this series that has made him tough to handle. “He has come in prepared and, they are being crafty with their field and what they are trying to do. We have fallen into their trap a few times,” he added. The Australian top-order batsman also said that the heavy leg-side field that India employed with the straight lines the bowlers have used meant the scoring rate also suffered, with the hosts just managing at about two runs per over. “They have certainly come in with a plan with those straight fields and making sure that they are not leaving the stumps and having a really heavy leg-side field. It slows your scoring because you know those shots that you do get on your legs go for one, not four. “And they are always keeping those catchers in the game. You have to be disciplined as they showed when I did glance one around the corner and got caught with that leg slip,” Labuschagne added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/labuschagne-doffs-hat-to-the-wily-ashwin/article33467553.ece
01 January 2021||LONDON,||Liverpool held again||An off-key Liverpool was frustrated for a second successive game by a struggling opponent as it was held to a 0-0 Premier League draw at Newcastle United on Wednesday. Jurgen Klopp’s side had the chance to open up a five-point lead at the top of the table, but a combination of wastefulness and Newcastle’s valiant rearguard kept it at bay. Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino were all guilty of poor finishing for the champion while Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow produced a couple of fine saves. Liverpool had been held to a 1-1 draw by second-bottom West Bromwich on Sunday and drew with Fulham earlier this month. Klopp’s team leads the table going into the New Year with 33 points from 16 games, three ahead of second-placed Manchester United, which has a match in hand. In LaLiga, Real Madrid was held to a disappointing 1-1 draw at struggling Elche on Wednesday, losing ground in the race to leader Atletico Madrid. Suarez nets winner Luis Suarez’s header gave Atletico a 1-0 home win over Getafe in coach Diego Simeone’s 500th game in charge and ending the year with an unbeaten home record. A header from Luka Modric gave Real the lead in the 20th minute but Elche found a way back into the game when Fidel Chaves levelled from the penalty spot early in the second half. Both sides had chances to take all three points, with Elche forward Lucas Boye striking the post, while Real defenders Dani Carvajal and Sergio Ramos were thwarted by fine saves from the home side’s keeper Edgar Badia. The draw halted a six-match winning streak in all competitions for Real. and left it on 33 points, two behind Atletico.  The results: LaLiga: Athletic Bilbao 0 lost to Real Sociedad 1 (Portu 5).   On Wednesday: Premier League: Newcastle 0 drew with Liverpool 0; Tottenham v Fulham — postponed due to coronvirus infections.   LaLiga: Granada 2 (Kenedy 45+2, Molina 88) bt Valencia 1 (Gameiro 36); Atletico 1 (Suarez 20) bt Getafe 0.   Celta Vigo 2 (Nolito 33, Aspas 61) bt Huesca 1 (Seoane 84); Elche 1 (Fidel Chaves 52-pen) drew with Real Madrid 1 (Luka Modric 20).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/liverpool-held-again/article33467585.ece

01 January 2021||Los Angeles,||James celebrates birthday with milestone||Los Angeles superstar LeBron James celebrated his 36th birthday on Wednesday with another NBA milestone, scoring double-digit points for the 1,000th straight game in the Lakers' 121-107 victory over Antonio Spurs. James finished with 26 points to extend his already record streak of double-digit games in the regular season. He sealed the milestone midway through the second quarter with a turnaround jump hook that gave the Lakers a 46-37 lead. Getting better "I just try to live in the moment and just try to continue to get better with my game, try to get better with my teammates and try to just maximise when I'm on the floor," said James, who is in his 18th NBA campaign after leading the Lakers to the 2020 title. James' double-digit scoring streak began on January 6, 2007, when he was playing for Cleveland Cavaliers. Shortly after James reached the milestone, Popovich was ejected from the contest for arguing with officials. Assistant Becky Hammon took over on the Spurs bench, becoming the first woman to direct a team in an NBA game. Heat hits back In early action, Miami Heat rebounded from an embarrassing 47-point loss to Milwaukee with a 119-108 victory over the Bucks in the return match. Goran Dragic came off the bench to lead Miami with 26 points. In Brooklyn, Kyrie Irving scored 17 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and Kevin Durant added 33 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists as the Nets dealt Atlanta Hawks its first defeat of the season, 145-141.  The results:   Dallas Mavericks 99 lost to Charlotte Hornets 118; San Antonio Spurs 107 lost to LA Lakers 121; Boston Celtics 126 bt Memphis Grizzlies 107; Brooklyn Nets 145 bt Atlanta Hawks 141; Miami Heat 119 bt Milwaukee Bucks 108; LA Clippers 128 bt Portland Trail Blazers 105.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/milestone-for-james/article33467737.ece

01 January 2021||KOZHIKODE,||KCA’s new initiative gives hope to players outside age-group tournaments||For K.G. Rojith, time was running out. Twenty seven isn’t exactly the ideal age to break into the State cricket team. So it was indeed a pleasant surprise for him to learn that he had been named in Kerala’s squad for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 tournament, to be held in Mumbai from January 10. He also made a record of sorts because he had never been part of the State team at any age-level tournaments. He could make it because his excellent performances at the various tournaments held across the State were noticed by the Kerala Cricket Association’s Cricket Talent Committee. Rojith, a hard-hitting batsman who bowls leg-spin, isn’t the only beneficiary from KCA’s new initiative. Left-arm spinner P.K. Midhun has also made it to the Kerala team. No platform Neither of those players could have been selected if the KCA hadn’t decided to acknowledge the performance of players in the tournaments, as both had left age-group cricket long ago. With the Jacob Trophy — which used to be the trail tournament to select the senior Kerala team — having been done away with, there was no platform a player once turned 23. “The KCA did the right thing by deciding to give credit to performance of players in tournaments,” says C.M. Deepak, one of the members of the KCA’s talent committee. “Otherwise, a player like Rojith would never have been in the reckoning. I had watched him playing some quickfire knocks at the Celestial tournament at Thiruvananthapuram and had been tracking his performance over the last few years.” The former Ranji Trophy wicket-keeper adds that a few other players had also caught the eye. “We also found M. Arun, who could swing the ball both ways at decent pace, very good, and he is someone Kerala could consider for the Ranji Trophy,” he said. “He has been a consistent performer in the Ernakulam district league for many years.” Excited Rojith, who plays for Athreya Cricket Academy (Thrissur), said he was excited to get selected. “I was hoping to make a mark at the KCA’s proposed T20 league but when it was postponed, I was disappointed,” he says. “I am glad though that my performances in other tournaments were considered.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kcas-new-initiative-gives-hope-to-players-outside-age-group-tournaments/article33467732.ece

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||The prayer for the season||A school of thought considers prayer as simply programming our inner mind. The science of psychology teaches us the power of imagination whereas spirituality teachings stress the importance of gratitude, to achieve our goals. Together, they implore us to a mindset of fulfilment, rather than want, when we yearn for something. ‘I am grateful for the avenues for success at my disposal’ would be a more impactful prayer than ‘I want to be successful’. So what can we pray or wish for during this season? We imagine that as individuals we remain genuine and grounded. That we choose humility over pride. We are grateful for the blessings we cherish and for those we take for granted. We imagine that at home, we care for one another and lend our shoulders to the family to lean on. That we nurture and cherish the bridges of relationships with our loved ones. We are grateful for those we are given to relate to and to the fount of sustenance they provide. We imagine that as a community we move in unison towards common aspirations than individual goals. That we respect beliefs and practices that seem different from ours, and yet retain our uniqueness. We are grateful for and celebrate the strength of the diversity that we are defined by. We imagine that our leaders seek peace and not conflict. That they devote their focus on development rather than division. We are grateful for the power bestowed upon us to choose true leaders. We imagine that humankind renounces the narrow and embraces genuine brotherhood. That the manmade boundaries fade and there is a new dawn of oneness. We are grateful for the ability of humanity to discover this innate goodness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-prayer-for-the-season/article33467545.ece

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Kick-start the year||“Just can’t wait to get on the road again” sang American country music singer Willie Nelson in 1980. Bikers around the world are itching to do just so in 2020. Shuttered indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the community connected virtually and offered moral and mental support to each other. With a vaccine in sight and hopes of a return to normalcy in the new year, the free spirits are once again yearning to head out.   Buddhi Singh, founder of Motorcycle Expeditions, says, “Our fleet of 100 bikes is sitting in garages across the world, desperate to come out and ride.” As Buddhi’s clients are mainly foreign travellers, his Manali-based business came to a virtual standstill. Except for a few fun rides to Shimla, Dharmashala and to closer getaways from Manali, his team stayed put. He is looking forward to restart trips that were shelved in 2020: an India to Burma ride and the Silk Route via Kashgar. Their most popular rides of late had been ones to Kerala. “Those will be done at the end of the year, which is season time,” says Buddhi who has operations in Germany, Australia, the U.S. and Mongolia. Most of the trips curated by his company are two weeks long and the bikes they commonly use are BMW GS 800 cc (in Europe), KTM 500 EXE (in Mongolia), and Royal Enfield in India. “We are looking at 2021 with great hopes of normalcy to put us back on track,” says Buddhi.   “Normally, we have an ‘annual rides’ calendar planned in advance and it is announced well before the year ends. This helps riders plan the trip, but there’s no such calendar yet for 2021. I guess we will be doing many ad hoc rides,” says Jayant Chitale, founder of Mumbai-based motorcycle group Road Stallions. But the one big ride scheduled for November 2021 that seems highly plausible is the cross country ride through Sri Lanka. “We plan a 10- to 12-day trip across Sri Lanka, visiting the country from end to end, stopping at the tourist attractions and driving through its interiors too,” says Jayant. Their first international outing was Bhutan in 2018. This will be their second and they hope the pandemic will subside by the end of 2021. “We are purely a Bullet club and ride only that brand of the Royal Enfield,” says Jayant, adding that the club was founded in 2008 and has a strength of 160. As the pandemic eased towards the end of 2020, the bikers undertook small rides to Hampi, Gokarana and Mudeshwar. “We were just four riders on that trip,” says Jayant. Their second trip of coastal Maharasthra had nine bikers. They were conscious of the social health protocols to be followed on their outings and took all precautions to reduce contact with locals. “We did a lot of research before we began the rides,” says Jayant.   The beaches of Kerala are the destination for the riders of Bullet Crusaders in January 2021. This Mysore-based club was founded in 2017 by Satish Narasimhan, who works for a German firm. Once the restrictions on travel were relaxed, 16 riders of the group took to the road to visit Gandikota, in Andhra Pradesh. “It is the Grand Canyon of the South,” says Sathish. The club’s 75 members consider themselves one big family. In 2019, they did a three-country ride that included Bhutan and Nepal. “During COVID-19 times, we just rode to places close by. But 2021 awaits us with much hope. The bikers are interested in doing a Leh Ladakh trip too, if the situation gets better,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/kick-start-the-year/article33467798.ece

Sai Devi, founder of the start-up, Thicket Tales. “There is so much to learn from our own backyard,” she adds. This is what the company has been trying to show children over lockdown — they have been holding virtual sessions on wildlife, inviting experts to present talks. This month, Thicket Tales is focusing on reptiles. Their session on January 2 is on snakes, and will be held by Yashyash Baradwaj. “The session will focus on the four big venomous snakes,” she says. On January 3, the team hosts an activity on venoms. “Participants can learn about the difference between venom and poison; how the former is produced, and how snakes invest so much energy into secreting venom,” explains Sai. The activity will be STEM-based and children can participate using basic objects.  Both sessions will be held over Zoom at 11.30 a.m. and are open for children aged six and above. Cost: Rs. 249 per child. Prior registration is required.

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Ring in the new||At the beginning of every New Year, we wish our friends, relatives and neighbours “Happy New Year” with joy and hope. But did you know that almost every country has its own tradition? The earliest recorded festivity goes back to ancient Babylon. The first new moon following the vernal equinox marked the beginning of the new year. Known as Akuti, it honoured the rebirth of the natural world. In time, the Julian calendar was followed all over the world and January 1 became the official New Year. But some countries, preferred to celebrate in their own way.    China follows the Gregorian calendar and so it is the Lunar New Year, or the Spring Festival, which falls on a different day every year. The Jews , on the other hand, celebrate their New Year (Rosh Hashanah) in the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. The Scots celebrate Hogmanay on December 31. Festivities combine street entertainment, fire festivals, and concerts. According to the ‘first-footing’ tradition, the first person to cross your threshold that night brings a gift of luck, which is usually coal for the fire or shortbread. In Times Square, New York, the U.S. , a 700-pound ball is lowered on a pole. People watch the ball start its descent and count down the year’s final seconds, singing “Auld Lang Syne”. The Dutch mark this important date with fireworks and explosions, described as “chaotic bursts of light”. The finale is a swim in the freezing waters of the North Sea. The Swiss believe that, if you drop a dollop of ice cream at midnight, you can channel your good luck and wealth. Here are some more ways in which countries celebrate the New Year.  Brazil: Wear White  This signifies luck and prosperity and also wards off bad spirits. People also gather on beaches, ‘jump seven waves’ and throw flowers into the water as an offering to Lemanjá, the goddess of the sea.  Colombia: Carry a suitcase  Partygoers carry empty suitcases at midnight in the hope of a year of travel; money to ensure financial security in the coming year; and baked lentils in their pockets for luck and affluence.  Denmark: Smashing Plates  Smash your plates and old dishes to ward off bad spirits. The Dutch also jump off chairs at midnight to literally leap into the New Year. But, the best part is Kransekage, a wreath-shaped cake made with marzipan rings stacked one on top of another, and decorated with flags and ornaments.  Spain: Eat Grapes  For every toll of the bell at midnight on December 31, eat one grape. The 12 grapes represent good luck for each month of the coming year.  Ecuador: Burn effigies  This signifies the año viejo or old year. Ecuadorians make effigies in the likeness of politicians, pop culture and other iconic figures and set them on fire at midnight. It is meant to symbolise the cleansing of the bad energy from the previous 12 months and bring in good fortune.  Japan: Bonekai or Year-Forgetting Parties  This day symbolises renewal and bidding farewell to the problems of the previous year with ‘year-forgetting parties’. On December 31, Buddhists temples strike their gongs 108 times with each ring representing one of the 108 earthy temptations a person must overcome to achieve nirvana and expel wrong deeds and the ill luck of the previous year. So how did you bring in the New Year?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/ring-in-the-new/article33468432.ece

With lockdown, quarantine, social distancing and more, life became unrecognisable around the world. The new year brings some hope.

With this, the expectation is that this year will be slightly more ‘normal’ than the previous one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/looking-ahead/article33468403.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||To new beginnings||Hello and welcome to the first week of 2021. I’m just back from two weeks with my cousins and grandparents. It was nice to get out of my house and, well…be inside their house? Because, really, we didn’t do any of the things we usually do. No beach, midnight ice creams, or football in the park. We pretty much stayed indoors. When we were leaving, my aunt gave me a planner for 2021 and told me that I could fill it up with the cool things I planned to do in the new year. It was a really nice gift, but I was a little surprised. I mean after everything that happened in 2020, are we all going to really try and plan anything anymore? What’s the point? Last year, all my amazing plans for Class VII went down the toilet, thanks to COVID-19. I was going to make the school band, remember? I was going to take loads of wickets in inter-school matches. Instead, I spent the entire year in front of my laptop at home, doing dry swimming classes (Don’t ask!). New beginning I know everyone thinks that a new year is a chance for a new beginning, a chance to hit ctrl+z and undo the past. But, let’s not forget COVID-19 is still around. Sure, there’s a vaccine on the horizon, but who knows how long it will take to reach our butt cheeks? So, here I am, in possession of a really nice ‘planner’ for 2021 and no idea what to do with it. I won’t lie, I’m also kind of scared that if I try to plan anything, then I’m just going to jinx the next 12 months. I don’t think I’ve ever started a new year feeling so… lost? Unsure? I couldn’t shake that feeling off till I started re-reading Andy and Lucy Neanderthal by Jeffrey Brown. I realised that time, days, weeks, years and calendars are all kind of a recent phenomenon. Well, recent in the grand scheme of the universe anyway. It was the Egyptians who started to keep time, right? Or was it the Romans? Anyway, cavemen didn’t have calendars, which means they didn’t have New Year anxiety to deal with. They were more worried about the chance of a sabre-toothed tiger waiting outside their cave looking for breakfast. Just like I woke up today wondering if COVID-19 would still be out there in the world.) So, maybe I’m not going to plan my birthday or sleepovers or (not) getting haircuts, but I’m definitely not going to wait for something fun to happen. If I find I have a few minutes or hours free in a day, I’m just going to do something fun on the spot. Like give the Pesky Brother a haircut when he’s sleeping. 2021 is already looking like fun.  Cavemen didn’t have calendars, which means they didn’t have New Year anxiety to deal with...||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/to-new-beginnings/article33468457.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A bright beginning…||There was a problem in the house. Everyone was angry. And sad. And hyper excited. It had been a terrible year. Mom hadn’t been to office in nine months. Dad had started “attending” office through his computer, but it wasn’t the same. He sat before the screen talking to various people who, of course, couldn’t see that below his shirt and tie, he wore only shorts. Asha missed her school and friends. It was the year of the pandemic. You had to wear a mask when you went out. You had to wash your hands every now and then. You couldn’t shake hands. Coughing and sneezing were looked upon as a sin. Everyone hoped the next year would be better. Young Deepak had always been hyperactive. He couldn’t sit still for long. They said it was a condition of his brain. His mind ran in different directions. His feet wanted to go to one place, his hands went somewhere else. Dad, Mom and Asha remained with him as much as they could, trying to make him comfortable. One day, they got him a large white canvas and some paints and showed him how nice it was to make colourful shapes on the white surface. Deepak stared at it for some time, then turned away. The canvas and paints lay in his room, untouched. Mom said, “Hope next year’s better. I can’t wait for things to be nice and normal again.” She sat down to rest, being very tired, after having finished cooking, cleaning up, and running after Deepak. Stroke of curiosity A little later, Deepak found the others absorbed in their own things. Mom was reading, Dad was watching TV, and Asha was on the phone with a friend. No one seemed interested in him. He popped over to his room and saw the canvas and tubes of paint. He placed the canvas on the easel and opened all the tubes. He took out the brush. A bright colour interested him. He dipped his brush in it and applied a splash on the bright white canvas. The bold crimson stroke excited him. “Let’s see the other colours,” he told himself. When his parents and Asha came looking for him, there he was before the canvas. It was no longer white. They stood staring at the painting. It was one of the most beautiful things they’d seen. It wasn’t a picture of people or animals, trees or flowers. It was just splashes and whorls of bright colours that seemed to have come alive, dancing and flowing and laughing. “Beautiful!” said Asha. “Deepak, this is magic!” “You turned out to be such a wonderful artist!” grinned Dad. Mom’s eyes filled with happy tears. “The sad year is over,” she said. “This New Year will be filled with colour and joy!” Deepak smiled at them, holding his brush. He was ready for his next canvas.  “Hope next year’s better. I can’t wait for things to be nice and normal again.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/a-bright-beginning/article33468462.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||21 for 2021||The past year was very different from what we expected, and no one can predict how 2021 will be either. However, here are things you can do, no matter how the new year turns out. 1. Read at least one book a month; by the end of 2021, you will have finished 12 books. 2. Have a ‘World on a Plate’ night every month. Pick a country and make some popular dishes from its cuisine for the family. 3. Learning a new language is fun. How about learning sign language, instead? Start with some important sentences. 4. Your health is crucial, so drink at least six glasses of water every day. 5. Have a movie night once a month with each family member taking turns to pick either a classic watch or a new film. 6. Go through old toys, books or clothes that are still in good condition and donate them. 7. Develop a green thumb. Start growing plants, flowers or vegetables. You get extra points if it survives till the end of the year. 8. Everyone likes to be appreciated. Send at least one hand-written letter to people you appreciate the most — your parents, grandparents, teachers, best friends, cousins... 9. Stay in touch with people by hosting a virtual game night with your friends or family who aren’t near, once every three months or so. 10. Try your hand at journaling. Write about your day or maintain a gratitude journal, where you list things you are thankful for. 11. Watch a sunrise or a sunset depending on where you live. 12. Fitness can be made interesting. Learn at least one or two fun choreographed dance routines. 13. Gift a treat! Bake a special and yummy cake or cookies for someone’s birthday. 14. Learn a new skill, sport or a game like chess. Or keep it interesting and learn how to juggle. 15. Do at least one random act of kindess. It could be helping your parents, sibling, grandparents, neighbours... It’s nice to be thoughtful. 16. Remember your vitamins and minerals are important too! Have at least two fruits or vegetables a day. 17. Build your vocabulary. Try to learn a new word daily and use it in a sentence at least once during the day. 18. Take the path less travelled; in this case, the stairs instead of the elevator whenever you have the chance. 19. Get crafty. Work on an arts and crafts project; paint, crochet, or build something with recycled materials. How about bird feeders for summer? 20. If you get pocket money or some change for helping around the house or a gift from your grandparents, try to put some, if not all, into a piggy bank that you will open only at the end of the year. 21. This might be a tough one. Try to keep your room clean and things organised for most of the year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/21-for-2021/article33468470.ece

NASA’s rover, Perseverance, will land on Mars to look for signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples. Missions from the U.A.E. and China are also expected to arrive on the Red Planet this year. In a test for ‘planetary defence’, NASA plans to launch a car-sized craft that will deliberately crash into an asteroid’s moon in 2022 to tweak its orbit. Another exciting launch is the James Webb Space Telescope, the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built. Chandrayaan-3, India’s planned mission to the moon, is likely to be launched too. Preparations will also be underway for Gaganyaan, the country’s first-ever human space mission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/reaching-for-the-stars/article33468412.ece

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Exuberant as always||The concert spirit for Ranjani and Gayatri comes from each other and themselves as much as from the large audience that they usually attract. The absence of physical audience did little to dampen their exuberance. Besides their execution skills and finesse, they crafted a well-thought-out performance as well. The Vaikunta Ekadasi day concert had them featuring five languages, five composers and five ragas, all in praise of the deity whose special day it was. They also do not leave it to the main piece to score the bulk of laurels. Every song had its bright spot. They began with ‘Santhana gopalakrishnam’ (Khamas, Dikshitar) that starts at the upper shadjam, giving the sisters the start they would have aspired for. Swarams at the sprightly ‘Nartana Muralidharam’ swayed in their alternating styles. Ranjani’s Varali raga alapana followed a characteristic course and L. Ramakrishnan embellished it with pleasing phrases. Andal’s ‘Aazhi mazhai kanna,’ in statistical terms, must be the most prolific Thiruppavai sung in concerts and was, therefore, a foregone choice. There was a brief swara segment at ‘Vazha’ that had a sarvalaghu streak. Purandaradasar’s beautiful Manirangu composition in misra chapu, ‘Ikko namma swami,’ was like a carrom ball, its flight lingering in the mind even after it ended. Ranjani and Gayatri handled it with the tenderness the raga and lyrics demanded. The Kamboji alapana by Gayatri was not in their default runaway style. It was poignant, even soft, and the finishing meandering at the ga, ma, ri was exquisite. Ramakrishnan’s sangatis were serene and grammatically saatvik. You never tire of listening to some kritis — ‘O Rangasayee’ by Tyagaraja is certainly one such. Ranjani and Gayatri revelled in the vast range of sangatis, the scale span and the kriti’s stream-like tempo, embroidering it at every stage, especially in the niraval at, you guessed it right, ‘Bhooloka vaikuntam.’ The sisters’ natural effervescence reflected in the swarams and the kuraippu at ‘da’ that followed. Ramakrishnan maintained a good balance of vilamba and pep in the niraval and swaram. He managed to keep the contest even, matching the sisters’ performance. The adrenaline piece for a large section of the audience was the abhang, ‘Vithoba chala,’ in Maruva Behag, which was rendered zestfully. Ramakrishnan revelled in the strong melody component of the Ranjani-Gayatri template. Manoj Siva (mridangam) and Anirudh Athreya (kanjira), largely played supporting roles, but had the skills to make it count. The concert largely settled on one tempo perhaps because of the short duration. It is, of course, a travesty to some extent to have a 90-minute concert for singers capable of a long flight of substance and delight, but that is the price of going virtual.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/exuberant-as-always/article33468065.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||An intelligent concert||One of the challenges in a concert of shorter duration is to offer a variety of ragas, kalapramanams and composers. It calls for a good thought process and execution skills, both of which Sowmya has in abundance. Her concert had a silken feel to it arising from the soft handling of ragas such as Takka, Karaharapriya and Saranga. Sowmya sang ‘Eranapai’ (Thodi varnam), a safe start to get the voice into action and fluency. The next piece, ‘Varana mukava’ (Hamsadhwani, Koteeswara Iyer) has a nice rhythm to it, with features like a delayed start from samam, the first line aligned to the arohanam, in-built laya, multiple speeds, and beautiful Tamil words. The brief swaras also kept up the unique character of the composition. Sowmya sang a karvai-laden raga alapana of Takka, not often heard in concerts since the days of MLV. Her intelligence came through in her attempt to keep the raga swaroopam intact and away from adjacencies. Embar Kannan responded well with phrase choices that kept circling the lifeline of the raga. Tyagaraja’s ‘Raka sasivadana’ is the popular kriti in this raga and Sowmya’s handling of it was sober. It is a good idea to present some swaras whenever a rare raga is sung, to expose and drive home the raga lakshana. The chittaswaram and swaras at ‘raka’ were engaging without being dreary. Embellishing sangatis Dikshitar’s Panchalinga kriti invoking the god of fire at Tiruvannamalai, ‘Arunachala natham’, (Saranga, rupakam 2 kalai) was presented in an enjoyable kalapramanam. It provided a change in the tempo of the concert. Sowmya’s Karaharapriya alapana was largely conventional, but some micro-sangatis offered embellishments. Kannan blended his sweet violin notes and a purposeful raga track to offer something that was larger than what was indicated by the time he took. Sowmya chose ‘Janaki pathe,’ a Papanasam Sivan masterpiece in the raga with a bounty of words and a Tyagaraja-style flow. Niraval at ‘Saroruha charana’ was a smart choice given its ateeta eduppu and janta swara style of starting. Sowmya and Kannan laid more accent on the top half of the scale in the niraval with characteristic phrases. Swara korvai was measured but the appointment with kuraippu was kept, with landings on ‘da.’ Despite the time limits, the vistara of the main piece was not compromised, but there is always more to display in such a piece. ‘Bhajare ethunaadam’ (Sadasiva Brahmendral, Pilu) complimented the song list as a bhakti piece in a soulful raga. Embar Kannan, with an eye on the clock, brought out the essence of alapana and niraval, keeping his interventions crisp. Senior percussionist Neyveli Narayanan’s competent playing enhanced the concert’s vitality, and propped it up when the energy sometimes seemed to slacken. H. Prasanna on the ghatam supported well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/an-intelligent-concert/article33468067.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||On a contemplative note||In what is generally the warm-up phase of a Carnatic concert, Aishwarya Shankar sprang a pleasant surprise by treading at a particularly slow pace. Into the 12th minute, she initiated a Tyagaraja kriti with unusual slowness. Without dragging in the least, ‘Enta vedukondu’ brought out the beseeching mood of its Telugu lyrics. The suite in Saraswati Manohari raga effectively set the contemplative tone for the entire performance. The young vocalist owes much of the erudite leisureliness to a school that has branched out of Musiri Subramania Iyer’s (1899-1975) music. The expansiveness of Aishwarya’s anupallavi session, starting with ‘Chinta dichuta,’ carried the stamp of her guru Suguna Varadachari, a disciple of Musiri. Aishwarya employed the first half of that line as niraval. Minor flaws apart, the exercise merits appreciation. Such is the challenge, which violinist R K Shriramkumar too sensed in his turn. To build sweeping arches with Saraswati Manohari is an aesthetically pleasing and technically strong idea. The raga has its parent scale in Harikamboji, which can be treated classically even with plain notes. The unhurriedness of the piece in Desadi tala magnified the role of the percussionists as well. Both K. Arun Prakash (mridangam) and N. Guruprasad (ghatam) came up with the patterned playing the occasion merited. A serene start Aishwarya’s kutcheri marked the end of the Indira Ranganathan Trust’s 2020 Margazhi calendar, and the singer opened it serenely with Muthuswami Dikshitar’s ‘Sri nathadi guruguho’ in Mayamalavagowla. Varali, coming third, was a nice choice. The alapana, largely relaxed, did have its share of frills. This could possibly be traced to Calcutta K.S. Krishnamurthy, also Suguna’s teacher. Syama Sastri’s ‘Karuna judavamma’ in misra chapu saw the ghatam singly handling certain percussive passages. A relatively quick ‘Sri sankara guruvaram’ (Nagaswaravali) was the bridge to the centrepiece. In Bhairavi, soft touches laced the weightiness of the raga in an alapana that spanned a good 21 minutes, vocal and violin put together. ‘Nee padamule gatiyani’ embodied the beauty of Bhairavi with its essential sways studded with gamakas. The niraval, ‘Omkara sadani bhavani,’ reinforced Aishwarya’s architectural skills while proving yet again the power of Musiri-style repose. A hint of falsetto Aishwarya deployed in an upper register of ‘Enta vedukondu’ made no reappearance in the hour-long Bhairavi package. The tani avartanam was suitably devoid of agitation. A short piece in Kedaragowla followed. Succeeding this was a virutham. ‘Namami dootam ramasya,’ penned by 17th-century theologian Raghavendra Tirtha, in Kapi. Strung to it were lines tuned in Hamsanandi and Behag. A sudden flurry of Hindustani-accent melodies, only to wind up with the quintessentially Carnatic Yadukula Kamboji. That was the raga for ‘Swami mukhyaprana,’ written by Purandaradasa. The bhajan bore the lightness typical of the last leg of a two-and-a-half-hour concert. A breezy Yamunakalyani number preceded the mangalam. Arun Prakash, being left-handed, customarily sits on the right of the stage. Shriramkumar chose a slot closer to the vocalist, apparently to support Aishwarya, who is also his protégé. That worked for the camera too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/on-a-contemplative-note/article33468075.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Complex and emotional show||As the city’s virtual music season moves towards its final phase, a notable downside in an otherwise breakthrough experiment has been the monotonous look and feel of the concerts and a template-driven format. With permanent sets and unchanging lighting and camera angles, it’s been hard to find any visual or spatial relief. And what makes it worse is how some musicians have adapted to the shorter format by cutting down on the content, harking back to the old era of album recordings. Thankfully, Saketharaman’s concert was pleasantly different. Instead of presenting a miniaturised version of a three-hour concert, he chose his content carefully: A 17-minute long Karaharapriya to begin with, a fairly detailed Sahana, and a 50-minute long Ragam Tanam Pallavi in Madhuvanthi with three shorter pieces in Bilahari, Maand and Kurinji thrown in between. There was no rush, it had the same gait and spread of a regular concert, and a mixed flavour of ragas. Saketharaman curated the concert around a theme, ‘Tyagayyarum Thamizh Thyaggayarum - Tyagaraja and Papanasam Sivan,’ presenting compositions by both. He also gave brief contextual introductions to each song that he presented. Detailed exposition The centre-piece of the concert was his RTP in Madhuvanthi, a Hindustani raga that has long since been borrowed by Carnatic music. Although there have been a few compositions, including the famous ‘Kanda naal mudhalai’ by Thanjavur S. Kalyanaraman and a Lalgudi thillana, there haven’t been many detailed expositions in the raga, except an RTP by Sanjay Subrahmanyan. It’s a raga with innate romance, beauty and tenderness, and Saketh’s alapana embodied both. He traversed through the raga languorously while gently caressing its sweet spots and slowly summoning up an atmosphere of affection and intimacy. The Tanam that followed maintained the same mood with spirited violin replays by H.N. Bhaskar. What was notable also was the dynamics that N.C. Bharadwaj created on his mridangam, making it sometimes sound almost like the human voice, to suit the ethos of the raga and Saketh’s rendition. The pallavi was both in Sanskrit and Tamil, denoting Tyagaraja and Papanasam Sivan respectively, and was followed by Ragamalika swarams in Gowlai, Saramathi and Sivaranjani. Saketh’s concert began with a virutham ‘Innum dayavillaya’ in Karaharapriya, a favourite raga of both Tyagaraja and Sivan. It was preceded by a highly evocative Pasuram by Thondaradipodi Azhwar, ‘Oor illen kaani illai’. The virutham was replete with delicate sangatis, an attribute that Saketh is known for, which accentuated its meaning, particularly the pleas to god for mercy. His swaras and acceleration soon kicked up a lively laya in which Bharadwaj, Anirudh Athreya (kanjira) and Bhaskar joined as an ensemble. It was a vibrant start to the concert. “Digital concerts are the T20 equivalents in music. The power-play overs start from the first ball,” says Saketh. Sahana is an over-exposed raga and can be tiring if sung with excessive rakti; but Saketh’s ‘Emanadichevo’ (Tyagaraja) that came next had a slightly neutral flavour. It was a bit slower to suit the meaning of the song (Will you converse with me?) and had longish glides. I thought the characteristic gamakas didn’t curve too much and hence the alapana sounded more sophisticated and less predictable. He immediately threw in a quick ‘Kanukontini’ in Bilahari by Tyagaraja before moving on to the RTP, which was followed by a virutham and the popular composition, ‘Ramanai bhajithal’ in Maand by Papanasam Sivan. The end piece, a lullaby ‘Kanne en kanmaniye’ in Kurunji by Papanasam Sivan, was outstanding. Saketh usually aces in speed and musical imagination in the pallavis and swaras, but in this rendition he went ultra-slow, fully personalising the spirit and emotion of a lullaby. I have never heard him in such a vilambit tempo. His laya was rock-steady even at this slow speed and his accompanists didn’t fail to follow his steps. Over the past few years, Saketharaman has been carefully choosing his concert repertoire to make it aesthetically diverse and more flavoursome. Ragas with a lot of complexity and emotional appeal have been an unmissable feature of his concerts. For instance, last Margazhi, his full-fledged renditions of Subhapantuvarali and Desh were remarkable. This year, it is his Madhuvanthi that will be long remembered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/complex-and-emotional-show/article33468087.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Precious abharanam, Sankarabharanam||The Thanjavur Maratha kings were among the greatest patrons of the arts, and Carnatic music flourished during their reign with an ever-increasing number of vidwans offering a veritable banquet of music at their courts. Thanjavur thus became the royal seat of music. The Maratha kings won the hearts of the vidwans with their deep appreciation of music as well as their awards and generous endowments. The titles and honorifics reveal how well the musicians were appreciated — Veenai Perumalaiyer, Pallavi Gopalaiyer, Irattai Pallavi or Sanjeevi Sivaramaiyer, Sallagal Krishnaiyer, Ghanam Krishnaiyer, Tsoukam Srinivasaiyengar and Thodi Seetaramaiyer. To the kings also goes the credit of patronising Pachimiriyam Adiyappaiya, who was not only a great musician himself, but had also taught many musicians, including some of those mentioned above. During the reign of Serfoji — another connoisseur of the arts — there was a talented musician named Narasaiyar. Once, in the king’s presence, he sang the ragam  Sankarabharanam, with an expansive alapana and imaginative kalpanaswaras. The king and the audience were enthralled with his singing. “We have never heard Sankarabharanam sung like this!” they exclaimed unanimously. The king gave the musician many gifts and bestowed on him the title ‘Sankarabharanam’ Narasaiyar. And that was how  he was addressed thereafter, this ragam becoming a popular choice at all his concerts. Pledging ragas for loan Once Narasaiyar, deep in debt, was forced to borrow, but his efforts to find a lender were in vain. He approached Ramabadra Moopanar of Kapisthalam, a wealthy and generous music connoisseur. After enjoying Moopanar’s warm hospitality for a few days, he gently broached the purpose of his visit. “I have incurred some unexpected expenditure. I feel greatly inhibited about asking anyone for money, but then I remembered you. I thought I might get a loan from you." “Loan? How much do you need?” asked Moopanar. “Eighty sovereigns,” replied Narasaiyar. “You say you want a loan. Will you pledge anything as security?” asked Moopanar. “Yes, I will,” said Narasaiyar, after some thought. “What will you give as security? An ornament, an abharanam. Let me see it,” said Moopanar. “You cannot see it, you can hear it, it is imperishable, it is a spring of joy, it is my ragam Sankarabharanam. I pledge it. Until I return this gold, I promise I will not sing it anywhere.” Moopanar agreed and gave the gold. Narasaiyar signed a deed, left with the gold and settled his debts. After that, he sang other ragams at his concerts but never sang Sankarabharanam. At this time there lived in Kumbakonam a wealthy man named Appu Rayar, a high-ranking employee of the East India Company. Since he wielded influence in Thanjavur and Tiruchirapalli, he was called Ubhaya Samasthana Diwan. Wallis, a British officer had great regard for Appu Rayar, so he was even called Wallis Appu Rayar. He owned properties in Reddirayar Agraharam in Kumbakonam. A wedding came up in Rayar’s family. He wanted to celebrate it grandly, and he arranged for concerts by the best musicians, including Narasaiyar. During the concert, Appu Rayar and the audience requested Narasaiyar to sing Sankarabharanam. Narasaiyar explained that he had pledged the ragam, and could not sing it until he had repaid the loan. Appurayar was astonished to hear this and offered to help him repay the loan. He sent an emissary with the gold (together with the interest accrued) to Moopanar, asking him to close the loan and redeem the pledge. Moopanar immediately set out to Kumbakonam and met Narasaiyar and Appu Rayar. “Forgive me,” said Moopanar. “The great vidwan has the right to ask me for any amount. Is not my wealth only to help people like him? It hurt me that he needed a loan. In jest, I asked for security and he offered the ragam. It shows his integrity that he has not sung it since. This money is not mine, it is his. You give it back to him. Moreover, for imprisoning Sankarabharanam all these days, let there be a penalty on me, also to be paid to him. Here is the release deed.” “We have seen borrowers returning the loan with interest. But for a lender to return the money along with penalty is unheard of,” said everyone, amazed by Moopanar’s magnanimity. The next day, at the wedding, Narasaiyar sang Sankarabharanam and its notes poured like nectar from the heavens on the audience below. And Narasaiyar became Appu Rayar’s favourite vidwan.

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Inspired by Bharatiyar’s works||To celebrate the works of one of the greatest Tamil poets, Subramania Bharathi, the U.S.-based Odissi dancer Prasanna Karthik decided to present some of his verses through the dance form. “Since I am passionate about Tamil literature, especially Bharatiyar’s poems, I thought why not convey its essence through Odissi. Something that has not been attempted earlier. I am happy that this way I will be able to share his amazing works with non-Tamil speaking people,” says Prasanna, who is married into the Mahakavi’s family. Her guru Nandita Behera has choreographed the pieces. “Since she cannot understand Tamil, I translated every line for her. It was an exciting process. Though we were initially apprehensive about the outcome, I am happy with the positive response to the video,” says Prasanna. “Dance and poetry are beyond language. It is the emotion that matters,” adds the young dancer, who is gearing up to do more such productions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/inspired-by-bharatiyars-works/article33468091.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Change as formula||Like everything else, the Carnatic concert is also changing. It has always been in a state of change — intrinsically — as individuals looked at it in new ways and bestowed it with fresh meaning. Tradition, therefore, was never a clinical hand-me-down, but altered with individual talent. Then why does change, happening at this juncture in its history, seem so overwhelming? Change, to use that simple word, was inherent to the artistic process of the great GNB or MDR or T. Brinda. The slowness, the speed, the way they interpreted a kriti was the outcome of a conversation between emotion and intellect, and a deeper dialogue with music itself. It was a vulnerable moment in which they surrendered to the callings of their art. Hence, in what was a profound, personal quest, all the masters brought their own selves into the art form. Change was innate. But change in the Carnatic space today is more or less a formula. It is a conscious design, and can be recognised in almost every concert. Concerts are full of surprises, thrills — they are crowd-pullers, and they regale the senses. This process is universal, irrespective of what the beginnings of the musician have been. R. Ashwath Narayanan, an extremely talented young musician, was featured by Music Academy last week in the sub-senior slot. Trained under the legendary Palghat K.V. Narayanaswamy and later under Padma Narayanaswamy, Ashwath Narayanan displays both felicity and knowledge. Breezy pace He began the concert with ‘Seethamma mayamma’ in raga Vasantha, which was followed by ‘Manasa guruguha roopam’ in Anandabhairavi. Both these kritis were rendered in a breezy pace and we were already at the third, ‘Brochevarevarura,’ in Khamas. The alapana — succinct, well-structured, flowing — was the highlight of this one-hour concert. While the first half had long, bhava-driven phrases, the latter part had ornamental variations and flash sangatis. The kalpanaswaras had some interesting aspects, the kriti was a matter-of-fact rendition. The concert ended with a ragamalika rendition of a Arunagirinathar composition, ‘Vizhikku thunai thiru men malar’ leading to a Murugan song in Sindhu Bhairavi, ‘Manathil ugandhadhu.’ This final piece had some evocative moments, giving it a reflective quality. The short duration of the concert could have been a hindrance to an elaborate approach, but the concert could certainly have been planned better. Tribute to Tamil Since it was a concert for Tamil Isai Sangam , Trichur Brothers — Sri Krishna Mohan and Ramkumar Mohan mostly sang Tamil numbers. It was, in a way, a tribute to the Tamil language and the composers and all the great musicians who rendered Tamil compositions. It made the whole concert a nostalgic experience, each piece taking one back to earlier renditions by the past masters. They opened with ‘Gajavadana karuna sadana’ (Papanasam Sivan), in Sriranjani. Brisk and vibrant, it ushered in a momentum. A brief alapana in Vachaspati was followed by the famed kriti, ‘Parathpara parameshwara’ (Papanasam Sivan). The niraval at ‘Ariya ayanum kaana...’ was clean, and so was the imaginative and energetic swaraprastara. In alignment with each other’s thought process, they made a diligent presentation. Sai Rakshith on the violin excelled. ‘Thoomani madathu’ in Hamir Kalyani, the ninth Pasuram of the Tiruppavai is a beautiful composition with wistful cadences. The neat presentation had a Hindustani accent in the improvisation portions (Shuddha Sarang hovered in places). They presented, in Mayamalavagowla, Ramalinga Swamigal’s virutham ‘Petra thai’ and one couldn’t help getting nostalgic about Dandapani Desikar’s rendition. The brothers displayed synchronisation and understanding, extending each other’s ideas in Varali (‘Kaa vaa vaa’), sometimes creating a pleasing harmony. How can one not remember MDR when ‘Varugalamo ayya’ is rendered? Stately and majestic, beseeching, prayerful and supplicant, the rendition is iconic. Set to raga Manji, the kriti has been rendered by several artistes, creating a spectrum of textures: the Trichur Brothers added to it. In all, it was a well-planned concert. Both concerts displayed skill and prowess, and were technically sound. Yet, somehow, they failed to stir one. Carnatic concerts are now more confident and less vulnerable. They have become external — the stress is on virtuosity and impressing the audience. Music, unless an internal process, can only imitate an emotion but cannot create one. This new change is worrisome, it is a modernity that has no soul. The audience should set higher standards — great art after all is the collective journey of both the rasika and the artiste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/change-as-formula/article33468052.ece
01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||At her creative best||The need to make a concert engaging within a limited time frame is undoubtedly a challenge. Amritha Murali managed it with élan, making an intelligent choice of ragas and kritis for her concert. Raga expositions and swara segments are always the deciding factors of a programme’s quality. Amritha Murali, with her voice in fine form, presented with a dedicated approach two vintage yet evergreen ragas — Dhanyasi and Kamboji — that were filled with bhava. The raga expansions and the phrases were developed steadily to highlight the melody as well as the nuances of each raga. For her Dhanyasi exposition, Amritha focused on the raga’s high melodic quality and her lengthy karvais at the right places created a great impact. As for Kamboji, the main raga, Amritha opted to highlight its grandeur and elegance with not just the time-tested phrases, but with creative prayogas to make them sound fresh, and with exact ‘sruti’ aligned stopovers that added depth to the raga treatise. Rich in lyrical content The choice of kritis added lustre to the raga essays — ‘Meena lochana brova’ by Syama Sastri in Dhanyasi and ‘Kana kann kodi vendum’ by Papanasam Sivan in Kamboji. As both kritis are rich in lyrical content there is always the possibility of lethargy setting in if the tempo is stretched beyond a point. But Amritha handled it with aplomb. In ‘Meena lochana’, ‘Kama palini’ was taken up for niraval and swaras with full restraint. In Kamboji, the niraval was at ‘Manikkam vairam’ and the vocalist linked it to interesting swara matrices landing on ‘dhaivatam’ before leading on to a grand finale. Mysore Srikanth matched Amritha’s renditions with equal poise. He played the ragas succinctly but not at the expense of the quality. His replies in raga treatises and swara passages were quite enjoyable. A brief raga alapana to highlight the charm of Ranjani was well-suited for Tyagaraja’s ‘Durmargachara’. Amritha’s repertoire included ‘Ramanukku mannan’ in Anandabhairavi by Arunachala Kavi and ‘Saraswati manohari’ in Saraswati Manohari raga by Muthuswami Dikshitar. The last piece was a Pasuram by Kulasekara Azhwar, ‘Chediyaya val vinaigal’, in Yamunakalyani, followed by Thirumangai Azhwar’s verse ‘Kongalarnda’ in a Ragamalika. Manoj Siva made his presence conspicuous in percussion, and his tani avartanam was soft and delicate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/at-her-creative-best/article33468081.ece

01 January 2021||January 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Ringing in the New Year||To say the year 2020 was overwhelming and upsetting is an understatement. A full year has passed, and sadly, the world is still under the tight grip of COVID-19. The biggest incident of the year started small, but spread faster than a rampant forest fire. Ironically, the pandemic became the biggest equalizer of all; highly developed nations were just as helpless as underdeveloped countries. Needless to say, COVID-19 or the Corona virus shook and rattled the world. It made every individual the world over sit up and rethink every aspect of their lives. Right from attending schools and offices to allowing anyone – friend, relation or foe, from entering our abodes. But the pandemic also threw up unexpected opportunities. In actuality, the year 2020 has been an unexpected one, while there was a whole lot of bad, there were quite a few aspects that were good and previously unimaginable. The most severely effected by the pandemic were the various industries. For many businesses, 2020 has been a matter of survival rather than development. And the key to survival is adaptation. Only the businesses that adapted to the changing market scenario could gain a competitive advantage. Most businesses were forced to digitally upgrade themselves on a much-accelerated timeframe than they had ever envisioned. Going forward, in the year 2021, even more new measures in workplaces are expected to come into effect. Work-from-home or remote-working has emerged from being a provisional arrangement during the worldwide lockdowns to an acceptable style of working. And that has revolutionised office culture to such an extent that it is the new-normal for work, which has been welcomed by some and despised by many more. The most significant upside of this work culture is that it allows more flexibility and focusses on overall wellbeing. As we move into a new decade, with so many powerful digital tools and technologies at our disposal, many companies are looking at ways to continue the changes wrought by 2020 and turn them into a more positive way of working with or without restrictions. Although it is an accepted reality that by mid-2021, when the much awaited COVID vaccines would be freely available, many bosses would be revisiting and questioning the efficiency and downsides of this evolved work culture. The year 2020 started and ended on a stormy note – it started with COVID-19 and ended with a new strain of the same, also with a promise of a cure or rather, a vaccination. And as the year 2020 departs, it is time to look forward to the new year, the new month, the new day and the new dawn with a whole lot of hope for good health, good cheer and good tidings. - Uma Chodavarapu||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ringing-in-the-new-year/article33468333.ece
