12 January 2021||New Delhi,||SC ‘intends’ to stay farm laws||The Supreme Court on Monday said it intended to stay the implementation of the controversial agricultural laws while proposing to form an independent committee chaired by a former Chief Justice of India to “amicably resolve” the stand-off between the farmers and the Union government. A three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, underlined its “disappointment” at the Centre’s handling of the protest, including the string of failed talks, States “up in rebellion”, suicides among protesters and the sight of aged farmers, women and children suffering in the biting cold amid the pandemic. “We don’t want to make any stray observations against you... But we are extremely disappointed in the way you are handling this situation. You [Centre] made a law without enough consultation, resulting in a strike. Many States are up in rebellion against you... The whole thing has been going on for months... You say you are negotiating, talking... What negotiating? What talking? What is going on?” Chief Justice Bobde told Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal and Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta. The court will pass orders on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-intends-to-stay-farm-laws/article33554298.ece
12 January 2021||MANGALURU,||Seven CNG stations to become functional in a week||Petrol-fired motor vehicles in Mangaluru can go green soon as Gail Gas Ltd., a subsidiary of GAIL India Ltd., will be commissioning at least seven Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) stations within a week in different corners of the city. By this financial year-end, the company plans to open at least 15 CNG stations in Dakshina Kannada, according to Gail Gas General Manager Villin Zunke. The company has set a total target of establishing 100 CNG stations across Dakshina Kannada in eight years. Apparatus for seven CNG stations have already been installed at seven petrol pumps being operated by public sector oil marketing companies and they are undergoing testing and validation by the authorities concerned. They are: IOCL Kulur, HPCL Hosabettu, IOCL Haleyangadi, HPCL Mulki, HPCL Kavoor and one each IOCL and HPCL in Adyar. The company would encourage eligible individuals to open new CNG dealership in the district who can provide land for the station. Gail Gas would provide the apparatus while the dealer has to manage day-to-day operation of the station. This became possible with the Kochi-Koottanad-Mangaluru liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline being commissioned and later dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 5. The areas were closer to LNG receiving stations at Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers and at Arkula where distribution pipe laying work is in progress. Domestic supply The government has also given a target of providing 3.5 lakh piped natural gas (PNG) connections to households and commercial establishments in Dakshina Kannada district in eight years. The initial concentration would be to cover Mangaluru taluk followed by other taluks, Mr. Zunke said. Agencies empanelled by Gail Gas have already booked 47,000 connections, while 4,300 connections were already given in different parts of the city. As many as 50 out of the 60 wards in Mangaluru City Corporation limits are being covered. LNG would begin flowing to kitchens in households once distribution pipeline work is completed. Consumers will be issued bi-monthly bills with meter readers visiting each meter location. Remote reading of meters is being explored, Mr. Zunke told The Hindu . The Koch-Mangaluru LNG pipeline will, in all, facilitate 21 lakh PNG connections in cities en route , the Prime Minister had announced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/seven-cng-stations-to-become-functional-in-a-week/article33555000.ece
12 January 2021||Chennai,||Swedish manufacturer chooses T.N. over Vietnam||Autoliv Inc., a fortune 500 company headquartered in Sweden, is setting up its manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu at an investment of Rs. 100 crore. It has bought land for the plant at Cheyyar to make air-bags. The project is expected to create jobs for over 400 people. Autoliv Inc. develops, manufactures and markets air-bags, seat belts and steering wheels. Statistically, more than three air-bags or seat belts from Autoliv have been delivered to every vehicle produced globally during the past 10 years. Sources told The Hindu that the company was initially planning to set up this plant in Vietnam, but decided to go for Cheyyar after several rounds of discussions with officials of the State government. A government source said, “They found the ecosystem in Tamil Nadu conducive to manufacturing and saw the State as a viable alternative to countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines.” ‘Economic sense’ “It makes economic sense for the company to set up a plant here as Chennai is the Detroit of India and major car-makers have their presence here,” said a source in the automobile industry. Last year, the State government signed several memoranda of understanding for investments worth over $2 billion in the automotive industry alone. Portfolio expansion In 2020, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles said it would expand its portfolio with an investment of Rs. 2,277 crore and generate jobs for 400 people. Netherlands-based Dinex proposed a project to manufacture auto components at Mahindra World City, entailing Rs. 100 crore in investment. Under one of the MoUs inked last year, BYD India Private Limited committed itself to establishing a project for manufacture of electric vehicles in the SIPCOT Industrial Park at Sriperumpudur. In December last, the State government inked a deal with Ola Electric Mobility for setting up an electric two-wheeler manufacturing unit at Hosur at an investment of Rs. 2,354 crore.

Hence, charges are required to be framed against the accused.” Ms. Sayeed was kidnapped in the evening of December 8, 1989 and held hostage till December 13, 1989. She was released in exchange of five known militants of the JKLF — Hamid Sheikh, Altaf Ahmed Bhat, Noor Mohammad Kalwal, Javed Ahmed Zarger and Sher Khan. Confessional statements The CBI has said several accused had made confessional statements and disclosed their role “which is found to be admissible in evidence under Section 15 of the TADA Act”. “The accused persons besides their own participation in the commission of offence have also explained the participation of other accused persons,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rubaiya-sayeed-kidnap-jklf-chief-9-others-to-face-charges/article33554899.ece
12 January 2021||Pune,||Uddhav instructs district administrations to provide proper information on bird flu||Appealing to people to desist from spreading rumours on H5N1 avian influenza which has been detected in some parts of Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday directed the respective district administrations to communicate proper information to the public. Mr. Thackeray reviewed the bird flu situation along with State Animal Husbandry Minister Sunil Kedar, additional chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh, and other senior officials. Mr. Singh said that 843 hens had died at a poultry farm in a village in Parbhani district in the last few days owing to the flu, while 15 crows and other birds in Thane and nine crows in Ratnagiri had been reported as H5N1 victims. As many as 11 crows in Beed have been reported as H5N8 bird flu deaths. He further said that the Animal Husbandry Department had set up a control room on January 7 and was collecting more information on dead birds being reported across the State. The Chief Minister said that the respective district administrations must provide proper and objective information to citizens in order to preclude rumours and misinformation on bird flu. Earlier, Mr. Kedar dismissed rumours of any ban on the sale of poultry products like eggs or chicken as of now. Likewise, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope urged citizens as well as poultry farmers not to panic. Attempting to assuage fears of bird flu, Mr. Tope said that the incidence of bird flu transmitting to humans was very low. “Eating chicken does not spread bird flu. One must only ensure that the chicken is properly cooked to avoid the risk of this disease,” he said. However, expressing concern over the developing situation, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Leader of Opposition (LoP) Devendra Fadnavis said, “This portends to be a serious crisis. More than five States have already been afflicted and now Maharashtra has reported confirmed cases of avian flu. Already, because of the lockdown in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, poultry businesses have been hit hard. Action to minimise damage must be taken promptly while poultry businesses must be given financial aid.” Earlier, Parbhani district Collector Deepak Muglikar said that he had issued orders for around 8,000 birds to be culled in a one km radius from the place where the deaths occurred. Avian deaths have been reported from Parbhani, Akola, Beed, Nashik and Jalgaon districts as well, while 60 hens have died at Pathardi in Ahmednagar district. Similarly, authorities in Thane have confirmed the deaths of 51 birds due to avian flu. “There is a complete ban on the movement of poultry within a 10 km radius of the affected village as well as the selling of poultry in the village. A medical team is already present there,” Mr. Muglikar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/uddhav-instructs-district-administrations-to-provide-proper-information-on-bird-flu/article33555021.ece

Zingade then rode towards Palm Beach Road and started driving at over 150 km per hour. “On the Belapur lane, near the pond, the road has a curve. Due to the speed that he was riding, he could not handle the bike and rammed into the divider,” Mr. Ijjapawar said.

12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre orders 11 mn doses of Covishield||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday announced that the State governments would not have to pay for vaccinating the priority group of three crore healthcare and frontline workers, stating that the Centre would bear the cost. The announcement came as the Central government placed a purchase order with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) for 11 million doses of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, at a cost of Rs. 210 per dose (including GST). Official sources said that the dispatch of vaccines is likely to start late on Monday. HLL Lifecare Limited, a public sector undertaking, issued the supply order on behalf of the Health Ministry. The Health Ministry is also slated to sign a purchase order with Bharat Boitech for its vaccine, Covaxin. “Meetings for this are under way,” a source said. No out-of-turn jabs Addressing Chief Ministers via videoconference ahead of the vaccination roll-out scheduled for January 16, Mr. Modi also “stressed on ensuring that politicians don’t jump the queue, and take the vaccine when their turn comes”. The direction comes amid requests by some States to include MPs, MLAs and panchayat heads in the priority groups. ‘Matter of pride’ Lauding the constant coordination and communication between the Centre and the States, Mr. Modi said, “It’s a matter of pride that both the COVID-19 vaccines for which Emergency Use Authorisation has been given are made in India.” “Both the approved vaccines are highly cost-effective in comparison to other vaccines from across the world,” Mr. Modi said, adding that India would have faced great difficulty if it would have had to depend on foreign vaccines. The Prime Minister noted that India’s vast experience with vaccination would prove handy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-orders-11-mn-doses-of-covishield/article33554302.ece

He was apprehended in the early hours of January 8 after he transgressed across the Line of Actual Control (LAC), south of Pangong Tso (lake) in Eastern Ladakh. State media in Beijing confirmed that China had lost a soldier and “called for an immediate return”. “India should return the soldier immediately, to help de-escalating of the border tension between the two countries, and uphold regional stability,” a statement said. As a procedure in such circumstances, there was interrogation on the circumstances of the crossing and also medical examination before the handover of the soldier. Massive deployment Since the beginning of the stand-off in May, there has been a massive deployment of troops and equipment along the disputed boundary in Eastern Ladakh and along the LAC. In a similar incident last October, a Chinese soldier, identified as Corporal Wang Ya Long, was apprehended in the Demchok area and was later handed over to the PLA at the Chushul–Moldo border point.

12 January 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata calls BJP ‘Bharatiya Junk Party’||At a time when the BJP leadership is maintaining a strategic silence over the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday raked up the issue of the controversial legislation, saying it would never be implemented in the State. Addressing a public gathering at Ranaghat in Nadia district, Ms. Banerjee said that the Matuas (a sect of Hindus that have migrated from Bangladesh) have been living in the country for decades and there was no need for any citizenship law for them. She maintained that they were already citizens and the whole debate of giving them citizenship was futile. “They [Centre] suddenly came with a Bill, which will make foreigners from citizens. I am telling you best if the CAA is not implemented. As the Chief Minister of the State, I want to assure that we will not let CAA happen here, “ she said. She reminded people that she had hit the streets in protest against the CAA in 2019 when the Act was passed by Parliament. The BJP leadership, particularly party president J.P. Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah have said that the rules of the CAA were being framed but they have shied away from giving any timeline of implementation of the Act in the State. While members of the Matua community are keen about the implementation of the CAA, the minority community have overwhelmingly opposed the implementation of the Act. Violence had erupted in Muslim dominated areas of West Bengal after the Bill was passed. A ‘washing machine’ The Trinamool Congress chairperson also targeted the BJP calling it a “washing machine” and “Bharatiya Junk Party”. “When you stay in the TMC, you are black. But when you join the BJP, you become all clean. The BJP is a big washing machine,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mamata-calls-bjp-bharatiya-junk-party/article33554520.ece

The members damaged a name board written in Tamil and blackened the Tamil letters on another board on the Dindigul – Bengaluru NH 209 near Talavadi. They raised slogans that Kannada was not written on the boards and later left. Based on a complaint, Talavadi police registered a case against 15 persons for damaging the boards that belonged to the National Highways Authority of India.  Police personnel were posted at the border to prevent untoward incidents. Confusion prevailed whether the location came under Karnataka or Tamil Nadu and on Monday, revenue officials in the presence of police personnel carried out a survey in the border area. Survey revealed that the boards were located inside the Karnataka border and not in Tamil Nadu. Superintendent of Police P. Thangadurai told The Hindu that since the spot came under the jurisdiction of Karnataka, legal opinion has been sought after which the case would be transferred to the Karnataka police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/members-of-kannada-outfit-booked/article33554434.ece

The affidavit by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare came hours after the court lashed out at the government for its inability to resolve the issue. The court indicated that it would stay the implementation of the laws and have an independent committee negotiate with the farmers.  Decades of deliberations The government, however, said the fact that the protests were confined to only one part of the country showed that the majority of the farming communities were happy with the laws. “The legislation were not hurriedly made but are a result of two decades of deliberations,” the Centre said. The past two decades had seen “intensive engagements with the States” on the new laws, it said.

12 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||HC stays panchayat poll notification||A single-Judge Vacation Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court comprising Justice M. Ganga Rao on Monday granted stay till further orders on the State Election Commission’s decision to hold gram panchayat (GP) elections in four phases next month. Advocate-General S. Sriram asserted that the action of the SEC was premeditated and swayed by material extraneous to record and mala fide. He insisted that the SEC treated the concerns raised by the government as adversarial but not as a participant in the process of fixing the election schedule. The A-G said the duty to be fair, reasonable and non-arbitrary equally applied to the SEC. He observed that the SEC had said at the time of postponing the elections for mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) that it would resume the process from where it is stopped. But, it (SEC) set the ball rolling for the gram panchayat polls without making a mention of the MPTC and ZPTC elections. ‘Situation not conducive’ Mr. Sriram said the SEC did not apply its mind to the enormity of the ground situation arising from vaccination, the involvement of many government departments in it and the deployment of men and resources for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. Appearing for the SEC, senior advocate N. Ashwani Kumar said the government had been seeking postponement of the elections on one pretext or the other, but Justice Rao observed that the impugned order of the SEC ought to be suspended in the interest of public health. In the petition filed by it on Saturday, the government maintained that the vaccination drive would be akin to a general election and its entire machinery would be involved in the process. The court-mandated consultative process was going to be a farce going by the tone and tenor of the letters which State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar wrote to the Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary (Panchayat Raj) regarding the conduct of elections, it was stated. The SEC later filed a writ appeal in the High Court challenging the stay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-high-court-stays-gram-panchayat-elections/article33554223.ece

There are 11 crore beneficiaries registered under the scheme. Punjab tops the list of States, accounting for 23% of those who wrongly received money. Maharashtra and Assam also saw a large number of such payments. As The Hindu had reported, a number of State Agriculture Departments have now been tasked with recovering the money wrongly paid. PM-KISAN is the Centre’s flagship scheme to provide income support worth Rs. 6,000 a year to farming families. When it was launched just before the general election in 2019, it was meant to cover only small and marginal farmers who owned less than two hectares. Later that year, large farmers were included in the scheme as the government removed the land size criterion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-1364-crore-given-to-wrong-beneficiaries-of-pm-kisan/article33554300.ece

12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Did our best to remove apprehensions: govt.||The Centre, in an urgent affidavit filed in the Supreme Court on Monday, said it had done its best to engage with farmers to remove “misapprehensions” about the new agricultural laws. “The Central government has done its best to engage with the farmers to remove any misapprehensions or misgivings in their minds and no efforts have been found lacking,” the affidavit filed by the Union Ministry of Agriculture said. It added that multiple attempts to talk to the farmers about the laws had been stonewalled by the latter, whose stand has been “either you repeal the laws or no discussion would be made”. The Centre said, prior to the new regime, farmers under the State agricultural market produce committees (APMC) were forced to sell their products at “market yards” to only a limited number of traders licensed under the APMC law. The pandemic situation, with lowering demands, had necessitated the need for expanding market for farmers beyond the State boundaries through a facilitative legal framework and promotion of inter-State trade. The new regime gives farmers the option to sell their produce outside the market yards, the Centre said. The Centre had also implemented the recommendations of the Swaminathan Report “by increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) one and half times of the weighted average cost of production with bumper procurement at MSP.” “The farmers of the nation are happy as they are given an option over and above the existing one,” it said. The government linked the passage of the laws to the pandemic, saying it would help de-congest mandis and help farmers sell produce at the farm gate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/did-our-best-to-remove-apprehensions-govt/article33554254.ece
12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||96 infected so far with mutant U.K. strain, says Health Ministry||The total number of persons found infected with the mutant U.K. strain of COVID-19 is 96, according to an update issued by the Health Ministry on Monday. India had also reported fewer than 170 daily COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, after 229 days, the Ministry said. The decline in new cases and the high rate of recovery had in tandem resulted in a continuous fall in the country’s active case load on a sustained basis, it noted. The country reported 161 case fatalities in the past 24 hours, with six States and Union Territories accounting for 69.57% of them. Maharashtra saw the most casualties of 34, followed by Kerala with 23 and West Bengal with 19. Data released by the Ministry said the total active case load had fallen to 2.25 lakh (2,22,526) currently, and that the present active case load consisted of 2.13% of the total positive cases. Also, 16,959 people had recovered and were discharged in the last 24 hours. This had led to a net decline of 809 from the total active case load. The total recovered cases stood at 10,092,909. The gap between the recovered cases and the active cases, which was steadily increasing, was nearing 99 lakh, and at present stood at 98,70,383, the Ministry stated. Recovery rate improves The recovery rate had improved to 96.43%, which was among the highest in the world and 78.56% of the new recovered cases were observed to be concentrated in 10 States and UTs. Kerala reported the highest number with 4,659. In Maharashtra, 2,302 people recovered, followed by 962 in Chhattisgarh. Of the new cases, 80.25% were concentrated in nine States and UTs. Kerala had also reported the highest daily new cases at 4,545. It was followed by Maharashtra with 3,558 new cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/96-infected-so-far-with-mutant-uk-strain-says-health-ministry/article33554265.ece
12 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Officials told to focus on achieving Palle Pragati programme targets||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the ministers and officials concerned to vigorously work for achieving the targets envisaged under the Palle Pragati programme launched for all round development of the villages across the State. A majority of the State population was residing in villages and the elected representatives and officials should recognize villages as their core focus areas. Plans for the all-round development of the villages should be developed and implemented accordingly. The Chief Minister during an elaborate review of the progress of Palle Pragati works with ministers and senior officials on Monday directed the additional collectors and senior panchayat raj officials to constantly visit the villages and monitor the progress of works. Regular inspections of progress of programmes like development of nurseries in the villages should be taken up and steps should be initiated to replace the saplings which did not survive. Own tractors Mr. Rao appreciated the progress achieved in the village since the launch of the Palle Pragati through which Telangana villages were emerging as role models for the country in terms of development. Telangana was the only State where all the villages had tractors, dump yards, nurseries and other facilities in addition to supply of safe drinking water to each household. While only 84 gram panchayats had tractors during the formation of Telangana, as many as 12,765 villages were having own tractors equipped with tankers and trolleys. Nurseries were set up in 12,755 villages and steps had been taken to ensure protection and survival of the saplings planted. In addition to nurseries, the government had embarked upon an ambitious programme for setting up Palle Prakruti Vanams in 19,740 habitations and lands for the purpose were identified in 19,027 habitations. Planting of saplings was completed in as many as 15,646 habitations and works were progressing in a speedy manner in remaining habitations. Construction of 2,601 Rythu Vedikas — platforms for farmers for exchanging ideas — were taken up and work on 2,580 vedikas were completed. The government was ensuring release of Rs. 308 crore to gram panchayats to see that there were no interruptions in the developmental works launched. “The enhanced cleanliness in the villages has ensured that no cases of dengue were reported during the current year,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/officials-told-to-focus-on-achieving-palle-pragati-targets/article33554956.ece
12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘No record of consultations on farm laws’||The Union Agriculture Ministry could not provide any record of pre-legislative consultations on the three farm reform laws, according to a response given by it to a query under the Right to Information Act. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has repeatedly said that wide-ranging consultations were held on the three laws. The Centre has now filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying that it is an “erroneous notion” that no consultations were held. In December 2020, RTI activist Anjali Bhardwaj asked the Agriculture Ministry for all details regarding stakeholder consultations held before the Centre promulgated three ordinances on agricultural reforms in June. She asked for dates and attendees of meetings, copies of minutes, and lists of the States, experts and farmers groups who had been consulted. Copy sought The RTI request also asked for a copy of the comments and communications that had been sent by the States with which the consultations had been held. In a separate RTI filing, she also asked for details to show that the Centre had placed the draft legislation in the public domain for 30 days, in accordance with norms set by its own Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy as well as by the Central Information Commission. The requests were both passed between multiple departments in the Ministry. Two Central Public Information Officers forwarded and transferred the requests. Two others disposed of the request, with one from the Ministry’s marketing cell saying that “this CPIO does not hold any record in this matter”. The fourth, from the section dealing with the administrative work of the Agricultural Marketing Division, said that “the information is treated as nil” as far as her section was concerned. The requests were then disposed of and these replies were sent to the activist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-record-of-consultations-on-farm-laws/article33554245.ece
12 January 2021||NEW DELHI/ CHANDIGARH,||Farmers reject court’s proposal||Farmers groups have rejected the Supreme Court’s suggestion to appoint a committee to resolve the ongoing crisis over three farm reform laws. They say the Centre’s attitude in court on Monday makes it clear that the government will not agree to discuss farmers’ demand for repeal of the three laws in such a committee. “While all organisations welcome the suggestions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court to stay the implementation of the farm laws, they are collectively and individually not willing to participate in any proceedings before a committee that may be appointed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” said the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), in a statement issued late on Monday night. The statement added that the decision comes after “Looking to the attitude and approach of the Government which made it clear before the court today repeatedly that they will not agree to the discussion for repeal before the committee.” Discussions with the lawyers were held at the Singhu border, led by union leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Darshan Pal, Prem Singh Bhangu, Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala and Jagmohan Singh. The statement expressed “respect” and “gratitude” for the Court’s “understanding of the problem and comforting words” but regretted that the unions were unable to accede to its suggestions, as millions of farmers across the country were demanding a full repeal of the laws. They also expressed disappointment that the Court would pronounce its order on Tuesday without further consultations. “The Hon’ble Supreme Court was requested to fix the hearing again tomorrow to enable them to consult the organisations to the suggestion of the Hon’ble court,” said the statement. “We have been told that no such hearing has been fixed for tomorrow and that only the matters are listed for pronouncements for order by the Hon'ble Court. These events have deeply disappointed us and also farmers at large.” “A committee is just a delaying tactic which is what the government wants,” said Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal. “Why divert and dilute the growing farmers movement with a committee? The protest is against the government, so the government should face the wrath of the people, and repeal the laws,” he said. Unions were also apprehensive about being pushed into binding mediation without clarity on the committee's remit. “Sometimes, they say it is a technical committee, sometimes they say it will have experts, sometimes they say it will be a committee of judges,” said a leader, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-reject-courts-proposal/article33554257.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Regulators not taking any shortcuts in ensuring safety of vaccines’||N.K. Arora  , executive director of the New Delhi-based INCLEN Trust and head of the operations research group of the ICMR’s National Task Force for COVID-19, says all safety-related information will be shared with the public as it emerges with the use of the COVID-19 vaccine.  This is for the first time the government is going to vaccinate adults. Does it require any special preparation? Yes, it does. India has an existing vaccine safety surveillance mechanism called the AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunisation) surveillance. It’s comprised of a national secretariat under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), including doctors, data specialists and public health specialists. The vaccine safety surveillance network extends up to every district where a panel of doctors and health workers monitor events of concern after getting any vaccine, investigate and report to state and national level. COVID-19 has necessitated immunisation of the adult population. The government has now involved cardiologists, neurologists, general physicians and pulmonologists in AEFI committees at national, state, and district level. Right now, we are anticipating — theoretically — events of concern that might possibly happen after immunisation drive. The AEFI members will be trained to look for any adverse event before we start the immunisation process. Adverse event surveillance is being established to actively seek these events across designated health facilities across the country. Additionally, there are around 300 medical colleges and tertiary care hospitals across the country that have adverse drug reaction monitoring centres which also report adverse events after vaccines along with drugs. What kind of awareness programmes do we need before rolling out the immunisation for COVID-19? We need to educate people and make them aware of less-known facts about vaccines. For example, some people might face mild symptoms such as pain or swelling, mild fever, among others. It is a normal immune response. Then, it is important for people to know that vulnerable population — the elderly, people with associated illness, such as diabetes, chronic lung disease, high blood pressure, kidney ailments, cancers and others may, otherwise also, suffer from any sudden health issues such as heart attack. We cannot and should not link it to the vaccine in all cases. I believe that we need to practise ‘exceptional transparency’ in this case. I assure that all safety related information will be shared with the general population as it emerges with the use of COVID-19 vaccine(s) either in our country or in any other part of the globe with the same vaccine. Indian regulators gave authorisation to Covaxin even before its Phase 3 trial results were out. How do we explain this? We are passing through troubled times. COVID-19 has caused social disruption, economic downturn and significant number of deaths. To control this pandemic, the society as well as the system may have to take steps which may also be termed as drastic. Both pre-clinical and clinical data (complete data for Phase I and II, and partial data for Phase III) of Covaxin have been thoroughly scrutinised by the regulators. This data shows that the vaccine is safe and induces a robust antibody response. However, to what extent the vaccine will protect the recipients from getting the disease is not known yet. Therefore, the regulators have allowed its use in trial mode. What does trial mode mean for a vaccine recipient? The way we do in a clinical trial phase: first, the recipient will be asked to give a written consent. Then he/she will undergo some blood tests before and after taking the vaccine. Additionally, the recipient will be followed up actively to see if the vaccine has led to any side effects. In short, it will be an extension of the Phase 3 trial. But in this, the person would know that he or she has received the vaccine, and not the placebo. It will be completely a person’s choice if he or she would like to give the vaccine a try or not. Developing a vaccine takes years. But this time our scientists have developed a vaccine against the novel coronavirus in such a short time. How was this possible? Developing a vaccine generally involves years of research. First, we need a vaccine candidate that is evaluated in animals for its safety and efficacy. After a vaccine candidate passes a pre-clinical trial, it enters the clinical trial phase. While scientists have worked round the clock in the laboratory, even regulatory approvals which used to take several months have been pretty quick. It helped eliminate all the time lapses between the pre-clinical and clinical trial stages. Earlier, the vaccine development involved a series of steps, but in the case of the coronavirus vaccine, the scientists and regulators worked in tandem, accelerating the whole process without compromises on any protocols and any step. What is your opinion on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine? To ensure that a vaccine is safe, we need to try it on a large number of people. The vaccine developers have not reduced the sample size at any stage of clinical trials rather it was bigger than what we usually test a vaccine on. When a vaccine is tested, most of the adverse events or unwanted effects, if any, occur in the first four to six weeks of its administration. So, in order to ensure that it is safe, we keep a close watch, for the first two-three months, on the people it has been given to. This data help us decide if a vaccine is safe. All concerned in the line of vaccine development, testing and evaluation have followed these procedures to the T. Both Indian vaccines are considered safe on this yardstick. As for the efficacy of the vaccine, we need time to tell how effective a vaccine is. All the global agencies have set the benchmark that only those vaccine candidates which show an efficacy of at least 50-60% will be considered. Interestingly, most of the vaccines have shown an efficacy of 70–90% within the short period of two or three months of observation, way more than what we were expecting. Besides, when a vaccine is given an emergency use authorisation, as in the case of the COVID-19 vaccine, the trial follow-ups continue for one-two years to assess the total duration of protection the vaccine will provide. What is emergency use authorisation. Does it involve any short-cuts on the part of our regulators? Not at all. In fact, our regulators are taking extra precautions. Some vaccine candidates were not considered for review by our regulators as the data was inadequate; some companies were asked to increase their sample size so that our regulators can have adequate evidence to support the safety and efficacy of the vaccine before they approve it. Similarly, Indian regulators wanted the U.K.’s regulator to approve Oxford’s vaccine first before even considering it for the Indian population. An important pre-requisite of the COVID-19 vaccine authorisation for our country is — the vaccine should have been evaluated on subjects in India. The regulators are not taking any shortcuts when it comes to ensuring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.  The government has now involved cardiologists, neurologists, general physicians and pulmonologists in AEFI committees at national, state, and district levels||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/regulators-not-taking-any-shortcuts-in-ensuring-safety-of-vaccines/article33554263.ece
12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Panel clears Parliament project||The Union government’s proposal to construct a new Parliament building was on Monday approved by the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC), whose clearance was mandated by the Supreme Court in its January 5 judgment allowing the project. The court ordered that the permission of the HCC, which is headed by an Additional Secretary of the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry and includes government officials primarily, should be obtained before any work starts on the ground. At a press conference, Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said the committee had discussed the proposal and cleared it on Monday. The panel looked at the preservation of heritage as per the Unified Building Bylaws, 2016. Permission was not sought earlier as the Ministry, whose Central Public Works Department is carrying out the project, felt there was no heritage involved. The new building was proposed to be built adjacent to the existing Parliament, which was built in the 1920s. Since the court ordered it to get the approval of the HCC, the Ministry had complied, Mr. Mishra said. Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri said the timeline for the completion was 2022, the 75th year of Independence. Another part of the larger Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project, the revamp of Rajpath or Central Vista Avenue, would be started by February 1, with the contract likely to be awarded soon, Mr. Mishra said. The Republic Day Parade next year would be held on the revamped Rajpath. The Minister said: “I don’t know what the overall cost will be. The cost will be absorbed by each Ministries.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-clears-parliament-project/article33554267.ece

The proposed march is slated to disturb and disrupt the august celebrations of the nation on Republic Day and would be bound to create a massive law and order situation,” the Delhi police affidavit said. Seven routes blocked The police said such a protest would cause an “embarrassment to the nation.” “The right to protest can never include maligning the nation globally.” The affidavit said seven major routes leading to Delhi were fully blocked and four partially.

12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. defends rules for animal seizure||The Central government on Monday defended the law to deprive owners possession of their animals, including cattle, on the suspicion that they are being subject to cruelty or illegally transported for slaughter. The Centre dismissed the argument that taking the animals from their owners divested them of their livelihood even before they were found guilty of cruelty by a court of law. “The argument that owners are deprived of their right to livelihood is not sustainable. They have no right to do their business illegally. They have to transport the animals as per the requirements of the Transport of Animals Rules of 1978,”it said in an affidavit. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde was hearing a petition filed by the Buffalo Traders Welfare Association challenging the validity of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Care and maintenance of case property animals) Rules 2017. Court’s earlier directive In the previous hearing, the court had asked the government to delete the Rules, saying the law stripped people of their means of livelihood. But the government said the Rules were in consonance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960. “The Rules prevent owners and transporters from causing animals unnecessary pain and suffering... Animals are sentient beings. They are capable of experiencing pain, sorrow, suffering and discomfort... Article 51A (g) of the Constitution enjoins upon every citizen to have compassion for living animals,” the affidavit said. The police seized the cattle and vehicles of only those who intentionally violated the Animal Transport Rules, it stated. The case was scheduled for hearing next week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-defends-rules-for-animal-seizure/article33554269.ece
12 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala pushes colleges to go for digitisation||The government plans to introduce high-tech facilities in State-run colleges under a digitisation initiative that will enable universities to share resources. While no decision has been taken to embark on a mission-mode programme similar to the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission that has provided public schools a facelift, a considerable portion of the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme funds and Plan funds may be earmarked for the purpose. Sources say efforts are on to digitise government and aided arts and science, engineering and polytechnic colleges, particularly those receiving RUSA assistance. “Only around half of the classrooms in colleges were equipped with whiteboards, functional LCD projects and laptops. Besides, there will be a greater need to utilise multimedia tools with a blended mode of learning likely to come into vogue in the State. While the possibility of utilising existing funds for the purpose will be explored, we also remain hopeful of substantial allocations in the State Budget. The Finance Minister has given indications that there will be emphasis on the higher education sector and has stressed the need for a knowledge-based economy to drive the State forward,” says a senior official. KSHEC initiatives Key to the State’s efforts in digitising the sector will be initiatives of the Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) in creating a network of State universities to share online resources. The Kerala Academic Libraries Network (KALNET), which will integrate university libraries and link affiliated colleges, is set to go operational later this month. Council member secretary Rajan Varughese says the shared repository will have nearly 18 lakh publications, including books, theses, and periodicals. Nine lakh among these will be linked from the Kerala University Library, the oldest and largest university library in the State. In addition to providing access to faculty, research scholars, and other students, the facility will also be made available for the public. Access to journals The KSHEC has also been working towards creating a consortium of all universities to provide unbridled access to journals from major databases such as Scopus that usually requires institutions to shell out large sums amounting to crores of rupees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-pushes-colleges-to-go-for-digitisation/article33554567.ece

COVID-19 loss Khaleel, who lends money on monthly interest, gave Rs. 15 lakh to the prime accused Rasheed, who failed to repay the amount as he incurred losses due to COVID-19 lockdown. The accused also borrowed money on interest from several private financiers. Due to severe debts, Rasheed approached the victim for a loan of Rs. 50 lakh to clear his debts with other persons for which the latter insisted him to hand over his hotel till repayment of the amount, Mr. Reddy said. When Rasheed did not agree to Khaleel’s terms, the latter started pressurising for repayment of the previous loan of Rs. 15 lakh. Conspiracy “As he was not in a position to clear the debt, the accused hatched a conspiracy to eliminate Khaleel with the help of his workers,” he said. To commission the offence, the accused procured two knives from Charminar and spade handles from a shop near M.M. Pahadi and were waiting for the ‘right opportunity’. On Sunday afternoon, Khaleel went to the hotel for his monthly payment and considering it as a right opportunity, the accused asked the former to meet him near HF Convention in the area to collect money. Around 11.15 p.m. the victim reached the convention on his scooter and met Khaleel. “While they both were discussing, Azmath and Imran attacked him from behind, and soon he tried to escape. In the meantime, Rasheed took a cement block and bludgeoned Khaleel. He was also attacked with knives, as a result of which he died on the spot,” the DCP said. Soon, the accused persons sped on the victim’s scooter to Jalpally where they changed their clothes and disposed of the blood stained clothes. However, a few hours later, the trio were arrested by the Rajendra Nagar police and were remanded to judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aimim-leader-chased-hacked-to-death-on-busy-road/article33554940.ece
12 January 2021||KOCHI,||Solo sailor quits Navy to get closer to sea||On Sunday, Commander Abhilash Tomy shared on social media The Moment , a poem by Margaret Atwood, on the moment of realisation after many voyages and years of toil that it was things/ beings around you that made you what you are, as he hung up the uniform after 24 years of service in the Navy. He thanked the naval fraternity, those who sailed along, for doing that. But a sailor hardly leaves the sea. Mr. Tomy, the first Indian to circumnavigate the globe solo and unassisted in a sail yacht, intends to give another shot at the Golden Globe Race next year. The GGR, as it is called, is a daredevil ocean race with basic, read vintage, sailing equipment which he attempted in 2018. But a vicious storm in the southern Indian Ocean dismasted him and he sustained a spinal injury. He was subsequently rescued in a multi-nation effort and had to undergo a surgery. He is fighting fit and raring to go. Not because he is steered by a quest for conquests, but by the enormity of the realisation of human smallness in the vast world. “It is a spiritual experience. The washing away of all learned behaviour. And, a big part of it is the smallness of yourself that you do not otherwise see,” he says. ‘Need a sponsor’ After recovering from his injuries, Mr. Tomy, a naval pilot, was medically cleared for flying and sailing. He flew his last sortie on Dornier around Goa sometime in September and was sailing and kayaking. “For me to do the race, all I need is money and I am looking for sponsors,” he told The Hindu . But unlike last time when he got a retro boat built for the race, he would prefer buying a second-hand one doing away with processes like registration. Once he has identified the boat, he will take it out to the sea to get a hang of it before the race. For now, he is spending time with family and reading two books, one on the biology of human behaviour and the other, titled Peak, on gaining expertise in almost anything. He also has an invite from Monaco to be part of the crew for a circumnavigation meant to scientifically study the southern Ocean.  It is a spiritual experience. A big part of it is the smallness of yourself that you do not otherwise see.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/solo-sailor-quits-navy-to-get-closer-to-sea/article33554231.ece
12 January 2021||LUCKNOW,||AAP MLA booked for ‘threatening’ to kill U.P. CM||A case was lodged in Uttar Pradesh’s Rae Bareli against AAP MLA from Delhi Somnath Bharti on the charge of threatening to kill U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, said Rae Bareli Additional SP Vishwajeet Srivastava on Monday. He said a police team had reached the Irrigation Department guest house, where Mr. Bharti was staying, to arrest him regarding an earlier FIR lodged against him in Amethi on the charge of use of indecent language. “Somnath Bharti used abusive language against the police team. He threatened he would strip the City Kotwal Rae Bareli of his uniform, and used foul language against the U.P. CM and threatened to kill him,” Mr. Srivastava said. In a video of Mr. Bharti’s argument with the police, a man can be seen throwing black ink at him and shouting “ Yogi Adityanath zindabad [Long live Yogi Adityanath]”, before being detained by the police. With his face blackened by ink, Mr. Bharti was seen chasing the intruder as the police hurriedly escorted him away. “ Yogi toh jayega [Yogi will go],” Mr. Bharti was heard saying when the intruder threw ink on his face and said “ Kahin nahi jayega [He will not go anywhere]”. Mr. Bharti allegedly also got into a heated argument with an officer. “ Yogi ko bol do, yeh sab karne se kuch nahi hoga. Yogi ki maut sunishchit hai [Inform Yogi nothing will happen by doing all this. Yogi’s death is confirmed],” he reportedly told the officer. ‘Charges wrong’ Mr. Bharti told The Hindu that he did not make any statements threatening to kill the CM hief Minister or to instigate the people. “The charges against me are absolutely wrong. What I meant was the political death of Yogi Adityanath and nothing else.Death and political death are two different things. He is not my enemy, just a political opponent.” The AAP MLA said he only talked about the “pathetic” condition of the schools and hospitals in Uttar Pradesh. “I was at the guest house of the Irrigation Department and the police were not allowing me to go out for a party function saying that senior officers are coming. Around 11.30 (a.m.) a BJP worker, despite the heavy police presence, came and threw ink at me while I was talking to the police,” he said. “Shocked to learn that my bail application has been kept pending till 13th January n I am sent to judicial custody of 14 days,” Mr. Bharti later said in a tweet. Reacting to the incident, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal hit out at the U.P. CM. “Yogiji, are your schools that bad? If someone goes to see your school, then why do you get so scared? Fix the schools. If you do not know how to do it, then ask Manish Sisodia,” he tweeted in Hindi. AAP MP Sanjay Singh also condemned the incident. He alleged that Mr. Bharti was “attacked” by “BJP workers” in Rae Bareli and later arrested by the police.

12 January 2021||Bengaluru/Mysuru,||Speculation rife on Cabinet expansion||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is likely to induct seven new faces into the Cabinet while dropping two Ministers, sources close to him said. Earlier in the day, the Chief Minister said that expansion will happen either on January 13 or 14, depending on the programme of BJP national president J.P. Nadda. While three defectors — N. Nagaraju (MTB), R. Shankar and Munirathna — are almost confirmed to join the Cabinet, the party is abuzz with speculation on the names of other party MLAs set to make the cut and the Ministers likely to be dropped. Senior MLAs Umesh Katti and Arvind Limbavali and MLC C.P. Yogeshwar were expected to be sworn in with 10 defectors as Ministers in February 2020, but were dropped in the eleventh hour, making them leading contenders this time too. While Mr. Katti is likely to make it, Mr. Limbavali is still lobbying hard and the large number of Ministers from Bengaluru already being in the Cabinet is an impediment, sources said. Mr. Yogeshwar has made a strong pitch arguing the party has only him to counter D.K. Shivakumar from Congress and H.D. Kumaraswamy from JD(S) in Ramanagaram district and reminding the party of his role in toppling the coalition government. But there has been intense opposition to Mr. Yogeshwar who lost the Assembly polls in 2018. “Given the defectors are taking away almost half of the ministerial berths, opportunities for party MLAs are already skewed and making MLCs Ministers is uncalled for,” said a senior MLA, who is a ministerial aspirant. The names of MLAs, including S. Angara from Dakshina Kannada, Halappa Achar from Koppal, Murugesh Nirani from Bagalkot, Arvind Bellad from Dharwad, Raju Gowda from Yadgir, and K. Poornima are also doing the rounds. Meanwhile, senior MLAs G.H. Thippareddy, S.A. Ramdas and M.P. Renukacharya openly expressed their desire to become Ministers on Monday. MLC A.H. Vishwanath, a defector who has been disqualified from being appointed as a Minister by the Karnataka High Court, also made an indirect bid to be inducted. “Mr. Yediyurappa should not forget who were in the forefront of the efforts to help him become the Chief Minister. He should now reciprocate,” he said in Mysuru. To be dropped? Sources close to the Chief Minister said he is likely to drop two Ministers from the Cabinet. Presently, there are seven vacancies and the party wants to keep at least two vacancies in case of a political emergency, sources said. The names of Independent MLA and Excise Minister H. Nagesh, Women and Child Welfare Minister Shashikala Jolle, Mines and Geology Minister C.C. Patil, and Fisheries and Muzrai Minister Kota Srinivasa Poojary were doing the rounds on this list. “The party needs a senior MLC to become the Chairman of the Council and Mr. Poojary fits the bill,” a senior party leader said. Meanwhile, Mr. Nagesh expressed confidence that the Chief Minister wouldn’t drop him from the Cabinet. “I resigned as a Minister in the coalition government and supported BJP. The Chief Minister assured me that I would be a Minister for the full term,” he said on Monday. While there has been intense lobbying both to be inducted and not to be dropped, the Chief Minister is learnt to be keeping his cards close to his chest. “He has only been saying that the list will be finalised and sent by the party high command which he would abide by,” a senior party MLA said. Speaking in Mysuru, Mr. Yediyurappa said besides Mr. Nadda, BJP national general secretary in-charge of party affairs in the State Arun Singh would also be present at the swearing in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cabinet-expansion-seven-in-two-out/article33554623.ece

12 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Ex-Minister’s bail plea dismissed, 3 more held||Taking into account that former Andhra Pradesh Minister Bhuma Akhila Priya Reddy can “harm” the kidnapped victims both personally and financially, a local court in Secunderabad on Monday dismissed her bail petition. The court granted three days of custody of Akhila Priya to the Bowenpally police for further interrogation in the case. Later in the day, the city police announced the arrest of Boya Sampath Kumar, 22, from Allagadda, and Nagaradoddi Mallikarjuna Reddy, 32 - both personal assistants of Akhila Priya and husband Madhoor Bhargav Ram Naidu, respectively. One Dorrlu Bala Chennaiah, 30, a driver from Kadapa, was also arrested for his role in the kidnapping of former national hockey player K. Praveen Rao and his two brothers -- Sunil Rao and Naveen Rao. They were apprehended by the Task Force team of North Zone led by inspector K. Nageswar Rao. As many as 19 people, including the fugitive Bhargav Ram and Srinivas Rao Chaudhary alias Guntur Srinu, were accused in the crime. Referring to the offence as an organised crime which was “meticulously planned” and executed by the former Minister, Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said that they have gathered clinching evidence to prove her role. “Right from recce of the area to procuring fake number plates, purchasing SIM cards and executing the crime, everything was well planned by Akhila Priya, Bhargav Ram and Guntur Srinu,” he said. The police seized five fake number plates, three mobile phones, and a two- wheeler from their possession. Divulging more about the case, Mr. Kumar said that three days prior to the kidnapping on January 5, Mallikurjana Reddy purchased six SIM cards in a mobile store at Miyapur to coordinate during the commission of the offence and further. Prime accused Akhila Priya, Bhargav Ram, Guntur Srinu, and others used those SIM cards, he said. He said that the confession statement of Sampath Kumar, who “actively” participated in the crime and the mobile phone tower location too from Vijayawada to Hyderabad was there to link the former Minister. As per the instructions of Akhila Priya, both Sampath and Bala Chennaiah conducted a recce of Rao’ residence at Bowenpally and shared the information to the former’s husband and Srinu. “During the investigation, it is established that Akhila Priya planned and executed the crime along with Bhargav Ram, Srinu and other accomplice in order to grab the land or extort money from the victims,” the Commissioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ex-ministers-bail-plea-dismissed-3-more-held/article33554227.ece
12 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Telangana to start Class 9, 10 and colleges in Feb.||The Telangana government has ordered reopening of educational institutions from class nine upwards from February 1. The resumption of class room lectures will apply to classes nine and ten in schools, junior, degree and professional colleges, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao told the Collectors conference on Monday. He asked Collectors to ensure that the institutions were ready for academic activity by January 25. All the institutions, hostels, residential schools and toilets on their premises must be cleaned up by the deadline as they had remained unused for a long time due to pandemic. The stock of rice, pulses and other cooking material which was left untouched in hostels due to their closure must be checked up for rottenness. Ministers must personally check the facilities at SC, ST and BC hostels , a release said. The conference discussed extensively the haphazard maintenance of revenue records before formation of Telangana. In this context, Mr. Rao reminded officials that it led to clashes and disputes over land ownership. The State government made several attempts to establish the ownesrhip of every gunta of land. The revamp of land records taken up by the State government, issue of new pattadar passbooks and enactment of new revenue law led to emergence of a clear picture about the ownership of lands. Dharani portal Mr. Rao expressed satisfaction that the Dharani portal of land transactions which was developed for transparency, corruption free land administration and check delays was a complete success. Yet, required changes for greater flexibility in transactions of agricultural lands must be made in the portal within a week. He asked Collectors to personally look into all revenue related issues for instant redressal of grievances. The mutation for registrations already done should be completed forthwith. They must accept fresh applications for pending mutations and complete the process within a week. To make Dharani more user friendly, Mr. Rao sought a provision in the portal for registration of lands in favour of NRIs on the basis of their passport numbers. The issue of passbooks to companies and societies for lands purchased by them should also be facilitated in Dharani. He asked officials to give one more chance to people who did not furnish Aaadhar number for enrolment of their properties in Dharani. They must be issued passbooks after entering Aadhaar details. People who wanted to cancel their slot booking or reschedule registration of properties must be given an opportunity. The portal should also be enabled to extend General Power of Attorney, Special Power of Attorney and Agreements-cum General Power of Attorney facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/reopening-of-schools-for-classes-9-and-above-from-feb-1/article33554228.ece

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||No need to shut poultry markets, says govt.||The Centre on Monday asked State governments not to shut down poultry markets or restrict sale of eggs or broiler chicken meat in the wake of the avian influenza outbreak that has affected 10 States. There is no need to panic as there have never been any cases of bird flu being transmitted to humans in India, and there is no danger of such transmission if the meat is properly cooked, Animal Husbandry Minister Giriraj Singh told mediapersons. The World Health Organization has said the virus will be destroyed if poultry products are cooked at 70 degrees Celsius or above. Asserting that unfounded rumours about the safety of poultry products could have a devastating impact on the industry, and hurt thousands of small farmers, Mr. Singh appealed to States not to take drastic action without scientific evidence. The Minister specifically appealed to the Delhi government to reconsider its decision to shut Ghazipur mandi, Asia’s largest wholesale market for chicken, and said he had written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the issue. There is also no evidence that restricting inter and intra-State movement of poultry products is necessary, he added. So far, five States, including Delhi, have issued such restrictive orders. Since January 3, when the current avian flu outbreak began, ex-farm gate prices of broiler chicken have fallen from a national average of Rs. 85-90 per kg to Rs. 55 per kg, according to Gulrez Alam, a director of the Indian Broiler Group. Sales have dropped 50%, he added. Mr. Singh noted that maize, which was selling at Rs. 1,800/quintal has now dropped to Rs. 1,100/quintal. Maize is used as feedstock for the poultry industry. In March, the sector already took a major hit from false rumours that COVID-19 could be spread by meat consumption, added the Minister. On Monday, Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand joined the list of affected States, taking the total number to 10.Mr. Singh emphasised that positive samples have been officially confirmed in commercial poultry only in Kerala and Maharashtra, while the other States have only reported confirmed cases among migratory birds, wild fowl and crows. In Delhi, he said the closure of several parks where migratory birds had been found dead was a necessary move, although there was no need to close poultry markets. In his meeting with Chief Ministers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also encouraged unaffected States to keep a constant vigil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-need-to-shut-poultry-markets-says-govt/article33554236.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Supreme Court ‘intends’ to stay farm laws||What talking? What is going on?” Chief Justice Bobde told Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal and Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta. The court will pass orders on Tuesday. At one point when Mr. Venugopal questioned the court’s “hurry” to pass the order of stay, Chief Justice Bobde said, “Mr. Attorney, we are giving a very long rope to you. Don’t give us a lecture on patience...” During the hearing, Chief Justice Bobde appealed to senior citizens, women and children at the protests to return home. “Tell them the Chief Justice of India wants them to go home... Whether you have faith in us or not, we are the Supreme Court of India and we will do our job,” he said. The court questioned the government’s “insistence” on the implementation of the laws. “We don’t know whether you [government] are part of the solution or the problem. There is not a single petition filed here which says the laws are beneficial... If the laws are put on hold, negotiations before the committee will be much better,” CJI Bobde said. The court, however, made it clear that it would not at this stage go into the question of constitutionality of the laws. Mr. Venugopal said the court would be taking a “drastic decision” if it stayed the laws. None of the farm leaders, during the discussions, had shown a single provision in the laws which was unconstitutional. “Mr. Attorney, sorry to say, we may be taking a decision because you, the Union of India, did not take responsibility. You were not able to solve the problem... You should have been able to solve the strike, but you did not,” CJI Bobde replied. Mr. Venugopal said the farmers were going to bring 2,000 tractors to “join” the Republic Day parade. Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, however, refuted the claim. “Mr. Venugopal, these farmers too have members in the Army. They will do no such thing... Really don’t understand the attitude of the government,” he said. To the farmers, the CJI clarified: “Even after we stay the implementation of the laws, you [farmers] carry on the protest. We don’t want any criticism that the court is stifling the protest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-intends-to-stay-farm-laws/article33554237.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Rs. 1,364 cr. given to wrong PM-Kisan beneficiaries||Later that year, large farmers were included in the scheme as the government removed the land size criterion. However, certain exclusions remained. If any member of a farming family paid income tax, received a monthly pension above Rs. 10,000, held a constitutional position, or was a serving or retired government employee, they were not eligible for the scheme. Professionals and institutional landholders were also excluded. Until July 2020, 20.5 lakh people who should have been excluded had wrongly received PM-Kisan payouts. According to the Agriculture Ministry data, 56% of these undeserving persons belonged to the “income tax payee” category, while the remainder belong to the “ineligible farmers” category. However, 72% of the payout amount was paid to the income tax payees, indicating that this category continued to receive money for multiple instalments before their ineligible status was discovered and they were weeded out of the scheme’s beneficiary database. Punjab (23%), Maharashtra (17%) and Assam (14%) account for more than half of the beneficiaries of wrong payments, followed by Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, with 8% each. Almost all the wrong payments in Punjab and Assam went to those in the “ineligible farmers” category, while Maharashtra had the highest number of payouts to “income tax payee” farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-1364-cr-given-to-wrong-pm-kisan-beneficiaries/article33554238.ece

With the help of Aadhaar, beneficiaries will be identified as well as timely second dosage will be ensured. After a person receives the first dose of vaccination, CoWin will immediately generate a digital vaccination certificate. This certificate will also act as a reminder for the second dose, after which, a final certificate will be given,” he said. Stating that India aims to achieve vaccination for 30 crore people in the next few months, he said all States and UTs will have to put in place mechanisms to keep rumours related to vaccination in check. “For this, help from religious and social organisations, NYK, NSS, SHGs etc should be taken,” he said. The country on Monday after 229 days reported less than 170 daily COVID deaths with total fatalities in the past 24 hours standing at 161, while the total number of new COVID cases was reported at 16,311.

12 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Dr. Reddy’s seeks nod for Sputnik-V Phase 3 trials||Pharma major Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories on Monday said safety data pertaining to Phase 2 clinical trial of the Russian Sputnik-V COVID-19 vaccine candidate had been submitted to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for review seeking approval to continue Phase 3 clinical trials. The company said this referring to a review undertaken by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). “The Phase 2 study was conducted on 100 subjects as part of the randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in India. The DSMB concluded that no safety concerns were identified and the study has met the primary endpoints of safety. Further, the safety data has been submitted to the DCGI for review and approval to continue Phase 3 clinical trials. Co-chairman and managing director G.V. Prasad said the Indian clinical trial being conducted by Dr. Reddy’s and Russian Direct Investment Fund was an adaptive design phase 2/3 trial. It was a bridging study to the larger global Phase 3 study on 31,000 subjects. He said, “Phase-2 study in India showed a very good safety profile. This further reinforces our confidence in the safety of Sputnik V, which has now been administered to more than one million people in Russia and more than 300,000 people in Argentina.” RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said safety data from the Phase 2 clinical trial from India was “very positive and confirms the safety profile of Sputnik V in the international markets”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dr-reddys-seeks-nod-for-sputnik-v-phase-3-trials/article33554826.ece

12 January 2021||Sidhi,||Woman raped in M.P., four arrested||A 45-year-old woman was grievously injured after four men allegedly raped and brutalised her in Madhya Pradesh’s Sidhi district, the police said on Monday. The incident took place on Saturday night following which the woman has been undergoing treatment at a hospital in the neighbouring Rewa district, Amiliya police station in-charge Deepak Baghel said. The four accused have been detained and are being questioned, said the officer, adding that they belong to the same village as the woman. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi cited the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder incident while reacting to the crime. “One more Nirbhaya! Till when would we tolerate assault on women?” said Mr. Gandhi in a tweet in Hindi, tagging a media report. State Home Minister Narottam Mishra told reporters in Bhopal that no culprit will be spared. A speedy trial will be conducted in the case and the accused will be punished, he said. According to the police officer, the woman was living with her two children and 40-year-old sister in a shanty on a hillock near Hardi village, about 60 km from the district headquarters. Around 10 p.m. on Saturday, four men approached her and asked for water. When the woman told them she did not have water, the accused broke into her home, allegedly raped her and inserted an iron rod into her private parts, the officer said quoting the victim’s complaint. Her sons, aged 16 and 18, were not at home at the time of the incident. The woman’s sister called an autorickshaw from Hardi village and took her to Amiliya police station, from where she was taken to Sidhi district hospital, he said.

12 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||LDF attempts to avoid split in NCP State unit||On Monday, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) appeared to attempt to avoid a split in the State unit of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). It reportedly encouraged Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran and Mani C. Kappan, both NCP legislators, to initiate talks to avoid a permanent parting of ways. The ruling front seemed disinclined to lose its image as a cohesive political force as it readies to face the Assembly polls in May. Frosty relations The LDF wanted the NCP leaders to smoothen the “frosty relations” caused by the report that the ruling front was inclined to hand over the Pala Assembly seat to Jose. K. Mani of the Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)]. Mr. Jose was intensely emotional about Pala and considered it the legacy of his late father and KC(M) founder K.M. Mani. He hoped to contest from the constituency. Mr. Kappan had wrested the Pala seat from the KC(M) in the Assembly byelection in 2019. Mr. Kappan has made it evident that he would quit the LDF than give up the hard-won constituency. NCP State president T.P. Peethambaran is backing Mr. Kappan. Power centre However, Mr. Saseendran, another power centre in the NCP, reportedly held a different view. He has purportedly argued for an accommodation with the KC(M). In intra-party meetings, Mr. Saseendran reportedly said he was not inclined to jump ship. The LDF stood a reasonable chance of winning a second term. The United Democratic Front (UDF) was on the “decline”, he said. The variance in views of the two leaders and reports of UDF overtures to Mr. Kappan appeared to have set the stage for a split in the NCP in Kerala. Other options Mr. Peethambaran had said that Pala seat was not on the negotiating table when the LDF weighed Mr. Jose’s entry. Mr. Kappan had repeatedly dropped hints that he would explore political options outside the LDF if the ruling front accorded Pala to KC(M). A few NCP leaders alleged the CPI also felt sidelined by KC(M). They also denied that KC(M) had brought rich dividends to the LDF in the local body polls as claimed by Mr. Jose.  Saseendran, Kappan told to thrash out differences over Pala seat||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ldf-attempts-to-avoid-split-in-ncp-state-unit/article33554234.ece
12 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Cinemas to reopen on Friday||The cinemas in the State will reopen on Friday after a gap of nine months, with the State government accepting some of the major demands raised by film bodies. On Friday, Tamil film Master starring Vijay will be released across several centres. The Malayalam films will be released from January 21, with Vellam starring Jayasurya. Around 12 Malayalam films are set for release in the coming weeks. In a major relief to cinema theatre owners, the government decided to waive entertainment tax and reduce the fixed charges on electricity during the COVID-19 outbreak period, when the theatres had remained closed. The decision was taken following a meeting between Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the representatives of various film bodies. The government had in 2019 issued an order allowing civic bodies to collect entertainment tax of up to 8.5% on the sale of cinema tickets, to make up for the revenue losses after the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. However, the the Film Exhibitors’ United Organisation of Kerala and the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce had maintained that this amounted to double taxation, as they are already paying the GST on tickets. Electricity charges Now, the government has heeded the exhibitors, who were ravaged by loss of revenue after the pandemic outbreak. The government has also decided to reduce the fixed charges on electricity by 50%. The exhibitors can repay the remaining amount in instalments. The property tax which should have been paid to the local body before March 31, 2020, can be paid as monthly instalments. The State government cannot decide on professional tax. The period of various licences for the cinemas from the local body, electrical inspectorate, films division, Health Department and fire force has been extended to March 31. The decisions of the government were lauded by most actors, including Mohanlal and Mammootty, on social media. Earlier in the day, Mr. Vijayan held talks with the representatives of the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce, Film Exhibitors United Organisation of Kerala (FEUOK), Kerala Film Producers’ Association, and Distributors’ Association. The State government had earlier this month allowed the theatres to reopen with 50% capacity from January 5, but the theatre owners refused to reopen until their demands were met.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cinemas-to-reopen-on-friday/article33554221.ece
12 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Act against loudspeaker use, HC tells Karnataka||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State government to immediately issue directions to the police and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to initiate action on use of amplifiers and loudspeakers in religious places in the State in violation of laws on noise pollution and the directions issued by the apex court. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, issued the directions while hearing a PIL petition, filed by one Girish Bharadwaj, a resident of Bengaluru.  The State must ensure protection of the rights of the citizens under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Bench observed, while taking note of the fact that the court had came across several PIL petitions about illegal use of loudspeakers in religious places in violations of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control ), Rules, 2000, issued under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The petitioner, while pointing out the directions issued to all the States by the apex court in 2005, had complained that the State government and its authorities have failed to implement the directions. The apex court had directed the State governments to make provision for seizure and confiscation of loudspeakers, amplifiers and other equipments as are found to be creating noise beyond the permissible limits and timings, the petitioner has said. The apex court, the petitioner has pointed, had also directed the Union and the State governments to ensure that noise level at the boundary of the public place, which include religious places, where loudspeaker or public address are used as per law, should not exceed 10 dB(A) above the ambient noise standards for the area or 75 dB(A), whichever is lower.  The petitioner also said that apex court had also directed that no one should beat a drum or tom-tom or blow a trumpet or beat or sound any instrument or use any sound amplifier at night (between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.) except in public emergencies besides directing the authorities to ensure that peripheral noise level of privately owned sound system should not exceed by more than 5 dB(A) than the ambient air quality standard specified for the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/act-against-loudspeaker-use-hc-tells-karnataka/article33554224.ece
12 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Intermediate semesters classes to begin on January 15||Offline classes for students of intermediate semesters for both postgraduate and undergraduate courses in degree, diploma and engineering courses will begin on January 15. Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan announced this on Monday after a high-level meeting with officials of the Department of Higher Education. It was also decided to reopen college canteens and libraries, which were closed until now. Further, colleges can also restart the sports, cultural activities and NCC and NSS training in the colleges after chalking out standard operating procedures (SOPs). Dr. Narayan said that hostels for all the students will be opened simultaneously and the bus pass facility will also be provided. “The department has also got in touch with the Transport Department to ensure that student bus passes are distributed on a fast track basis,” he said. These classes would reopen amidst all precautionary measures taken, including conducting COVID-19 tests in colleges, and sanitisation, among others. While classes for final year students had commenced on November 17, the State government had decided to reopen the remaining classes after Sankranti, which falls on January 14. The department had sought reports from vice-chancellors of all universities on the reopening. It was unanimously decided that there was an urgent need to reopen the remaining classes in the best interest of students. Many students had complained that the online classes were not effective and they were not able to grasp even core concepts. A press release from the department stated that NCC exams also needed to be conducted. It has been decided to organise short-term camps. “It has been allowed to conduct three days camp for the B-Certificate exam and five days camp for the C-Certificate exam,” the release added.

12 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala govt. seeks CBI probe into Walayar case||The State government has recommended an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the suspected suicide of two minor Dalit girls, both sisters, at Walayar in Palakkad in 2017. After a trial court acquitted the three persons alleged to be responsible for their deaths, the government and the State police had come under withering criticism from across the social and political spectrum. Recently, the Kerala High Court had set aside the acquittal by a special court for the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO). It slammed the botched investigation and ordered a further inquiry and retrial. The case had become a political hot potato for the government. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party pointed out that the suspects, all men in the neighbourhood of the victims, were Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] supporters. They alleged the police had consequently developed cold feet and scuttled the probe bowing to political influence. Opposition charge Moreover, Opposition parties pointed out that the lawyer who defended the accused persons was a CPI(M) functionary who had officiated for years as the District Child Welfare Committee’s chairperson. They said the entire case smacked of conflict of interest and conspiracy to save the accused. The alleged police apathy to the Dalit family’s plight had driven the victims’ parents to the street to seek justice for their wards. The couple also moved the High Court for a reinvestigation. The parents also sought a parallel probe into the “shoddy” police investigation that saved the suspects from conviction. Support for parents The government had supported the parents’ plea to overturn the acquittal of the accused and institute a re-inquiry. It had also appointed a commission of inquiry headed by retired district judge P.K. Haneda to probe the matter. The government removed the errant prosecutors and suspended the investigating officers pending an inquiry. The Haneda commission had pointed out severe flaws in the investigation and faulty prosecution as reasons for the acquittal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-govt-recommends-cbi-probe-into-walayar-case/article33554233.ece

12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Private conservancy work to start in north Chennai in Feb.||The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is planning to launch private conservancy operations in north Chennai in the third week of February. The launch has been delayed by litigation pertaining to the existing conservancy workers. A special purpose vehicle, created by the GCC and Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited, will carry out the operations in the Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram and Ambattur zones. GCC Chief Engineer N. Mahesan said 825 battery-operated vehicles, 12 compactors and 12 mechanical sweepers would be used. The private operator would start the work in Tiruvottiyur in the third week of February. The operations would begin in Manali in the second phase of the launch, before being expanded to Madhavaram and Ambattur, he said. “We depend on more battery-operated vehicles to ensure 100% door-to-door waste collection. Mechanical sweepers will clean all main roads,” Mr. Mahesan said. All market areas would also be cleaned with mechanical sweepers. A total of 2.5 lakh households in the four zones generate 2,800 tonnes of solid waste every day. The special purpose vehicle would focus more on mechanical sweeping and door-to-door waste collection using battery-operated vehicles, he said. The GCC has already launched private conservancy operations in seven zones of south and central Chennai. But most of the drivers of the battery-operated vehicles have been protesting against the GCC’s order on waste segregation. “The drivers have received less wages than what was promised. So they protested a few days ago. But the private operator has not resolved the issue. As discontent is high, 70% of the drivers are planning to quit after schools are reopened. The drivers of the battery-operated vehicles are reluctant to segregate waste as residents are not cooperating,” said an employee. “A few battery-operated vehicles have been parked at the D2 police station near Spencer Plaza because of the issues pertaining to permit, insurance and RC book. The GCC has not been able to take them out for the past nine days. So garbage clearance is getting disrupted frequently,” said another worker.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-conservancy-work-to-start-in-north-chennai-in-feb/article33554870.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Disclose status of arrear exams, HC tells varsities||The Madras High Court was on Monday informed that various universities in the State have decided to conduct arrear examinations, after the court, through its interim order on December 1, 2020, restrained them from declaring that all students had passed without conducting examinations — online, offline or both modes. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, therefore, directed the individual universities to file reports by February 4 indicating the status with respect to the conduct of the arrear examinations. The direction was issued on a batch of cases filed against the State government’s decision to cancel the arrear examinations. Defending the government order (G.O.) issued on August 26, 2020 (to pass all students), Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan told the court that it was issued to save students from COVID-19. He also said the G.O. was in consonance with the then advisory issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which had insisted on conducting the final-year examinations alone. However, after former Anna University Vice-Chancellor E. Balagurusamy and advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan filed public interest litigation petitions challenging the G.O., the UGC filed a counter-affidavit insisting on the conduct of the arrear examinations. Since the COVID-19 situation, too, had improved by December, the court passed interim orders, he said. On the other hand, advocate E. Vijay Anand, representing the former Vice-Chancellor, urged the Bench to quash the G.O. and order that the students could not be declared to have passed the arrear examinations without writing them.

Ravi, BJP national general secretary in charge of Tamil Nadu, made it clear on Monday that any decision on the chief ministerial candidate for the Assembly election would be made by the AIADMK. He conceded that the ruling AIADMK was a major partner in the National Democratic Alliance in the State and the BJP a minor partner. “The AIADMK in Tamil Nadu..., they are the major partner [in the NDA]. They will decide who is the chief ministerial candidate. We [the BJP] are the minor partner,” he said. The statement marks a change in the BJP’s stand that the national party would decide on the chief ministerial candidate after the election, and the AIADMK was free to choose its candidate. The AIADMK has already fielded Edappadi K. Palaniswami for the top job. Mr. Ravi recalled that Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had said in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah at an event recently that the AIADMK was part of the NDA. The BJP and its State leaders, especially president L. Murugan, had said the BJP’s parliamentary party board and the NDA co-ordination committee would decide on the chief ministerial candidate. However, the AIADMK’s general council meeting declared Mr. Palaniswami the party’s candidate for Chief Minister.  Getting stronger Speaking to reporters in Tiruchi, he claimed that the BJP had become stronger in the State now as compared to previous years and the people of the State would extend good support to his party. “Our workers and leaders were doing good work and I hope we will get good results in the coming elections,” he told reporters. Stating that the BJP cared for the people of Tamil Nadu, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given more schemes for the State. The BJP would gain people’s trust, he further said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-will-decide-on-cm-candidate-says-bjp-leader/article33554389.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Banks deny loans to over 15,000 street vendors||Banks continue to deny loans to street vendors under PM SVANidhi during the COVID-19 pandemic in the city, even after seven meetings with the Greater Chennai Corporation. At a meeting of bankers on Monday, the GCC advised them to disburse loans to all street vendors. “As many as 19,000 street vendors have applied for loans under the PM SVANidhi scheme. Banks in Chennai have disbursed loans to only 2,600 street vendors. Some banks have disbursed loans to most of the applicants. But most of the banks have rejected the applications,” said an official of the GCC. At a meeting held a few weeks ago, Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash directed the banks to disburse loans to all applicants in 10 days. But the bank branches disbursed loans to less than 500 street vendors before the deadline. As a result, the GCC is planning to compile a list of all branches that have rejected the applications. The data will be shared with the Central and State governments. At least 15,000 street vendors who have identity cards are yet to get loans. Most of the letters of recommendation issued by the GCC were rejected by the banks, which argued that the applicants did not have identity cards. Corporation officials explained to the bank representatives that the letters were issued to those who did not have identity cards. They stressed the need for creating awareness among bank officials of the importance of such loans during the pandemic. The bank representatives said they did not have the manpower to help the street vendors during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/banks-deny-loans-to-over-15000-street-vendors/article33554873.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Plea to display portraits of President, PM in govt. offices||A public interest litigation (PIL) petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the State government and the secretary to the Governor to ensure that the portraits of President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are displayed in all State government offices across the State. R. Jayakkumar, a Bharatiya Janata Party member from Cuddalore, had filed the case on the ground that only the portraits of incumbent Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, former Chief Ministers and others were displayed in government offices and those of the President and the Prime Minister were neglected. He said that a Government Order issued way back in 1978 lists out the portraits that could be displayed in public offices and buildings and they include the portraits of the President and Prime Minister apart from those of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Tiruvalluvar, C.N. Annadurai, C. Rajagopalachari and Thanthai Periyar. Subsequently, another G.O. was issued in 1990 including the portraits of B.R. Ambedkar in the list and a 2006 G.O. added Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, V.O. Chidambaranar, Quaid-e-Millath, Indira Gandhi, former Chief Ministers, incumbent Chief Minister and Tamil Annai to the list of personalities whose portraits could be displayed. However, in practice, the portraits of the President and Prime Minister were absent in most of the public offices and buildings, the petitioner complained. Minimum obligation Stating that States could not function without the assistance of the Centre in a federal structure, the petitioner claimed that Tamil Nadu enjoys maximum financial assistance from the Centre and there it must have the minimum obligation to display the portraits of the President and Prime Minister in all public offices and buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-display-portraits-of-president-pm-in-govt-offices/article33554874.ece

12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Low breathing frequency may push aerosol deeper into lungs||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras have found that when breathing frequency falls, the chances of virus-laden droplets being transported deeper into the lungs increases.  A team of researchers modelled breathing frequencies in the laboratory and found that among those with low breathing frequency, the virus lives longer and increases the chance of deposition, resulting in infection. Also, the multi-scale lung structure has a significant effect on a person’s susceptibility to COVID-19. The research was led by Mahesh Panchagnula, of the Department of Applied Mechanics, and research scholars Arnab Kumar Mallik and Soumalya Mukherjee. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Physics of Fluids . Mr. Panchagnula said: “Our study unravels the mystery behind how particles are transported and deposited in the deep lung. The study demonstrates the physical process by which aerosol particles are transported into the deep generations of the lung.” In their research, the team reported that holding the breath and having low-breathing rate could increase the chances of virus deposition in the lungs. Better therapies The study was conducted to pave the way for developing better therapies and drugs for respiratory infections. In an earlier work, the team had highlighted a significant variability in aerosol uptake among individuals, explaining why some people were more susceptible to airborne diseases. The team imitated the droplet dynamics in the lungs by studying the movement of droplets in the small capillaries of the size, ranging from 0.3 mm to 2 mm, similar to bronchioles. They took water mixed with fluorescent particles and generated aerosols from the liquid using a nebuliser. The fluorescent aerosols were used to track the movement and deposition of particles in the capillaries. The team intends to continue this work to understand how the virus-laden droplets are transported into the lungs. The process by which the virus is transported from the nasal cavity to the deep lung is yet unknown. An understanding of the physics of this phenomenon could help to contain the spread of the disease, the team said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/low-breathing-frequency-may-push-aerosol-deeper-into-lungs/article33554370.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tenders floated for construction of Kolathur-Nathamuni network||Before COVID-19, many residents of the city from areas like Kolathur, Retteri and Villivakkam had to travel all the way to Thirumangalam and take the Metro if they wanted to reach their workplace or other transport hubs, including the airport. But now, all this could change as these areas will get stations of their own in the phase II project. Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) has floated tenders for the construction of underground stations and tunnels from Kolathur to Nathamuni, a stretch covering a distance of nearly 5 km. This will pass through stations like Kolathur Junction, Srinivasa Nagar, Villivakkam, Villivakkam Bus Terminus and Nathamuni. This is the only underground stretch in corridor 5 of the phase II project from Madhavaram to Shollinganallur. The remaining portions will be elevated. This will be particularly helpful for residents of Villivakkam as one of the stations will be linked to the bus terminus, facilitating multi-modal integration and allowing commuters to easily switch from one mode to the other. But it is not clear why two stations have been planned at Villivakkam. The stretch will also pass underneath the Villivakkam railway track, with a distance between the tunnel and ground level maintained at 15.5 m.  Priority corridor According to CMRL officials, the Kolathur-Nathamuni stretch is part of the 52 km priority corridor to be built from Madhavaram to CMBT and Madhavaram to Shollinganallur. It will take nearly four years to complete, and the construction will be challenging because many localities are congested and dense. CMRL had already damaged buildings in north Chennai a few years back during construction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tenders-floated-for-construction-of-kolathur-nathamuni-network/article33554857.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen at loggerheads over berthing space in Kasimedu||Two boat associations are at loggerheads over space to berth their craft in the Kasimedu fishing harbour. A group of around 50 mechanised boats that are occupying the low-level wharf meant for smaller fibre boats is causing the problem. “They are refusing to move and when the winds are heavy or the tide is high, the smaller boats get hit and damaged. Due to lack of space, these fibre boats are berthed some 5-6 boats away, which leads to men falling into the water and getting hurt due to the stones and rods at the bottom. There are at least 10 wharfs for the larger mechanized boats that number around 1,000,” explained Nanjil Ravi of Akhila Indhiya Meenavar Sangam. M. Vijesh, who represents the small boats, said the issue should be amicably resolved and that they did not want to create a ruckus over it. “They are our brethren. They should understand our problems. A section of the boats did move out. But some boats are still berthing here. This will cause damage to the wharf too since it cannot withstand the loading and unloading operations,” he said. The Fisheries Department had sent notices to the owners of the boats and also to the association representing them. Their diesel subsidy, too, was suspended for a certain time. However, they managed to get that lifted. A meeting with the association members has been planned, said a source in the department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-at-loggerheads-over-berthing-space-in-kasimedu/article33554855.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Remembering a trendsetting thavil maestro||Valangaiman, a town in Thiruvarur district, gets its name from the fact that Lord Siva in the temple there holds a deer in his right hand. It is a rare idol. In the world of Carnatic music, it occupied an important place because of thavil player Valangaiman Shanmugasundaram Pillai, whose birth centenary is being celebrated this year. To keep alive the memory of the maestro, Parivadini, a charitable organisation promoting music, has released a table calendar. “He exemplified a traditional thavil maestro — both in his way of playing the instrument and physical appearance. Clarity was his forte,” said thavil maestro T.R. Govindarajan. Interestingly, Shanmugasundaram Pillai was not born in Valangaiman. His birthplace is Segal Madappuram near Thiruthuraipoondi. His family moved to Sri Lanka when he was a child. After establishing a career in music there, he came back to India to learn from Nachiar Kovil Raghava Pillai. Valangaiman became inseparable from his name after he settled there. Though he played for all great nagaswaram players, for almost 30 years he accompanied Sheik Chinna Moulana. He was a trendsetter when it came to accompanying other instruments. He first played for flute Mali and N. Ramani. “He came forward to play for Mandolin Srinivas and the combination created a wave in the music world. His concerts with violinist L. Subramaniam and his brothers are also well received. He even played for T.N. Seshagopalan in his vocal concerts,” said Mr. Govindarajan. Srinivas had acknowledged how Shanmugasundaram gave a fillip to his career in the initial years. The way he controlled the instrument to produce soft sounds to suit instruments other than nagaswaram was amazing. “He accompanied me when I was a boy and told me not to be overawed by his presence. ‘Let us see what we can do together’ was the word of encouragement,” recalled nagaswaram player Injikudi E.M. Subramaniam. “He was a team player and elevated the concert together with other musicians. The way he played during raga alapana is something unique, and now that style has almost disappeared,” he said. Parivadini founder Lalitharam said the calendar also has the portraits of thavil maestros Raghava Pillai and Needamangalam Meenakshisundaram Pillai.  His concerts with violinist L. Subramaniam and his brothers are well received. He even played for T.N. Seshagopalan T.R.

12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘IITs are deliberately avoiding reservation’||Criticising the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in the country for deliberately avoiding reservations and inclusivity in their campuses, Subhashini Ali, former MP and vice-president of the Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch (DSMM), said the IITs had become “casteist” institutions. Delivering a talk during a webinar organised by the Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front to protest the recommendations made by a committee constituted by the Ministry of Education to abolish reservations in faculty recruitments at the IITs, she said the implementation of reservations in the IITs were already poor. The representation of Muslims and women were also poor in the IITs, Ms. Ali added. Arguing that the admission policies followed by the JNU in New Delhi were inclusive, she said eminent academicians had recommended the adoption of its policies across other educational institutions. She said students from Dalit and Adivasi communities were feeling discriminated on IIT campuses despite being academically sound. Stating that though the Congress governments in the past did not try to address inclusivity-related issues in the IITs, she said the present BJP-led government was determined to uphold the caste system and implement the principles of Manusmriti .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iits-are-deliberately-avoiding-reservation/article33554391.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||It is worrying that only a few Vanniyars have been made HC judges, says Ramadoss||Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S. Ramadoss on Sunday said it is a matter of serious concern that only 13 people from the Vanniyar community have been elevated as judges of the Madras High Court in the last 25 years, despite it being one of the most populous communities in the State. Stating that there were hundreds of meritorious lawyers and judicial officers in the community, Mr. Ramadoss said they were being deliberately neglected to keep them away from centres of power. He urged the Advocates Forum for Social Justice (AFSJ), also founded by him, to strive towards the cause. Portrait released After releasing a portrait of former Madras High Court judge K.M. Natarajan, Mr. Ramadoss said he was the first from the Vanniyar community to be elevated as a judge of the High Court and also someone who worked tirelessly for the upliftment of the members of the community. The PMK founder expressed surprise over some judges from the Vanniyar community recusing from hearing cases related to the group and the PMK. In his address, former Madras High Court judge P. Kalaiyarasan recalled his long association with Natarajan. No opportunity He said those from the Vanniyar community were not elevated to the High Court at a young age and were thereby deprived of the opportunity to become senior judges. PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss met former Madras High Court Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul (now a Supreme Court judge) during the latter’s tenure. It was only after the meeting that two young lawyers from the community were elevated. Pointing out that they both were now serving as judges of the High Court, Mr. Kalaiyarasan said the community should be ever thankful to Justice Kaul. Subsequently, the AGSJ executive committee meeting was held virtually and Mr. Balu was appointed as its president.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-is-worrying-that-only-a-few-vanniyars-have-been-made-hc-judges-says-ramadoss/article33555073.ece

On December 22 last, Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam had written to the Registrars of all universities, setting the approximate dates for the examinations to be held online. Anna University was given the period from January 2 to 20 for its odd-semester examinations. The university had asked the autonomous colleges in December to conduct the examinations. These colleges were through with them. The non-autonomous colleges affiliated to the university are awaiting instructions. Teachers of the non-autonomous affiliated colleges said the second- and third-year students were idling away their time for two months as the teachers had completed the syllabus. ‘Huge exercise’ Anna University Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa said conducting examinations online would be a huge exercise and required an appropriate software. “We are conducting all exams, including arrears exams; it requires a massive preparation. We had committed ourselves to conducting the exams in the second week of January, but we have sought some more time,” he added. The delay was due to the difficulty in finalising the tender for the software, he said. “It has all been sorted out. On Tuesday, they are opening the financial bid,” he said. Within a week, the university would announce the schedule, he said. The university had written to the Department of Higher Education for consent to announce the date, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anna-university-writes-to-govt-seeking-new-dates-for-exams/article33554375.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC commends HR&CE Dept. for coming up with a roadmap to preserve heritage temples||The Madras High Court on Monday commended the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department for coming up with an “excellent” roadmap for preserving heritage temples in Tamil Nadu. Justices R. Mahadevan and P.D. Audikesavalu appreciated HR&CE Commissioner S. Prabhakar, who attended the court proceedings through video call, for filing an elaborate affidavit on the plans to preserve ancient temples. The judges suggested that the Management and Preservation of Properties of Religious Institutions Rules of 1964 could be amended in tune with international charters on conservation of monuments, to safeguard heritage temples. They also asked Rangarajan Narasimhan, a litigant who had filed numerous cases for protecting temples and their properties, to go through the Commissioner’s affidavit and submit his suggestions and ideas by January 25. The affidavit was filed in response to a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court in January 2015, during the tenure of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul (now a Supreme Court judge), for conservation of heritage temples. It stated that there were 44,121 religious institutions under the control of HR&CE department. Of them, 1,966 were mutts and charities. The remaining 42,155 were temples of which 8,450 were built over 100 years ago and hence fall under the category of ancient temples. The department had decided to restore the temples in a phased manner giving priority to structures that were degrading due to natural phenomenon. A database was being created for the purpose and so far data had been collected with respect to 40,695 temples. Of those temples, 32,935 were found to be in good condition and 6,414 required only minor repair works. However, 530 temples were identified to be partially dilapidated and 716 were in severely dilapidated condition, according to the Commissioner. The department had begun the process of restoring and renovating all the dilapidated temples by indexing the heritage temples as per UNESCO norms. The services of Vasanthi, a retired Deputy Superintending Archaeologist, had been availed to grade the temples. A team led by her had inspected and graded over 5,000 ancient temples. The grading process would help in deciding the method of restoration. It would be followed by assessment of damage by teams comprising structural engineers, conservation architects and Stapathis who shall prepare detailed project reports (DPRs). The DPRs will have to be approved by the heritage screening committees at the local, regional and State-level before commencing restoration work, when every effort would be made to maintain architectural integrity of ancient temples, the department assured the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-commends-hrce-dept-for-coming-up-with-a-roadmap-to-preserve-heritage-temples/article33554380.ece

Thangamani called on Dr. Ramadoss at the latter’s residence in Thailapuram near here. The Ministers, deputed by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, held discussions with Dr. Ramadoss for nearly one-and-a-half hours. With speculations rife that electoral pact was being finalised, Dr. Ramadoss said on social media that there was no discussion on elections or politics. At the meeting, the discussions were only about internal reservation for Vanniyars. "The Ministers have promised to come back after Pongal to resume the negotiations," Dr. Ramadoss tweeted. " Till the PMK's demand for internal reservation is implemented, there will not be any talk of electoral alliance," he added. On Saturday, PMK released a statement that the party was diluting its stance regarding ‘separate 20% reservations for Vanniyars’ to internal reservations within the MBC quota and urged the State government and the AIADMK to accept the demand.

12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Student battles for provisional certificate after completing course||For more than a year, a student who completed M.A (Economics) from Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) was not issued course completion certificate and provisional certificate by varsity authorities despite finishing all formalities. After repeated attempts to get the certificates failed, the student, Pawan Kumar of Kaithal district in Haryana, filed a petition under the Right to Information Act, 2005, seeking copies of the course completion certificate and the provisional certificate. Not satisfied with the replies of the Public Information Officer/Assistant Registrar and the First Appellate Authority, the petitioner filed an appeal with the Tamil Nadu Information Commission. While the contention of the PIO was that the certificates were not issued since the applicant had not paid the prescribed fee, the student said he paid the fee through Demand Draft. Though the DD was accepted by the authorities, the amount was not credited to the account of the university. This was not communicated to the petitioner despite his petitions under the RTI Act. When the appeal was taken up via telephonic enquiry, in view of the COVID-19 safety protocol, the PIO said he had sent a letter to the petitioner regarding the issue and asked him to send the credit details of the DD. “It is impossible for the petitioner to get the details because the said transaction was made from one bank to another bank. Hence, the letter sent to the petitioner, after one year of RTI petition, by the Public Authority is irrelevant,” State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj said. Directing the student to pay the fee once again to get his certificate immediately, the SIC said the Commission had the power to direct the university to award compensation to the petitioner under section 19(8)(b) of the RTI Act, 2005 for the loss suffered by him in the process. Mr. Muthuraj also directed the PIO of the Directorate of Distance Education, MKU, to send an explanation within 15 days as to why disciplinary action should not be recommended under section 20(2) of the RTI Act, 2005 against him for not providing information to the petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/student-battles-for-certificates-after-completing-course/article33554883.ece
12 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Murder accused nabbed in Mumbai after 3 years||Personnel from the Neelankarai police station arrested a murder accused who went into hiding for three years in Mumbai even after a sessions court issued repeated non-bailable warrants (NBWs) against him. On the orders of the City Police Commissioner, personnel have been executing pending non-bailable warrants. In line with this, sub-inspector S. Tamilanban and grade-I constable V. Ganesh went to Mumbai and arrested Amit Kumar Ranjan, 29, from Bihar, who is one of the key accused in the murder of a college student in 2010. On July 4, 2010, Nirbhay Singh, 20, of Ranchi, a third-year engineering student in a private college in Maduravoyal, was riding on a motorcycle when a speeding car knocked him down. A group of students from the vehicle attacked him with clubs. A rift between two groups over the organising of engineering admissions in private universities allegedly led to the murder. As many as 15 students, including Amit Kumar Ranjan, were arrested and remanded. Off the grid Ranjan continued to be absent from court proceedings. He discontinued his studies and went off the grid.

Ramachandran here on Monday. Inaugurating a new building for the Office of Joint Commissioner (HR&CE) here, he said following representations from various Hindu groups, Chief Minister Edappadi K.

12 January 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Farmers’ association demands repeal of laws||Alleging that the State government had enacted two anti-farm laws even before the Centre introduced three laws on agriculture, members of Tamilaga Vivasaigal Sangam, organised a day-long protest in which they urged both the Centre and the State government to repeal the laws. The protest, organised at the association’s office on Perundurai Road, was presided by its district president E.R. Kumarasamy and chaired by Erode MP A. Ganeshamurthi. Farmers said Tamil Nadu Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2019, envisaged an agreement between the farmer and the purchaser, who is a private company. They said that farmers would be forced to sign contracts and supply their produce at a meagre price or at a price fixed by the company. In case of problems, these would have to be sorted out only legally, which would delay payments to small and marginal farmers and affect their livelihood. Breeding of bulls Under the Tamil Nadu Bovine Breeding Act, 2019, bulls used for cross-breeding have to be registered with the government and the registration has to be renewed every two years. The farmers pointed out that the Act banned crossing-breeding of native bulls with exotic breeds and obtaining a fitness certificate for bulls from veterinarians was mandatory. Also, officials were given powers to enter the bull owner’s premises without any notice to examine the bull’s breeding fitness, they said. They said the Centre’s move to bring primary agricultural cooperative societies under the control of the Reserve Bank of India would affect the farming community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-association-demands-repeal-of-laws/article33554424.ece

But, the government did not regularise their service and their long pending demand for switching from consolidated pay to time-scale based pay was not fulfilled forcing them to protest two years ago in Chennai. The government, after the High Court direction in 2018, promised to regularise the service of 300 to 400 nurses every year and had also hiked the salary to Rs. 14,000. Members said that even after two years, their services were not regularised and their salary was not hiked to Rs. 40,000 on par with those appointed on a permanent basis. They nurses said that they worked round the clock at the PHCs and were not eligible to take leave. “We worked during COVID-19 pandemic without leave or additional benefits,” they said and wanted the government to regularise their service and provide them time-scale based pay. On Monday, over 150 nurses from The Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Karur, Erode, Namakkal and Salem districts participated in the demonstration and raised slogans to fulfil their demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nurses-demand-job-regularisation-stage-protest/article33554432.ece

12 January 2021||KANNIYAKUMARI,TAMIL NADU||NDA will form govt in T.N. again, says Murugan||The National Democratic Alliance, which is already in power in Tamil Nadu, will form the government again after the next Assembly polls, BJP State president L. Murugan has said. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Mr. Murugan said the NDA’s Chief Minister is already ruling here (in Tamil Nadu) and would form the government again after the next Assembly polls when he answered a question as to whenthe BJP would form its government in Tamil Nadu. When asked about the choice of the Chief Minister’s candidate, Mr. Murugan said the AIADMK had passed a resolution unanimously electing Edappadi K. Palaniswami as the Chief Ministerial candidate. The NDA’s leaders, after discussing about their choice with the constituents, would come out with the formal announcement, he clarified. On a question if the Union Government, using Central agencies, was arm-twisting the AIADMK for continuation of electoral alliance and getting sizable number of Assembly constituencies, the BJP chief said there was no necessity for their party to threaten anyone for electoral gains. Mr. Murugan exuded confidence that the BJP would win the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha by-poll for which the candidate would be handpicked by the party high command. When asked about Congress State president K.S. Alagiri’s charge that the BJP was treating AIADMK as a ‘second-grade party’, Mr. Murugan said the Congress was not sure that it was still in the DMK-led electoral alliance as the latter was forcing every constituent party to contest in its symbol. “Moreover, absolute confusion prevails in the DMK about its Chief Ministerial candidate as Stalin, Kanimozhi and Udhayanidhi Stalin are eying the post,” Mr. Murugan claimed. He charged that the DMK was treating the women badly, verbally abused and manhandled a woman when she raised questions during a recent meeting chaired by Mr. Stalin and even its Alangulam MLA Poongothai Aladi Aruna was not spared by the party cadres. “She [Dr. Poongothai] was forced to fall at the feet of party cadres during a party meeting,” Mr. Murugan said adding that the people of Tamil Nadu would not lead a peaceful life if the DMK, which kept Tamil Nadu under utter darkness due to power cuts between 2006 and 2011 and grabbed thousands of acres of lands from innocents and the voiceless, returned to power. When asked about actor Rajinikanth’s latest statement that he was pained at being forced to enter electoral politics, Mr. Murugan said: “He (Mr. Rajinikanth) who believes in spiritualism and nationalism would support us”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nda-will-form-govt-in-tn-again-says-murugan/article33555118.ece
12 January 2021||Karaikal,TAMIL NADU||Electricity dept. employees begin indefinite strike||Defying a warning by the Karaikal district administration, employees of Electricity Department , in deference to a call given by Privatisation Protest Committee, commenced their indefinite strike by staging a dharna on Monday, triggering fears of disruption of power supply. The employees sat all through the day and raised slogans against the Puducherry government expressing their fears over job security and working conditions, even as the district administration contemplated action against them on the ground of causing disturbance to public tranquillity and danger to human life, health and safety. Apprehending damage of properties in view of the indefinite strike by Electricity Department employees, the Karaikal district administration has arranged for police protection to the buildings and equipment. In an order directed at the Electricity Department employees, Karaikal Collector Arjun Sharma invoked Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, to prohibit ‘unlawful assembly’ of the employees. Legal action under Section 188 of IPC and other relevant provisions will be initiated against the violators, the Collector said. Electricity being an essential service, critical services like hospitals and water supply are dependent on electricity supply. Any indefinite disruptions in the supply of electricity is likely to cause disturbance to public peace and danger to human life, health and safety. Meanwhile, V. R. Dhanaseelane president, Karaikal District Citizens’ Welfare Association, drew the attention of the Postal Department to the dysfunctional condition of UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) devices in the Post Offices in the enclave. In a letter to the Superintendent of Post Offices, Nagapattinam Division, Nagapattinam, and The Postmaster General, Central Region, Tamil Nadu, Tiruchi, Mr. Dhanaseelane said immediate steps must be taken to restore the UPS devices in the post offices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/electricity-dept-employees-begin-indefinite-strike/article33554367.ece
12 January 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Residents demand closure of quarry in Shoolagiri||Protests have risen against a stone quarry at Basthalapalli panchayat in Shoolagiri here, as the residents have raised safety and ecological issues demanding its closure. On Monday, the residents led by the panchayat representatives arrived at the Colletorate with placards demanding that the Collector order the closure of the quarry, Konkan Aggregates Private Limited. The residents have raised issues such as public safety, ecological degradation of ground water, farming, and other environmental concern to close down the quarry. Over 50 heavy vehicles that ferried stones from the quarry damaged the village roads and caused accidents, the residents alleged. According to the protesters, the Konkan Aggregates Private Limited-run-quarry was located on 30 acres of patta land and 15 acres of panchayat land. However, the quarry had not paid the taxes payable to the panchayat, ever since it was set up. Constant reminders by the panchayat were not heeded by the quarry. The residents said that the recurrent explosion in the quarry without prior warning had damaged properties, besides posing serious threat to the lives of the villagers. It has been alleged that the explosions also whipped up stone dust and stone shrapnel, before settling on the adjoining farmlands and damaged houses, and roofs. There are over 10 villages surrounding Basthalapalli panchayat, whose farmlands were severely affected from the quarry dust, the residents said in their petition. The settling of dust on the farmlands was impacting the plantation of coconuts, mango, plantains, tamarind and other crops in the surrounding areas. Further, the ground water level had fallen to 1,000 feet from the earlier 300 feet, the residents said. The panchayat has also alleged that the quarry had encroached parts of the graveyard land and village temple lands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-demand-closure-of-quarry-in-shoolagiri/article33554437.ece

Venkatesan, Madurai MP, here on Monday. Addressing mediapersons after inspecting the progress of several smart city projects in the city, he said, “The civic body was instructed during the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee meeting to set up SCAF under the smart cities mission within the next one month. However, it has not been set up yet. I have written to the Collector regarding this and the SCAF is likely to be set up by January-end.,” The MP, along with City Engineer S. Arasu, inspected Thirumalai Nayak Palace, Vilakkuthoon, Pathuthoon lane, Heritage Plaza constructed on erstwhile Jhansi Rani Park, Masi streets and Chithirai streets. The inspection was undertaken to ascertain whether the smart city projects were on schedule and executed as per plan. Till date, only one out of 14 smart city projects had been completed in the city, he said. He said the smart city projects caused air and dust pollution in the city, causing severe inconvenience to the residents. To a query on Periyar bus stand project, Mr. Arasu said it would start functioning by March. Speaking to The Hindu , the MP said several suggestions were offered to Corporation officials regarding execution of the projects. “The park constructed on Thirumalai Nayak Palace complex must come under the purview of Archaeological department as it is highly probable that visitors could desecrate the monument,” he said. Similarly, at Vilakkuthoon, construction of a six-feet guard around the lamppost was suggested to protect it from vandals. Mr. Venkatesan said storm water drains were inadequate on Masi streets. “The officials were instructed to provide additional holes to drain water from the streets,” he said. The officials were also instructed to repair and reopen dysfunctional toilets around Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple. “I have also asked for a detailed report about street lights erected on the Masi and Chithirai streets under the Smart Cities Mission,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-inspects-progress-of-projects-in-madurai/article33554397.ece
12 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Follow the guidelines in letter and spirit: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday directed the organisers of jallikattu in Madurai to follow the earlier High Court orders in letter and spirit and ensure the smooth conduct of the events. In the previous years, the court had directed that there should be no ‘muthal mariyathai’ (first honours) to any person and no party flags or materials projecting any leaders should be exhibited at the jallikattu venues. The court also directed that bank accounts should be opened for the deposit of donation / contribution for the conduct of jallikattu. The orders were passed in a batch of public interest litigation petitions seeking a direction for the smooth conduct of jallikattu. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi said, “We hope and trust the jallikattu programme would be conducted peacefully.” After it was alleged that there was no equal representation in the Avaniapuram jallikattu organising committee, the judges directed the committee to include two more petitioners. Last week, the court had directed the committee to include a Scheduled Caste member.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/follow-the-guidelines-in-letter-and-spirit-hc/article33554995.ece
12 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Ensure compliance with protocols: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday took note of the fact that crowds were gathering at cinema theatres for hours together to buy tickets for the Pongal film releases without maintaining physical distance or wearing face masks. It directed the State government and the theatre owners to ensure that COVID-19 guidelines were strictly followed. The government submitted that the order allowing 100% occupancy at the theatres was revoked and a fresh order was issued to allow 50% occupancy in compliance with the guidelines issued by the Union government. Permission for extra shows had been granted, with the welfare of the theatre owners kept in mind, Advocate-General Vijay Narayan said. Representing the Tamil Nadu Theatre and Multiplex Owners Association, senior counsel Prabhakaran argued that the industry had come to a grinding halt owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The extra shows alone would not help the theatre owners. An increase in the ticket prices, as in Noida and Delhi, would help. They also had to bear the sanitation cost, a recurring one, he said. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi observed that the State and the theatre owners must ensure that the 50% occupancy limit was not breached. Full occupancy should not be allowed at any cost and the protocols must be followed, it said. As for the increase in the ticket prices, the court asked the Tamil Nadu Theatre and Multiplex Owners Association to approach the government, which could consider the request. When counsel for the petitioners submitted that tickets might have been sold for full occupancy, the judges said that in that case, the ticket-holders could be accommodated in the subsequent shows.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-compliance-with-protocols-hc/article33554382.ece

SFI district urban secretary S. Veldeva said the schools remained closed for more than 10 months now, affecting students, particularly those in villages, and those belonging to economically weaker sections of the society. “Many students are on the verge of quitting studies owing to the closure of educational institutions for long. Others have joined jobs to support their families. These students do not have access to nutritious food as schools are closed,” he said. “Online classes have created a major divide between the rich and poor students. Also, online classes cannot serve as a proper alternative to physical classes. Many students do not have smart phones or laptops to attend the online classes,” said Mr. Veldeva. Hence, the government must allow reopening of educational institutions, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reopen-educational-institutions-sfi/article33554997.ece
12 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Compensation sought for crop damaged in rain||A group of farmers, affiliated to Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, petitioned the Collector here on Monday demanding compensation for farmers whose paddy crop was damaged in the recent rains. The farmers brought samples of crop with them to the Collectorate to illustrate the extent of damage. The association’s district president, S.P. Ilangovan, said paddy crop that was ready for harvest in a few days were extensively damaged in Madurai North, East and Melur blocks. “The crop was submerged in water due to the recent rains,” he added. The farmers have borrowed extensively to cultivate paddy as they had to spend around Rs. 35,000 per acre. But the unexpected damage caused by the monsoon disheartened the farmers. They are clueless about how to address the issue. Hence, officials must conduct a field survey to study the extent of damageand give compensation to the farmers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compensation-sought-for-crop-damaged-in-rain/article33554994.ece
12 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Registration of bulls for jallikattu gets under way||A large number of bull owners lined up at Avaniapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur on Monday for registration of bulls for jallikattu events scheduled for this Pongal festival. Joint Director of Animal Husbandry R. Rajathilagam said they had restricted the number of tokens to be issued to 700 per event. “This is to ensure that all registered bulls get an opportunity to participate in the events,” he said. Mr. Rajathilagam said bulls were medically examined at 96 veterinary dispensaries and four veterinary hospitals across the district from January 7 to 10. “The bulls were examined at these health centres to check if they were medically fit to attend the jallikattu events. It was also checked if bulls had been vaccinated for foot-and-mouth disease. Based on this, the bulls were given medical certificates,” he said. In addition, a photo of the bull with its owner and a helper was affixed with the medical certificate. “Usually, at least four people are allowed to accompany a bull. But, this year only two are allowed owing to restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the photographs attached with the medical certificates will tell the two persons who will accompany the bull to the arena,” he said. Another examination The bulls were registered for jallikattu events on Monday based on the medical certificate. “Another medical examination for bulls will take place on the day of the jallikattu, which will guarantee the participation of the bulls in the game,” he added. RT-PCR tests were also conducted for the bull owners and helpers participating in the jallikattu. “In the event of a bull owner or a helper testing positive for COVID-19, officials will be immediately informed and that person will not be allowed to participate in the event,” said Mr. Rajathilagam. It is also learnt that unlike the previous years, revenue and police officials were also allowed to register bulls for jallikattu, along with animal husbandry officials. “This may lead to misuse of power while issuing registration tokens to bull owners,” said another official from the Animal Husbandry department.

12 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Work on National Digital Health Mission in progress||Work on key components of the National Digital Health Mission, a Central project to set up an integrated database of health providers and users, is under way in the Union Territory. S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health, and J. Ramesh, nodal officer for the project, told a press conference that the Health Department in Puducherry has completed enrolment of doctors in the government sector and was now in the process of collating data in the private sector for the DigiDoctor component of the NDHM. Simultaneously, a campaign is under way to encourage citizens to generate their unique health ids electronically. The Centre has set a target of getting an estimated 6.50 lakh citizens to register their health id. “We are expecting to meet the target set by the Centre by the end of this month,” Dr. Mohan Kumar said. “We are also in the process of encouraging public participation in the creation of health ids, which is an important layer of the ecosystem.” Simultaneously, the State-level health mission has also piloted a health records consolidation programme in health centres in Kirumambakkam, Mettupalayam and the Government Dental College, Dr. Ramesh said. Puducherry, which is one of the six Union Territories where the mission implemented by the National Health Authority has been rolled out on pilot basis, is hoping to create a model health ecosystem that can be replicated throughout the country, officials said. The key building blocks of the ecosystem are DigiDoctor, HealthID, Health Facility Registry, Personal Health Records, e-Pharmacy and Telemedicine. All components would form an integrated and citizen-centric health ecosystem with the objective of enabling access to timely, safe and affordable healthcare. According to officials, health id creation is a simple measure where users can either enrol through Aadhaar number of just via OTP on their mobile number. The health id can be set up by following the linkwww.healthid.ndhm.gov.in The id can be downloaded and stored on the mobile for future use. All the patient details, including case history, would be integrated with the id, ensuring seamless treatment irrespective of hospital location, anywhere in the country. This would also facilitate remote consultation with experts via Telemedicine. Up to 10 family members can be enrolled using one mobile number. Health teams would be reaching out to banks, industries and other workplaces, colleges and schools to boost public participation in creation of health id. Officials also sought to allay concerns over risk to patient data confidentiality as the system was set up in such a way that user input was necessary at various stages of access. The Health Department has also provided the following lines for assistance — 104 and 0413-2262527/537 and 9443215450/9944014410/9360038239 on WhatsApp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/work-on-national-digital-health-mission-in-progress/article33555071.ece

Governor (L-G) Kiran Bedi addresses the issues he had raised in a letter to her on January 9. “Either I should be given an audience by the Lt. Governor at Raj Nivas or the secretaries should come to the Assembly and address my grievances. Otherwise, I will continue with the stir,” he toldThe Hindu. The Minister, in his letter, had raised 15 issues, including the release of the remaining Rs. 12 crore for civic amenities, clearance for increasing housing subsidy from Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh, fund allocation for residential schools, clearance for increasing marriage assistance, including 10,000 more additional beneficiaries under the old age pension scheme and the release of grant-in aid for co-operative sugar mills. The Minister said he also wanted to discuss with the Lt. Governor the issue of the reopening of textile mills, free rice distribution and the non-allocation of funds to the backward classes corporation for the disbursal of loans. People are asking why there were double standards in implementing welfare schemes, he said, adding that the Tamil Nadu government could distribute rice and provide Pongal gifts but not the neighbouring Union Territory. “It is the right of a Minister to discuss issues with the Lt. Governor. A delay in the implementation of welfare schemes has caused much hardship to the backward classes,” the Minister said. The Minister had spent Sunday night in the portico of the Assembly.

12 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Electricity Department staff in U.T. begin indefinite strike||A significant section of electricity workers began an indefinite strike on Monday against the Centre’s privatisation move of the power distribution in Puducherry even as the Government urged agitators to call off the “illegal” stir in the interest of the public. Under the umbrella of the Joint Action Committee of engineers and other categories of staff representing about 3,000 employees in the Department, hundreds of workers assembled at the headquarters of the Puducherry Electricity Department in Dubrayapet. Heavy police bandobust was deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incident. “Employees across levels are participating in the strike and have resolved not to back down from our demand to drop the privatisation move,” said P. Velmurugan, Electricity Engineers and Employees’ Privatisation Protest Committee. The conciliatory talks convened by the Labour Department failed to yield any result. “The strike is also about upholding public interest in the long term as electricity workers are also consumers. Allowing entry of private players in the power sector would result in uncontrolled hikes in tariffs,” Mr. Velmurugan said. The workers also believe that there is no rationale for privatisation of the power sector in Puducherry as it was efficiently managed and transmission and distribution losses were well under control. Devesh Singh, Power Secretary, told the media that the strike contravened provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 stipulating power supply as a public utility service and provisions of the disciplinary rules of the department. Elaborate steps have been taken to ensure that normal life is not affected due to power disruptions. “All executive engineers have been instructed to be vigilant and to ensure that in case of disruptions power is restored at the earliest by utilising available staff, private parties and other government agencies”. Manpower deployed Additional manpower, including 22 junior engineers and five assistant engineers, has been deployed in the field for speedy remedial action during disruptions. Meanwhile, the Electricity Department Superintending Engineer stated that the agitation of the employees of the Electricity Department was against the rules and regulations. Action would be taken against the employees indulging in agitation as per the relevant provisions of the CCS Conduct Rules and the period of strike would be considered as break in their service. Further, no salary would be paid for the period of the strike, the official added. According to the Department, the Government of India has taken a policy decision to privatise the Electricity Departments in all the Union Territories to increase efficiency and consumer satisfaction. Preparatory works have already been commenced in most of the Union Territories. There is an apprehension in the minds of the public that the power interruptions and service to the power consumers would be affected due to the strike / agitation. The Department proposed to deploy the services of the retired Assistant Engineers / Junior Engineers on contract basis, if situation warrants. Further, it is proposed to engage about 50 electricians and ITI apprentices on contract basis and perform all the electrical maintenance and break downs through the electrical contractors. Besides, District Collectors in Puducherry and Karaikal have imposed section 144 of CrPC in the Electricity Main Office, sub-stations and various other offices of the Electricity Department and in these circumstances, agitations on these premises would be illegal, the Department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/electricity-department-staff-in-ut-begin-indefinite-strike/article33555069.ece

Even that would not be paid immediately,” Mr. Ramachandra Raja said. The State and Centre have not taken any steps to make private sugar mill pay Rs. 27 crore dues for the farmers pending for three years.

12 January 2021||S. Sundar,TAMIL NADU||Ex-MLA files complaint against moneylender||Moneylenders are adopting a new way to avoid punishment for usurious lending by forcing borrowers to name transfer their properties by registering sale deeds instead of pledging them. A former DMK MLA, D. Radhakrishnan, on Monday lodged a complaint with Madurai Superintendent of Police Sujit Kumar claiming that his relative had cheated him of prime properties worth Rs. 9 crore for a Rs. 2-crore loan he had taken. The SP said he had instructed his officials to inquiry into the complaint. “He insisted that I should execute sale deeds of some of my properties with the promise that on repayment of loan with interest, he would cancel the registration. But now he has gone back on his word with an intention to cheat me,” said Mr. Radhakrishnan, who had won Sholavandan Assembly constituency in 1989. “This is a novel practice being adopted by moneylenders in some districts like Pudukottai, Madurai and Theni. They believe that borrowers cannot seek legal remedy if their properties are usurped through sale deeds,” said a senior police officer. Earlier moneylenders used to force borrowers to give blank cheques or pledge properties as collateral for the loan. “As the State government brought in a legislation to abolish ‘kanthu vatti’ (Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, 2003), they are trying to take a shield under registration of sale deeds,” he said. Mr. Radhakrishnan took a loan of Rs. 1 crore in 2016 in a similar fashion from two persons after executing a sale deed of 1.70 acres of his agricultural land in Vadipatti. When the moneylenders wanted him to repay, he sought the help of another moneylender, who is his relative. After the land was transferred to the new moneylender by the first moneylenders, Mr. Radhakrishnan took a loan of Rs. 1.70 crore to settle the initial loan. He later got Rs. 30 lakh as loan for his daughter’s marriage, after registering a few other properties to the same moneylender. “I had told them that I would soon repay the loan amount with interest after selling my property in Tiruppur. However, as things did not go as planned, I could not immediately repay the loan,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said. Gift settlement Meanwhile, the moneylender made a gift settlement of the 1.70 acre land to his son and they sunk a borewell and were trying to set up a petrol pump in the land without the knowledge of Mr. Radhakrishnan. When local people, including the first moneylenders, asked him to return the land to Mr. Radhakrishnan on repayment of loan, he rejected their suggestion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ex-dmk-mla-lodges-cheating-complaint-against-moneylender-with-madurai-sp/article33554401.ece

As per the proposal of Collector K. Senthil Raj, residents living in all local bodies from Corporation to village panchayats and heads of all government offices across the district from the Collectorate to the village panchayat office would ensure the collection of degradable and non-degradable garbage generated on their respective premises on Wednesday (January 13), the Bhogi Day, between 7.30 a.m. and 11 a.m. Moreover, their surroundings should also be cleaned during this time by removing the thorny bushes and the debris, if any, heaped there. While the heads of government offices should monitor it, head of every family and the residents’ welfare association representatives, local body representatives, traders’ bodies, women’s self-help groups, entrepreneurs etc. should actively take part in this exercise, christened ‘Thooimaiyana Thoothukudi’, to ensure the cleanliness of every street in the district. After the garbage in every street and the government office is accumulated in a particular point in the respective area in degradable plastic bags to be given to every family, the local bodies will remove it in the vehicles to be hired for this purpose. “The lorry owners association and the heavy equipment operators have joined hands with the district administration in this noble exercise. Hence, removal of huge thorny bushes, clogged drainage channels and heaped debris will be an easy affair.

It has been a customary practice at the village to hold the bull taming event on the second day of the Tamil month of Thai when ‘Maattu Pongal’ is celebrated. Amid a series of norms stipulated by the State government for holding the event and the restrictions imposed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organisers have completed the preparatory works at the jallikattu venue - a sprawling barren area located ahead of the village. Separate makeshift stages made of metal for accommodating VIPs, officials, press corps and prominent persons of the village have been installed at the venue. Metal barricades have been erected at spots including the bull holding area and ‘vaadivasal’ through which the participating bulls would be allowed one after the other after being subjected to medical examination by the veterinary team. Double barricades have been installed along the bull running arena to a distance of about 400 feet from the ‘vaadivaasl’ to prevent onlookers from entering. There is a separate spot earmarked as the collection point for the animal owners to capture the bulls after being released. The venue has a separate area for tamers who would be allowed to participate only after obtaining a negative report for COVID-19 and checked by medical teams using thermal scanners and breath analysers at the event venue. “The organising committee has completed the preparatory works and spent about Rs. 15 lakh for holding the annual event,” said S. Raja, one of the organisers. The best tamer would go home with a new motorcycle and the best bull would be given a one sovereign gold chain. The number of tamers would be restricted this time in view of the pandemic, he added.

12 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Community libraries will now bring books closer to readers||The Department of Public Libraries has decided to promote community libraries in small residential clusters in urban centres and the first such library was declared open at an apartment complex in Tiruchi last week. Under the initiative, local communities comprising residents of an apartment or gated communities can approach the District Library Officer for establishing the community libraries. The Department would initially provide 500 books (and more, if required) which can be rotated monthly. However, the applicant would have to make a caution deposit of Rs. 20,000 besides providing a room with furniture for the library. The libraries should be run and managed by the local residents. They can fix the library hours depending on their convenience. They can also depute a volunteer such as a retired person to manage a library, though this is not a must. The city’s first community library was declared open at the Rohini Garden Enclave C-Block on Pattabiraman Street in the city recently by Collector S. Sivarasu. Commending the residents of the apartment complex for establishing the library, Mr. Sivarasu underlined the importance of reading books, especially in the mother tongue. He also offered to provide an assistance of Rs. 20,000 for development of the library from the Collector’s discretionary fund. A. P. Sivakumar, District Library Officer, claimed that the city’s first community library was also the first in the State. “The department would seek to promote more such libraries in the city and we have got a few enquiries too,” he said. The department would also encourage the residents to organise regular programmes such as book reviews and competitions for children at the community libraries, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/community-libraries-will-now-bring-books-closer-to-readers/article33554354.ece

A decision to this effect was conveyed to a group of cattle rearers by senior officers led by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) on Friday. A meeting with cattle rearers was held at the behest of the City Police Commissioner J.Loganathan to discuss measures to check accidents and obstructions caused by stray cattle. In a statement issued later in the day, the police said the cattle owners were briefed on measures to be taken to check accidents. They were requested to ensure that all their cattle heads were kept inside confines of their residential premises and not let them out on the streets. They would be held responsible and booked if their cattle heads caused accidents leading to loss of lives or limbs for road users. While asking them to cooperate, the police told them that if they failed to adhere to the directive, the cattle would be impounded and legal action would be initiated against them. The initiative has been welcomed by residents, many of whom have been complaining about stray cattle menace. “It is a welcome move to hold such a meeting and come out with such decisions. All these years, the issue has been highlighted by residents and the media only to get knee jerk reaction from the corporation. It is commendable that the police have acted in the interest of road safety,” K.C.Neelamegam, a city resident and State Advisor of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam, said. Even a few days ago, he said, a professor of a city college sustained injuries after a bovine strayed on to the road unexpectedly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/owners-of-stray-cattle-to-be-held-responsible-for-accidents/article33555112.ece

12 January 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Official removed for distributing old and dying cows to adivasi communities||An official, who is alleged to have overseen a scheme whereby adivasi and Adi Dravidar communities were supplied with free milch cows that were alleged to have been old and beset with health problems, has been relieved from her post, Nilgiris District Collector J. Innocent Divya confirmed to reporters here on Monday. Ms. Divya confirmed that the official had been “relieved” from her post and charges have been framed against her for departmental action. The actions follow after the Collector formed a committee to look into charges of malfeasance that had been brought against the official concerned, whose name has not been disclosed. Informed sources said that on paper, 1,079 cattle were to be distributed to beneficiaries under the scheme to communities across the Nilgiris. The scheme was being implemented by the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department. A tribal rights activist working in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and Gudalur, said that many of the cattle that the communities received were of old-age and were destined for slaughterhouses before being procured and distributed to the communities. “Many of the cattle also died shortly after they were given to the communities while the ones which did survive are too old to produce any milk, which have now become a financial burden to the communities, who have to pay for their maintenance without any financial benefit,” said the activist. A source from the district administration also said that there had been discrepancies in the list of beneficiaries and the cattle that had been distributed. When contacted, Regional Joint Director of the Department of Animal Husbandry, Nilgiris district, Bagavath Singh, said that around 60 of the cattle that were distributed had died from tick infection. Health camps The department was working with the communities to ensure that the cattle which have been distributed are given adequate care. “We are conducting awareness campaigns and health camps where the cattle are being monitored for any signs of disease and treated,” said Mr. Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/official-removed-for-distributing-old-and-dying-cows-to-adivasi-communities/article33554417.ece
12 January 2021||Udhagamandalam,TAMIL NADU||Littering returns to MTR after easing of restrictions on tourism||The littering menace has returned to the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) following an increase in the number of tourists passing through. According to local forest department staff, resorts and guest houses, as well as visitors passing through the reserve are dumping mounds of liquor bottles along the road side within the reserve. “The bottles pose a huge risk to wildlife, including elephants, which can sustain injuries if the animals step on the glass bottles,” explained an MTR staff. The increase in the amount of litter has coincided with the district opening up for tourism once again, officials said. When contacted, MTR Deputy Director (Buffer Zone), L.C.S. Srikanth, said that in the last one month, Rs. 2 lakh in fines have been collected from tourists for a variety of offences, including trespassing into protected forests, disturbing wildlife, illegally exiting their vehicles while inside the reserve and also for littering. MTR has prominent signs throughout the reserve warning tourists about how littering can have an impact on local wildlife. However, catching offenders who break the rules remains a challenge, officials said, as it is almost impossible to find people who litter unless they break the rules in front of forest department staff on patrol duty. The management of the reserve has also stepped up clean-up operations of the reserve, with eco-sanitary watchers being employed to pick up trash discarded by tourists on a more regular basis recently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/littering-returns-to-mtr-after-easing-of-restrictions-on-tourism/article33554421.ece

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Hopes for bumper crop overflow along with dam||In what could be the most soothing news of New Year for farming communities and water managers of Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts, the 62-year-old Manimuthar Dam now overflows with the largest reservoir reaching the maximum capacity of 118 feet. As the 2.80-km-long dam with 5,511 million cubic feet storage capacity overflows after two years, cultivable lands under all four reaches of the reservoir up to Sattankulam in Thoothukudi district are likely to get enough water to recharge groundwater in a big way though more than 50% of farmers in tail-end regions will not go in for cultivation of crops, especially paddy. In Manimuthar irrigation system, having four irrigation areas being fed by as many reaches, water will be released in alternate pattern. If the first two reaches receive water this year, the remaining will get water in the next year. Water will be released in all reaches whenever the dam overflows. When the northeast monsoon started on a dull and delayed note last November, water was released to lands under the third and fourth reaches as it was in the first two reaches in 2019. As water level steadily moved up, farmers with lands under the first two reaches started demanding release of water to their areas too. And water managers assured them that their demand would be fulfilled only if the dam’s storage level became comfortable. Since the dam now overflows, even as intermittent drizzle drenches catchment areas even in January, three of the seven surplus shutters have been opened. Hence, cultivable lands under all four reaches will get water this year. “If the influx of water into the dam which now stands just over 2,000 cusecs, increases substantially, all seven surplus shutters will be opened,” said a senior official of the Public Works Department. Since water from Papanasam Dam has been released since November last for pisanam paddy cultivation, the district is all set to enjoy a bumper harvest this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manimuthar-dam-overflowing/article33554395.ece

A group from O. Duraisamypuram, Chokkalingapuram, A. Kandasamypuram, Thoppampatti, Kalkumi and Aatrankarai, all under Vilaathikulam taluk, arrived at the collectorate on Monday with the damaged crop, said rain at the beginning of monsoon was beneficial for rain-fed crops such as black gram, green gram, maize, corn, chilli, onion and pearl millet. Even as the crops grew well on over 800 hectares, the continuing wet spell played spoilsport. “The continuous rain led to stagnation of water in fields and rotting of the crop, which affected growers, mostly small and marginal ones. Hence, the Collector should order survey of the affected farms at Vilaathikulam taluk,” said T. Raghuraman, vice-president of Aatrankarani village panchayat, who led the petitioners.  SFI petition Members of Students’ Federation of India submitted a petition seeking distribution of free laptops to Plus Two students of 2017-2018 batch.

A group of villagers from Sankaraperi near Kadambur submitted a petition seeking formation of a road adjacent to a railway track to reach Kadambur as the existing one filled with potholes was unmotorable. The existing underpass could not be used to due to stagnant rainwater. Farmers from Kuthiraikulam near Kamanickenpatti under Kayathar taluk and Kurumalai areas submitted petitions separately seeking crop loss insurance benefits for black gram, green gram, corn, maize and pearl millet even though they paid premium for 2019-2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crops-damaged-in-thoothukudi-district/article33554398.ece

The objective behind the programme — designed by Collector V. Vishnu — is to financially uplift the target group by equipping them with skills to create products with more attractive designs and innovation to meet the standards of leading e-commerce platforms. “The legacy of Pathamadai fine mats and the skill sets of the weavers are well-known across the country. Hence, with the expertise of TNSDC and Crafts Council of India, we want the artisans to take a relook at the products and enhance their livelihood through improved sale via modern e-platforms,” says Mr. Vishnu. On Sunday, the Collector inaugurated the training programme funded by SANKALP (Skills Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood) initiative of Union Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship at Pathamadai. Experts from TNSDC and the Union Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship are imparting training in creating attractive designs and new products such as eco-friendly tote bags, wallets and shopping bags. Besides ensuring design intervention, the programme also eyes at imparting digital and financial literacy to 40 beneficiary weavers, who are completely unaware of these aspects. “The beneficiary women weavers are from Lebbai community. Though are experts in mat weaving techniques, they lack digital and financial literacy required to tackle e-commerce platforms on a global basis. Hence, we have also designed modules to make them literate in digital and financial areas,” Mr. Vishnu points out. The Collector has roped in Creative Dignity and Industree Foundation, Bengaluru, as training partners, who mainly focus on design interventions as they are experts in the field, especially in moulding rural artisans. Their design interventions will focus on educating the traditional artisans to produce contemporary products. They will impart financial literacy to cover entrepreneurship and management of business. “Given the importance of e-commerce in the modern era, digital literacy is important. Hence, the programme will focus on educating the artisans about social media and e-commerce platforms and how to sell their products on them,” he adds. A virtual expo was organised to showcase products made by Pathamadai mat weavers for leading companies to facilitate sourcing from the cluster in order to create market linkages and generate livelihood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/training-for-pathamadai-mat-weavers-under-way/article33554400.ece

12 January 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Marathi groups oppose flag in front of corpn.||The controversy created by some Kannada activists erecting a flag pole and unfurling the Kannada flag without due permission in front of the city corporation continues in Belagavi with Marathi groups opposing it. Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti has warned that it will organise an indefinite agitation if the Kannada flag is not removed. MES leaders who held an emergency meeting in the old city early last week argued that the flag was unauthorised and the State government’s silence on such unauthorised acts would result in an increase in such acts. They also threatened to fly the Bhagwa, the saffron flag that they have been using to denote their party since the 1950s, in every street corner, if the Kannada flag was not removed. A delegation of MES leaders, including Deepak Dalvi and Manohar Ashtekar, senior functionaries, met Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath asking him to resolve the issue. He told them that Kannada activists had not accepted his invitation for talks. He also said that he would communicate the concerns of MES to the State government. Kannada activists admit that the flag has been hoisted without permissions. “However, there are provisions in the law that allow the State government to accord retrospective permissions,” argues Srinivas Talukar, who was among the activists who hoisted the flag.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/marathi-groups-oppose-flag-in-front-of-corpn/article33554449.ece

12 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Council ruckus: Law Minister says panel is ‘null and void’||The special committee set up by Legislative Council Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty to inquire into the pandemonium that unfolded in the Council last month seems to be besieged with problems. Close on the heels of BJP MLCs A.H. Vishwanath and S.V. Sankanur withdrawing from the committee, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy on Monday said that the government will not take cognisance of the report submitted by the committee. BJP members quit The Minister said that the BJP does not have anything to do with the committee and termed the committee as “null and void.” Incidentally, the two BJP members withdrew soon after the committee was constituted. Post their withdrawal, the committee has Congress members B.K. Hariprasad and R.B. Thimmapur, and Janata Dal (Secular) member Marithibbe Gowda. Recalling the developments in the Council on December 15 when unprecedented scenes were played out, with ruling BJP and Opposition Congress members fighting over the issue of no confidence motion moved against the Chairman, the Minister said in defence, “The Deputy Chairman was allowed to sit on the seat because the Chairman did not come to the House even after 15 to 20 minutes of the Council had quorum.” For nearly half an hour, scenes of Congress members pulling out the late Dharme Gowda from the chair, while BJP members tried to push him back were witnessed on December 15. The late Deputy Chairman is learnt to have expressed dismay over the incident in his death note, before he allegedly committed suicide.  Meanwhile, Congress MLC P.R. Ramesh maintained that the committee will submit its report in the next 20 days, and requested legislators to cooperate with the committee. As per rules Defending the formation of the committee, Mr. Ramesh said: “It has been formed as per the rules of the House and BJP members are misleading the public with their statements on the issue. The BJP members appear like they are scared.” The Supreme Court has also said that the issue within the House has to be resolved in the House, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/council-ruckus-law-minister-says-panel-is-null-and-void/article33554627.ece
12 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CBSE schools asked to help parents on a case-to-case basis||The Management of Independent CBSE Schools Association (MICSA) has asked its member schools to reach out to parents under stress and provide them help in whatever way they could and devise an action plan to stabilise the situation for children and parents. Only recently, the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS) had asked its member schools affiliated to the State syllabus to reduce the fee by around 20 to 25%. MICSA has sent an advisory to its 200 member schools earlier this week and stated they should extend whatever help they can to parents who are in financial distress. Following this, school managements are examining the situation on a case-to-case basis and are either offering concessions or waiving off fees for a section of the parents. “We need to keep in mind that the situation is not the same for all the parents. It would be a great service to humanity if we could identify parents under stress and reach out to them with whatever help we could extend. This would be a better service than thinking of concessions across the board. It is time that we address individual predicaments,” the association in a letter to the schools has stated. Mansoor Ali Khan, General Secretary, MICSA, said that they had left it to the prerogative of school managements and parents to engage in a dialogue and help parents in anyway they could. “The finances of each school are different and it is best if they devise a strategy to help parents,” he said, and added that there was a need for parents to be transparent about their finances. Many parents had lost jobs or faced salary cuts during the pandemic. As a result, many are unable to pay fees. The association has even suggested that schools “organise voluntary support of parents to compatriots in need”. Ruchitha S., a parent whose child studies in a CBSE-affiliated school, felt this was a viable solution. “Many parents like me who are software engineers have faced no salary cuts can afford to pay the full fees, but some parents who have lost jobs are finding it difficult to pay the fees,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cbse-schools-asked-to-help-parents-on-a-case-to-case-basis/article33554461.ece
12 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BJP is 30% commission govt.: Siddaramaiah||Describing the BJP government in Karnataka as a “30% commission government”, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had either not seen it or was quiet despite knowing it. “Mr. Modi had called my government a 10% commission government even though there was no scam during my tenure,” he said. He was in Hubballi to participate in the Belagavi division-level ‘Sankalpa Samavesh’ of the Congress. He alleged at a press meet that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s son had received Rs. 7.1 crore through RTGS. “Without money, no transfer is being done in this government,” he said.

Meanwhile, addressing party workers, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar emphasised the need for strengthening the party from the booth level. He asked party workers and leaders to “shift from individual worship to party worship.” Mr. Shivakumar elaborated on the change that the party wanted to bring about in the way it was functioning and said that efforts were on to transform the party to cadre based.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-is-30-commission-govt-siddaramaiah/article33554624.ece

12 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC directs inquiry into ‘scandalous’ statement||The Karnataka High Court on Monday directed the chairman of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to hold an inquiry, through a senior officer, on the filing of a statement of objection, in which it was “scandalously” claimed that the Environment Protection Act, 1986, was “passed by the Parliament not only to protect environment but also at the instance of foreign powers.” A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, issued the directions while hearing a PIL petition, filed by the United Conservation Movement Charitable and Welfare Trust, Bengaluru, challenging a 2013 order exempting certain types of highway projects from an environmental impact assessment. The Bench noted that R.B. Pekam, Deputy General Manager (Technical), Regional Office of the NHAI, Bengaluru, has made the claim in the statement of objection filed opposing the PIL and NHAI Counsel R.V. Naik had signed the statement containing the claim that the Act was passed “...also at the instance of foreign powers.” The statement was made while referring to the fact that the Act was enacted following a decision at the United Nations’ conference in 1972. Wondering how the NHAI, which was set up through a law passed by Parliament, could make such a statement, the Bench also directed the NHAI chairman to submit the inquiry report to the court, along with the process followed in filing the statement of objections, and the actions taken against all responsible. The NHAI had said that it was not known whether the petitioner is receiving foreign funds while claiming that many NGOs, allegedly receiving foreign funds, were challenging projects at the instance of foreign powers. The Bench directed the petitioner to disclose details of its constitution, activities, etc. However, the Bench said that did not mean that it was accepting the reckless allegations by the NHAI. After the hearing, the Chief Justice orally said that he had not come across “such an obnoxious documents by a public authority” in his 17 years as a judge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-directs-inquiry-into-scandalous-statement/article33554472.ece

Sharing his pain with the media, coffee grower Manjunath said he could not estimate the loss. “At least 30 to 40 bags of beans have been lost. Well-grown robusta coffee plants have been destroyed. It will require a long time for me to rebuild the farm,” he said. In an appeal to the government, he said it would be impossible for elephants and human beings to coexist. “Capture all the elephants and rehabilitate them. Otherwise, rehabilitate the people from this area. If the government is not in a position to respond to our problems, then let it allow me to end my life,” he said. A group of elephants roaming in the area for the last few days has damaged paddy fields and coffee estates. Officers of the Forest Department visited the area and assessed the loss. Edehalli R. Manjunath, leader of a struggle committee of elephant-affected people, said the government had failed to resolve the problems of farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/distraught-coffee-growers-plea-to-state-govt/article33554473.ece
12 January 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||DC visits farms hit by untimely rains||Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautam and a few other senior officers, on Monday, visited the farms badly by untimely rains in Mudigere taluk.  The Hindu had carried a report on the damage caused to coffee and paddy fields on Monday. The news report had featured A.B. Krishne Gowda, a coffee grower of Attigere near Kottigere, who had suffered a huge loss. The officers visited his farm and interacted with Krishne Gowda. Following the untimely rains, coffee beans had fallen on the ground in his farm. Against the expectation of 200 bags of beans in his five-acre farm, he could hardly get 50 bags. He had estimated the loss at Rs. 6 lakh. Besides him, many growers lost coffee beans spread on drying yards after the harvest. Similarly, paddy growers could not safeguard their yield due to the heavy rains. The team of officers visited Bettagere, Phalguni, Tatkola, and Mugravalli villages in Mudigere taluk. They assured the farmers that the officers would conduct a survey on the loss suffered and submit a report to the State government. Mudigere tahsildar H.M. Ramesh accompanied the DC in the visit.  In some areas, the untimely rains have caused early flowering in coffee estates. Normally, flowering happens in March. “This time flowering has happened in January itself. This is the first time I am noticing this in my place”, said Srinivasa Murthy, a small grower at Mudagodu near Sringeri. Early flowering affects the yield in the next harvest season, besides forcing the farmers to spend more money to keep the plants healthy.“Normally, the harvest is done between December and January. Because of the early flowering, beans will ripen by November. The yield would be less. he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dc-visits-farms-hit-by-untimely-rains/article33554611.ece
12 January 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Belagavi division-level Sankalpa Samavesh organised in Hubballi||Emphasising on the need to strengthen the party at the booth-level, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar conveyed a strong message to party workers and leaders asking them to maintain discipline in the party, work among the people. Addressing party workers and leaders at the Belagavi Division level ‘Sankalpa Samavesh’ in Hubballi, Mr. Shivakumar elaborated on the change that the party wanted to bring about in its functioning and said that efforts were on to transform the party from a mass-based to a cadre-based one. He said that it would not be enough if some gathered at a place and made speeches. “The history of Congress itself is agitation. Congress has fought for preserving the unity, integrity and diversity of the country and taking it on the path of progress. The workers and leaders should remember this. However big a leader might be, he or she should take the responsibility from the booth level and the party has taken this decision,” he said. He categorically stated that indiscipline and unnecessary comments from leaders, however big they might be, would not be tolerated. “Whoever you are, if don’t want to function within the framework of the party, you can choose your path. Discipline is must in Congress,” he said. He stressed that the workers should create opportunities for themselves by working among people. “If you want to become a leader, you should have the fighting spirit and that should be identified by the people. Only then can you become a leader,” he said asking the office-bearers to express themselves and give suggestions at the convention.  On the nationwide agitation planned in support of the farmers on January 20, he called on the workers and leaders to bring farmers and fellow workers to Freedom Park in Bengaluru for the agitation. Mr. Shivakumar said that committees would be set up at the panchayat and ward level and subsequently booth level too. On changes within, he said that old officebearers would be promoted and newcomers would be given opportunities. There would also be a change in the manner in which meetings and functions would be held and there would be ‘no stage culture’, he said appealing to the workers to bring back those who had left the party apart from welcoming those who believed in the party’s ideology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-division-level-sankalpa-samavesh-organised-in-hubballi/article33554468.ece
12 January 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Only those who work for the people will get party ticket: Shivakumar||Lambasting the BJP-led government in the State, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar on Monday said that those in the BJP were shameless people and as the government had lost its eyes and ears, it was not responding to the hardships of farmers. Speaking to presspersons after participating in the Sankalpa Samavesh in Hubballi, he gave details about what the Congress planned to do to strengthen the party from the booth level. He clarified that only those who worked for the people and responded to their problems would be considered for party ticket. “We will not give party ticket if anyone comes and seeks it ahead of elections. It not only applies to Assembly elections but also to taluk and zilla panchayat elections. Those who have done good work in the constituencies and who are active will be given ticket for the Assembly elections,” he said He said that from the next month he and party leaders will tour the constituencies with focus on those segments where the party had lost. Cultural organisations, cooperative societies and drivers and other associations will be established to further strengthen the party, he said. Block offices Mr. Shivakumar said that it has been conveyed to party MLAs that they should not hold meetings in their residences. Instead, meetings should be held at block offices of the party and instructions have been given to set up block offices wherever they did not exist, he said. He said that there was a lot of difference between facing elections when in power and when not in power. “Wait till the results of the next elections. There is no groupism in the party and all will unitedly plough the field,” he said. To a query, Mr. Shivakumar said it has been decided to term 2021 as “year of agitation” and programmes will be chalked out to work in close coordination with people and to work amid them. He said that those who wanted to be elected representatives should first begin with social service and work for strengthening the party. Some of the party leaders have become dull and steps are being taken to wake them up and make them active. The work of every leader will also be reviewed, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-those-who-work-for-the-people-will-get-party-ticket-shivakumar/article33554458.ece

Criticising the Congress, the former Chief Minister said that the Congress leaders were making baseless allegations and criticising BJP leaders in the State as they did not have any genuine issue to raise. “The Congress has degenerated in the State and disunity is ruling the roost. The fight between Siddaramaiah and D.K. Shivakumar [KPCC president] has reached its peak. Let the Congress leaders correct themselves before pointing their fingers to others,” he said. Speaking to mediapersons in Kalaburagi later in the day, Mr. Shettar said that six-seven people will be inducted into the Council of Ministers in the State. “The expansion or reconstitution of Council of Ministers is a prerogative of the Chief Minister. Mr. Yediyurappa met national leaders in Delhi and discussed the issue in detail. As the Chief Minister himself said, six-seven people are expected to be inducted into the Cabinet. The Chief Minister would shortly announce the number of new faces and their names,” he said. ‘I’m an aspirant’ Meanwhile, in his interaction with media, Sedam MLA Rajkumar Patil Talkur said that he was also an aspirant for a Cabinet post. “I have been working for the party for the last 20 years and effectively handled all responsibilities entrusted to me. None from Kalaburagi district is in the Cabinet this time. I have met the Chief Minister and requested him to include at least one from the district in the Cabinet. I hope that I will get a place in the Cabinet,” Mr. Telkur said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-does-not-have-any-genuine-issue-to-raise-shettar/article33554452.ece

12 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||BSY attacks Siddaramaiah||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday attacked former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah over his remarks on consuming beef. Though he did not name Mr. Siddaramaiah, the Chief Minister said the “Congress leader from Mysuru was going around behaving as though that consumption of beef was a big achievement”. Mr. Yediyurappa was speaking after inaugurating the Jan Sevak programme organised by the BJP to felicitate the recently elected gram panchayat members. Mr .Yediyurappa addressed the former Chief Minister in singular and added that it does not befit him to speak about such people. He said such irresponsible statements are repeatedly made by the Congress leader to provoke the BJP and the media expects a response for the same from the BJP leaders. However, he said there was no need for the BJP leaders to respond to such provocations. “Let us reply to the people by doing work”, he said. He wondered what was the need for them to talk about Congress when the party was neither in power at the Centre nor in the State. He said the BJP’s central leadership was happy over the party winning more gram panchayat seats and expressed optimism of the party performing well in the coming taluk panchayat and zilla panchayat elections. The party expects to win 140 to 150 seats in the next elections to the Legislative Assembly in the State. ‘Congress arrogant’ BJP’s State pPresident Nalin Kumar Kateel, who claimed that the BJP had won the most number of seats in the gram panchayat elections, said the Congress was done in by its arrogance. The Congress forgot Mahatma Gandhi’s concept of Gram Swaraj, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi was trying to implement Gandhiji’s ideals. Similarly, the Congress ‘forgot’ B.R. Ambedkar after winning elections. Former Minister and Chamarajanagar MP V. Srinivas Prasad said people’s representatives should also become “sevaks” of the people. He said the efforts of Mr. Yediyurappa and Mr. Nalin Kumar Kateel were responsible for the good performance of the party in the gram panchayat elections. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha said the victory of BJP leaders in the gram panchayat elections was crucial to create awareness about the programmes of Central and State government among the people in rural areas. A host of leaders including Minister for Cooperation S.T. Somashekar, who is also the Minister in charge of Mysuru district; A.H. Vishwanath, MLC; S.A. Ramdas, L. Nagendra, Harshavardhan, MLAs; former MP C.H. Vijayshankar, BJP’s Mysuru City unit president Srivatsa; and the party’s Mysuru district unit president Mangala Somashekar were present on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bsy-attacks-siddaramaiah/article33554614.ece

Kempanna, a retired judge of the court, complained that he has not been provided with sufficient infrastructure to discharge his duties as Claims Commissioner to assesses the damage caused to properties during the violence in D.J. Halli-K.G. Halli on August 11, 2020. Interestingly, the High Court had appointed Mr. Kempanna as the Claims Commissioner on a batch of PIL petitions, including one filed by the State government on August 19, seeking appointment of a Commissioner to assess the damage in terms of the Supreme Court’s guidelines to assess and recover damages caused during such incidents. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, which took note of the letter written by Mr. Kempanna, observed that the government had “miserably failed” in providing infrastructure due to “gross negligence” by officials despite several directions issued by the court since October 2020 in this regard. Orally observing that “it is unfortunate that a retired judge was forced to write a letter”, the bench directed the Chief Secretary to immediately meet Mr. Kempanna, discuss the infrastructure required, and ensure that the Commission would commence effective functioning from January 18. In his letter addressed to the Registrar (Judicial), Mr. Kempanna had said that besides not providing sufficient infrastructure, the government has not sent various notifications issued on appointment of staff, etc., while pointing out the requirement for creation of certain posts, like secretary and section officer, for discharging his duties as Claims Commissioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dj-halli-violence-hc-pulls-up-government/article33554836.ece

Vishwanath sought to remind Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa of the role he (Mr. Vishwanath) played to help him occupy the post of Chief Minister. Speaking to reporters after Mr. Yediyurappa said a decision had been taken to expand the Cabinet on January 13 or 14, Mr. Vishwanath said it was the prerogative of the Chief Minister on whom to induct into the Ministry. “But, before he exercises his prerogative, he should remember who made him the Chief Minister and give everybody an opportunity”, the BJP MLC said. When asked if he had approached Mr. Yediyurappa with a request to induct him into the Ministry, he said he cannot repeatedly meet the Chief Minister with the same request. “He should not forget who were in the forefront of the efforts to help him (become the Chief Minister). He should reciprocate.” To a question, Mr. Vishwanath said he chose to resign from the House Committee constituted to go into the ruckus that broke out in the Legislative Council recently because the Committee also comprised those who were involved in the trouble that rocked the House. Asked about his next course of action if he is not accommodated in the Ministry, Mr. Vishwanath said he has been made an MLC and nobody can dislodge him from the post for another six years. Meanwhile, former Minister S.A. Ramdas said he will accept the decision taken by the party leadership on Cabinet expansion. Though he said he is ready to discharge any ministerial responsibility, if given, he made it clear that he will not complain if he is not accommodated in the Ministry. “I will continue to do my work.” Asked about the absence of representation to Mysuru district in the ministry, Mr. Ramdas said it was left to the party leadership to answer the question. “Mr. Yediyurappa is like the captain of the team. He will choose the players to provide a good administration for the next two-and-a half years.” Former Minister and MLA representing Kollegal Y. Mahesh, who has been expelled from the BSP, said he was extending support to Mr. Yediyurappa, but he does not think he will be provided a berth in the Ministry. However, he said would discharge his responsibility honestly and facilitate development in his constituency if he is accommodated.   Vishwanath says before exercising his prerogative in ministry induction, Chief Minister should give everybody an opportunity.  He also says nobody can dislodge him from the MLC post for another six years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ahead-of-cabinet-expansion-vishwanath-again-rakes-up-portfolio-issue/article33554619.ece

Liju on Monday slammed the Communist Party of India (Marxist) {CPI (M)} for its decision to reject the support of Congress party in Chennithala Thripperumthura grama panchayat. Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Liju said that the decision showed the unholy nexus between the CPI (M) and the BJP. Seats won In the local body elections held earlier, both the UDF and BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won six seats each, whereas the LDF got four seats in Chennithala Thripperumthura, the home panchayat of Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala. The post of president in the local body is reserved to Scheduled Caste woman. As the UDF did not have a Scheduled Caste woman member, its members had voted for Vijayamma P., of the CPI(M) in the election to the president post last month. The DCC president said that its members had voted for the CPI(M) candidate to keep the BJP away from power in the local body. “The CPI (M) leaders involved in criminal cases want the help of the BJP-led Union government to clear their names. By rejecting the Congress’s support, the CPI(M) is paving the way for the BJP to attain power in some of the grama panchayats in the district,” Mr. Liju said. Earlier, the CPI(M) decided to ask the Chennithala Thripperumthura grama panchayat president to step down from the post. The party’s district leaders said that it was averse to accepting the support of Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dcc-slams-cpims-move-to-deny-cong-support/article33554575.ece

Forest officials have also set up 20 camera traps and three cages. The tiger had attacked a forest range officer on Sunday and killed three domestic animals in the human habitation in the past week. Many local people have reportedly seen the tiger in the area. Though fresh pug marks were seen, no images were captured by camera traps set up at the site after the incident, said D.K. Vinod Kumar, Chief Conservator of forest (Northern circle) Kannur. The nine teams, each consisting of six frontline forest staff, will conduct round-the-clock search, block main roads, and control mob in the area with the support of the police, the official added. “We searched around two sq km from the area the animal was last seen. The operation went on from 9.30 a.m. to 4 p.m., but we could not find the animal,” Mr. Vinod Kumar said.  “However fresh pug marks were seen on the banks of the Kabani river, nearly 300 metres from the Bandipur tiger reserve. It shows that the animal may have escaped to its habitat. The search, however, will continue on Tuesday,” he added. As many as 70 forest personnel participated in the combing. Wayanad Wildlife Warden S. Narendra Babu, Assistant Conservator of Forest V. Rajan, and Divisional Forest Officer, Vigilance, P. Dhanesh kumar, coordinated the operations . The forest officials have requested the Wayanad district administration to invoke Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) as part of intensifying combing operations on Tuesday.

Prashanth, Assistant Executive Engineer, PWD National Highway, the highway is being upgraded with cold milling and recycling technology. “The first phase of work on the Thana-Thazhe Chovva stretch and the Edakkad Pump-Dharmadam Bridge stretch has already been completed. Only smoothing of the road surface is pending,” he said. Mr. Prashanth said that 80% of the work on the Thana-Dharmadam national highway had already been completed. The cold milling work was completed by January 5. The final layering work on the first stretch from Caltex to Thazhe Chovva was in its final stages. Work to strengthen the 17-km stretch of the national highway from Thana to Dharmadam Bridge, undertaken at a cost of Rs. 27.91 crore, started on December 18. The 3.56-km stretch from Thana to Thazhe Chovva Gate and the 6.44-km stretch from Edakkad Pump to Dharmadam Bridge were strengthened using cold milling and recycling technology.  The method of laying the road was to dig to a depth of 7.5 cm using an existing tarring machine, add the required amount of metal, cement and foam bitumen, and recycle it immediately. “Eighty-five per cent of the materials have been recycled. Only 15% of the materials are used externally,” he said. He pointed out that the main advantage of the technology was that environmental impact could be greatly reduced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thana-dharmadam-nh-likely-to-be-opened-soon/article33554502.ece

However, overflowing septic tanks at the hospital are giving nightmare to residents in the area. Residents said no step had been taken to solve the issue that started weeks ago. They also staged a protest on Sunday to bring the issue to the notice of the authorities. Abdul Khader Mallam, who stays near the hospital, said the residents came to know about the issue after streams in the area got contaminated and a foul smell emanated in the area after rains. He said it posed a health threat to residents. U. Karunakaran, another resident, said 15 to 20 families staying close to the hospital were living in fear. “The hospital is situated in an elevated area and the water leaking through septic tanks is flowing down during rain,” he added. Congress leaders in the area visited the hospital and shared their concerns with the Health Department and the administration. Uduma block Congress secretary Sukumaran Poochakad said immediate action should be taken to fix the issue. District Medical Officer A.V.

A meeting chaired by T.J. Vinod, MLA, to take stock of the renovation work asked Kerala Electrical and Allied Engineering Company Limited (KEL), the implementing agency, to wrap up the remaining work in the next three weeks. The renovation funded by Rs. 4 crore sanctioned by the Department of Tourism got under way in April 2018. The work was scheduled to be completed in 2019 but got delayed owing to reasons ranging from deluge, change of contractor midway through the work, and the pandemic. Among the works to be completed include renovation of the recreation pond for pedal boating for which the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) will initially buy five pedal boats. Mr. Vinod promised to set up a high-mast light in the middle of the park using his MLA Local Area Development Funds. “It was also decided to invite tenders for renovating the now-defunct musical fountain and set up a medium-sized water theme park. It will be done on the design, build, operate, and transfer model, and the operator will share the revenue with the DTPC and the District Council for Child Welfare (DCCW),” said S. Vijayakumar, Secretary, DTPC. New entrance Meanwhile, officials of Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) said the construction of the new entrance to the park and fencing would be completed in a fortnight. Around 17 works, including deployment of modern gaming equipment, solar energy park, setting up of CCTVs, renovation of toilets, and provision for drinking water, are being done at the park. Work on the solar park is likely to be completed soon. A team led by Mr. Vinod recently visited the park and reviewed the progress of work.

12 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Bringing students back to normal schooling||The unprecedented break from normal schooling seems to have adversely affected a sizeable section of students who may now need rigorous reorientation to return to the fold. It was one of the patterns noticed by teachers and counsellors attached to the Career Guidance and Adolescence Counselling Cell of the General Education Department as Class 10 and Plus Two students returned to school after a prolonged break ahead of their exams. “A little bit of anxiety while returning to normal classrooms ahead of exams is, in fact, a positive sign, which means that they [students] care about their performance. But there is another section who seems to be so casual and lazy that they do not seem to care. They will have to be reoriented and brought back to normal schooling through sustained emotional support and other assistance,” said C.M. Azeem, State coordinator of the cell. A two-day training for teachers by mental health experts sought to address the issue by focusing on a smooth transition from digital to classroom learning and performing in exams while living with the pandemic. Some students, especially in the higher secondary classes, have taken up part-time jobs while screen addiction has emerged as another major problem among a section of students. Break effects “As the World Health Organisation and the UNESCO have pointed out, the prolonged break may impact long-term development of students, leading to increased drop-outs and, in case of girls, even being married off, lack of motivation, academic backwardness etc. This may hamper the quality of the future generations, though Kerala remains better placed compared to other States in coping with the issue,” said Anilkumar T.V., professor, department of psychiatry, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. He led one of the training sessions for 1,500-odd teachers. “Screen addiction could also affect the sleep structure and, by extension, the biological clock. Hitting the bed after excessive screen time will drive away sleep, to beat which they again return to the screen and thus get caught in that vicious cycle that will also affect their concentration levels. The anxiety surrounding the pandemic also affects students,” said Dr. Anilkumar. He added that there could be no common time frame for bringing back the affected students to the fold. “Some can overcome it soon, while it takes longer for some others. It depends on their coping abilities, perceptions, and social and emotional support,” said Dr. Anilkumar. Solution-based approach The focus is on a solution-based approach rather than emphasising on problems. Students should be reminded of their inner strength and capabilities and the support mechanism available for them to deal with their issues. However, some students may be depressed and it is critical to identify that and facilitate professional help beyond school counsellors and even medications if needed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bringing-students-back-to-normal-classes-a-challenge/article33554972.ece

K. Kamanees, Special Judge of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Court, who allowed a petition filed by the agency in this regard, also notified these 10 as protected witnesses. The court also ordered that the names and addresses of these witnesses shall not surface in any of the orders, judgments and records of the case which are accessible to the public. The NIA will supply in two weeks, a fresh set of case documents for sharing with the counsel of the accused after removing all the references that could expose the identity of the witnesses. NIA cites threat to life In its petition, the NIA had submitted that there was impending threat to the life of these witnesses considering the status of the accused and the possibility of them threatening and winning over the witnesses. The witnesses required the support of law to depose before the court freely and faithfully, it submitted. The agency also submitted that the accused were affluent persons having high connections in the world of crime who could manipulate and harass the witnesses to have the evidence turned around. It feared that the accused shall threaten the witnesses who were malleable, to obtain adverse evidence against the prosecution. The court ordered that no statements of the 10 witnesses and the documents which could reveal their identity shall be supplied to the accused or their advocates, at this stage, considering the sensitivity of the case. It noted that it was a case where the vulnerability of the witnesses had to be taken note of, considering the status of the accused, their affluence and the general nature of allegations levelled against them. Statements to be effaced Besides the statements of protected witnesses, the confessional statements of the protected witnesses shall be effaced. The references to the protected witnesses shall be blacked out from the copies of the charge sheet as well as other records also, it ordered.

12 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Busting cliches about government offices, with a green thumb||A well-kept garden complete with a water lily pond is perhaps the last thing one associates with a government office. But that is exactly what welcomes visitors at the Malayattoor village office, thanks to the efforts of village officer P.T. Unnikrishnan, who loves to bust the cliché about government offices. He set up the garden over three cents on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti last year, when he along with his staff toiled for 12 hours to beautify not just the exterior but the office interiors as well. “The garden gives positive vibes to employees and the public coming to the office, not to mention the personal satisfaction. I tend to it daily either by coming early to the office or staying back after office hours,” said Mr. Unnikrishnan, who was equally proactive during his stints at Mookkannoor and Asamannoor village offices with his organic farming initiatives. But it is not just appearances that Mr. Unnikrishnan is determined to change, but the more significant service delivery system as well. He personally supervises a meticulous register maintenance system, which in a village office is usually the preserve of a clerk, realising that prompt access to documents is at the heart of efficient service delivery in a government office. “That updated subject-wise register is the hard work of 16 days and is now on my table all the time. My fellow village officers used to ask how I manage the system amidst the hectic schedule. It is a bit tough, but then, where there is a will there is a way,” said Mr. Unnikrishnan who joined Malayattoor village office last August. While certificates are now largely issued through common service centres, people still drop in at village offices to know the status of their applications processed online. “There is the possibility of the laptop freezing, the network being very slow or power outage making a status update impossible when an applicant walks in. To overcome such a scenario, we maintain a register of the status of online applications so that we can update the applicant with the exact date on which the application was processed, cleared, or declined with the reasons thereof and whether the certificate is ready for issue,” he said. Mr. Unnikrishnan has also been offering free coaching in English and general knowledge for PSC exam candidates. Breaking into nine different rank lists during his PSC training days and the years put in as an English tutor before he eventually joined the service in 1998 have stood him in good stead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/busting-clichs-about-govt-offices-with-a-green-thumb/article33554971.ece
12 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Assault: HC displeased with DIG’s investigation||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday expressed its unhappiness with a report filed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police(Prisons) after inquiring into the alleged manhandling of Tittu Jerome, a life convict in the Kevin murder case, by the officers of the Central Prison, Thiruvananthapuram. The Bench comprising Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice M.R. Anitha observed that it was dissatisfied with the report of the DIG in which there was a prima facie attempt to “safeguard the prison personnel who are involved in the alleged incident of torture inflicted on the inmates of the Central Prison”. The court pointed out that the report indicated that the complaints raised by the convicts were in retaliation to an inquiry ordered by the Prison officials into the smuggling in of liquor on the prison premises. The court also noted that the report of the Medical Officer, Central Prison, did not indicate whether convicts were subjected to any torture or they had suffered any injury. The report said that external general examination of Tittu and Shinu, two convicts had not revealed any visible injury. This was quite contrary to the report filed by the consultant physician and junior consultant physician who examined them at 4 p.m. on the same day after the examination of the medical officer. The court directed the DGP Prisons to conduct an inquiry into the revealing of the contents of the report by the DIG to the media and file a report in two weeks. When the petition came up for hearing, the Government pleader submitted that the erring jail officials had been transferred from the Central Prison as part of disciplinary proceedings. The court also directed the Commissioner of Police, Thiruvananthapuram, to immediately produce the convict, now admitted to the Medical College before the jurisdictional magistrate who should record the oral statement of the convicts and should take further steps.

12 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Container ro-ro ferry conducts trial run||A trial run of the proposed container roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) ferry service in the Willingdon Island-Bolghatty Island corridor was held on Monday, with one of the two vessels built at the Cochin Shipyard operating in the corridor. City-based Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC), which operates a pair of ro-ro ferries in the Fort Kochi-Vypeen route, has been vested with the task of operating the two vessels, the capital cost of which was borne by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI).  Transporting passengers The container ro-ro ferry service will transport commuters and motorists too on board, unlike a private firm that ferried container-laden lorries on the corridor till it fell out with the Cochin Port Trust over the quantum of security deposit and withdrew service a couple of years ago. The trial run was held using one of the two brand new ro-ro vessels. It took about 30 minutes to cover the distance, as compared to over one-and-a-half hours that lorries would take if they took the road route. A formal inauguration of the service, which was slated to be done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi a month ago, was postponed after it came to light that it was difficult for lorries of a particular manufacturer to be driven into the vessels. Fault rectified The fault was hence rectified, said official sources. A few container lorries were ferried during the trial run, although there was no formal announcement. “We will shortly announce the timings, so that lorry operators can bank on our reliability,” said Prasanth N., Managing Director of KSINC. “The ro-ro ferry service is a good opportunity for stakeholders to decongest roads in the city, including the congested NH Bypass and Seaport-Airport Road which are relied on by container-laden lorries and other heavy vehicles. Monday’s trial run was a success and the service will hopefully begin formal operations in a week or two. Congestion and pollution in city roads will come down if lorries and even smaller vessels avail the waterway route between the two islands, providing much-needed breathing space in Kochi,” he added. Each of the container ro-ro ferries is 56-m-long, 13.50-m-wide and has the capacity to carry weight up to 375 tonnes. The KSINC has announced the fare for commuters and different types of vehicles in the corridor — passengers Rs. 10; two-wheelers Rs. 30; autorickshaws and car shorter than 4 m Rs. 120 to Rs. 150, depending on their load; bigger cars and cargo autos Rs. 150 to Rs. 200; pick-up vans and mini-tippers Rs. 250 to Rs. 300; mini bus Rs. 300 to Rs. 400; and trucks Rs. 450 to Rs. 1,200, depending on their capacity. Hand brakes All vehicles must have their hand brake on while being ferried and the driver must be in the driver’s seat throughout the journey. The fares were arrived at on the basis of operation and maintenance cost of the two vessels. The KSINC did not get government subsidy or viability gap funding, said official sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/container-ro-ro-ferry-conducts-trial-run/article33554578.ece
12 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kochi’s iconic park has never remained closed for so long||The Children’s Park, as the Indira Priyadarshini Children’s Traffic Training Park is popularly known, has never remained closed for so long, nearly three years now, since its inception in 1973. The park, closed for renovation in 2018, is spread over five acres in the heart of the city, and is owned by the District Council for Child Welfare (DCCW). It is governed by an 11-member elected governing body with the District Collector as chairman and assistant development commissioner as secretary, both ex-officio members. “A largely neglected small park owned by the corporation was handed over to us on our request. We then developed it, the credit for which should largely go to the late Bhaskaran Nair, who was so passionate about the project that he chose to serve as the park superintendent despite being a deputy collector and even slept at the park overnight,” recollected S. Chandrasenan, vice-president and long-serving member of DCCW governing committee. He recalled how the late superintendent used to go around shops on Broadway, seeking sponsors to even replace faulty lights in the park. “There used to be a monkey in the park in those days and he unfailingly served him milk daily,” Mr. Chandrasenan chuckled. While the park witnessed periodic repair works, it was never closed to visitors with the last major renovation being witnessed in 2002 when the Department of Tourism set up a recreation pond for boating and musical fountain in the park. Previously, a boat jetty stood where the pond was dug later. Shyamalakshmi S., secretary of the DCCW, said some renovation works were carried out by the Kerala State Nirmithi Kendra in the 90s. In the past, the park had traffic signals regulating the movement of toy vehicles, and traffic cops used to drop in for imparting traffic lessons to children. But that gradually stopped as the police found it hard to spare officials. ‘Move to politicise’ Mr. Chandrasenan recollected an attempt to politicise the running of the park in the past by inducting political nominees into the governing body. “We got the move stalled by the High Court and the judge had even made a scathing observation about the attempt while disposing of the case,” said Mr. Chandrasenan, who had argued the case on behalf of a governing body member who had petitioned the court. Till some two years before the park was closed for renovation in 2018, it was open to all on taking the entry tickets whereafter entry was restricted to children under the age of 10 and parents accompanying them alone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochis-iconic-park-has-never-remained-closed-for-so-long/article33554975.ece
12 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Police moot plans to decongest Vyttila||Faced with no let-up in traffic congestion at Vyttila even after the six-lane flyover was commissioned at the junction on Saturday, the Traffic Police handed over a list of recommendations to the PWD (NH wing), which included minor redesign of the roundabout and traffic islands, in order to streamline the flow of vehicles which converge at the junction from six roads. This comes in the wake of criticism that the flyover caters to the flow of vehicles in just two of the 16 directions in which they move at the junction which is spread over 80 metres. The list of recommendations and drawings by the police was handed over to PWD at a meeting in which officials of both agencies participated. Signal system A senior official of the PWD (NH wing) said that altering the time cycle in the signal system in keeping with traffic pattern would bring some respite in the snarls at the junction. For this, the police must do a traffic study, he said. This alone would not be enough, said a senior Traffic Police official. “We have recommended that 1/3 of the roundabout at the junction must be dismantled to create more space for vehicles from the Palarivattom side waiting to turn towards SA Road. This will, in turn, open up space for vehicles wanting to turn towards Vyttila Mobility Hub and the free-left turn towards Thripunithura. In addition, the right-angled edge of the traffic island has to be shaped at a slanting angle so that vehicles from the Alappuzha side can easily turn right towards Thripunithura.” The triangle shaped island near the roundabout too must be adequately pruned. The PWD must also erect sign boards at the entry to the flyover on the Palarivattom side and further south to segregate motorists who come along the NH Bypass to occupy the fast track and those that join the bypass from the adjacent service road to occupy the slow track, in order to prevent time wastage caused when vehicles criss cross each other and to ensure that only vehicles wanting to turn right to SA Road occupy the fast track. Widening stretch The long-term plans that the police have suggested include widening of the 100-metre stretch located north of the turning towards Kaniampuzha Road, since it is extremely narrow and does not have space even for two lanes. The PWD or NHAI (which owns NH Bypass and service roads) must also extend service roads on the northern side of Vyttila by a few metres where a new underpass, wide enough for two-way traffic, can be readied. The existing narrow underpass too must be widened if possible, since it would still hold the key to the smooth flow of vehicles in the east-west direction, police sources said. The curbs on direct entry of vehicles from SA Road to Mobility Hub and Thripunithura and turning off of four signal posts will remain for another week, when a full fledged traffic plan is expected to be rolled out. A decision on traffic movement along RSAC Road too will be taken then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-recommend-structural-changes-to-decongest-vyttila/article33554983.ece
12 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Frequent water supply disruptions leave Cheranalloor residents livid||In the last four years since he moved into his new house at Cheranalloor panchayat, Liyons Jos was forced to make several unplanned visits to his in-laws’ house at Palarivattom, courtesy the frequent drinking water supply disruptions at his home. The latest such visit was on Sunday when his water tank dried up following days-long supply disruption. “We have a four-year-old daughter and it is not possible to live without water, forcing us to shift to Palarivattom. This frequent shifting is so frustrating,” said Mr. Jos. The tale is no different for the majority of residents of the panchayat bordering the Kochi Corporation. The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) officials admitted to the problem, attributing it to the location of the panchayat along the tail end of the supply line. “Any disruption in the Aluva water treatment plant affects the supply in Cheranalloor and lingers even after the pumping is resumed. It takes days before the supply gets stabilised in that part,” said a senior KWA official. He cited as a potential solution the proposal under Rebuild Kerala for laying a dedicated supply line from the Thammanam pump house at an investment of Rs. 21 crore, for which administrative sanction has already been received. The latest supply disruption, which is yet to be fully restored, was the result of a day-long shutdown of the Aluva treatment plant on January 8. Illegal tapping Benny Francis, a panchayat member, said it took more than a fortnight for the water supply to be normalised after every disruption in Aluva. “When supply dries up, people illegally dig into the supply line or mount hand pumps to suck out the water. This further deteriorates the problem and necessitates the intervention of the maintenance wing of the KWA to remove the air blocks created in its wake. Even during normal times, the pressure of water supply is so feeble,” he said. Frequent protests So acute has the problem been over the years that protests at the KWA office have become a common affair for the elected representatives of the panchayat who get bombarded with complaints from the public. They hope that the proposed overhead tank and pumping station at Ponekkara under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation will resolve the perennial problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/frequent-water-supply-disruptions-leave-cheranalloor-residents-livid/article33554984.ece

12 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Education Department’s YouTube channel to stay||The prolonged closure and uncertainty over the reopening of schools in the wake of the pandemic is what forced the Career Guidance and Adolescence Counselling Cell of the General Education Department to switch to the online platform and launch a YouTube channel to reach out to students, parents, and counsellors last year. That perceived obstacle seems to have turned out to be a blessing in disguise in hindsight, with the cell enhancing its reach like never before, prompting the department to make the stopgap arrangement a permanent feature for its future campaigns. “We were never able to impart training to all of our 3,000-odd counsellors owing to logistical reasons in the past and often had to restrict it to a few hundreds at a time. But this time, we could cover the entire base during a five-day comprehensive training, besides another two-day training on giving exam-related tips to students. We are now planning to organise both online and offline sessions simultaneously in the future,” said C.M. Azeem, State coordinator, Career Guidance and Adolescent Counselling Cell. The cell has 1,650 ‘Souhruda’ coordinators in higher secondary schools, 900 high school counsellors, 1,650 career guides, and 350 career masters in vocational higher secondary schools. Souhruda clubs were set up in schools a decade ago for adolescent counselling and health care. Good reach The online reach, both through Zoom and the YouTube channel, also helped the cell maximise participation this time for Disha, the annual higher studies expo, with over 4.50 lakh participants, while the previous biggest participation when it was held offline was over 45,000 the year before. The event familiarises students with various courses and reputed higher education institutes, besides facilitating interactions with experts from diverse disciplines. It was held in November-December and hence proved timely, since it coincided with the invitation of applications by some premium institutes. Sessions helping students and parents chart career plans are usually held at the opening of Plus One classes, and life skill training by teachers trained by experts from the Bengaluru-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences, training sessions for 3,300 student leaders across 1,650 schools, civil services exam training, training for effective adolescent parenting, and training for teachers on shifting from online to offline mode are among the online sessions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/education-departments-youtube-channel-to-stay/article33555111.ece

The Special Court considering the case approved the schedule for examining the witnesses in the coming days. Going by the present schedule, around 120 witnesses will be examined till March 3. The examination of Kavya Madhavan, wife of actor Dileep, the eighth accused, and his friend and filmmaker Nadirsha will be held on January 28 and February 3 respectively.

A batch of petitions, including the plea of the prosecution for cancelling the bail of Dileep for allegedly violating the bail conditions and trying to influence a witness,are pending before the court. Special Public Prosecutor V. N. Anilkumar sought time to go through the petition for the cancellation of Dileep’s bail, which was filed by his predecessor A. Sureshan. Incidentally, Dileep moved a petition on Monday to bring Vipinlal, a witness who turned approver in the case, back to custody. Vipinlal had unauthorisedly got out of the jail.

Speaking at a function organised to distribute financial support to beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)-LIFE Mission project, Mr. Anilkumar said welfare measures for the poor were among the focus areas of the civic administration. The activities of the Kudumbashree Mission should be streamlined and extended to new sectors, he said. Initially, the financial aid for a beneficiary of the PMAY scheme was Rs. 2.50 lakh, which was pooled by the State and the Central governments and the local bodies. The beneficiary contribution was fixed at Rs. 50,000. However, with the LIFE Mission project announced by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, the total aid for an individual beneficiary was revised to Rs. 4 lakh, by increasing the contribution of the State government. The beneficiary contribution was also done away with, said the statement issued by the Mayor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/civic-body-will-support-the-homeless-says-mayor/article33554980.ece

The arrested man was identified as Sabu, who allegedly committed the crime in the early morning hours of January 9. The police said that he feigned to be a destitute by lying down in front of the shop and clandestinely broke the lock of the shutter to sneak in. He was caught in the CCTV mounted in the shop and that helped the police to track him down. He took to his heels after he landed in front of a patrolling team on Sunday night. However, he was chased down and was later produced in court. A team led by North Station House Officer Sibi Tom, sub inspector V. B.

George, MLA, has stepped up the attempts to join the Congress-led coalition ahead of the Assembly elections. Official sources said Mr. George was keen to field a candidate in Pala if Kerala Congress (M) leader Jose K. Mani contests from the seat, besides retaining the Poonjar constituency. A couple of community organisations, including the Catholic Church, are likely to back Mr. George’s entry to the UDF. Confirming the move, Mr. George said the State committee of his party had decided to cooperate with the UDF if a reasonable deal is struck. “Six panchayats in the Pala constituency belonged to the Poonjar constituency prior to delimitation. Considering the strong influence of Janapaksham in this region, we would like to field a candidate in Pala as well. A decision will be taken after consultations with the UDF,” he said. However, confusion reigns within the UDF over an association with Mr. George despite attempts by him to douse the protests against him at the grassroots, especially in Erattupetta. Recently, the UDF committee in Erattupetta had adopted a resolution against any association with Mr. George and took out a public rally raising the demand. A section of the Congress leadership too appears apprehensive about the virtues of associating with Mr.George. Though Mr. George has sought to dismiss these protests as smear campaigns, the UDF seems to have taken a serious note of the. In this context, the coalition is also learned to have explored the possibility of associating with Mr. George without taking him on board.  There are protests at the grassroots, especially in Erattupetta, against the UDF’s proposed tie-up with Mr. George||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pc-george-keen-to-befriend-udf/article33554591.ece

12 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||LJD likely to drive a hard bargain||In the absence of a proposed merger between the Janata Dal (Secular) and the the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [(CPI(M)] is seemingly fine-tuning its seat allocation strategy between its age-old partner and relatively new associate for the Assembly elections. Party sources said both partners would have to be accommodated without damaging the legislative fortunes of the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Ahead of the seat-sharing talks, possibly next week, the LJD State executive committee is meeting in Thrissur on Wednesday to chalk out its own electoral blueprint. After a critical appraisal of the performance of both parties in the local body polls, the CPI (M) leadership has decided to offer eight seats in total to both of them. The LJD and the JD(S) won 100 and 72 seats respectively in last month’s election. Previous election Even before the local body polls, the CPI(M) had pushed for the merger of both the parties so as to forestall a wrangling over the seats. But the merger failed to take off despite several rounds of parleying. The JD(S) had contested in five seats and won from three in the last Assembly election. However the LJD, then the Janata Dal (United) in the Congress-led United Democratic Front camp, drew a blank from seven seats. Now, the split in the JD(S) would limit the number of the seats to that party. CPI(M) leaders said the party was weighing all options in the case of the LJD which ostensibly has solid grassroots support despite having no legislators. Hence, some hard-nosed bargaining is on the cards from the LJD in the seat-sharing process. ‘Eyeing five seats’ LJD functionaries said they were eyeing at least five seats – Vadakara and Koothuparamba segments, a second seat in Kozhikode district, apart from a seat in Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram districts. The party is looking closely at the Kayamkulam segment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ljd-likely-to-drive-a-hard-bargain/article33554587.ece

That is exactly what ‘Team Akoe’ plans to be for aspiring cyclists of Kozhikode, to be an ear for all their doubts regarding cycling and to assist them. ‘Team Akoe’ is the first professional cycling club of Kozhikode, formed almost a year ago by a group of professional as well as amateur cyclists in the region. The club was, however, formally launched last Sunday when Cycle Mayor of Kozhikode Sahir Abdul Jabbar flagged off its launch rally. The club has around 20 cyclists at present as its members, of the age group between 15 and 30. The members go on long and short trips together once in a while. But the greatest attraction of the club is the training it imparts to aspiring cyclists to take part in races. “There are professional cycle races in many States in India. Many of our cyclists are doing well there. We plan to inspire new cyclists to join the bandwagon,” said Justo K.R, one of the founding members of the club. The training is being provided free of cost to members by professional cyclists such as Rithul Das and Ahamed Musthar , the president and secretary respectively of the club. Besides, the club has the support of noted cyclists such as Abhinav.K.C., who will help train new members. “We will provide them basic training so as to launch them in the arena,” Justo said, adding that cycling being a competition event at school level and university level in the State, it will help students earn a few grace marks if they excel in the field.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pedalling-on-a-mission/article33554495.ece

He would sing at the Srimookambika temple, Kolllur, Karnataka. This year, he could not. Or rather, the coronavirus did not let him: he was stuck at Dallas, United States. So he had to offer his musical tribute to the goddess online. However, his 81st birthday was made special by his fellow singers from Malayalam cinema. Twenty-eight of them came together and sang a song written and composed as a tribute to him. It was the idea of singer Shwetha Mohan. She tuned the song written by B.K. Harinarayanan, got it rendered by playback singers and made it into a video. Gandharva gaayakaa. .. proved a hit on YouTube where it attracted more than 1 lakh views within two days. For someone who had never composed before, Shwetha has done a fine job. “I have already paid musical tributes to my favourite singers like Lata Mangeshkar, P. Susheela and S.P. Balasubrahmanyam by rendering their songs,” says Shwetha. “I felt I should compose a sing especially for Yesudas, my icon.” Stellar line-up She wanted to bring in as many as singers a possible. They were happy to oblige, so the song got a stellar line-up that included K.S. Chithra, Sujatha, Unni Menon, M.G. Sreekumar, G. Venugopal, Srinivas, Biju Narayanan, Madhu Balakrishnan, Vijay Yesudas, Devanand, Gayatri Asokan, Jyotsna, Rimi Tomy, and Harishankar. “Everyone got their portion of the song recorded and shot on video and sent it to me,” says Shwetha. “It felt nice to listening to my composition in different voices.” Her mother Sujatha helped her choose the line for each singer. “Shwetha worked hard on it,” she says. “Her talent for composing came as a surprise to me.” Veteran singer and actor Krishnachandran too is impressed. “The tune is perfect for the song,” he says. “I was happy that I could be part of such a fine effort.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/yesudas-gets-a-birthday-melody-from-fellow-singers/article33554569.ece

12 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Tourism dept. may revise Kappad beach entry fee||A revision of the existing entry fee and various other service charges at the Kappad beach is likely to be considered by the Tourism Department amid continuing protests by political parties and local residents’ collectives. For local residents, free entry to the beach will be the only acceptable solution as mooted by local body representatives. Though the authorities had earlier promised to consider the request, the private management team entrusted with the safekeeping of the location reportedly opposed the move. According to them, entry is not free in any of the blue flag-certified beaches. The Tourism Department is also not in favour of allowing free entry to the public as it might cause a fall in its revenue and increase operational costs. According to department officials, only a nominal amount is being collected from local people for entering the beach. Meanwhile, the political parties, which staged a series of protests in front of the renovated beach upholding local residents’ right for free entry, pointed out that renovation works were completed in the area promising free service to local residents. They alleged that the Tourism Department failed to keep the promise and introduced separate charges for each service in the area. Fishermen’s organisations and coastal residents’ associations have also come up against the collection of entry fee from local residents. According to them, people who used to visit the spot in the evenings are now unable to enter the area for ‘unknown reasons’. The private management is charging a fee for parking and sea bath, which we had never expected during the renovation process, they said. Some of the local residents have called for issuing special privilege cards to identify those who are eligible for free entry. According to them, at least residents who stay within two kilometres of the tourism spot should be allowed to access the place at free of cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourism-dept-may-revise-kappad-beach-entry-fee/article33554505.ece
12 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Drivers of LPG autos to go on indefinite strike||Drivers of over 1,000 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) autorickshaws are heading for an indefinite strike to protest against the frequent disruption of LPG supply from the fuel outlets in Kozhikode district. Despite a number of requests made to the district administration and the fuel station operators, the disrupted supply in Koyilandy and Vadakara taluks are yet to be restored addressing the concerns of hundreds of taxi operators. The leaders of autorickshaw drivers’ union say only two LPG filling stations are now available for more than 500 autorickshaws in the Kozhikode rural area, where they have no option but to wait for the arrival of stock to resume the service. A fuel station at Payyoli has been remaining shut for over a month claiming that there has been some technical delay on the part of delivering the stock from the fuel company, they allege. The situation is almost the same in the case of the remaining three LPG filling stations in Kozhikode city. According to autorickshaw drivers, there is no consistency in supply or guarantee to get 24x7 service. Many fuel station owners claim that they are short of staff to dispense the fuel to stop the service, they add. As part of the indefinite strike, there is also a plan to lay siege to the fuel stations. Mass petitions have already been sent to various authorities for checking the possibility of holding joint discussions and finding a solution. According to divers’ union leaders, they will resort to an indefinite strike within a week if things have not been settled on time. A functionary of the LPG autorickshaw drivers’ union in Kozhikode city said the promises given by the Union and State government to promote non-polluting vehicles were in vain in the case of LPG-fuelled vehicles. “Now, the authorities are after electric vehicles and those who purchased the LPG-powered vehicles are abandoned midway,” he rued. The drivers’ union leader said that the call to start five more LPG dispensing units in the district was yet to be considered by the authorities. “Even the appeal to start 24x7 service was not considered. The drivers are really struggling to cope with the adverse situations now. We are totally being sidelined,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drivers-of-lpg-autos-to-go-on-indefinite-strike/article33554501.ece

Rekha, 22, councillor from Eranhipalam ward, who is tipped to head the Standing Committee on Sports and Education in the Kozhikode Corporation, says the Left Democratic Front-led civic body will strive to raise the standards of all government schools in the city on the lines of the Government Vocational Higher Secondary School for Girls, Nadakkavu. Ms. Rekha, an alumnus of the school, said her election to the standing committee was expected to be beneficial for the youth in education and sports sectors. It was the Faizal Shabana Foundation which helped improve the infrastructure at the Nadakkavu school. Similar public-private participation ventures could be emulated in other places, she pointed out. LDF manifesto In its manifesto for the local body polls, the LDF had promised to devise a master plan for the infrastructure development of all government schools in the city. It also promised to have high-tech laboratories in all schools. The manifesto also had proposed an educational knowledge park to have all educational infrastructure under one umbrella. Ms. Rekha, who has represented the Kerala State Hockey team, says more students from Kozhikode district should find their place in the State team in various sports and games. “We need to improve the condition of sports grounds in the city. There should be more sports grounds as well,” she said. The LDF manifesto had promised to develop playgrounds in the city as sports training centres and set up a sports school in the city. It also proposed to set up an international multi-purpose stadium with the help of the State government. A roller skating ground too had been proposed at the mini-stadium in Pooladikkunnu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/focus-will-be-on-raising-standards-of-govt-schools/article33554507.ece

It was not known who hoisted the BJP flag on the statue. The incident evoked sharp protests from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Congress, and their youth wings. The police removed the flag and began an inquiry into the incident. On December 16, when the BJP celebrated its victory in the municipal elections, a group of Sangh Parivar men had unfurled a giant ‘Jai Sriram’ banner on the municipal building, courting a controversy that made the BJP leadership distance itself from the incident. Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) workers had unfurled the national flag in protest from the municipal building. The draping of the BJP flag on the Gandhi statue triggered yet another wave of protests here on Monday, with DYFI workers garlanding the statue in a political quid pro quo. Youth Congress and Kerala Students Union protesters took out a demonstration in the town. The BJP said it was not responsible. Congress and CPI(M) councillors staged a sit-in in front of municipal chairperson K. Priya Ajayan, demanding that those responsible for the incident be brought to book. Ms. Ajayan said some anti-social elements were behind the incident and that those responsible would be brought to book. She filed a complaint with the police, and the police began an inquiry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-flag-on-gandhi-statue-sparks-protests-in-palakkad/article33554609.ece

Helmet challenge Named “Helmet challenge@ M.C. Road’, the six enforcement squads under the Regional Transport Officer, Enforcement, Thiruvananthapuram will patrol the stretch in uniform and civil address to book those violating the MV rules without stopping the vehicles and with focus on motorcycles. “In addition to patrol teams, our men will be present in intersections, signal points and pedestrian crossings to book motorcyclists and pillion riders not wearing helmet, indulging in overspeeding, road rage, racing and signal jumping. The officials have also been asked to see whether the helmet is fastened and worn properly,’ RTO, Enforcement, Dilu. A. K. told a press conference here on Monday. The drive comes in the wake of the increasing road accidents outside the city limits and rural areas after the Unlock measures. The RTO Enforcement said the less use of helmets by motorcycle riders and those riding pillion and the racing by youths below 25 years in the rural areas is a concern. Those being booked from January 12 to 21 in the 36-km road corridor along M. C. Road will get e-challan notices with photographic proof of violations and motorist can also check e-challan.parivahan.gov.inby keying the motor vehicle number. Drivers who show good driving habits will be appreciated by the MVD. The Department has plans to extend the drive to other areas in the capital district, Mr. Dilu added. Less experience The MVD is of the view that the entry of motorists with less experience in driving, more entry of personalized transport modes, deployment of MVD personnel for undertaking the COVID-19 works and reduced checking due to the protocol and guidelines had led to rise in accidents. The RTO Enforcement said enforcement activities will be strengthened in the coming days and road discipline will be ensured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mvd-crackdown-on-violators-from-today/article33555106.ece
12 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||No expansion plans for now, says UDF||A meeting of the United Democratic Front (UDF) here on Monday appeared to have deferred the decision on expanding the Congress-led coalition, if at all, for later. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the matter was not on the table for discussion at the conclave. His statement came amidst reports that the UDF had made overtures to “disgruntled” National Congress Party (NCP) legislator Mani. C. Kappan to contest on its ticket from Pala constituency in the coming Assembly elections. Mr. Kappan was reportedly cut up with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and A. K. Saseendran “faction” of the NCP for being allegedly accommodative of the claim of Jose K. Mani of the Kerala Congress (M) for the Pala seat. P.C. George of the Kerala Janapaksham (Secular), earlier an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), had evinced interest in joining the UDF. So had P.C. Thomas who heads his own faction of the Kerala Congress. He was also an NDA ally for long. The meeting appointed Benny Behnan as chairman and C.P. John of the CMP as convener of the election manifesto committee. From Kasaragod Mr. Chennithala would launch a Statewide march from Kasaragod on February 1. The march would touch 140 constituencies. The campaign would seek to highlight the anti-people policies of the Central and State governments. It would reach the capital on February 22. Mr. Chennithala deplored the LDF attacks on the Indian Union Muslim League. He accused the CPI(M) of stoking Islamophobia ahead of the elections to divide the electorate into communal lines. Collective leadership The CPI(M) was hand-in-glove with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and fundamentalist outfits such as the SDPI. Its sole intention was to erase the Congress in Kerala and supplant it with the BJP, he said. He said the UDF swore by a collective leadership. The All India Congress Committee would decide who would head the Congress Legislature Party once the elections were over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-expansion-plans-for-now-says-udf/article33554593.ece

12 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Kadakkavoor case: bail plea rejected||The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) court here rejected a bail plea moved by the accused woman in the Kadakkavoor child abuse case on Monday. While dismissing the application, Additional Sessions Judge - V and POCSO Court in-charge Denny C.J., noted that the petitioner could not be granted bail, considering the investigation is in its early stages and there is possibility of the witnesses being influenced or intimidated. The judgement also took into account the counselling report that had been submitted by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Thiruvananthapuram, to the Kadakkavoor station house officer (SHO). The report apparently recorded the ordeal of the minor boy as had been narrated by him during counselling. While the same was also repeated to a woman civil police officer, the victim’s statement was then recorded by the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Attingal, under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) when he reiterated the alleged incident of sexual assault. The emergence of the counselling report and its contents brought CWC chairperson N. Sunanda’s claims under scrutiny. She had maintained that the committee had not directed the police to register case. However, a formal communication submitted by the CWC, along with the counselling report, on November 30 urges the police to adopt further steps. The case was subsequently registered on December 18, following which the mother was arrested on December 28. Meanwhile, Inspector General of Police, South Zone, Harshita Attaluri, commenced probe in the case and called for the case files and related documents. While she will also examine the allegations levelled at the police, the officer is also likely to collect evidence in person at a later stage. The accused woman’s family, along with an action council that has been seeking ‘justice’ for her, petitioned the Chief Minister, State Police Chief and the State Human Rights Commission. Collusion Speaking to media persons outside the State Police headquarters, her father accused the CWC of colluding with the local police in framing his daughter. While the committee has been trying to distance themselves from the incident, their involvement is evident in the case, he said.

12 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Man sets himself ablaze outside school||The recent COVID-19 lockdown, which had led to the loss of several livelihoods, claimed one more life as a former employee of a private school allegedly committed suicide by setting himself ablaze near the school near Sreekaryam on Monday. Sreekumar, 55, of Maruthoor, Vattappara, purportedly doused himself in petrol and set himself ablaze inside his own autorickshaw at around 7.30 a.m. after he parked the vehicle a stone’s throw away from the L’école Chempaka school, Edavacode. Incidentally, the suicide bid took place on the same day when students of Classes X and XII rejoined the school after the lockdown. Attempts made by local residents to douse the fire came to a naught as the fire spread to trees nearby and continued to rage on until a Kerala Fire and Rescue Services team reached the spot. Despite their efforts, Sreekumar was found dead inside the charred vehicle. The deceased used to work in the school as a driver for 16 years until he and 83 other non-teaching employees, including his wife Bindu who had been employed as a cleaner there, were laid off in September last year. Hard times While Sreekumar’s family apparently fell on hard times, he is suspected to have taken the extreme step after the management had decided to outsource their jobs, the police said. A supposed suicide note was found in Sreekumar’s diary that he apparently gave a former colleague a day ago before committing suicide. Following the incident, the former employees of the school resisted the efforts of the police to shift the body and demanded the District Collector’s intervention in ensuring reasonable compensation from the school management. Later, district authorities led by Sub-Collector M.S. Madhavikutty convened a meeting at the school to resolve the issue. The management decided to provide the family a solatium of Rs. 15 lakh, of which Rs. 5 lakh has already been provided. In addition, the school will also provide a relief aid of Rs. 10,000 every month to Bindu throughout her life. Besides his wife, Sreekumar is survived by their two daughters. School principal Joy M. Varghese said the employees in the driving and cleaning wings had been paid full salary till June 2020, but the imposition of the lockdown and dwindling income compelled the management to reduce their salaries by 30% in July. However, a proposal to cut their wages by half (their original salaries) irked the employees who went on an agitation mode. Around the same time, the school had roped in an agency for the maintenance of the school. Meeting convened Later, the district labour union convened meetings following which the management entered into an agreement with the agitators to reappoint 61 employees, including Sreekumar and Bindu, through the outsourcing agency. The school authorities had also cleared the retirement benefits of all employees by then, he said.

12 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Prosecute Customs official, says Secretariat union||The ‘strained’ relationship between the government Secretariat, the nerve centre of State administration, and the Central agencies investigating the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case came to the fore on Monday. The Kerala Secretariat Employees Association (KSEA) has accused the Commissionerate of Customs (Preventive), Kochi, of attempting to browbeat at least one senior administration official into implicating the State government in the racket. The KSEA is aligned closely with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. The CPI(M) had earlier termed the Customs probe politically motivated. KSEA president P. Honey has sought the prosecution of an Assistant Commissioner of Customs, Kochi, for ‘custodial harassment’ of Assistant Protocol Officer M.S. Harikrishnan. ‘Threat of arrest’ In a letter to the Secretary, General Administration Department, Mr. Honey said the officer had summoned Mr. Harikrishnan to the Kochi office on January 5. Customs officials took turns questioning him from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. The officer ‘attempted’ to coerce Mr. Harikrishnan into incriminating the government. He ‘threatened’ Mr. Harikrishnan with arrest and remand. Mr. Honey demanded that the State government prosecute the Customs officer for causing the officer acute distress. If the government heeds the request, it could trigger a legal stand-off between the administration and a Central agency. A Customs official denied the allegation. The Customs had earlier sought details of duty exemption certificates granted by the State Protocol Officer to the UAE consulate to import cargo consignments. It wanted to determine whether the government had granted immunity to the UAE consulate to import freight without Customs examination or assessment via air and seaports in the State during the 2019-21 period. The protocol section had been at the centre of a stormy political controversy ever since the smuggling case surfaced in July. A fire in the division in August had prompted the Opposition to accuse the government of arson to erase evidence of official complicity in the racket.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/prosecute-customs-official-says-secretariat-union/article33555101.ece

The Left Democratic Front, which has increased its tally to 52 seats in the 100 member council and which expects the support of three Independents, is trying to wrest control of all the eight standing committees. According to LDF sources, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), which is leading the front, will probably be putting up its own candidate in six of the eight standing committees, leaving just two for its allies. The CPI already has a standing committee in its kitty, with Deputy Mayor P.K.Raju set to head the Finance Committee. Of the remaining, the Tax Appeals Standing Committee chairperson post will be shared between the four smaller LDF constituent parties - Congress(S), Indian National League (INL), Janata Dal (Secular) and Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy (JSS)- with each taking turns for a year and a few months. The LDF is expected to field Medical College councillor D.R.Anil for the Works Standing Committee chairperson post. For the Welfare Standing Committee chairperson post, Kadakampally councillor P.K.Gopakumar and Puthenpally councillor S.Salim are under consideration. Peroorkada councillor Jameela Sreedharan is being considered for the Health Standing Committee chairperson post.

The State government has added Rs. 30,000 from the NREGA funds to each unit. The State government intends to construct 28.30 lakh houses in two phases -- 15.10 lakh houses in first phase and 13.20 lakh houses in second phase. This was in comparison to the previous government’s allocations. The previous government had allocated Rs. 1.50 lakh as its share in the Affordable Housing Programme and Rs. 1 lakh in the beneficiary-led housing programme. According to GO M.S No 8, the government has accorded administrative sanction to the project costing Rs. 24,776.84 crore under PMRY-YSR Urban-BLC 2019 under which 13.76 lakh houses will be constructed with a unit cost of Rs. 1.80 lakh. The government also issued revised administrative sanction to construct 1.33 lakh houses with a unit cost of Rs. 1.80 lakh and a project cost of Rs. 2,407.45 crore under PMAY-YSR Urban-BLC (2018-19). “The unit cost of Rs. 1.80 lakh is hardly sufficient to meet the rising construction costs. The prices of sand, cement and steel have gone up considerably during the last five years. In this scenario, the beneficiary may find it a herculean task to build a house,” said a senior official in the Department of Housing. CM Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy promised that the new colonies would have all amenities of a township, including paved roads, schools, health care centres, and bus stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rising-construction-cost-may-prove-a-dampener/article33555133.ece

Jagan Mohan Redy and the other accused in five charge-sheets filed by Enforcement Directorate (ED) against them in quid pro quo cases suffered a setback on Monday when a special court for ED cases rejected their request that the trial of ED cases be held back till the prosecution against them in the same court in Central Bureau of Investigation cases was disposed of. Incidentally, the Enforcement Directorate had filed charge-sheets against them in the court of Principal Judge for CBI cases on the basis of charge-sheets filed by the CBI under provisions of IPC. The counsels for Mr. Jagan and other accused had argued in the court that the CBI cases be tried first and then the ED cases be taken up. They contented that the arguments in ED cases were not even heard by the court after CBI cases against accused in 2G scam were struck down. Therefore, they feared a similar fate to their clients. The counsels, in the alternative, requested hearing of both ED and CBI cases simultaneously as the same court had allowed it in another instance in the past. The ED, however, argued that the ED and CBI cases were standalone and prayed that trial in its cases precede that of CBI. The court upheld the argument of Enforcement Directorate and conceded trial of its cases ahead of CBI. Meanwhile, the personal appearance of Jagan in the court on Monday in the sixth charge-sheet filed by Enforcement Directorate in respect Aurobindo Pharma was put off to January 21 at his request on the ground that he had pressing official engagements.

12 January 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan announces laptop in lieu of DBT for students of IX to XII||Chief Minister Y.S.Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday announced laptops for students of IX to XII standards in lieu of direct benefit transfer under Amma Vodi from the new academic year. Launching the second phase of the welfare scheme to confer an economic benefit to the tune of Rs. 13,023 crore on 44.48 lakh students, he said mothers of students studying in these classes could opt for laptops instead of DBT from the next academic year. Showing a piece of laptop to the assembled gathering and giving its technical specification, he said his government had held several rounds of talks with leading computer manufacturers, who had agreed to supply laptops costing Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 27,000 each for just Rs. 18,500. ''My Government will go for reverse tendering to bring down the cost further. The facility will be extended to degree students also,” he said. Mr. Jagan reiterated the charge on the occasion that the Opposition parties were behind the series of attacks on places of worship. He objected the issuance of notification for holding of local body elections without any concern about people's health during COVID-19 times to benefit a particular political party. He had a dig at Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu and his son TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh for restricting themselves to their homes fearing contracting COVID-19. The desecration of places of worship had been timed a few days before or after the launch of welfare schemes by the government, he observed and cautioned the assembled mothers of students to be wary of a possible attack even on the temples of learning. From February 1, the Anganwadi centres would be turned into YSR pre-primary school and Rs. 4,000 crore had been spent to give facelift to them. Another Rs. 1,870 crore would be earmarked to provide nutritious food to the tiny tots, he added. Education Minister A. Suresh outlined the various schemes in the education sector for 1.87 crore students entailing an exenditure of Rs. 24,559.97 crore as against just Rs. 3,875.93 crore spent by the previous TDP Government during its term.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-announces-laptop-in-lieu-of-dbt-for-students-of-ix-to-xii/article33554294.ece
12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||File affidavit, apex court tells ex-HC judge||The Supreme Court on Monday asked former Andhra Pradesh High Court judge, Justice V. Eswaraiah, to file an affidavit about the “private phone conversation” between him and a suspended judicial officer, which the State High Court dubbed as a “serious conspiracy” to destabilise the judiciary. The High Court, on August 13, had ordered a judicial inquiry by former Supreme Court judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, into the phone chat. It had termed the conversation an attempt to “malign” a senior sitting Supreme Court judge and the then Chief Justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. On Monday, appearing for Justice Eswaraiah, advocate Prashant Bhushan asked a three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan how a private chat could be called a “conspiracy” to revile the judiciary. Mr. Bhushan said the judicial inquiry was ordered without even issuing prior notice to his client. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Vipin Nair, for an intervenor-advocate, P. Samuel John, said “there was nothing private about the conversation.” Mr. Sibal said the conversation was “motivated to attack the system.” “Once inquiry is made, we will know what was the motive,” Mr. Sibal said. Mr. John, in his application, said it was common knowledge among the members of the Bar that the present State government has launched a series of systematic attacks on the High Court and its judges for questioning its “radical” executive decisions which does not pass judicial scrutiny. Justice Bhushan recorded Mr. Bhushan’s oral statement in court that Justice Eswaraiah “does not dispute the conversation.” Mr. Bhushan informed the court that a transcript of the conversation has been filed along with the appeal against the August 13 order of the High Court. “The petitioner [Justice Eswaraiah] had in fact spoken publicly about the misconduct of the sitting Supreme Court judge and his nexus with the erstwhile government [of Chandrababu Naidu] and he was privy to the various facts regarding this misconduct,” the petition filed by Justice Eswaraiah said. The petition said the misconduct Justice Eswariah was talking about was the “subject matter of an enquiry by the cabinet committee regarding dubious property transactions for unlawful gain, also involving the sitting Supreme Court judge and other public servants at the helm of affairs in the erstwhile government of Andhra Pradesh.” “This conspiracy was the subject matter of an FIR which names Dammalapati Srinivas, formerly Additional Advocate General, Andhra Pradesh, and 12 others, including the two daughters of the Supreme Court judge ... In these circumstances, it was legitimate for the petitioner to seek any further information about the misconduct of the judge from anyone who might be privy to such information,” the petition said. Justice Eswariah, in his petition, argued that terming such a conversation to be some sort of a criminal conspiracy to destabilise the judiciary which needs an investigation was “totally unwarranted.” The court scheduled the next hearing for Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/file-affidavit-sc-tells-ex-hc-judge/article33554241.ece

12 January 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD to take up gold plating of Tirumala temple Mahadwaram||The TTD has embarked on an ambitious programme of providing gold malam (plating) to Mahadwaram and taking up repair works to Dwajasthamba Peetham and Bali Peetam at the temple of Lord Venkateswara here. The gold malam will be taken up to the copper design sheets on the gigantic temple doors. A decision to this effect was taken by the TTD Board of Trustees during its recent meeting. The process was necessitated following an inspection report submitted by a team of officials who found the gold malam provided on the Mahadwaram doors to have faded away to a height of 2.30 metres from the bottom resulting in the exposure of copper sheets. The team which included the Deputy Executive Engineer (jewellery), the Assistant Executive Officer (jewellery) and Assistant Stapati also found the nails provided on the gold malam sheets at the base (peetam) of Dwajasthambam and Bali Peetam either broken or come off their grooves leading to openings at several places. According to estimates about 6.625 kilogram of 24 carat gold in addition to 68 kilogram of copper is likely to go in the completion of the project, the cost of which is projected around Rs. 3.13 crore. The cost also includes Rs. 2.80 lakh in the form of labour charges and Rs. 30,000 GST. The board also resolved to draw 6,625 grams of gold required for the project from its treasury and 68 kilogram from the existing stock with the Jewellery Department in Tirupati. Adherence to rules As per rule 131 of G.O. Ms.No.311, the Executive Officer is not empowered to alter, convert, melt, replace, sell, gift away or destroy any jewel, vahanam, articles of gold, silver received in the form of kanukas or any such other valuables belonging to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam or Endowments without the prior permission of the Board of Trustees. However, he can make a new jewel or vahanam by utilising the available gold or silver with prior sanction of the board in accordance with rule 132. It is against this backdrop that the subject was placed before the board for its approval. When contacted, Executive Engineer XIV (Jewellery) Mr. Sivaramakrishna said that as the management shall supply gold and copper required for the project tenders relating to labour works have alone been initiated. The gold plating works will be taken up soon after the finalisation of tenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-plans-gold-plating-of-temple-mahadwaram/article33554832.ece

12 January 2021||Tirupati,ANDHRA PRADESH||NARL scientists solve aerosol mystery||A study by the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL) in Gadanki in Chittoor district has solved the mystery over the unequal aerosol distribution in the atmosphere in India and China. Published in the recent issue of the Nature magazine, a research paper brought out by a team led by Scientist-SF M. Venkat Ratnam is expected to change the narrative over the rainfall prediction pattern and the impact of aerosols on health. Aerosols are known to be caused by crop residue burning, forest fires, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. Studies have pointed to the effect of the enhanced man-made emissions on the Asian monsoon circulation and the resultant precipitation over East and South East Asia. A ‘Dipole pattern’ in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), based on long-term satellite measurements, indicated a concurrent increase over India and a marked reduction over China. The study observed a rapid increase in aerosol loading over India and its adjoining seas, and in sharp contrast, reduction over China, which is credited to the country’s ‘clean air actions’. Scientists at NARL have found decreasing trends in the surface (black carbon) aerosol concentration in the recent decade. “ Similar decreasing trends were noticed over several locations in India,” Dr. Venkat Ratnam told The Hindu over telephone. The pollutants over the earth’s immediate surface are easily lifted to the free troposphere through convection , leading to higher aerosol concentration farther from the earth, added the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar awardee .  Global warming The increased aerosol concentration over India is attributed to land aridity due to global warming, a 20% increase in fire activity and 50% rise in aerosol loading in the Thar Desert over the last decade. Interestingly, decreasing trends in AOD were observed in northwestern India, which is credited to conversion of deserts into crop-land areas. NARL Director A.K. Patra said the study would have significant consequences on the meteorology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/narl-scientists-solve-aerosol-mystery/article33555037.ece
12 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||SEC Joint Director Sai Prasad discharged from services||State Election Commission (SEC) Joint Director G.V. Sai Prasad has been discharged from his services for allegedly influencing the employees to go on mass leave, thereby derailing the process of Gram Panchayat (GPs) elections. In his proceedings on Monday, State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar stated that the elections to gram panchayats were notified on January 9 and all senior officers, including the SEC Secretary, were directed to be available at the headquarters and not to be absent without his permission. Leave letter But, Mr. Sai Prasad has purportedly placed a leave letter for 30 days and left without giving any intimation, in spite of him being the seniormost functionary of the SEC after its Secretary. Besides, Mr. Sai Prasad is charged with influencing the employees to apply for leave en masse “as part of a larger design to adversely effect the functioning of the Commission” against the backdrop of some recent developments. Mr. Sai Prasad allegedly committed these illegal acts from his chamber before his “unauthorised” departure. Barring one or two misguided persons, the rest of the employees rebuffed his counsel and indoctrination to desert the Commission, it was mentioned in the proceedings. The SEC invoked its plenary powers vested under Articles 243-K and 324 of the Constitution to discharge him from his services to safeguard the integrity of the election process. It may be noted that the State government and SEC were embroiled in a major controversy over the proposed conduct of GP elections in February.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/election-commission-joint-director-removed/article33554235.ece

The TDP state president K Atchannaidu, in a statement on Monday said the YSRCP leaders were afraid that the election results cannot be managed if the elections were conducted during the tenure of State Election Commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar. How can the MP Vijaya sai Reddy say that the local bodies elections would be held only after Tirupati byelection and retirement of Mr. Ramesh Kumar?

Three other government general hospitals in Kakinada, Kadapa and Tirupati have also been sanctioned oxygen generators. KGH already has liquid oxygen tanks of 20 KL and 13 KL capacity on the hospital premises. The 20 KL tank meets the requirements of the Super Speciality block and the 13 KL tank is connected to the different wards in the hospital. The tanks are refilled with liquid oxygen on a regular basis. “The oxygen generators will be an alternative to us, when there is a shortage in the supply of liquid oxygen. An acute shortage of oxygen was felt during the COVID-19 pandemic and during such times, the oxygen generators will be of immense help. The vacant site beside the Super Speciality block has been identified for erection of sheds required to house the oxygen generators,” says P.V. Sudhakar, Principal, Andhra Medical College. “The supply of oxygen gas from the liquid oxygen tanks, to the wards and Super Speciality block is done through pipes. The purity of oxygen supplied through cylinders and by conversion of liquid oxygen ranges between 98 % and 99%, the purity of oxygen produced by the oxygen generators will be in the 93% to 95% range. However, the 93 to 95% purity is enough to treat patients,” he says. The generators and the technical know-how will be provided by the Centre and the State government has to provide the site for setting up of the generators. A contractor has been appointed by the Centre for the purpose. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an acute demand for ventilators as thousands of patients were admitted to hospitals after contracting the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/oxygen-generators-sanctioned-to-4-hospitals/article33554313.ece

But, it does not have the courage to face the elections,” Ms. Yashaswi told the media here. She strongly condemned the statements made by the Ministers, YSRCP leaders and the representatives of employees’ organisations against the State Election Commission which had issued the notification for the local body polls. “It is unfair to target a constitutional body. The courts should intervene and refrain the YSRCP leaders from making such comments,” she added.

12 January 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Spl. package need of the hour for growth of North Andhra’||Uttarandhra Melukolupu, an NGO, on Monday urged the government to announce an exclusive package for A.P.’s North Coastal region which suffered neglect and under-development in the last 70 years. The association founder president Pakalapati Sanyasi Raju said that such a package was given for the development of Bundelkhand region between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Addressing a media conference here, he said exodus of nearly 15 lakh people from this region to other parts of the country was an indication of the lack of employment opportunities and the required economic activity within the region. “As per the assurances given in the A.P. Reorganisation Act-2013, the Union government announced Rs. 50 crore per year for speedy development of the three districts of the region but the State government failed to utilise the amount. It’s failure led to denial of nearly Rs. 1,000 crore fund in the last seven years,” Mr. Raju said. The Association’s leaders Adada Mohana Rao, Karanam Murali, Dantuluri Ramachandra Raju and K.Damodar and others were present. The association members will tour all the three districts and seek the opinions of the people to step up pressure on the government for a special package for the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/spl-package-need-of-the-hour-for-north-andhra-growth/article33555044.ece

12 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Schools to open after 315-day COVID break||Following Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao’s direction to open schools and colleges from February 1, officials will be meeting on Tuesday to finalise the guidelines and standard operating procedures to be adopted with regard to classes, teaching and exams. About 26,000 government schools and 11,000 private schools in Telangana will be opened for students of higher classes after a gap of 315 days as the last working day of the previous academic year was March 21. Special Chief Secretary Chitra Ramchandran told The Hindu that guidelines will be issued after deliberations on Tuesday with State officials and District Medical and Health officials on the safety measures to be adopted by school managements. The guidelines will have information on whether parents’ consent would be needed and staggered attendance should be allowed. Information on the syllabus and examination pattern will also be included in the guidelines. However, there is no clarity on the opening of coaching institutes. Since coaching is optional, coaching centres may be allowed to start after the vaccination drive stabilises. Ms. Ramchandran said the syllabus has been re-arranged for this academic year and there would be lesser burden on the children in the exams as well. While question paper will consider only 70% of the syllabus, 30% will be covered in the internal assessments. Question paper Moreover, there will be lot of choice in the questions with multiple-choice questions dominating the paper to make it easier for students. Last year, all the students till class 10 were declared passed as exams were not conducted. Though Intermediate exams were conducted, the government decided to pass all the candidates irrespective of their performance. As per the regular academic schedule, schools were to be opened from June 12 but the peak in COVID-19 cases led to continuation of the shutdown. Schools will now reopen for students of classes 9 and 10, and also Intermediate and above by strictly following the COVID-19 guidelines. Teacher unions have welcomed the decision to reopen schools and said it may not be a problem for students to jump into academics as they were already attending online classes. Telangana State United Teachers Federation general secretary Chava Ravi said out of the 220 working days, 120 have already been lost and he advocates reduction in syllabus in the interest of students. However, majority of students are already in the groove with online classes and the physical classes will help them in fine-tuning the lessons already learnt apart from those remaining, he said. S. Sreenivas Reddy, president of Telangana Recognised Schools Managements Association, said reopening would help students understand the lessons better. “We will take parents’ consent while allowing students as per COVID-19 norms,” he said. About 11,000 private schools will now start functioning, though with reduced number of students. Online classes Though students would be allowed now, academic activity has already began in the government schools from September 1 through online mode using WhatsApp and other social media platforms. Private schools were way ahead in using the electronic mode compared to government schools. Online classes were also conducted through digital, Television and T-SAT platforms.  The syllabus has been re-arranged for this academic year and there would be lesser burden on the children in the exams as well.

In a statement on Monday, chairman and managing director of Southern Discom G. Raghuma Reddy cautioned people against indulging in kite-flying near electrical lines, distribution transformers and other installations of power as it could not only disrupt power supply but also cause accidents. Suggesting the kite flyers only to use thread/string made of cotton or nylon, Mr. Reddy advised against use of metallic thread or metal-reinforced string or metal coated thread (manja) as they act as good conductors of electricity and could cause electric shock when they touch or come close to electric lines. Further, he asked them to indulge in the activity in dry weather as wet string would act as a better conductor of electricity. He suggested them not to touch the kites or strings when they fall on power lines or electrical installations or get caught up in electrical lines. He also suggested people to avoid kite flying from balconies, roof tops and walls as it could lead to fatal falls.

Chandrasekhar Rao is destroying the education system in the State deliberately by not appointing regular vice-chancellors to many universities, national spokesperson of AICC Dasoju Sravan has alleged. Speaking at a round-table conference on “Delay in Appointment of Vice-Chancellors and Other Appointments” organised by Osmania University Teaching Association (OUTA) in Osmania University here on Monday, he sought to know why the government was not filling thousands of faculty and non-teaching posts, which were vacant in government colleges and universities.  ‘Evil intention’ This, Mr. Sravan said, was being done with an evil intention to destroy the State-run education institutions while promoting private colleges and universities. The Congress leader requested Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to intervene in the matter and ask the Chief Minister to act immediately in this regard. “It is very unfortunate that universities have been functioning without regular vice chancellors ever since the formation of Telangana. Historically universities have played a pivotal role in questioning the ruling class and their anti-people policies. Fearing such prospects, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao is deliberately killing the education system in general and higher education in particular,” Mr. Sravan observed. Because of the lopsided approach of the Chief Minister, the universities were losing recognition, grants-in-aid from the Universities Grants Commission (UGC), lacking research, missing direction thereby making them standstill in operations, the Congress leader pointed out. Schools closed In spite of his 2014 election promises to offer free KG to PG, over 5,000 schools were closed.

12 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||State govt. blamed for vacancies in varsities||Universities in Telangana are without vice-chancellors for the last 18 months while thousands of vacancies are combinedly damaging the image of the varsities while academics are severely hit due to the indifferent attitude of the Telangana government, charged speakers at a roundtable. The meeting, organised by the Osmania University Teachers Association (OUTA), was attended by N. Ramchander Rao, MLC from BJP, Dasoju Sravan Kumar, AICC spokesperson, Prof. B. Bucha Reddy, former chairman, Federation of University Teachers Association, Prof. D. Manohar Rao, chairman, Telangana State Retired Teachers Association, Prof. G. Laxman, Prof. Battu Satyanarayana, former president, OUTA., among others -- expressed their concern over the pathetic situation in universities. In-charge V-Cs They said 13 out of 15 universities in Telangana are functioning with IAS officers as in-charge vice-chancellors since July 2019 and the government has not bothered to appoint regular vice-chancellors due to which varsities were losing grants and accreditation. The huge vacancies are also an impediment in securing the much needed accreditation while students are also losing opportunities in research. The speakers argued that the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in India was only about 25% and the Government of India in its National Education Policy 2020 recommended increase of GER to 50% by 2030 without compromising quality in view of the global higher education bench marks. IOE status Moreover, the Indian government is encouraging universities to compete with top world class universities by awarding Institute of Eminence (IOE) status to 20 universities by providing Rs. 1,000 crore grant, besides providing RUSA funds to remaining universities for their development and to provide quality education. But the neglect of varsities in Telangana is negating all these steps taken by the Central government. The State funded universities are on the verge of collapsing and none has imagined such a pathetic situation in the newly formed State.

12 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Substandard helmet manufacturers held||In a major crackdown against the making sale of substandard helmets, the Cyberabad police arrested two people from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, who manufactured such headgears. The accused, Dheeraj Kumar, manufactured ‘O2 helmets’, while Anil Kumar was manufacting helmets made of three different brands – Welfare, Hood and Duro. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) SM Vijay Kumar said that for the first time in the country, manufacturers of low quality headgears were arrested. The accused were brought to Hyderabad on Monday. With increasing menace of sale, distribution and usage of low-quality and fake helmets in the capital, the Cyberabad police constituted a special team to identify and raid the warehouses. “A team of Economic Offences Wing identified such manufacturing companies at Ghaziabad to curb manufacturing, supply of such low quality helmets which are against law and provide no protection to the riders,” he said. The officer said that so far they have booked 10 cases against those companies. “The fatalities have drastically increased. On detailed analysis, it was identified that the two wheeler riders and pillion riders who were not wearing helmets or wearing low quality helmets constitute a majority of the deaths in road accidents,” Mr. Kumar said, adding that such helmets were manufactured at various places in the National Capital Region. According to him, most of the low quality helmets bear a fake ISI mark and they are made of cheap plastic, fibre and thermocol materials which can’t bear the weight/pressure of a bike rider on fall as mandated by legal standards. The manufacturing cost of these low-quality helmets would be anywhere between Rs. 100 and Rs. 200 - but are sold at Rs. 500 and above.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/substandard-helmet-manufacturers-held/article33554947.ece

12 January 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||RTI activist claims credit for inquiry against district official||A Right to Information Act activist from Nalgonda, Kothapalli Sivaji, has filed at least 60 petitions to study service rules of government servants, with focus on a senior official in the district’s rural development office, related transfers and postings, to now claim “the officer has committed fraud”. “The official for the past 12 years, in the name of deputation, has been violating Foreign Service Rules and even misled district collectors and State functionaries. He chose a department that has more temporary and contract workers, and also committed several frauds and diverted public money,” he said in his letter, with some 60 attachments. Mr. Sivaji had posted the set of his investigation to several departments, including the CMO, the Chief Secretary, the District Collector and the Vigilance Department requesting an inquiry. According to him, the said officer lacked the eligibility to be posted as the ‘project director’ in Warangal, and had colluded with State functionaries to continue in the deputed department for several years. “There was no information to the parent department, Agriculture. He continued his deputation for more than 10 years, but the RTI replies show this is his fifth year. Following allegations of corruption, in 2019 he got himself transferred to Nalgonda citing family reasons,” he shows. Elaborating on the charges of financial impropriety, Mr. Sivaji alleged that in one instance the officer, while posted in Warangal, collected nearly Rs. 2 crore from the Watershed Development Fund for construction of cluster buildings and produced bills. However, there were no tenders or e-procurement procedures, which is mandated for any works exceeding Rs. 5 lakh, this is one among other deviations, he says. Asked why he was probing into the particular officer’s works, whether he had personal interest or was bearing a grudge, Mr. Sivaji said he was part of the Praja Sankshema Pathakala Parirakshana Samithi, founded in 2012. In the past too, similar findings exposed irregularities in a Central scheme leading to the suspension of a DWMA chief, he said. The district officer, now facing allegations, when contacted for his version said he remained transparent all through his career and deputations and corresponding extensions were effected from time-to-time following government orders. “Without the parent department’s consent, orders cannot be released and even salaries cannot be paid. How can I violate? This year too, I got my order for extension of deputation till July,” he said, while refuting arguments of corruption as just “wild allegations” to damage his image. The officer confirmed to The Hindu that he neither knew nor meet the probing activist. However, he expressed suspicion that a terminated employee may be in the background. Meanwhile, Mr. Sivaji showed his latest RTI replies from secretaries directing commissioners in their department “for personal enquiry and immediate necessary action.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rti-activist-claims-credit-for-inquiry-against-district-official/article33555090.ece
12 January 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||E-Cell of IITH to organise ‘E-Summit’||The E-Cell of the Indian Institute of Technology is organising ‘E-Summit 2021 - a pragmatic advent’ from January 22 to 24, 2020. One of the biggest entrepreneurship conclaves in India, E-Summit 2021 aims to inspire and educate students and corporate-inclined towards entrepreneurship and encourage early entrepreneurs to take and manage bigger risks. The event is also intended at providing more insights of the business world to attendees from industry experts. It will be centered on the theme -- a pragmatic advent.

The E-Cell have initiated an outreach that covered more than 1,00,000 people. Over 100 startups are expected to participate in this event. Highlighting the unique aspects of ‘E-Summit 2021,’ Mr. Vaibhav Kumar, Head – E-Cell, IIT Hyderabad, said: E-Summit 2021” will witness a completely new perspective of ideas and solutions. The year 2020 was full of unprecedented events, and the global pandemic has affected every domain of work alike. It would be really interesting to know how different industries came out to cope up with such a scenario, what sort of new opportunities have opened up, and what should be the plan for the coming years to achieve “a pragmatic advent.” As part of this summit, a ‘campus ambassador programme’ will be launched, providing students with an opportunity to be more closely associated with the event. The campus ambassador will be the first contact between E-Summit and his/her college. One reason to consider becoming a campus ambassador is that of the experience it offers. In this role, students will have the opportunity to build their skills, get internship opportunities, an official certificate, win exciting gifts and event passes, the chance to organise events and a chance to interact with the speakers and entrepreneurs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/e-cell-of-iith-to-organise-e-summit/article33555088.ece
12 January 2021||SURYAPET,TELANGANA||‘BJP in Centre, TRS in State two sides of the same coin’||Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy on Monday described the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi at the State and the Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre as two sides of the same coin, which are working in a synchronisation to pursue anti-farmer and anti-people policies. “TRS supported several BJP moves such as demonetization, GST, election of various leaders and controversial legislation. While the PM brought the three laws, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao here has announced removal of procurement centres operated by IKP and PACS that purchase farmers’ produce at MSP,” he said. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said the friendship and understanding between the two parties was no more a secret, and the Congress party would continue its protest till the legislations are repealed and procurement centres are continued as usual. The Congress leader, along with others, participated in a protest at the District Collectorate here on Monday, to condemn the State decision on halting procurement of farm produce. He objected to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s statements that the State had suffered a loss of Rs. 7, 500 crore last season, towards procurement of agriculture produce. He said the government’s crop loan waiver, disbursed in four instalments did not help the situation, and non-encouragement of crop loan insurance had also exposed farmers’ crops to vagaries of weather. Asserting that IKPs and PACS centres, brought by the Congress in 2004, were for ensuring minimum support prices, Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said the party will intensify its stir across the State till procurement decisions are pro-farmer and all grains are purchased at MSP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-in-centre-trs-in-state-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/article33554949.ece
12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘SC panel formation won’t be purposeful’||With the Supreme Court on Monday stating that it intended to stay the implementation of the three agricultural laws and proposing to form a committee, protesting farmers at the Singhu border stated that they would not move from the protest site till the laws were repealed by the government. The farmers who have been protesting across Delhi’s borders for over 45 days now, said that formation of a committee would result in delaying the process and that they would accept nothing short of the laws being repealed. Litigation takes time Jagmeet Singh, a 22-year-old veterinarian from Patiala said, “We are here fighting for our rights. Litigation takes a lot of time and it may be decades before judgments are passed. Even earlier we have seen how cases, be it the 1984 riots case or other matters, have dragged on for several years. How can we depend on such provisions now? We do not want any committee or any commission of any sort. We will leave the protest site only after the laws are repealed.” Several of the agitating farmers also said that constitution of the committee as proposed by the apex court would be similar to the government “imposing” the new laws on the farmers. ‘PM should resign’ Malraz Singh, a farmer from Amritsar who owns around six acres of land said, “Why are the authorities imposing things on us which we do not want. We did not want the laws but the Centre was adamant on implementing the same. Now what are we supposed to do with a committee? After the manner in which the government has failed us, the Prime Minister should resign.” “The farmers are not going to move from here unless the laws are repealed and our demands are met,” said Mr. Singh, who had reached the Singhu border on the first day of the protest along with a group of 20 others. Jagdev Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Barnala district said, “The government should know that we are not going anywhere without the laws being repealed. No committee can be useful to us whatsoever.” Another farmer from Punjab’s Patiala, Sukhjeet Singh Sidhu said, “It looks like authorities are under the impression that they can form a committee and the farmers will retreat. But that is not the case as formation of a committee cannot be of any benefit to us. This will just end up dragging the matter for a longer period of time so that people end up leaving and going back to their villages. However, once people start leaving it will be very difficult to accumulate so many thousands of people together yet again. So we are not going to move as of now. We will move only when we are certain that the laws have been repealed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sc-panel-formation-wont-be-purposeful/article33554643.ece
12 January 2021||New Delhi,||Chandni Chowk facelift likely to take more time||A little over a fortnight before it is scheduled to be showcased on a State tableau during the Republic Day celebrations, work related to the Chandni Chowk Redevelopment Project on a 1.3-km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Mosque is visibly far from being completed, The Hindu found during a visit on Friday. Consecutive junctions along the entire length of the corridor — sought to be pedestrianised and kept out of bounds for motorised traffic for most part of the day — are disconnected from the main road which continues to be used by two-wheelers, the dusty central verge has been occupied by the homeless and lights are yet to be installed on a significant portion of the boulevard. Underground work related to water and sewage pipelines was under way at the very beginning of the stretch adjacent to the Shri Digambar Jain Lal Mandir on Netaji Subhash Marg; on the opposite side of the street, the façade of the Bhagirath Place market was still being worked upon among a teeming rush of shoppers. In August last year, The Hindu had reported on the progress of the initiative which has its roots in a cultural event organised in 1998 and at least a dozen government agencies engaged in one way or the other with it. Though there has been some visible progress since, the project is far from completion. Delay due to pandemic Initially scheduled to be completed till March, 2020, the project, like most others, encountered delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was then supposed to be completed by the end of December, 2020. The 1.3-km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid is to be turned into a vehicle-free zone between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., allowing only non-motorised vehicles, have tree-lined footpaths on either side of the road as well as a wide central verge and seating space for visitors. Most of the work is being done in red sandstone keeping the Mughal-era architectural style in mind; LED streetlighting is also a part of the plan according to which all overhead wires have been taken underground and sewer lines have been rehabilitated. While most of the work was only visible till Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib till the end of August last year, red sandstone has reached much farther towards the Fatehpuri Mosque side by now — but not without the odd power transformer yet to be shifted, or gaps in the stone to be filled after the removal of electricity wires or the shutting of an underground drain. Access points to most areas abutting the stretch such as Nai Sarak have heavy construction equipment parked on top of layers of rubble, mud and garbage. Some part of the road is cordoned off due to the ongoing work shifting the entire flow of pedestrian, and usually two-wheeler, traffic completely onto the opposite carriageway. “The issue is not only creation but also maintenance of the infrastructure being created at a significant cost. In Chandni Chowk, we are now facing serious issues of post-maintenance; the homeless have taken over the redeveloped areas after the lockdown. I have made several requests to the government as well as Delhi Police but nothing has been done,” Sanjay Bhargava, president, Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, complained. Revised estimates The improvement of arterial roads and inner streets, a government official said citing a meeting presided over by Public Works Department (PWD) Minister Satyendar Jain in his capacity as chairman of the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) on December 29, will be taken up after the PWD submits revised estimates. In addition to this, the official said, the façade restoration of buildings in the vicinity, a majority of which are heritage structures, is part of phase 2 of the project which is being done simultaneously with the ongoing work. Delhi’s Republic Day tableau — showcasing the Chandni Chowk project — has been accorded approval by the Ministry of Defence, marking the Capital’s return to the festivities on Rajpath after three years. It will not only be the only other “live” tableau apart from the Ram Temple-themed Uttar Pradesh float, but also, featuring mini contingents of four cyclists each riding along on either side of it in a symbolic bid to promote it as a means of commuting in a megacity, possibly have bicycles on Rajpath as part of a State float for the first time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/chandni-chowk-facelift-likely-to-take-more-time/article33554636.ece

The painting by Praveen Kumar has been installed near the main stage at the protest site. Mr. Kumar who completed the 300-km journey in his modified two-wheeler said, “I came to join the protest along with my nephew. While I started the painting back at home, some parts were left empty and I intend to complete it at the protest site itself.” Depicts various stages The painting is a depiction of the various stages that the farmers’ agitation has gone through in the last few months, explained Mr. Kumar who plans to be at the protest site for at least three days. “I have tried to capture the various episodes involved in this movement. The farmers first stopped trains, then moved to the Haryana border where they had to overcome barricades by breaking them and move forward. It also includes portraits of farmers from Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan among other States, apart from images of the elderly and children who have also played major roles in the agitation,” said Mr. Kumar. Meanwhile, heating pads were also distributed among women and elderly farmers by members of the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee, to protect them from the cold. DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, “Around 1,000 such heating pads have been procured. While 500 have been distributed at the Singhu border, around 300 have been sent to the Tikri border.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh permitted the medical termination of the woman’s pregnancy based on the board’s report and disposed of her plea. On January 7, the court had asked AIIMS to constitute a medical board to examine the woman and give a report on the feasibility of terminating her pregnancy. The woman stated that an ultrasonography at the gestational age of 27 weeks 5 days found that the foetus suffered from anencephaly, making it incompatible with life. In India, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act stipulates a ceiling of 20 weeks for termination of pregnancy, beyond which abortion of a foetus is statutorily impermissible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-nod-to-terminate-28-week-pregnancy/article33554632.ece

12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pace of ownership rights scheme in illegal colonies needs to pick up: Puri||Housing and Urban Affairs (HUA) Minister Hardeep Puri on Monday said the pace of the PM-UDAY scheme — for granting ownership rights for properties in Delhi’s unauthorised colonies — needed to pick up as only around 3,000 conveyance deeds and authorisation slips had been issued since it was launched in December 2019. The scheme was targeted towards the 50 lakh residents of unauthorised colonies in the Capital, which was expected to yield eight lakh applications, said Mr. Puri. However, as on January 1, 3.6 lakh people had registered on the Delhi Development Authority’s portal for the scheme and 1,487 conveyance deeds and 1,659 authorisation slips had been issued, according to data shared by Mr. Puri. Asked about the progress of the scheme on Monday, Mr. Puri said the number of registrations would have been higher if not for the pandemic. He said the DDA would be coming out with development control norms for these colonies by March. Without development control norms on one hand and protection from demolition accorded via the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, Mr. Puri said the residents of the colonies did not have “the same incentive to register”. He said the matter was reviewed when the government recently decided to extend the protections under the Act, which was set to expire on December 31, 2020, for another three years. “We have reviewed it. The pace needs to pick up a bit”. HUA Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said the DDA was working on a strategy and would be holding public consultations regarding the development control norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/pace-of-ownership-rights-scheme-in-illegal-colonies-needs-to-pick-up-puri/article33554905.ece
12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Education reforms have impacted learning outcomes’||The seven-day Delhi Education Conference began on Monday with an independent report on the Delhi government’s education reforms since 2015 being released by the Boston Consulting Group. In its report, the American management consulting committee said that the education reforms have definitely had an impact on learning outcomes as CBSE Board results have shown a steady increase and that there is improvement in Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) outcomes in Classes 6 to 8 as well, although much remains to be done. “New curricular elements such as Happiness Curriculum (HC) and Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum (EMC) have been received positively. Student attendance is improving and students also attested to increased teacher attendance and engagement during focus group discussions (FGDs),” the report said. It pointed out that the true impact of Delhi’s reforms has been vitalising the entire system and infusing a sense of renewed aspiration, belief, and deep motivation into every stakeholder. Deputy Chief Minister and Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that although a lot has been done to strengthen the infrastructure of schools in Delhi and improve quality of education via teacher training and better school management, the real result still remains to be achieved. “The real success will be when every child leaves the school with a passion to do something for their country and commit to driving a change,” Mr. Sisodia said. Mr. Sisodia also said that in the post-COVID scenario when schools reopen, the school management committees would play a major role. “We want to focus on amplifying the role of SMCs in the post-COVID era, and bridge the gap between parents and schools further,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/education-reforms-have-impacted-learning-outcomes/article33554638.ece

The film includes candid interviews of parents, therapists, their day-to-day activities like swimming classes, horse-riding and music lessons; their special moments with parents. “I have tried to move away from clinical analysis and understanding. There is too much of it everywhere, anyway. Rather, my take was to show them as regular kids who do have certain behavioural issues but nothing that cannot be handled or tackled to bring them within the folds of “normal” society,” Mr. Shreedhar said. “I chose three students who were autistic; followed them in their daily lives along with their parents in an effort to document their daily lived experiences and bring to the world snapshots of their lives that are extraordinary in all its ordinariness. Where simple acts of eating a fruit on his own, or asking for food on his own, completing school homework without help become little victories,” he said. He said he did not want a scripted narrative in the film; rather wanted the film to take a course of its own where he stitched the interviews together along with the activities, the therapy sessions to bring out the message. “It is a film that raises awareness of ASD not by preaching in moralistic terms or advising in clinical terms; but by busting myths and misconceptions and presenting their lives in all its honesty,” he said. “The message is of assimilation. We are all well aware of how autistic children are perceived; they are sidelined, treated as abnormal; often such children end up having no friends; they are not invited to birthday parties or social gatherings,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delving-into-the-world-of-autism/article33554556.ece
12 January 2021||Mumbai,||Farmers’ stir: coalition of Left parties, civil society groups to meet today||A coalition of Left parties and civil society groups from Maharashtra will be meeting on Tuesday to decide the road ahead in their ongoing agitation against the three farm laws. Dr. Ashok Dhawale, president, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) said, “We have given a call of protest across Maharashtra and the country. In Maharashtra, we have invited all like-minded organisations to come together and protest. We are yet to get the exact order passed by the Supreme Court, but we have decided to go ahead with the meeting on Tuesday.” Mr. Dhawale, who was in Mumbai for a meeting with the State unit of the AIKS, said farm laws were not only going to affect farmers alone but also every citizen of the country. “The BJP understands the language of votes and nothing else. Today, they see it as a problem limited to Punjab and Haryana. Based on Lok Sabha seats in these two States, they refuse to take the protest seriously. We will be ensuring that the BJP is answered in a language it understands,” he said. Mr. Dhawale said in States like Maharashtra, AIKS is inviting labour unions, civil society groups and political parties with secular ideals to join the meeting. He said farmer leaders like Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana chief Raju Shetti and leaders of the Peasants and Workers Party will be attending the meeting, which will be organised at Bhupesh Gupta Bhavan in Prabhadevi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farmers-stir-coalition-of-left-parties-civil-society-groups-to-meet-today/article33554554.ece

12 January 2021||Mumbai,||Overhaul healthcare system, says Sena||The Shiv Sena on Monday said nothing will come out of the Centre just expressing grief over the death of infants in a fire in a Bhandara hospital in Maharashtra and asked it to work on the healthcare system as happened during ex-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehrus regime. In the editorial of its mouthpiece Saamana , the Shiv Sena also accused the Opposition BJP in the State of seeking to exploit the tragedy for political gains and termed the act as height of brazenness. The Sena said it does not depict a good picture that government health machinery is claiming lives of children in rural areas when industrial agreements worth 20 lakh crores are being inked in the State. The Sena called for an audit of the entire healthcare system of Maharashtra and, without naming Health Minister Rajesh Tope, said heshould ensure that the machinery works beyond handling COVID-19 situation too. “The Centre has expressed grief over the incident. What will happen by (only) expressing grief?” it asked. “(It) should play a little less politics, stop splurging on elections and work on the healthcare system as had happened during Pandit Nehrus regime,” the paper added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/overhaul-healthcare-system-says-sena/article33554561.ece

The fire reportedly broke out at around 1.30 a.m. and the hospital administration could rescue only seven out of the 17 children kept in the ward,” the NHRC said in a statement. The Commission has issued notices to the State chief secretary and Director General of Police, seeking a detailed report within four weeks, the officials said. The report must contain the fire audit reports of various hospitals in the State as well as measures that have been taken or contemplated to be taken by the State against the erring or negligent officers and officials so that they cannot go on with impunity, the statement said. The Commission has also observed that the babies were in the custody of a State-run hospital where they lost their lives, and “hence, the Atate cannot escape its responsibility”.

Currently, water is being supplied for drinking purpose through existing four tube wells, which is being maintained and regulated by the Residents Welfare Association.

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. House likely to consider impeaching Trump this week||The U.S House of Representatives plans to vote on a resolution on Monday to ask Vice- President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment, a statute by which the President — Donald Trump — can be removed on grounds of incapacitation. This comes days after Mr. Trump’s supporters attacked the Capitol building. If Mr. Pence does not invoke the statute, the House will consider impeaching Mr. Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to fellow House Democrats on Sunday evening (U.S. time). “In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both. As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. Given Mr. Pence’s apparent hesitation to invoke the 25th Amendment, it is highly likely the House will seek to impeach Mr. Trump this week. There are 10 days left in Mr. Trump’s term and if impeached, he will the first President to be impeached twice. If convicted in the Senate, Mr. Trump could be barred from running for office again in the future. Several Democrats plan to introduce impeachment resolutions on Monday. One resolution, which will be introduced by Rhode Island Congressman David Cicilline, Maryland’s Jamie Raskin and California’s Ted Lieu includes a charge of “ incitement of insurrection” against Mr. Trump. At least 210 of 222 House Democrats have signed on to this, as per The New York Times . It is theoretically possible that if Mr. Trump is impeached on Tuesday, the articles could be sent to the Senate for trial as early as Wednesday. However, the new administration and Congress will need to focus on a COVID-19 response and Cabinet appointments and House Democrats may delay sending the charges to the Senate, where the trial has to begin immediately. Democratic Whip, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, told the CNN that they might not send the articles to the Senate until after 100 days of the Biden administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-house-likely-to-consider-impeaching-trump-this-week/article33554213.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Democrats introduce article of impeachment against Trump||Democrats in the House of Republicans introduced an article of impeachment against U.S. President Donald Trump — the “incitement of insurrection” for his role in the attack on the Capitol last Wednesday. The House could vote on this charge on Wednesday. House Republicans blocked a measure on asking Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment, a statute by which the President can be removed on grounds of incapacitation. The measure will go to the full House floor for a vote. On Sunday evening, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi articulated a plan to go ahead with the impeachment of Mr. Trump if Vice-President Mike Pence did not invoke the 25th Amendment. “In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both. As the days go by, the horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action,” Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to her fellow House Democrats.

Democratic Whip James E. Clyburn told CNN that House Democrats might not send the articles to the Senate until after 100 days of the Biden administration.

"We have repeatedly told... the intervening parties, whether they are the United States or France, that the case does not concern them at all and that they will not help to solve a technical problem if they politicise it," said foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized the Hankuk Chemi and arrested its multinational crew of 20 near the strategic Strait of Hormuz one week ago. The move came as Tehran urged Seoul to release billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen in South Korea as part of U.S. sanctions. The U.S. and France have called for Iran to release the ship. A U.S. State Department spokesperson called the seizure "part of a clear attempt to extort the international community into relieving the pressure of sanctions". South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun arrived in Tehran on Sunday with an aim to “negotiate an early release" of the tanker and its crew.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-warns-against-action-over-seized-south-korean-vessel/article33554209.ece

Earlier, the V-C had said he had instructed the university’s administrative staff to remove the memorial — a sculpture of hands crying out of help — erected two years ago to commemorate the victims of Sri Lanka’s civil war. The decision, he said, followed “instructions” from authorities, including Defence, Intelligence, Education Ministry officials, on grounds that it was an “unauthorised structure”. The University Grants Commission said the memorial at the Jaffna University threatened “north-south unity”. Demolition slammed The removal of the structure, dedicated to victims of the final phase of the civil war, triggered spontaneous students protests, drawing national and international attention. Many, including other national student bodies, slammed the move, that they said curbed Tamils’ right to remember their loved ones. “After this became a big issue, I got messages from authorities, asking me to take steps,” Prof. Srisatkunarajah said. Asked if the structure, termed “unauthorised”, had been authorised now, he said it had been cleared “in principle”. “We have to later work out the design and form it will take. It will be something that marks peace, not war.” The Jaffna-based Uthayan newspaper reported that the Pradeshya Sabha, or local administrative body in Nallur, Jaffna on Monday granted permission to erect a memorial on campus. Meanwhile, businesses and shops across the north and east observed a hartal on Monday, protesting the demolition, local media reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/memorial-on-campus-will-be-built-again-jaffna-university-v-c/article33554211.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||WHO experts to visit China to trace origins of COVID-19||Chinese authorities said on Monday a team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) will arrive in China on Thursday to study the origins of COVID-19. The trip had been scheduled for last week, but some members of the team were at the last minute told the trip would be delayed. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week he was “very disappointed” China had not permitted the trip, in rare criticism of Beijing from the agency. ‘Joint research’ China’s National Health Commission said the team will arrive on Thursday “to conduct joint research with Chinese scientists on the origin-tracing of the novel coronavirus”. The WHO Director-General welcomed the announcement on Twitter: “We look forward to working closely with our [Chinese] counterparts on this critical mission to identify the virus source and its route of introduction to the human population.” China’s Foreign Ministry said during the visit, “The international experts will hold exchanges with Chinese scientists and medical experts over scientific cooperation in origin-tracing.” China’s decision to not permit the trip last week appeared to come at the last minute and catch the WHO by surprise, with some of the experts already having left home and in transit when told the visit would not take place. Investigations into the origins of the coronavirus have already become politicised. The WHO has been criticised, particularly by the United States, for its response to the pandemic and was described by President Donald Trump as being “China-centric” and “a puppet of China”. China’s authorities, for their part, have suggested they will control how much access international scientists will have and that its scientists will have a say in how the investigations go forward. Scientists in China, who have been working on tracing the origins, have been told that any studies will have to be vetted by the authorities, while some scientists there have put forward studies suggesting the virus was circulating in other countries, such as Italy, before it came to China. Chinese officials and State media have in recent months backed a narrative suggesting COVID-19 may have originated elsewhere but was first ‘detected’ in Wuhan. Focus on Wuhan That is not the consensus of most scientists, and the WHO team is likely to focus on Wuhan in its origin-tracing mission. In November, Michael Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said it would be “highly speculative” for WHO “to say the disease did not emerge in China”. “It is clear from a public health perspective that you start your investigations where the human cases first emerged,” he said. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Monday China had “maintained close communication and cooperation with WHO on global origin-tracing in an open, transparent and responsible manner”. “In February and July last year, despite the arduous task of prevention and control, China invited WHO experts twice,” he said. “Chinese experts and WHO and international experts also held frequent interactions through video-conference and seminars, sharing the outcomes China has achieved and the global progress in origin-tracing in a candid and science-based manner. The two sides also jointly formulated the China part of a global plan for scientific cooperation on origin-tracing. “The two sides have reached a basic consensus on origin-tracing, which is a scientific issue that should be jointly studied by scientists all over the world,” said Mr. Zhao. “As new developments emerge, our knowledge of the virus deepens and more early cases are found, it is highly likely that origin-tracing will involve many countries and localities, and WHO will need to pay similar visits to other countries and regions as the need arises.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/who-experts-to-visit-china-to-trace-origins-of-covid-19/article33554219.ece
12 January 2021||New York,||Author Ved Mehta passes away in the U.S.||Celebrated Indian-American novelist Ved Mehta, who overcame blindness and became widely known as the 20th century writer most responsible for introducing American readers to India, has died at the age of 86.  The New Yorke r magazine, where he had been a staff writer for 33 years, reported that Mehta died on Saturday. “Mehta, a writer for The New Yorker for more than thirty years, died at the age of eighty-six, on Saturday morning,” it said on Sunday. Born in pre-Partition Lahore to a well-off Punjabi family in 1934, Mehta lost his eyesight when he was three years old to meningitis. He, however, did not let his challenge get in the way of a flourishing career or stop him from showcasing his literary prowess to the world. “I felt that blindness was a terrible impediment, and that if only I exerted myself, and did everything my big sisters and big brother did, I could somehow become exactly like them,” he wrote. Best known for his 12-volume memoir, which focused on the troubled modern history of India and his early struggles with blindness, Mehta’s 24 books included volumes of reportage on India, among them Walking the Indian Streets (1960), Portrait of India (1970) and Mahatma Gandhi and His Apostles (1977), as well as explorations of philosophy, theology and linguistics. “Ved Mehta has established himself as one of the magazine’s most imposing figures,” The New Yorker ’s stories editor William Shawn, who hired him as a staff writer in 1961, told The New York Times in 1982. “He writes about serious matters without solemnity, about scholarly matters without pedantry, about abstruse matters without obscurity.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/author-ved-mehta-who-took-india-to-americans-dies/article33554272.ece
12 January 2021||Rome,||Pope says women can read at Mass, but still can’t be priests||Pope Francis changed church law on Monday to explicitly allow women to do more things during Mass, while continuing to affirm that they cannot be priests. The Pope amended the law to formalise and institutionalise what is common practice in many parts of the world: that women can read the Gospel and serve on the altar as eucharistic ministers. Previously, such roles were officially reserved to men even though exceptions were made. The pontiff said he was making the change to increase recognition of the “precious contribution” women make in the church, while emphasising that all baptised Catholics have a role to play in the church’s mission. But he also noted that doing so further makes a distinction between “ordained” ministries such as the priesthood and diaconate, and ministries open to qualified laity. The Vatican reserves the priesthood for men. The change comes as Pope Francis remains under pressure to allow women to be deacons — ministers who perform many of the same functions as priests, such as presiding at weddings, baptisms and funerals. Currently, the ministry is reserved for men.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pope-says-women-can-read-at-mass-but-still-cant-be-priests/article33554217.ece

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Reframing India’s foreign policy priorities||The year 2021 should see a cementing of the many trends that had their genesis in 2020. Leadership change in the United States is perhaps the most awaited change, but is unlikely to bring about a major power shift in the international arena. Even before the changeover, and despite the promise of a Biden presidency to invigorate the U.S.-Europe axis, Europe has turned its back on the U.S. and revived its China links, by ‘concluding in principle the negotiations for an EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment’. In one swift move, Europe has thus shattered all hope that China would remain ostracised in 2021.  Many countries will now find themselves scrambling for cover. India which has greatly curtailed its relations with China since April 2020, (in the wake of Chinese aggression in Eastern Ladakh) will find itself ‘out on a limb’, with many countries likely to seek closer economic relations with China now.  A stronger China The year 2021, hence, begins on a triumphal note for China and China’s Supreme Leader, Xi Jinping. China is about the only major country which had a positive rate of growth at the end of 2020, and its economy is poised to grow even faster in 2021. Militarily, China has further strengthened itself, and now seeks to dominate the Indo-Pacific Ocean with its announcement of the launch of its third aircraft carrier in 2021. Simultaneously, it is seeking to strengthen its military coordination with Russia. Consequent on all this, and notwithstanding Chinese intransigence in several matters including its heavy-handed actions in Hong Kong and Uighur, China’s position across Asia is, if anything, stronger than in 2020. News emanating from China is that President Xi will further cement his position, both as Party leader and as President during 2021, despite internecine tensions within the Communist Party of China. China is, hence, unlikely to concede any ground to its opponents across the world in 2021, a fact that India will need to reckon with. It cannot expect any Chinese concessions in Eastern Ladakh, until India ‘makes amends’.  Economy first for Europe The new year will be dominated by strong authoritarian leaders like Xi Jinping in China, Vladimir Putin in Russia, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey. International politics may not be very different from that in 2020, but any hope that the Compact of Democracy would emerge stronger will need to be eschewed. Europe, minus Britain following Brexit, and the retirement of Germany’s Angela Merkel, could become even less relevant in world affairs. The China-EU Investment Treaty which saw Europe capitulating to China’s brandishments is an indication that Europe values its economy more than its politics. Major changes are afoot in Eurasia and West Asia which could lead to significant shifts. Russia is beginning to display greater interest in the affairs of countries on its periphery and, together with strengthening ties with China and reaching an entente with Turkey, this seems to signal reduced interest in countries such as India. In West Asia, the Abraham Accords, leading to a realignment of forces in the Arab world, have sharpened the division between the Saudi Bloc and Iran-Turkey. Despite the hype surrounding the Abraham Accords, the situation, however, remains fluid and has not reduced the risk of a confrontation between Iran and Israel. This does pose problems for India, since both have relations with it. Meanwhile, China demonstrates a willingness to play a much larger role in the region, including contemplating a 25-year strategic cooperation agreement with Iran.  Saudi Arabia could find the going difficult in 2021, with a Biden Administration taking charge in Washington. The healing of wounds among the Sunni Arab states in the region should be viewed as a pyrrhic victory at best for Saudi Arabia. One by-product of this could be a sharpening of hostilities between the Sunni and Shia camps. Given the strategic flux in the region, Iran could well be tempted to use its nuclear capability to enhance its position, confident that the West may be unwilling to challenge it at this juncture.  India isolated At the start of 2021, India seems the odd man missing as far as these developments are concerned. No breakthrough in Sino-Indian relations has, or is likely to occur, and the confrontation between Indian and Chinese armed forces is expected to continue. India currently plays no significant role in West Asia. India-Iran relations today lack warmth. In Afghanistan, India has been marginalised as far as the peace process is concerned. While India’s charges against Pakistan of sponsoring terror have had some impact globally, it has further aggravated tensions between the two neighbours, and in the process, also helped Pakistan to cement its relations with China. While hostility between India and Nepal appears to have reduced lately, relations continue to be strained. Through a series of diplomatic visits, India has made valiant efforts to improve relations with some of its neighbours such as Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka, but as of now worthwhile results are not evident. One key takeaway is that as India-China relations deteriorate, India’s neighbours are not averse to taking sides, increasing India’s isolation.  Whether India’s perceived marginalisation from global mainstream events as we enter 2021 signifies a sharp drop-off in its foreign policy capabilities is, no doubt, debatable. India’s foreign policy objectives are to widen its sphere of influence, enhance its role across nations, and make its presence felt as an emerging power in an increasingly disruptive global system. It is a moot point though whether any of these objectives has been achieved. Today, India’s voice and counsel are seldom sought, or listened to. This is a far cry from what used to happen previously. India will serve as the president of the powerful UN Security Council for the month of August, 2021, but if it is to make a real impact, it must be seen to possess substantial weight to shape policies, more so in its traditional areas of influence.  Diplomacy and perceptions Many explanations could be available for this state of affairs. Admittedly, our diplomats conduct their activities with a high degree of competence, but they are possibly hampered by other factors. One, could be the kind of policy choices the country has adopted in the recent period, which have possibly altered the perception of India in certain quarters. There is again a perception that India’s closeness to the U.S. has resulted in the weakening of its links with traditional friends such as Russia and Iran, impacting the country’s image. Perhaps the most relevant explanation could be the shifting balance of power in the region in which India is situated, notably the rise of China, and the enlarging conflict between the two biggest powers in Asia, compelling many nations to pick sides in the conflict.  A less obvious, but perhaps more relevant aspect, could also be that India’s foreign policy suffers from an ideational vacuum. It is not the sharp decline in the economy, problems caused on account of the pandemic, or the growing polarisation in values across nations and societies, but more possibly India’s inability or failure in the ideational realm that lies at the root of our foreign policy inadequacies.  More misses than hits Currently, India remains isolated from two important supranational bodies of which it used to be a founding member, viz. , the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Efforts to whip up enthusiasm for newer institutions such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), have hardly been successful. India has opted out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) (a majority of Asian countries are members), and failed to take advantage of the RIC, or the Russia, India and China grouping, even as relations with Russia and China have deteriorated. On the other hand, India’s foreign policy imperatives, across Asia and South Asia in particular, today seem to be a mixture of misplaced confidence, sometimes verging on hubris (as in the case of Nepal), a lack of understanding of the sensitivities of neighbours such as Bangladesh and long-time friends (such as Vietnam and Iran), and according excessive importance to the policy needs and pressures of nations such as the U.S. There is possibly a misplaced perception in much of Asia that the India of today is not unwilling to sacrifice its strategic autonomy under U.S. pressure.  As part of the ideational restructuring of India’s foreign policy, what is urgently required, apart from competent statecraft, is the adoption of prudent policies, pursuit of realistically achievable objectives, and, above all, a demonstration of continuity of policy, irrespective of changes in the nature of the Administration. These may be time consuming, but are a surer recipe for success in attaining foreign policy objectives. M.K.

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Arrow’s Paradox in the age of social media||The mechanics of all elections are flawed. Each country has different rules regarding its voting systems, and each set of rules is necessarily a compromise. Some countries use ‘first past the post’ systems, while others use electoral colleges. Yet others use referendums where two choices are pitted against one another, such as the Brexit vote.  The influence of the minority The mathematician Kenneth Arrow laid bare the flaws in elections. Arrow’s doctoral thesis, completed in the 1950s, identified that in any electoral system where three or more preferences exist, a curious paradox comes into play: proponents of the minority voice can dictate the broader choice. His finding is now called Arrow’s Paradox. This can be illustrated with an example. Let’s say a population participates in an election in which candidate ‘A’ says let’s go to war and candidate ‘B’ says let’s not go to war. While there are only two choices (war or peace), the voting populace may be distributed along three lines: the first category comprising the hawks who are in a minority but want war; while the other two categories, the majority of the voters, comprising those who don’t want war. The majority is more or less evenly split into the doves who prefer not to go to war ever and the realists who don’t want to go to war unless it’s absolutely necessary. In an election where only two choices can be made, the hawk minority, which wants war, can dictate the outcome by convincing the realists (who believe in not going to war unless absolutely necessary) that war is actually needed at this moment. Note that this isn’t the minority swing vote which causes a ‘tipping point’ in an election; it is a systematic way for a minority to go about setting a voting agenda such that it carries the day. The Internet, and especially social media, help this minority instigate a large part of the populace. This is a more recent development that boosts Arrow’s Paradox to levels hitherto unheard of. The recent U.S. presidential election and its aftermath is an example. In today’s digital world, humans are constantly bombarded with messaging of all kinds, and our attention spans have dwindled. We make up our minds in ever smaller bits of time — often within the first few seconds of viewing an Internet-based message or video. Most readers would have experienced this phenomenon. Research has been dedicated to this phenomenon and books have been written about it. Adam Alter, the author of Irresistible – The Rise of Addictive Technology and The Business of Keeping Us Hooked, said in an interview to the U.S.’s National Public Radio: “Ten years ago, before the iPad and iPhone were mainstream, the average person had an attention span of about 12 seconds.” Now, he says, “research suggests that there has been a drop from 12 to 8 seconds — shorter than the attention span of the average goldfish, which is 9 seconds.” As recent events around the U.S. election have proved, newly online populaces do not have the ability to discriminate or adequately process what they see online. Ancient scripture advocates “ shravanam, mananam, nidhidhyaasanam ” (listen, continuously reflect on what you heard, and then deeply contemplate what you heard before arriving at the truth). But today’s combination of shortened attention spans, the relentless bombardment of messaging, and the indisputable mathematics of Arrow’s proofs make for an incendiary mix. This is true even in the most technologically advanced regions such as the State of California in the U.S. Vote on Proposition 22 For instance, during a U.S. presidential election, other referendum choices are also on the ballot in each State. Given last year’s circus, many of these issues, some of them pivotal, got relegated to the back seat. One such issue was California’s referendum on Proposition 22, which was critically important to companies such as Uber and Lyft. These gig economy businesses that use ‘casual’ workers had threatened to leave the State if the measure was not voted in. These businesses wanted their drivers to be classified as contractors and not as employees. California is a left-leaning State and voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden. It is also the undisputed tech capital of the U.S. Yet, Proposition 22 made it through. The gig economy ride-hailing apps spent over $200 million to win. Those opposed to it could only muster about a tenth of that sum. Bigger money paid off. Over 58% of California’s voters opted to continue classifying drivers at these services as contractors, seemingly acting after mere shravanam , without the additional steps needed after that to get to the truth. Employee classification would have given rise to a slew of labour rights that today’s gig workers do not enjoy as ‘independent contractors’. Workers will not have the same rights as other employees to paid sick days, overtime pay, unemployment insurance or a workplace covered by occupational safety and health laws. California’s Assembly had tried to head this off earlier with a law of its own called Assembly Bill 5, which would have guaranteed these rights. California’s voters seem to have been won over by misleading campaigns run before the election to sway voters’ opinions in this otherwise left-leaning State. They were bombarded with emails, glossies, text messages and video spots. Gig companies put out messages that in the first few seconds promised that they would pay their contractors more than the minimum wage. This appears to have caught voters’ attention and led them to act without stopping to reflect on what was the real truth. The truth, at least according to the National Employment Law Project (NELP), was that someone driving an average of 35 km every hour in a 40-hour work week would make $287 less per week if Proposition 22 passed. The NELP says a “permanent underclass of workers” has now been created. Gig businesses will take heart from the victory in California and hope to replicate this success across the U.S. (and beyond its shores). Emboldened by the result in California, Uber and the other companies will move similar legislation in other U.S. States and possibly other countries. It is certain that there will be future attempts at influencing elections using both intense messaging which takes advantage of our shortened attention spans as well as the setting of agendas of electoral choice which Arrow first described. We should learn from such issues in India. Enlightened legislation may be needed.

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Dialogues for democracy, lessons from Rajasthan||It is 45 days and counting since lakhs of farmers have gathered in Delhi protesting against the farm laws. Leaving aside the merits and demerits of the laws, many are aggrieved about the process of promulgation of the laws as it lacked any consultation with those that the laws are purportedly meant to serve. Very often, policy makers ignore the need for dialogue and deliberation with beneficiaries. Consultations are needed during the initial stages of law making of a government programme as much as a continuous dialogic exercise must be the norm for effective programme implementation. Even when policies are anchored in good principles, their implementation is often messy and requires iterations based on people’s concerns. In particular, redistributive, people-facing welfare policies need constant feedback. We illustrate this through an example of the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in Rajasthan. Rajasthan has a healthy tradition of consulting with worker groups and civil society organisations not only in the initial stage of policy formulation but also to take continuous feedback from the field and carry out periodic midway course corrections. In the case of MGNREGA, engagement with civil society organisations had been institutionalised in the MGNREGA samvads ; some of which were attended by the Chief Minister of Rajasthan. MGNREGA wages are now directly credited from the central government to a worker’s bank account. While there is a case to be made for direct transfers, this system is not without its pitfalls. An overreliance on the technical architecture of MGNREGA has subverted workers’ rights. The troubles are compounded when things go wrong as workers run from pillar to post knocking on the doors of various government officials, banks, payment disbursement agencies, panchayat officials, etc. Issue of payment rejections One such vexing problem is that of payment rejections which are like bounced cheques. These occur when the government initiates the payment, but money does not get credited due to technical issues. There are numerous reasons for rejections and their resolutions require a thorough understanding of the complex payment architecture that not only involves various line departments and banks but also the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Workers are bereft of their own money unless the core underlying problems are successfully addressed. For example, on occasions, the block level data entry operators make errors in entering the account or Aadhaar details of workers. At other times, banks consider accounts as ‘dormant’ when the accounts are not used for some time. Software flaws While these are somewhat tractable, a very common rejection reason called ‘Inactive Aadhaar’ is more complex to resolve. This happens when the linkage of the worker’s Aadhaar and their bank account is broken in the software maintained by the NPCI. Let alone workers, many government officials and bank officials are unaware of how to resolve these errors. Short-staffed and overcrowded banks mean that workers have to make multiple trips to banks only to be told rudely that their ‘payments have not come’. Field officials often resort to temporary and incorrect quick fixes which backfire leaving the workers in an abyss. Notwithstanding the range of hostilities workers face in the process, the reasons for rejections are rarely provided, thereby adding more uncertainty to their precarity. From the perspective of the administration, it is difficult to look into each payment, understand the reasons for rejection and help the worker take action on an individual basis. Guidelines after a workshop To resolve payment rejections, the Department of Rural Development of the Government of Rajasthan has held numerous discussions. These resulted in a workshop involving worker groups and civil society organisations who interacted directly with the aggrieved workers, administrative officers from the village level to the State level, and bankers. As the dialogue evolved, detailed guidelines were issued with well-defined responsibility, clear timelines, and monitoring and protocols to be followed by officials. This has resulted in a significant reduction in payment rejections in Rajasthan. In a period of one year from the workshop, the Rajasthan government was able to clear Rs. 380 crore worth of payments to workers that were earlier stuck due to rejections. Currently, only 2.7% payments are pending regeneration from the State government, and 12.3% are under process by the banks; the goal is to ensure that every person who has worked, gets their full payment on time. Open communication channels, an eagerness to work with worker groups and a keen ear to the ground have benefited thousands of MGNREGA workers in Rajasthan. The Right to Information (RTI) Act that had its origins in people’s movements in Rajasthan, mandated proactive disclosure of information. However, programme information on many occasions continues to be inaccessible and, when available, some are in ill-defined formats. This provision got a major boost in Rajasthan as the Rajasthan government launched the Jan Soochna Portal, or JSP (https://bit.ly/2LmKLmv), in 2019. The JSP is a single platform in the public domain providing information across 60 departments of over 104 schemes. The design and formats of each scheme have been painstakingly arrived at through a ‘digital dialogue’ involving government officials and numerous civil society organisations. The American civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said, ‘Deliberation and debate is the way you stir the soul of our democracy.’ Federalism and good governance require constant constructive engagement between people and officials. If a government is committed to constitutional principles, then paying attention to multiple points of view and listening to the voices of the marginalised is a prerequisite. While there is still a long way to go, the ongoing consultative experiences in Rajasthan do offer hope. Sakina Dhorajiwala is a Researcher with LibTech India.

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||A step back in gender equality||Is the electoral promise of paying women for carrying out domestic work and care work a progressive public policy? The proposal, put forth by Kamal Haasan’s political party, Makkal Needhi Maiam, has generated curiosity and reopened the old but unsettled academic debate. On the face of it, the proposal might appear progressive. However, closer scrutiny suggests otherwise. Disproportionate burden of work Women bear a disproportionately high burden of unpaid domestic work and care work in India. It would be instructive here to examine how Tamil Nadu, where the electoral promise is being made, fares vis-à-vis India. The all-India Time Use Survey (2019) says that 82% of females (six years and above) as against 24% of males from Tamil Nadu participate in unpaid domestic work. The huge disparity persists even if we look at the age group of 15-59 years: 90% of females and 24% of males participate in domestic work. A similar disparity prevails at the all-India level as well: 81% of females (six years and above) and 26% of males participate in unpaid domestic work. There is an equally huge disparity in the average time spent by participating males and females. While females (six years and above) in Tamil Nadu spend, on average, 261 minutes a day in unpaid domestic work, males spend only 91 minutes. The corresponding figures for females and males in India are 299 minutes and 97 minutes, respectively. The data suggest that females bear more than 83% of the burden of domestic and care work both in Tamil Nadu and India. Can the proposed policy address the huge burden that women are forced to endure daily? Posed differently, what should a progressive policy proposal aim at: paying women a wage for domestic and care work or addressing the huge gender disparity? The insights offered by the feminist economist Diane Elson (2017) are pertinent. The gist of her argument is this: public policy should aim at closing the huge gender gap in unpaid domestic and care work through ‘recognition, reduction and redistribution’ (Triple-R). The party’s proposal only satisfies the first component of Triple-R, that is ‘recognition’. Paying a wage is a formal recognition of the fact that unpaid domestic and care work are no less important than paid market work, as the latter is parasitic on the former. Since it is women who predominantly carry out unpaid domestic and care activities, often at the expense of their employment prospects and health, the monetary reward is a recognition of their contribution to the well-being of the household and the opportunities forgone by women. The proposal appears progressive, for this reason and to that measure. Failing two aspects If the broader aim of a progressive public policy is to close the gender gap in unpaid domestic and care work, how does the proposal measure up? Specifically, will paying women a wage for domestic and care work reduce their disproportionately huge daily burden? The proposal not only fails miserably in this aspect, but also has the potential to increase women’s burden. This is because paying monetary benefits carries with it the possible danger of formally endorsing the social norm that domestic and care work are ‘women’s work’, for which they are being paid. The purportedly progressive proposal thus has the risk of furthering the gender disparity in unpaid work within homes. What’s more, it also fails in the other crucial aspect of ‘redistribution’ of the burden of unpaid work. In fact, it might give space for men to claim that women are bound to do these unpaid activities as they are being compensated for the time spent or income foregone, and that women can at best expect men only to help but not participate daily in carrying out these activities. The fact that only 24% of men from Tamil Nadu participate in and spend less time than women on unpaid domestic work calls for a policy proposal that increases men’s participation and the time they spend in unpaid work at home. Instead of incentivising men to participate more in household work and reducing women’s burden by redistributing the responsibility, the current proposal might do the opposite. Incentivising men, monetarily or otherwise, to participate more and spend longer hours in carrying out unpaid domestic work is one thing, but paying women a wage for shouldering the primary responsibility is another. At best, the latter might help meet what the academic Caroline Moser referred to as ‘practical’ gender needs. But it cannot possibly address the ‘strategic’ gender needs of reducing and redistributing women’s burden. The electoral promise, therefore, lacks the transformative potential of achieving gender equality in sharing unpaid work.

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||A safety net||The Union Education Ministry’s directive to the States to launch a mission to avoid large-scale dropouts in schools in the coming year, partly by relaxing the detention policy, should end the anxiety of millions of students about their academic prospects. Managing schooling during COVID-19 has been a challenge, with UNESCO estimating that at the end of 2020, about 320 million students were locked out of schools globally. South and West Asia are among the regions where students are at highest risk of not returning to schools and tertiary institutions, along with sub-Saharan Africa. Assessing the problem is key to planning for 2021. The Indian school education system remains top-down in making policy, which may not advance educational reform, but the vast administrative resources can be used to quickly assess the pandemic’s impact on students, teachers and schools. The pandemic year has thus far witnessed apprehensive governments keeping the majority of school instruction online, and treading carefully when it comes to reopening campuses. They must prioritise the door-to-door surveys needed to identify students who are not in a position to return to classes when schools reopen, and whose economic circumstances have changed due to the pandemic’s impact on their families. Clearly, the priority should be to draw up a database, to plan incentives that will prevent dropouts. Education continues to be covered by a cess on tax, and the funds could be deployed in 2021 towards this objective, through the Centre’s Samagra Shiksha scheme and other COVID-19 relief plans. The irrevocable role played by examinations in determining the fate of students, who come from varied backgrounds and preparation, has long been criticised for its rigidity, and these arguments were raised afresh when the Centre removed the no-detention policy under the RTE Act a couple of years ago. In the year of the virus, asymmetries among groups of students stand aggravated, and any detention would be illogical and unjustified. Particular mention should be made of the situation for girls, whose enrolment in higher numbers has been achieved over the years with considerable effort, as well as children in less-urbanised States where access to schools is weak. When the pandemic had still not swept India in February last year, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said, among the reasons for children remaining out-of-school or dropping out were poverty, economic reasons, and ill-health. The economic factors have, over the past dozen months, been exacerbated by COVID-19, while the digital divide witnessed in online education became an unprecedented cause of deprivation. Moreover, vaccination cannot cover the bulk of the population quickly, and education can possibly achieve a semblance of normality only well into the next academic year. This is the time to create a safety net for education, letting no student fall through.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-safety-net/article33554190.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Bridging the Gulf||The Gulf reconciliation summit, in Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia, where the kingdom and its allies decided to end their blockade of Qatar, has brought to an end, for now, their long feud. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed the blockade and severed diplomatic ties, accusing the tiny Gulf country of supporting terrorism. They also issued 13 demands for it to be lifted, which included shutting down the Qatar-funded TV network, Al Jazeera, closing a Turkish military base and reducing diplomatic relations with Iran. Qatar did not budge despite the heavy economic cost. When the Saudi and Emirati airspaces were closed, Iran offered Qatar global connectivity. Al Jazeera is still live. And, Qatar has invited more Turkish troops, bolstering its ties with Ankara, which is eager to play a bigger role in West Asia. Moreover, it played an important role in the U.S.-Taliban deal and continued to host talks between Taliban representatives and the Afghan government. If the original Saudi plan was to isolate Qatar and make it kneel, it has backfired. And in the last weeks of the Trump administration, MBS and his allies seem to have realised their strategic folly. Qatar has made few concessions to reach the reconciliation. The 13 specific demands were replaced by a broad agreement on non-intervention in other countries’ internal affairs and cooperating to ensure regional stability and security, which can be open to different interpretations for different sides. After the summit, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry has said that the country had no intention of altering ties with Iran and Turkey. In practice, the Saudi side stepped down from its demands and made amends with an unshaken Qatar as a new President is going to assume power in the U.S. The Saudi U-turn could be the result of a genuine tactical rethink. The rift in the Gulf helped Iran and Turkey, Riyadh’s main rivals, while it failed to scuttle Qatar’s standing. Iran, reeling under U.S. sanctions, also got some financial relief from Qatari payouts for using its airspace. By lifting the air and sea blockades, the Saudis and the Emiratis could deny Iran of those funds and also try to put up a united Arab regional front as Joe Biden is preparing to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal. The Saudis may also be hoping that bridging the Gulf between two American allies would help them warm up to the Biden administration. While ending the feud is welcome, it cannot be overlooked that this unnecessary crisis was born out of an ill-thought-out Saudi-Emirati strategy of coercion. It reflects poorly on them. They should learn from the mistakes and build ties based on mutual interests and cooperation, not on threats and coercion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bridging-the-gulf/article33554191.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Decoding Cuba’s currency reforms||The devaluation of the Cuban peso (CUP) and the withdrawal of the convertible peso (CUC), the second currency of the country, neither of which can be traded internationally, caps Cuba’s gradual economic transition since the end of the Soviet Union. The reforms that came into force on January 1 aim to eliminate price distortions arising from multiple exchange rates and reduce Cuba’s dependence on imports of basic commodities. These conditions have been exacerbated by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, decline in the export of the nation’s famed medical services, the depletion of foreign exchange revenues from tourism, and the crippling impact of U.S. economic sanctions. As per the latest devaluation plan announced in December by President Miguel Diaz-Canel, the CUP’s artificial one-to-one parity with the U.S. dollar has been removed. The currency will instead trade at 24 pesos to the greenback and the CUC will be phased out in six months. The CUP is in circulation in the domestic economy and serves as the principal medium by which goods are priced and wages paid. A dual domestic currency During the turmoil in Cuba’s sugar industry and a plunge in nickel prices in the 1990s, a volatile CUP had fallen to 140 to the dollar. Against this backdrop, the CUC was introduced in 1994 as a unit of account and store of value, to prevent the country’s excessive reliance on the U.S. dollar following the end of the former Soviet Union. In recent years, this second currency has more or less steadied at one CUC to 24 CUPs in official exchange outlets and is the predominant mode of transaction for tourists and residents at high-end shopping outlets and other imported goods. Apart from the disparities attributed to the prevalence of a dual domestic currency, Havana has at times had to deftly deploy the surge in dollar remittances and tourism to bolster the peso, by legalising the greenback in the 1990s. It has also had to respond in kind to American sanctions at other instances, as when the government in 2004 imposed a 10% tax on the exchange of the dollar for CUCs. Last July, Havana scrapped the 10% surcharge in a sequel to the 2019 opening of stores trading principally in dollars. The recent shift is part of the government’s bid to boost dollar transactions alongside other hard currencies, especially after tourism was closed in the wake of the pandemic. There is concern that the circulation of hard money could reinforce the segmentation and distortions of the past that resulted from access to the CUC for public sector companies at preferential exchange rates. An important objective The country’s switch back to a single currency was an important objective in the economic transformation plan envisioned in the 2011 Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba under former President Raul Castro. Among the expected gains from a unified peso are transparency of firms in terms of costs and profits, higher economic productivity and incentives for exports. Experts have opined that a corresponding devaluation of the peso was a necessary first step to discontinue the dual currency. The government of President Diaz-Canel has sought to cushion the likely impact of high inflation resulting from the devaluation with a generous wage and pension hike for state employees, besides a roll-back of subsidies to state-owned firms. There are concerns, however, that it could still leave a sizeable private and informal sector labour force exposed. In addition, there is the real risk that the adverse effects from high prices could further incense protesters who have been demanding protection for civil liberties and artistic freedom following the detention of a well-known rap singer. Predictably, the government has been quick to dismiss the voicing of dissent as U.S. interference in Cuba’s internal affairs. Havana must take citizens along in order to implement the new reforms.

Mr. Trudeau was carrying a garland in his hand as he emerged from the special aircraft which brought him to the capital. On stepping down, he put it around Mrs. Gandhi’s neck – even before he was formally welcomed. An embarrassed Mrs. Gandhi shook hands with Mr. Trudeau. Protocol then took its course, with the Delhi Mayor, Mr. Hansraj Gupta, garlanding the bachelor Prime Minister. With disarming informality, he also embraced an Indian diplomat, who was a fellow-student with him at the London School of Economics. As he was being introduced to the officials, Mr. Trudeau spotted Mr. K.R. Narayanan, Joint Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, who had recently joined the Jawaharlal Nehru University for research on Nehru and non-alignment. Welcoming Mr. Trudeau, Mrs. Indira Gandhi told him that his visit had brought Canada closer to India. She said the task that confronted India was incomparable with that of any other country because of its vast population. Mr. Trudeau, in his reply, said his visit was indicative of the “lasting interest and friendship that unite our people.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/trudeau-garlands-pm/article33554200.ece
12 January 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Stretched valuations threaten stability’||Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das has flagged the growing disconnect between exuberant equity markets and real economic activity and warned that the ‘stretched valuations of financial assets’ threaten overall financial stability. “The disconnect between certain segments of financial markets and the real economy has been accentuating in recent times, both globally and in India,” Mr. Das wrote in his foreword to the RBI’s biannual Financial Stability Report (FSR), which was released on Monday. “Stretched valuations of financial assets pose risks to financial stability,” he cautioned. Pointing to the interconnected nature of the financial system, the RBI Governor urged banks and financial intermediaries to be cognisant of the risk. India’s stock markets have been on a tear since plunging to their lowest levels in more than three years in March in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic’s outbreak and ensuing lockdowns. As of Monday’s close, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex had appreciated almost 90% from its March 23, 2020, low. The pandemic could also trigger balance sheet impairments and capital shortfalls, especially as regulatory reliefs are rolled back, Mr. Das cautioned. ‘Obscure true picture’ “Congenial liquidity and financing conditions have shored up the financial parameters of banks, but it is recognised that the available accounting numbers obscure a true recognition of stress,” Mr. Das wrote. As per the FSR, the gross non-performing assets (GNPA) and net NPA (NNPA) ratios of banks fell to 7.5% and 2.1%, respectively, by September 2020. But the RBI warned that the withdrawal of pandemic-triggered reliefs could see a jump in bad loans at lenders. “The improvements were aided significantly by regulatory dispensations extended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Macro-stress tests for credit risk show that SCBs’ GNPA ratio may increase from 7.5% in September 2020 to 13.5% by September 2021 under the baseline scenario,” the RBI observed. ‘Ratio may escalate’ “If the macroeconomic environment deteriorates, the ratio may escalate to 14.8% under the severe stress scenario. These projections are indicative of the possible economic impairment latent in banks’ portfolios,” it said. “Consequently, maintaining the health of the banking sector remains a policy priority and preservation of the stability of the financial system is an overarching goal,” Mr. Das said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/stretched-valuations-threaten-stability/article33554180.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Steep steel prices hurt several sectors as China gorges on ore||With several automakers recently announcing price increases to offset input costs, steel prices have come under the spotlight. Steelmakers in turn have been impacted by surging global prices of iron ore, the main raw material, as demand from China has soared. And with Indian iron ore production having seen a dip in recent months, steel producers have been caught in a bind. “China’s focussed fiscal stimulus for the construction sector has led to a sustained and strong uptick in steel demand there,” said Arnab Hazra, deputy secretary-general, Indian Steel Association (ISA). “Steel demand in China is expected to cross the 1 billion [tonnes] mark for the first time [in 2020].” Market intelligence firm SteelMint said on Friday that Indian iron ore exports had doubled to 40.7 million tonnes (mt) in 2020, from the previous year’s 19.1 mt. Of this, China alone accounted for 38.1 mt versus the 16.6 mt that it imported from India in 2019. Iron ore exports are attractive for Indian miners because global prices are now at about $170 a tonne. “Earlier, iron ore touching $100 was news. $165-170 is a once-in-a-lifetime price,” said a steel industry official, requesting anonymity. Australia is a major trading partner for China but bilateral ties have run into rough weather after the former called for a probe into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Australian iron ore has so far been spared from higher duties and customs delays, as 60% of China’s requirements have traditionally come from the island nation. After record iron ore exports in October, Australia saw its figures dip 2.2% month-on-month in November, ostensibly due to the cyclone season when Australian port activity tends to get affected. “The global supply chain dynamics are being redefined by geopolitics,” said Srivats Ram. MD, Wheels India, which has seen a 20% increase in steel costs over the last 12 months. “[This] has affected the elasticity of response, especially at a time when there has been a severe contraction followed by a rapid increase in demand, with container availability and ramping up issues further congesting trade. Sudden changes in demand occurring at the same time have caused some disruptions in the demand-supply equilibrium globally,” he added. The other factor influencing iron ore supply and prices in India is a decline in production, especially at mines in Odisha. The ISA wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) last month flagged a dip in domestic iron ore production as a key factor that had left its members with little option but to raise steel prices. Iron ore output fell 30% from the year-earlier period to 92.1 mt in April-October 2020, it pointed out. The ISA also urged a temporary ban on iron ore exports and cited frequent increases in domestic iron ore prices by state-run NMDC as particularly impacting smaller steel producers – which account for about 40% of India’s 140 mt steel capacity.  ‘Obfuscating issue’ In a separate letter to the PMO, the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI) contended that the ISA was ‘obfuscating the issue’ and defended the iron ore sector’s actions. Local steel prices had risen ‘an unprecedented’ six times in November and December, FIMI said, arguing that it wasn’t necessary for the steel industry to raise local prices in line with international rates. FIMI also said that of the 33.4 mt of iron ore exported between April and October, 22 mt were of a grade that the local steel industry did not require as input material. A senior executive in a major steelmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed out that smaller steel players had not yet recovered from COVID-19 related lockdowns, either due to severe losses, poor working capital availability or lack of local iron ore availability. This had led to a shortage of construction steel, which is made mostly by secondary steel players. By mid-December, long product prices had risen 15% over June, Motilal Oswal Securities observed in a recent report. And ratings agency ICRA noted last week that realty developers may suffer a 5-6% hit on margins given rising steel prices. But prices may cool soon as China’s demand softens. “We anticipate that by the middle of 2021” iron ore and steel prices will ease, the industry official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/steep-steel-prices-hurt-several-sectors-as-china-gorges-on-ore/article33554177.ece
12 January 2021||new delhi,||Amazon again urges SEBI to suspend Future-RIL deal review||Amazon has written to SEBI again, apprising the regulator of the formation of the arbitration tribunal at SIAC while urging it to suspend the review of the Rs. 24,713-crore Future-RIL deal. It has also filed an appeal with the division bench of the Delhi High Court against the December 21 order of the single member bench, according to sources. The single-member bench of the Delhi HC had rejected Future Group’s plea to restrain Amazon from writing to regulatory authorities about the SIAC’s (Singapore International Arbitration Centre) arbitral order but gave a go-ahead to the regulators to decide on the deal. E-mails sent to Amazon and Future did not elicit a response. In its letter dated January 5, a copy of which was seen by PTI, Amazon informed SEBI the “Singapore International Arbitration Centre has constituted the arbitral tribunal in the arbitration proceedings initiated by Amazon against inter alia FRL, Mr. Kishore Biyani and Mr. Rakesh Biyani.” Amazon had dragged Future Group to arbitration after an indebted Kishore Biyani group firm signed a pact to sell retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance last year in a Rs. 24,713-crore deal. Amazon’s argument is Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance. In 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49% stake in Future’s unlisted firm — Future Coupons Ltd. — with the right to buy into FRL after a period of three to ten years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/amazon-again-urges-sebi-to-suspend-future-ril-deal-review/article33554187.ece
12 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Retail vehicle sales grow for first time in FY21 on pent-up demand: FADA||Domestic retail vehicle sales across categories grew for the first time in the current financial year in December with registrations rising 11% year-on-year (YoY) to more than 18.44 lakh, driven by a double-digit growth in sales of passenger vehicles (PV) as well as two-wheelers, according to data released by Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on Monday. While retail sales of PVs grew 24% last month, sales of two-wheelers were up by almost 12% mainly due to spillover of festive demand coupled with consumers advancing purchase decisions following price hikes announced by most manufacturers January onwards. However, the dealers’ body expects demand in January to be ‘bleak’ for PVs on account of price increases and supply-side issues. As per the data, PV sales rose 24% to more than 2.71 lakh, while two wheeler sales increased by almost 12% to 14.24 lakh. Commercial vehicles (CV) sales continued to drop, falling by 13.52% to 51,454 units. The tractor segment continued to see positive sales growth with an almost 36% increase to 69,105 units. “Automobile registrations for the first time witnessed YoY growth in this financial year,” said Vinkesh Gulati, president, FADA.  Good crop season “A good crop season, better offers in the two wheeler segment, new launches and a fear of price increase in January kept the demand going,” he added. However, supply side issues in PVs continued for the second straight month, pushing waiting period for select models to as high as eight months, he added. On the near-term outlook, FADA said, demand for vehicles in January appeared to be ‘bleak.’ “PVs may witness growth if demand-supply mismatch is resolved. With recent hikes announced by all OEMs, FADA expects a temporary blip in demand as customers will take time to absorb the same.” Hope for CVs The dealers’ body added that with the gradual opening of educational institutes and colleges, demand for two wheelers should slowly start coming back, while the government’s approval for Rs. 12,000 crore worth infrastructure projects would have a positive effect in the CV space. “Though full recovery is only expected in all the segments of the industry April 2021 onwards, with no further price-hike shocks, demand-spurring Budget by the Central government, COVID-19 vaccine’s effectiveness to fight the current and the new strain of virus with no/minimal side effects, FADA remains guarded in its optimism for auto sales during the last quarter of this fiscal year,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retail-vehicle-sales-grow-for-first-time-in-fy21-on-pent-up-demand-fada/article33554175.ece

12 January 2021||Kozhikode,||Kerala has it easy against Puducherry||S. Sreesanth didn’t disappoint. The 37-year-old seamer, returning to competitive cricket after seven years, played his part in Kerala’s six-wicket win against Puducherry in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament in Mumbai on Monday. Coming off a ban following the spot-fixing scandal of the 2012 IPL, he took a wicket with the second ball of his second over, cleaning up Fabid Ahmed. For an ageing seamer who had been away from the game for so long, it was indeed a commendable performance, as he bowled his first three overs on the trot. Fine effort It was overall a fine effort from the Kerala bowlers, who restricted Puducherry to 138 for six. After Sreesanth and fellow-pacer K.M. Asif sent back the openers, and Sheldon Jackson was needlessly run-out, Jalaj Saxena took over. The Indore-born off-spinning all-rounder claimed three for 13, stifling the middle-order. But for some lusty blows towards the end by top-scorer Ashith Rajiv (33 n.o., 29b, 3x6), and his unfinished seventh-wicket stand of 51 with P. Thamaraikannan (16 n.o.), Puducherry would have managed even less. Terrible mix-up Earlier, a third-wicket stand of 43 between Sheldon (17) and Paras Dogra (26), had offered hopes of a recovery, but a terrible mix-up saw both the batsmen at the striker’s end. Kerala was off to a flying start with Mohammed Azharuddeen (30, 18b, 4x4, 2x6) playing some attractive shots. A towering six over long-on off seamer Sagar Trivedi signalled his intentions and he added 52 for the first wicket with Robin Uthappa inside the fifth over. Though both the openers were back in the dugout in successive overs, captain Sanju Samson (32, 26b, 3x4, 2x6) and the man whom he took over from, Sachin Baby (18), put on 43 for the third wicket to take the game away from the underdog.

12 January 2021||MUMBAI,||Mumbai comes a cropper against Delhi||Arch-rivalry between the opponents besides the presence of some of the prolific stars in domestic arena was a recipe tailormade for the opening Group E tie of the Syed Mushtaq Ali between Mumbai and Delhi to be a humdinger. However, it turned out to be a lop-sided affair in favour of Delhi at the Wankhede Stadium here on Monday. An all-round performance by Shikhar Dhawan’s boys took Delhi to a facile, 76-run win. One-way traffic Ever since opener Hiten Dalal went after Dhawal Kulkarni and Tushar Deshpande in the first two overs of the match until last-man Kruthik Hanagavadi perished to veteran Ishant Sharma, it was a one-way traffic. Nitish Rana’s (74, 37b, 7x4, 5x6) power-packed innings, and his 122-run stand with Himmat Singh (53, 32b, 3x4, 4x6) meant Delhi put on a gargantuan 206 for four after being inserted in to bat. A star-studded Mumbai batting line-up — with top six having been a part of IPL 2020 — couldn’t withstand the pressure applied by Delhi pacers to fold up for a meagre 130 with 11 balls remaining. Had it not been for Shivam Dube’s big-hitting (63, 42b, 3x4, 5x6), Mumbai would have struggled to cross the 100-run mark. But the all-rounder, who earlier had Rana’s wrath with the ball, ensured he showcased his straight-hitting abilities. Fizzling out With the trio of Ishant, Simarjeet Singh and Pradeep Sangwan reducing Mumbai to 17 for four in the fifth over, the fizz had been taken out of the game before Dube’s arrival at the crease. Earlier in the afternoon, Dube’s medium-pace was taken to the cleaners by left-handed Rana, who tonked him for two fours and as many sixes in the 14th over. In another match, Kerala’s S. Sreesanth, returning to competitive cricket after seven years, played his part as Kerala posted a six-wicket win against Puducherry. Jalaj Saxena picked up three wickets.  The scores: Delhi 206 for four in 20 overs (Nitish Rana 74, Himmat Singh 53) bt Mumbai 130 in 18.1 overs (Shivam Dube 63, Pradeep Sangwan three for 20) .

12 January 2021||Sydney,||Down for the count, India battles back brilliantly to save SCG Test||A courageous and injury-wracked India pulled off a remarkable draw in a tense third Test against Australia on Monday, defying the hosts' much-vaunted bowling attack to take the series into a decider. India resumed day five at 98 for two, needing a further 309 runs after being set a huge 407 to win. At first, India had a massive go at it, but later chose to bravely cling on for the draw with Hanuma Vihari, nursing a hamstring injury, surviving 161 balls for just 23 runs and R. Ashwin, who needed treatment on his ribs, making 39. The 256 balls they faced in their unbeaten partnership of 62 was the most by an India sixth-wicket pair on Australian soil, helping steer India to 334 for five at the close, 73 runs adrift. Paine's slips Their resistance was built on the back of an explosive 97 from Rishabh Pant and a typically gritty 77 from Cheteshwar Pujara, but also helped by wicketkeeper Tim Paine dropping three catches. When Nathan Lyon accounted for skipper Ajinkya Rahane without adding to his overnight four in Monday's second over the end appeared nigh. But Pant surprisingly came in at number five ahead of Vihari and produced some fireworks. He came to the wicket with no strapping on his hurt elbow and, after settling in and surviving a missed catch by Paine on three, began to hit out, smacking Nathan Lyon for a four and a six off consecutive balls. He then clobbered two more sixes in a row off Lyon before bringing up his third Test 50 off just 64 balls. Paine dropped him again on 56, both times off Lyon. The scoreboard kept ticking over after lunch and a third Test century looked imminent only for the 23-year-old to throw his bat one time too many, caught by Pat Cummins off Lyon. His wicket ended a 148-run partnership with Pujara, who resumed the day on nine and slowly reached a second consecutive 50. In the process he brought up 6,000 career runs, the 11th Indian to achieve the feat, before being bowled by Josh Hazlewood. That left Vihari and Ashwin to pull off an unlikely draw, with the pair so exhausted that they gave up running between the wickets at the end. Jadeja out of fourth Test Ravindra Jadeja is set to be operated on his injured left thumb in Sydney on Tuesday, ruling him out of the fourth Test against Australia at Brisbane and also making him doubtful for India’s Test series at home against England. His recovery is likely to take at least four weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/down-for-the-count-india-battles-back-brilliantly-to-save-scg-test/article33554285.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||A spellbinding draw for the ages||When Monday dawned, India was supposed to suffer the blues at the Sydney Cricket Ground. A dominant host, a tough second innings, a dressing room groaning with injured men and a tense fifth day of a third Test against Australia were all intimidating factors. A lesser team would have wilted. But glorious Monday showed why Tests still matter in this age of emoticons and instant soup. Ajinkya Rahane’s men had the audacity to even seemingly chase an improbable triumph despite the skipper falling prey to Nathan Lyon in the day’s second over. At 102 for three and with injured personnel including Ravindra Jadeja watching from the change-room, a truncated middle-order and a tail too weak to wag, India was at the crossroads. Yet, Rishabh Pant had other ideas that hinged on an audacious jail-break, which brought to mind the iconic lines from the movie Shawshank Redemption : “Hope is a good thing, may be the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” The southpaw promptly tore into the Aussie bowlers. It was a counter-attack breathless in its execution and expansive in its imagination. Pant’s 97, Cheteshwar Pujara’s 77 and the 148-run fourth-wicket alliance they built revealed that contrasts can work together. Adrenaline and patience can join forces. On Rahul Dravid’s birthday, and as his famous fellow constructor of the Eden Gardens miracle of 2001, V.V.S. Laxman, gushed on Twitter, Rahane’s men seemingly dreamt about the improbable and as the day progressed, hope never retreated despite Pant and Pujara’s exits. In poor taste Tim Paine’s men did all they could, through their relentless attack and sledges that were in poor taste. But in Hanuma Vihari, never mind the torn hamstring, and in R. Ashwin, struggling with a sore back, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Lyon ran into their next set of immovable objects. Vihari and Ashwin’s unbeaten knocks – 23 and 39 respectively – minuscule in number but gigantic in terms of the heart displayed, will endure long in the public imagination. A fourth-innings target of 407 was always difficult but through Pant, Pujara, Vihari and Ashwin, India showed that it can step up and finished with 334 for five. As far as stalemates go, this draw will be remembered for the ages. The series is level at 1-1 and Brisbane awaits with hopefully another round of incandescent thrills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-spellbinding-draw-for-the-ages/article33554283.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Kudos to the redoubtable duo: Rahane||They overcame injuries. They saw off a barrage of short-pitched stuff from the world’s best pace unit. They wore down a quality spinner on a Day 5 pitch. They even conversed in Tamil. But, most importantly, Hanuma Vihari and R. Ashwin’s 259-ball blockathon ensured that the excellent work by Cheteshwar Pujara and Rishabh Pant in the first half of the last day’s play didn’t go waste. No wonder then that India captain Ajinkya Rahane had a special word of praise for Ashwin and Vihari after the match. “I think everyone chipped in for the team’s cause but credit to those two guys who dug in and batted almost two-and-a-half hours,” he said. Pep talk in Tamil While overnight back pain didn’t deter Ashwin, Vihari hurt his hamstring early on in his innings and was unable to even jog for singles. Still, the duo carried on, with Ashwin playing the senior’s role to perfection, egging on Vihari — at times in Tamil — with the Andhra batsman being a regular in the TNCA league. While Rahane stressed that the dressing room was “sure about Ashwin’s ability as a batsman”, he reserved special praise for Vihari. Not only did he carry on despite the injury, Vihari came in to bat on Monday on the back of a woeful run — with the bat and in the field — in the series so far. “We saw a special knock today. His knock was more special than a hundred. “The way he batted after getting injured, to show that motivation, that hunger, to hang in there for your team was really good and that’s what we want from each and every individual,” Rahane said. Had it not been for Pant’s onslaught and Pujara’s patience earlier in the day, the lower-order would have had to dig much deeper. While Pujara was his typical self, Pant grabbed his promotion to No. 5 with a blistering innings. “Going out there at No. 5 — the captain or the team management can make strategies — but in the end it’s up to the individual to actually go out there and deliver. Rishabh did that for us,” Rahane said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kudos-to-the-redoubtable-duo-rahane/article33554289.ece
12 January 2021||BENGALURU,||BDFA’s best laid plans come to naught||The BDFA Super Division League’s best laid plans to enforce COVID-19 protocols went up in smoke as crowds thronged the Bangalore Football Stadium for the opening match between Kickstart FC and Young Challengers on Monday. The League had decided to not allow spectators and play matches behind closed doors, but a few hundred fans arrived nonetheless and sat next to each other, paying little heed to distancing guidelines. Many of them did not even sport masks. “We didn’t expect them to show up. People jumped inside through the parking lot. We tried to stop them but we couldn’t,” said BDFA chairman S.L. Anthony. “We have requested the Ashok Nagar police station to post policemen at the entrance (from Tuesday). Only people who have passes (players, staff, match officials and club officials) will be allowed to enter the stadium.”  The results: Kickstart FC 2 (Magesh Selva 43, Sudheer Kotikela 48) bt Young Challengers FC 1 (P. Ankith 65); ASC & Center FC 2 (Dip Majumdar 40, Gautham Singh 87) bt FC Deccan 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bdfas-best-laid-plans-come-to-naught/article33554828.ece

We thank you all for your love, prayers and good wishes,” Kohli tweeted. “Anushka and the baby are both healthy and we are feeling beyond blessed to start this new chapter of our lives.

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||MCFC cements its lead||Bartholomew Ogbeche’s spectacular finish saw Mumbai City FC down ATK Mohun Bagan by a solitary goal in the Indian Super League at Fatorda. The win saw MCFC (25 points) surge to a five-point lead over second placed Bagan. MCFC attacked right from the start and made it a one-way traffic in the first quarter while the Bagan defence took a lot of pounding. Mumbai almost got the lead in the 11th minute following a sequence of sharp passes over the Bagan box between Hugo Boumous, Cy Goddard and Amey Ranawade. But the Bagan citadel somehow survived as goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya managed to palm out the final shot that came from Goddard. Dominant MCFC’s dominance was evident with over 150 successful passes as against 20 managed by Bagan in the first 15 minutes. The Bagan defence lead by Spanish centre-back Tiri managed to keep at bay Mumbai’s famed attack. The Islanders showed fine form and coordination in the midfield where Boumous had complete control. The change of ends saw Bagan gaining control over some of the action but it was Mumbai that enjoyed the majority of possession. Edu Garcia could have put Bagan ahead in the 58th minute but his attempt went off the upright. Mumbai sealed the issue 11 minutes later when Boumous set up the unmarked Ogbeche inside the Bagan box with a fine back-heel. The Nigerian centre-forward made no mistake curling his attempt to the far corner past Bhattacharya.  The result: ATK Mohun Bagan 0 lost to Mumbai City FC 1 (Bartholomew Ogbeche 69).

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||I let the team down, says ‘butter-fingered’ Paine||Australia skipper Tim Paine held up his hand and took responsibility for dropping three catches on the final day, possibly costing his side a win at the SCG. He dropped Rishabh Pant twice off Nathan Lyon and Hanuma Vihari off Mitchell Starc. “I am bitterly disappointed. I pride myself on my keeping and yeah, I haven’t had too many worse days than that,” said Paine. “It is a horrible feeling knowing that our fast bowlers and our spinner bowled their hearts out and gave everything to the team. I certainly feel I let them down,” he added. Paine also praised Rishabh Pant’s innings but said he was not worried at any stage that Australia was in danger of losing the game. “I thought throughout his whole innings we were creating chances to get him out; we just had to hold one. He played an amazing innings and some superb shots. We know that he has got that in him and is a huge talent. But we also know he gives you chances,” he said. About the racial abuse aimed at the Indian players, Paine said, “It is bitterly disappointing. We have said, you know, Cricket Australia and the Australian cricket team we don't condone any sort of abuse, particularly racial abuse.  “I am disappointed when that happens, when teams come to Australia and, we want it to stop. I just wanted to make sure the Indian boys knew that we are also against it and we support them,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-let-the-team-down-says-butter-fingered-paine/article33554287.ece
12 January 2021||BANGKOK,||Sindhu, Saina eye good outing||Nearly 10 months after COVID-19 disrupted the international calendar, star Indian shuttlers P.V. Sindhu and Saina Nehwal will return to competitive action in the Yonex Thailand Open Super 1000 tournament starting on Tuesday, an event shorn of some sheen due to Japan and China’s pullout from the Asia leg. While Sindhu has been training in London for the last two months and will be keen to find her rhythm quickly, Saina was down with COVID-19 and has recently recovered. She will look to test her fitness as badminton returns in a bio-secure bubble. Asian leg Both didn’t participate in Denmark Open Super 750 and SaarLorLux Super 100 — the only two events which could be conducted after BWF was forced to suspend the calender at the end of the All England Championships in March. The Asia leg also comprises Toyota Thailand Open (January 19-24) and HSBC BWF World Tour Finals 2020 (Jan. 27-31), which will conclude the 2020 season. One factor that will boost the chances of Indians is the absence of Japanese and Chinese shuttlers. World champion Sindhu, the sixth seed, will open against Denmark’s Mia Blichfeldt, while Saina will take on unheralded Malaysian Kisona Selvaduray in the first round. Sindhu has a 3-0 record against Blichfeldt. A victory is likely to pit her against another Danish player Line Hojmark Kjaersfeldt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/olympic-hopefuls-sindhu-saina-eye-good-outing/article33554319.ece
12 January 2021||Milan,||Juve struggles past Sassuolo||Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Welshman Aaron Ramsey helped Juventus secure a 3-1 victory over 10-man Sassuolo in Serie A on Sunday, lifting the champion to fourth place in the standings. Following its win at leader AC Milan in midweek, Juventus struggled to create many chances in the first half, but its cause was aided after Pedro Obiang was sent off for a dangerous tackle on Federico Chiesa just before half-time. Juventus capitalised on the numerical advantage as Danilo was left in plenty of space to fire home a fierce opener in the 50th minute, but the lead lasted just eight minutes as Gregoire Defrel levelled to stun the host. Ramsey, who has been in and out of the side this season, put Juve in front in the 82nd minute with his first goal of the season. In contrast, Serie A top scorer Ronaldo took his season’s tally to 15 as he struck in stoppage-time to complete the win. The result helped Juve close the gap with Milan to seven points, having played one game less. Sassuolo stays seventh. Valencia snapped a two-month winless spell in LaLiga with a 1-0 victory away to Real Valladolid on Sunday thanks to a late pile-driver from Carlos Soler to move away from the relegation zone. Midfielder Soler, who had scored a hat-trick of penalties against Real Madrid in Valencia’s last win on November 8, broke the deadlock in the 76th minute, controlling a pass from outside the area before lashing the ball high into the net. Valencia thought it had doubled its lead later on when Manu Vallejo scored but the goal was ruled out following a VAR review for an offside in the build up. Vallejo missed a later chance to score and Valencia lived dangerously until the final whistle, almost conceding in the 96th-minute when Valladolid forward Sergi Guardiola headed a free kick against the post. A first victory in nine league games saw Valencia climb from 17th place in the standings up to 13th on 19 points. Visitors VfB Stuttgart cruised past 10-man Augsburg 4-1 on Sunday to secure a first win in four Bundesliga matches and climb to 10th place in the standings. Stuttgart, which had not won since crushing Borussia Dortmund 5-1 last month and had lost its last two matches, took a 2-0 lead with goals from Nicolas Gonzalez and Silas Wamangituka. Marco Richter cut the deficit for hosts Augsburg a minute after the restart but Gonzalo Castro volleyed in at the far post to restore Stuttgart’s two-goal cushion just past the hour. To make matters worse for Augsburg, Richter was sent off in the 77th minute following his second booking in the space of four minutes. Substitute Daniel Didavi slid in at the far post to seal Stuttgart’s victory and it leapfrogged Augsburg into 10th place on 21 points. Augsburg dropped to 11th on 19.  The results: Serie A: Udinese 1 (Lasagna 27) lost to Napoli 2 (Insigne 15-pen, Bakayoko 90); Hellas Verona 2 (N. Kalinic 16, Dimarco 25) bt Crotone 1 (Messias 55); Parma 0 lost to Lazio 2 (Alberto 55, F. Caicedo 67); Fiorentina 1 (Vlahovic 72) bt Cagliari 0; Juventus 3 (Danilo 51, Ramsey 82, Cristiano Ronaldo 90+2) bt Sassuolo 1 (Defrel 58).   LaLiga: Cadiz 3 (Alex 15, Lozano 56, Negredo 68) bt Alaves 1 (Joselu 23-pen); Real Valladolid 0 lost to Valencia 1 (Soler 76).   Bundesliga: Augsburg 1 (Richter 46) lost to VfB Stuttgart 4 (Gonzalez 9-pen, Wamangituka 29, Castro 60, Didavi 87); Arminia Bielefeld 1 (Yabo 64) bt Hertha Berlin 0.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/juventus-struggles-past-sassuolo/article33554335.ece

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||Devaki gets a boon||In His avataras, Lord Narayana had parents of His choice. Even in the case of Narasimha, Vedanta Desika says that since He emerged from a pillar, the pillar became Brahma’s grandmother! Brahma is Vishnu’s son, and if the pillar is Narasimha’s mother, then it becomes Brahma’s grandmother. Desika’s poetic imagination came up with such an interesting interpretation. But in terms of the Lord’s parents, none had the good fortune of Devaki, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. Whatever Devaki wanted in her child, that was granted to her. She wanted the Lord as her child. But she was not content with this. She wanted the Lord to be dark like a cloud. The Lord is neela megha shyamala. She wanted Him to have lotus eyes. This is a defining feature of the Parabrahma. Chandogya Upanishad says ‘yathA kapyAsam pundareekam evam akshinee’ — that is the Paramatma’s eyes are like lotuses. She wanted Him to be born with all His weapons. And she got what she wanted! Parasara Bhatta, in his Sri Rangaraja Stava, marvels at Devaki’s desire. Had anyone but Devaki asked for the Lord to be born with His celebrated dark hue, as dark as a cloud? Had anyone but she asked for the Lord to be born with His five weapons? Had anyone but she asked for Him to be born with His customary yellow garment (pitambara)? Who could have thought of asking for such a boon, asks Parasara Bhatta. And Devaki had the good fortune to be Krishna’s birth mother. While there are many things which make the Krishna avatara special and unique, this granting of Devaki’s prayer also stands out as something special about the avatara. He spent twelve months in her womb, and as promised to her, He appeared with all the features of the Supreme One.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/devaki-gets-a-boon/article33554291.ece

12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||To coin or not to coin?||During the wild, off-chance you are at a startup incubator and have your ear to the ground, chances are that you might hear murmurings about crypto, such as ‘how did your Ether investment work out?’ or ‘don’t worry about stop-loss just yet, ride this tide out!’ The headline mania — such as Bitcoin hitting a value of $40,000 and the crypto-market reaching a $1 trillion value — became the making of novice traders eager to make a quick buck. Despite this, and maybe also due to this, crypto is saddled with a stigma similar to that of gambling. These decentralised digital currencies are seen as a tool only for the ultra-rich with a Midas touch. The downside of novice traders entering the game is that they might not have done all the necessary reading and learning before heading into this coin-dazzled world. So what should people know before making a decision of ‘to coin or not to coin?’ The answer: there is no hard-and-fast formula. Contrary to popular belief, not all crypto business-people are utopists; wise ones warn that investing in crypto-coins or tokens is speculative, the market is largely unregulated, and that anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. In fact, on January 11, Bitcoin and other coins tanked, wiping off some $170 billion from the market, signalling some market correction and proving that the industry itself is battling obstacles in terms of scaling, efficiency and security. A little history... In 2018, the scene had experienced what experts call a ‘crypto winter’: value was at rock-bottom and there was a lot of speculation around government intervention. Alongside this apprehension, crypto technologists took more than a sleeves-rolled-up commitment to technical development in the infrastructure. This strengthened the foundation, which contributed to crypto’s ‘spring’ in the late-2020 ‘success’ of Bitcoin. Alexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit and crypto advocate, explained in a past interview with CNBC that, “I’m personally happy with the fact that there has been a tough year in all these cryptocurrencies because it gets people focussed on the things that matter, which is building the software which is, hopefully, going to make these things tremendously valuable in the long term.” With lakhs of such currencies available to choose from, Neeraj Khandelwal, co-founder of India-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, says, “People should be guided by principles and ground rules, rather than persons or certifications.” He adds that “the top 10 cryptocurrencies [such as Chainlink, Binance Coin, as well as Bitcoin and Ether] are widely trusted and properly decentralised, in that no single party has control over the prices.” Neeraj’s company CoinDCX powered through the Supreme Court-RBI ban (April 2018 - March 2020) announced on crypto based on the belief that it would not last long. “We were confident in the technology,” he recalls, “We were not emotionally driven, we were rather focussed on the technology of CoinDCX itself and in the industry.” He explains that crypto-investments should be made only when someone is “stable and thinking in the long-term.” He adds, “We should not take ultra-high risks with hard-earned money. If you are absolutely keen and have done consistent studying and analysis into the crypto world, then start with a small amount and monitor that for a reference to increase exposure.” CoinDCX has its own learning platform as well: DCX Learn, where people who sign up to the exchange programme can learn the in’s and out’s, free of cost. Akshay Aggarwal, CEO at Blocumen Studios, says education is extremely important and any exchange platform should have an element of responsibility to teach. He also runs Blockchained India, one of the world’s largest networks of blockchain or crypto enthusiasts. Here, the members host virtual global talks about the latest developments to keep everyone in the loop about an unpredictable tech. “If you do decide to start in crypto, it’s always helpful to have a network or even a person you trust to bounce ideas off. This kind of ‘closer peered investing’ could be helpful in keeping you in check.” “The ideal crypto-investor should be patient, have some foresight after seeing how the market behaves for a certain time period, and maintain self-control and restraint. Also one should always stay as informed as possible,” urges Akshay, “because crypto evolves in a volatile manner at any time. Don’t think that you can always be ahead of a curve that is unpredictably impacted by innumerable factors.” Don’t fall prey Neeraj warns that, like most other fin-tech industries, crypto has its fair share of red flags. Those firing up their search engines to read up are most likely inundated with ads of bizarre encouragements: ‘give us your money and we’ll double it for you using crypto!’ or even ads for shady-seeming exchange platforms that just do not sit right. Neeraj urges netizens not to cave in. “People should not believe in everything written in online forums, and don’t invest in just any token. People should restrict to the top currencies which can’t be manipulated,” he advises. Agreeing with this, Akshay says, “Whoever is coming in, does not know how things might pan out. When the market sees a stabilisation, there may be a lot of losses for those who are experimenting.” Another down-side to the crypto-trading and investing realms is the risk of addiction. “There is an element of FOMO (fear of missing out),” says Neeraj. “Understand that the market is volatile and have a mindset that you are in it for the long term. As markets go up, they also come down; so in these compulsions, short-term decisions are risky. This behaviour can eliminate a fair number of risks.” “Just as you would not do it with your ‘offline money’, don’t trust your crypto with a stranger,” adds Akshay. “No matter how much returns they promise, it is impossible to predict prices in this space.” It is easy to find resources and experts a click away to seek advice on crypto. But on a regulation level, things are still grey. Whether 2021 will finally be the year India clarifies laws around crypto remains to be seen.  Technical developments strengthened this space’s foundation, which ended crypto winter and kicked off crypto’s ‘spring’ with the late-2020 ‘success’ of Bitcoin||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/to-coin-or-not-to-coin/article33554517.ece
12 January 2021||January 12 2021 00:00 IST,||If not WhatsApp, then what?||It has been a confusing January for WhatsApp. The platform celebrated a milestone of 1.4 billion video and audio calls on New Year’s Eve 2020, but the celebrations seemed premature given the global backlash to the platform’s updated privacy policy, which features a ‘take or leave it’ clause — if the user refuses to share data with Facebook, they will have to quit WhatsApp. On January 9, WhatsApp Head Will Cathcart tweeted that this policy is purely for business communication, rather than private. Still, before the new terms of service are set to take effect on February 8, WhatsApp and Messenger users alike are flocking to other apps, both out of fear of misuse of their data, and as a virtual protest against Facebook. What are people looking for in these alternative apps? Encryption, an important buzzword across communication apps, converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext; decrypting the ciphertext converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext. Many of these apps feature AES methods which, according to a National Institute of Standards and Technology report, is the use of “cryptographic keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits to encrypt and decrypt data in blocks of 128 bits.”   Fast approaching 500 million users, Telegram observed a growth of more than 2.2 million users in the last week alone due to the WhatsApp purge. Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync across several devices at once. The messaging app comprises two layers of secure encryption. Server-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), while the platform’s Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption. “All data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files,” says the platform’s official website, adding, “Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange [a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel].”    Signal’s privacy policy is not as descriptive as that of Telegram but they do state they undertake end-to-end encryption, as do most communication apps these days. The chat history for the app is stored on the user’s device instead of, as with WhatsApp and Telegram, on an app-specific cloud server. If you are going to use Signal, be vigilant of their third-party sharing policy and which apps you link with this app: “Our third-party Providers send a verification code to your phone number when you register for our services. These providers are bound by their privacy policies to safeguard that information. If you use other Third-Party Services like YouTube, Spotify, Giphy, etc. in connection with our services, their terms and privacy policies govern your use of those services.”   An under-discussed app more favoured in the West, Spike, is becoming a choice alternative here in India. Like most apps, they emphasise, “We store only the minimum data needed to provide you with the fastest experience possible… We do not rent, sell, distribute or monetise on your data to anyone. There are no ads on Spike either.” However, the personal data they store includes the data shared with the platform when you register for an account including payment information, postal address, date of birth, full name. However, some potential users may not sit well with the fact that Spike “periodically collects your device number or IP address (the location of your device on the Internet), tracks your geographic location, monitors installation and online behavioural information recorded during user sessions and technical data and related information (including but not limited to technical information about your device, applications installed on it, its operating system and your operator).” They also, however, have a strict minors policy, too: “We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.” This platform comes with a variety of payment plans, the basic one being free with a limit of 15,000 messages.   Session does not require your name, phone number or email ID. The makers of the app — Oxen, backed by The Loki Foundation, an Australian non-profit tech group — claim that your messaging activities will leave no digital trail. The app creates a Session ID, which you need to share with the person in the contact to start chatting. Private group chats for up to 20 people are possible. Photos, voice snippets and other files can be shared. Session does not collect any geolocation data, metadata, or any other data about the device or network. It is available for Android phones, iPhones and desktops.   As of January 9, Threema was the top paid app in Play Store’s communication category. Available for Rs. 270, the app allows text and voice messages, voice and video calls, file-sharing and group chats — all encrypted. You can also use the built-in poll feature in group chats. Each Threema user receives a random Threema ID for identification — phone number or email are not required. You can even use the app on desktops and tablets (without SIM cards). The app became popular, especially in Germany, after Edward Snowden, in 2013, released documents on surveillance. There aren’t many design themes to choose from; otherwise, the app promises top-notch security and privacy for the price you pay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/if-not-whatsapp-then-what/article33554515.ece
12 January 2021||Chandigarh,||Farmers’ protest: 71 booked for rioting at CM’s event in Haryana||Haryana police have booked at least 71 people for rioting, obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions, among other charges after a group of people protesting the Centre’s farm laws ransacked a venue at Kaimla village in Haryana’s Karnal where Chief Minister Manohar Lal was scheduled to address a farmers’ gathering ( kisan mahapanchayat ) on January 10. The police said the FIR has been registered against 71 identified persons, besides unknown people, who allegedly were involved in vandalising the event site by smashing the chairs and the stage, tearing posters, etc. “We have booked 71 protesters by name, besides unknown people as well under different Sections.

12 January 2021||Guwahati,||Dzukou Valley wildfire doused||The wildfire at Dzukou Valley straddling the Manipur-Nagaland border has been doused after it raged for two weeks, officials said on Monday. Mohammed Ali Shihad A., Deputy Commissioner of Kohima, said no fresh fire or smoke was visible from the valley. The Dzukou Valley, situated at an average altitude of 2,452 metres, is a popular trekking destination known for its exotic flowers. “The Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority will soon assess the damage caused to the forest, environment and other flora and fauna in Dzukou Valley,” he said. He said all the Indian Air Force helicopters deployed for dousing the fire would be de-inducted on Tuesday, as no fresh fire or smoke was reported from anywhere in the valley during an inspection by both the air and ground teams on Monday. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams engaged for fighting the wildfire would also be de-inducted. This was decided on Monday at a coordination meeting in Nagaland capital Kohima. The meeting was chaired by the State’s Home Commissioner Abhijit Sinha. An official statement said personnel of the Forest and other departments concerned besides volunteers of the local Southern Angami Youth Organisation would be stationed at the base camp for two days in Dzukou Valley to monitor the situation. Defence spokesperson Wing Commander Ratnakar Singh said the IAF had deployed four Mi-17V5 helicopters equipped with Bambi buckets for spraying water to douse the wildfire. The helicopters had been carrying out sorties since January 1, following the Nagaland government’s requisition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dzukou-valley-wildfire-doused/article33554530.ece
12 January 2021||Chandigarh,||Vote against Haryana govt., Hooda tells legislators who offered to quit||Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Monday appealed to all those MLAs, who had been offering to quit in support of ongoing farmers’ agitation surrounding farm laws, to instead vote against the ruling BJP-JJP government during the no-confidence motion to be brought by the Congress in the next Assembly session. “The Congress is going to bring a no-confidence motion against the coalition government in the upcoming Assembly session. All those MLAs, who had in the past few days extended their support to farmers and offered to resign should vote against the government. If legislators such as Abhay Chautala of the INLD resign, then the Opposition will have one vote less and it will indirectly help the government. All legislators who oppose the three laws should vote against the government in the House, instead of resigning. This will also let the public know who stands with the farmers and who is with the government,” he said.  Appeal for peace Mr. Hooda appealed to the farmers to continue their movement in a peaceful and disciplined manner. “In democracy, non-violence is the biggest weapon of the movement. I hope that the farmers will finally prevail,” he said. Mr. Hooda accused the State government of deliberately creating a situation of confrontation with farmers. Criticising Chief Minister Manohar Lal’s ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ at Kaimla village of Karnal, Mr. Hooda questioned the rationale behind the Chief Minister holding the event. On Sunday, a crowd, mostly of farmers, ransacked the venue of the programme, meant to highlight the advantages of the new farm laws. ‘Provocative steps’ “When the farmers of the area were opposing the Chief Minister’s programme, why did the government insist on organising it? If the government wanted to stop creating a tense situation, it could have simply cancelled the event in view of the protest, but it did not do so. The government should not push the State towards anarchy by taking provocative steps,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/vote-against-haryana-govt-hooda-tells-legislators-who-offered-to-quit/article33554526.ece
12 January 2021||JAIPUR,||Now, a task force for mining sector||A new task force for the mining sector is being constituted in Rajasthan on the instructions of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to ensure scientific exploration of minerals and bring technical expertise to the work. Chief Secretary Niranjan Arya will head the task force. Mr. Gehlot said here that the exploitation of rich mineral resources would help transform the development scenario in the State and create new employment opportunities. The State government would shortly bring a new mineral policy to create an atmosphere favourable for attracting investments in the mining sector, he said.  Improper exploitation Interacting with the representatives of a mining company, Mr. Gehlot said though Rajasthan had more mineral resources in comparison with other States, this sector’s share in the revenue earnings was very low because of the lack of proper exploitation. “The State government will work with an investment-friendly approach for development of the mining sector,” he said. The task force will have officers of the Forest, Mining and Revenue Departments as its members, who will ensure prompt disposal of the related works and resolve the issues faced by the investors. The Chief Minister said the Mineral Exploration Trust, appointed recently, would help speed up search and identification of the sites for mining.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/now-a-task-force-for-mining-sector/article33554531.ece
12 January 2021||New Delhi,||Respond to plea seeking to declare all child marriages in Delhi as invalid: HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the AAP government to respond to a petition seeking to declare all child marriages performed in the Capital as invalid. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on the petition by a woman, who has also sought to nullify her marriage which was allegedly performed when she was a minor. It also issued notice to her father, brother and the man she was married to seeking their response to the plea before February 12, the next date of hearing. The woman has challenged a provision of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, which makes wedding of minors voidable only at the option of either of the parties who was a child at the time of the event. The petitioner has sought a declaration from the court that every child marriage performed in the State should be void ab-initio (to be treated as invalid from the outset). The woman’s counsel informed the court that she was staying at an undisclosed location as she apprehended that her family would force her to agree to the child marriage, which was performed in April 2010 when she was a minor. The woman, who claims to be born on December 10, 1993, has contended that when her marriage was performed she had no option but to give her consent. The woman said she was residing peacefully with her parents till November 19, 2020 when the person to whom she was married to as a child came with his parents to take her to Gujarat with them. When she objected, she was allegedly beaten up. Subsequently, she escaped from her home on November 20, 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/respond-to-plea-seeking-to-declare-all-child-marriages-in-delhi-as-invalid-hc/article33554536.ece
