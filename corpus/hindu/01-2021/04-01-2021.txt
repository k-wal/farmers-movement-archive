04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||India approves two COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use||The Central Drugs and Standards Committee (CDSCO) on Sunday formally approved the COVID-19 vaccines by Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII). This allows the vaccines — Covishield by SII and based on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, and Covaxin by Bharat Biotech — to be offered to healthcare workers and frontline workers in India. The Health Ministry had said that 3 crore such personnel, considered at the highest risk for COVID-19, would be given the vaccine for free. It isn’t yet known which vaccine will be made available to these personnel though officials said roll-outs could begin in less than a fortnight. Yet to complete trials Neither Covishield nor Covaxin has completed the crucial Phase-3 trial, under which a vaccine candidate is administered to volunteers at multiple locations across the country. The approval was based on a recommendation by a Subject Expert Committee which deliberated for two days on granting approvals to the vaccines. The minutes of the SEC meeting aren’t yet available. However, a Health Ministry statement said the vaccine’s efficacy in Indian volunteers was “comparable” to that tested in overseas trials. Both approvals accorded are for “restricted use in emergency situation” and in the case of Bharat Biotech, the approval wording notes that it is in “...public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains”. These conditions were not specified. Bharat Biotech, whose vaccine candidate is being tested in large Phase-3 trials in India, has provided safety and immunogenicity data.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-approves-two-covid-19-vaccines-for-emergency-use/article33490062.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. ropes in I-T Dept. to crack down on GST fraud||Tightening the noose around fraudsters rigging the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, the government has roped in the Income Tax Department to tap illicit incomes as part of a crackdown against 7,000 fraud companies, identified using data analytics tools, Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey told The Hindu . Any income traceable to the use of fake bills and other GST frauds shall be considered concealed income and attract severe penalties so that direct tax collections may also get a leg-up while better compliance pushed GST collections to a record high of Rs. 1.15 lakh crore in December 2020. “GST collections in December show the economy is undoubtedly on the fast recovery track. We have also been working on improving compliance for more than a year now, at the systemic level and at the enforcement level,” Mr. Pandey said. “We will be honouring the honest, but at the same time, we will not hesitate from doing things to deter those who try to cheat the system. I think there is now a sense among the fringe elements who were trying to game the system that it is not going to be so easy to continue in that fashion as the times have changed. And that is leading to better compliance,” he added. Over the past one-and-a-half months, “concerted action” had been taken to ensure compliance in the GST net, pooling data with States, the Income Tax and Customs Departments, banks and other agencies, the Finance Secretary said. “So we are today in a position to undertake data analytics to pinpoint those who are trying to game the system and take targeted action against such tax frauds. We have been able to identify 7,000 companies who have been issuing fake bills or using fake bills to evade GST and income tax,” he said. In a recent case, an e-commerce player was found to have even procured manpower services from a fake company, he pointed out. Around 187 persons have already been arrested, including five chartered accountants and a company secretary. “Most of them had to spend 40-50 days in jail, because the crime was so grave that the courts were not inclined to give them bail. The I-T Department is also taking action as the direct tax implications for beneficiaries of fake invoices, are much, much higher than the GST implication,” the top Finance Ministry official said. “If you see the penalties on I-T evasion, it will be more than the invoice value itself,” Mr. Pandey said. This co-ordinated action had also helped bolster Customs revenues, which crossed the Rs. 16,000 crore mark in December, 93% higher than the same period a year ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-ropes-in-i-t-dept-to-crack-down-on-gst-fraud/article33490059.ece
04 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Universities, colleges in State set to reopen today||After close to nine months, higher education institutions are set to partially reopen in the State on Monday amid challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The resumption of offline classes comes as a relief for large sections of the academic community that feared the consequences that a zero academic year potentially have on career prospects. Around 1,350 colleges, including arts and science, engineering, law, fisheries science, music and fine arts, almost all State universities and the Central University of Kerala, Kasaragod, will receive students in adherence to a stringent protocol that will involve thermal screening, frequent sanitisation of campuses, constant use of face masks and enforcement of physical distancing. The classes will be held at 50% attendance and on shift basis if the need arose, depending upon the student strength. While classes will resume for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students of all batches, online sessions will continue for all other categories for the time being. The government will take a call on the other batches after evaluating the arrangements after 10 days. The institutions will function from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on all days except Sundays, apparently to maximise teaching hours. The decision to conduct classes on Saturdays has led to resentment among a section of the teaching fraternity that has accused the government of increasing their work load. Stop-gap arrangement However, Usha Titus, Principal Secretary, Higher Education, maintained that the guideline was a stop-gap arrangement to compensate for the lost time and ensure the academic year did not fall into disarray. She said the work pattern would continue to adhere to the University Grants Commission (UGC) guideline. Students will have to attend a maximum of five class hours a day. Principals’ concern Many college principals remained apprehensive of the students’ concerns, especially those related to transportation woes and accommodation facilities. While the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will resume counters for receiving applications for student concessions on Monday, teething issues concerning their issuance are likely to persist during the initial weeks of reopening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/universities-colleges-in-state-set-to-reopen-today/article33490410.ece

04 January 2021||Bengaluru,||SWD connecting Bellandur Lake ready for a Rs. 160-crore overhaul||The historically significant 11.4-km-long rajakaluve or stormwater drain, K-100, connecting the erstwhile Dharmabudhi Lake, which is now Kempegowda bus station, to Bellandur Lake is set to get a complete overhaul with the State government approving a Rs. 160-crore ‘Citizens Water Way Project’ on December 31. Stormwater drains in the city have become cesspools, with sewage flowing and garbage dumped indiscriminately, but civic agencies hope to change this. The project aims to re-frame the ‘grey infrastructure’ as an ecological corridor, reconnect the city to its water heritage, increase the availability of public spaces for recreation and health, and address key issues of pollution, air quality, water scarcity, and flood mitigation. As a first step, the civic body has proposed to address the pollution caused by sewage, untreated industrial effluents, garbage, unregulated construction leading to channelisation, and reduced width. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad told The Hindu that the project has been proposed to be taken up under the Design, Build, Operate and Transfer model, with operation and maintenance for five years. However, civic experts, while welcoming the development of the drain network, questioned the model, which they fear will lead to privatisation of the public space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/swd-connecting-bellandur-lake-ready-for-a-rs-160-crore-overhaul/article33490105.ece

04 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||KCR to inaugurate integrated collectorate complexes this month||The stage is being readied for inauguration of some of the integrated collectorate complexes in the State this month. According to Roads and Buildings Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will formally inaugurate the newly constructed integrated collectorate complexes in Siddipet and Nizamabad districts in the first week followed by Kamareddy, Jagtial and Sircilla the next week. The Chief Minister will subsequently launch the integrated complexes in Warangal, Jangaon and Peddapalli districts in the third week and Vikarabad and Medchal districts in the last week. The Minister directed the officials concerned to make arrangements for the formal inauguration of these complexes and expedite works on the collectorates in the remaining districts. Steps should be taken to speed up works on the collectorates in Medak, Nagarkurnool, Khammam, Suryapet and Bhupalpally districts. He said the construction of the integrated complexes is aimed at bringing all the departments under one roof so as to avoid inconvenience to people who were hitherto forced to make rounds to different offices for even minor works. The Chief Minister conceived the idea of district reorganisation as part of decentralisation of administration and taking it closer to the people. Mr. Prashanth Reddy who reviewed the progress of construction of the new complexes with senior officials on Sunday wanted them to closely monitor the works to ensure their timely completion. Yadadri works reviewed The Minister also reviewed the ongoing works relating to Yadadri temple, especially those relating to the main temple complex, presidential suites, villas, ghat road and others. The government is firm on making Yadadri a world-class pilgrimage centre and the temple complex had accordingly been designed to reflect the spiritual aspects of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kcr-to-open-integrated-collectorate-complexes/article33490376.ece
04 January 2021||KADAPA,||‘B.Tech’ Ravi arrested in 2018 riots case||TDP MLC M. Ravindranath Reddy alias ‘B.Tech’ Ravi of Kadapa was arrested reportedly at the Chennai airport on Sunday. He was an accused in the violence witnessed in the Poola Angallu area of Pulivendula town in 2018. A warrant had been issued alleging his involvement in rioting and attempt to murder. The violent incidents were triggered by the challenges and counter-challenges by the TDP and YSRCP leaders on the development of the Pulivendula constituency, for which workers of both the parties gathered at the spot on January 4, 2018. However, the situation turned out of control with the TDP and YSRCP workers hurling stones on each other. As SI Chiranjeevi sustained injuries, the police booked a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) against Mr. Ravi and 63 others. SP K.K.N. Anburajan said the arrest had nothing to do with recent murder of a woman in Lingala mandal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/btech-ravi-arrested-in-2018-riots-case/article33490053.ece
04 January 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,||Ministers see Naidu’s role in idol desecration at Ramateertham||Ministers for Municipal Administration and Endowments B. Satyanarayana and V. Srinivas on Sunday alleged that former Chief Minister and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu was behind the desecration of Lord Rama’s idol at the Kodandarama Swamy temple at Ramateertham a few days ago. After visiting the temple and interacting with the priests, the Ministers also alleged that Mr. Naidu was raking up the issue for political survival and to win the ensuing byelection to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat by hook or by crook. Mr. Naidu, during his tenure, had never tried to protect the temples, including the one at Ramateertham, they alleged. Snipe at Ashok Defending the removal of senior TDP leader P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju from the chairmanship of three temples, Mr. Satyanarayana said, “Mr. Raju had never visited the hilltop temple. He had failed to take steps for its improvement and protection. He is now trying to utilise the incident to gain political mileage.” He further said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had faith in God and never tried to use religion or caste for political gain. Security mounted Meanwhile, police department had deployed more forces at the temple to prevent all forms of agitations. The police also did not allow religious heads and activists of various Hindu organisations to visit the temple. Vizianagaram Superintendent of Police B. Rajakumari reviewed the security measures in view of the agitations planned by several organisations in the next few days. Senior BJP leader and MLC P.V.N. Madhav and other party leaders demanded an inquiry into the happenings at Ramateertham on Saturday wherein Vizianagaram parliamentary party president Reddi Pavani fainted during the tussle with the police personnel. They also condemned the arrest of party State Executive Committee member N. Eswara Rao. The BJP leaders took out a protest rally in Vizianagaram, condemning the “police high handedness” at the temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ministers-see-naidus-role-in-idol-desecration-at-ramateertham/article33490055.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Police stop Rajasthan farmers’ march to Delhi||Around 600 farmers from Rajasthan tried to break through the barricades in Haryana’s Rewari on the Delhi-Jaipur highway on Sunday to march towards Delhi. The police lobbed tear gas shells and chilli grenades to stop them. Sources in the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a joint front of farmer unions, said the group of farmers was acting on its own and the unions did not approve of their action. The incident comes as farmers’ leaders and government Ministers are set for yet another round of talks on Monday in a bid to break the impasse over the controversial farm laws, whose repeal has been demanded by farmers. Farmers belonging to Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh and Sri Ganganagar districts broke through the first layer of barricades in Rewari around 4 p.m. to march towards Delhi, but the police managed to stop them near Masani village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-stop-rajasthan-farmers-march-to-delhi/article33490264.ece
04 January 2021||Kolkata,||Need one govt. at Centre and in State for Bengal’s development: Suvendu||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari on Sunday said that West Bengal cannot prosper unless there is one government at the Centre and in the State. Mr. Adhikari, who has been holding public rallies almost on a daily basis after joining the BJP on December 19, addressed a rally along with State BJP president Dilip Ghosh at Paschim Medinipur. The former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister continued to target TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, levelling allegations of corruption on his associates. He also said that there were huge irregularities in the cyclone Amphan relief distribution. “Those who did not have any cattle got compensation for loss of such animals. Even people who had no betel leaf vines claimed compensation saying that their vines were destroyed in the cyclone,” Mr. Adhikari said. Mr. Adhikari further said that once the model code of conduct for the elections was enforced, the TMC hooligans who are trying to terrorise people, would have to flee from the area. Speaking in the same vein, Mr. Ghosh said that the State police would be made to wait 100 metres away from the polling booths which would be guarded by Central armed police forces. The State BJP president also accused the Trinamool Congress of trying to take help of former Maoist leaders to win the elections. Mr. Ghosh was referring to the recent joining of former Maoist leader Chhatradhar Mahato in the TMC. Mr. Mahato was the convener of People’s Committee Against Police Atrocities and had played a crucial role in the siege of Lalgarh by the Communist Party of India (Maoist) in 2009. Mr. Mahato was arrested by the Left Front government on charges, including the UAPA, and he was recently released from prison. Meanwhile, violence erupted in Kanthi area of Purba Medinipur district when supporters of Mr. Adhikari were returning from the rally in the adjoining district. In another development, the Kolkata Police have denied permission to a roadshow by BJP leaders, former Kolkata Mayor Sovan Chatterjee, and his aide Baishaki Banerjee. Recently, the BJP gave key organisational roles to the leaders who had switched sides from the TMC in 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/need-one-govt-at-centre-and-in-state-for-bengals-development-suvendu/article33490456.ece
04 January 2021||Kolkata,||Owaisi visits Furfura Sharif, announces political tie-up ahead of Bengal elections||All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday visited Furfura Sharif, a prominent religious shrine of Bengali Muslims in Hooghly district. Mr. Owasi met Abbas Siddique, peerzada and secretary of Furfura Sharif, and said his party would stand by him in the times to come. “Whatever decision Mr. Siddique takes, the AIMIM will stand by him,” he said. Announcing the political tie-up, the AIMIM chief showered praise on Mr. Siddique, describing him as the guiding light of Furfura Sharif. “I realised that if I had to make the Majlis flag strong, I would have to pay obeisance to Furfura Sharif,” he said. The development adds a twist to the poll-bound political situation as the tie-up may emerge a threat to the opponents of the BJP, particularly the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). In fact, the meeting is the first instance of coming together of Urdu-speaking and Bengali-speaking Muslims and it may pave the way for setting up a Muslim front ahead of the Assembly polls. Later in the day, Mr. Siddique said he was forming a front of several groups, including the AIMIM. More support base Of late, Mr. Siddique has been giving hints that he is keen on testing the political waters. In terms of physical connect, he has more support base than the AIMIM which has never contested polls in the State. The meeting, which comes months before the Assembly polls, assumes a lot of significance. The minorities have been overwhelmingly supporting the TMC since 2011. The TMC leadership said such developments did not pose any challenge to it as Muslims were firmly behind Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Its Lok Sabha MP Saugata Roy said Mr. Owasi was well aware that he could not be a factor as Urdu-speaking Muslims were not in significant numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/owaisi-visits-furfura-sharif-announces-political-tie-up-ahead-of-bengal-elections/article33490458.ece

Palaniswami said on Sunday. Beginning his electioneering at Villiseri near Kovilpatti, he said the plan would also weed out middlemen and ensure a good price for farmers on the spot. The produce would be exported based on demand. This strategy would double farmers’ income in the near future, he said. Mr. Palaniswami said the ‘kudimaramathu’ scheme had helped to revive the neglected irrigation tanks and supply channels and enabled farmers to grow crops on more area. The government had also helped out farmers in times of drought and heavy rain through timely distribution of crop insurance benefits and relief. Farmers had received Rs. 9,400 crore in crop insurance benefits in the past four years, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-plans-to-double-farmers-income-palaniswami/article33490178.ece

Mr. Ambedkar said it was Pune which had a fair claim of being renamed after Chhatrapati Sambhaji as Sambhajinagar, given that the samadhi of the Maratha king, who was tortured and murdered by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1689, was in Vadhu Budruk village. “What is the need for such religion-based politics? There are about 80% Hindus in this country, so why play politics based on religion?” the VBA chief, the grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, said. Mr. Ambedkar said disintegration of the country’s social fabric was certain once religion-based politics began to hold sway in the general discourse. “Political parties want to do politics based on caste and religion and are not interested in the politics of development,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/renaming-a-ploy-to-divide-hindus-and-muslims-says-ambedkar/article33490539.ece

Mr. Shivanand obtained his M.Tech in Materials Engineering from the National Institute of Technology-Karnataka (NIT-K), Surathkal, and M.Sc in Materials Science from Mangalore University more than one-and-half-decades ago. He later became a full-time agriculturist. Mr. Shivanand, backed by the BJP, won from Aranthodu Ward II. “I have won by a margin of five votes,” he told The Hindu. He added that “rebel factors” resulted in a decrease in the margin of votes. A B.Sc degree and a diploma holder, Mamatha (in photo) has won the election from Pavoor Gram Panchayat in Mangaluru taluk. Her parents were migrant workers hailing from Udupi. After her father Krishnappa suddenly disappeared in 1995, she lived with her mother and two brothers without a proper shelter in the surroundings of Pavoor and Innoli, on the outskirts of Mangaluru city, by erecting a tent and leading a life of a slum dweller.

The State BJP confirmed the change of allies around the time the newly-formed Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal found a common ground — opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act — to get closer to a pre-poll tie-up. The AJP evolved from the same student organisations as the Asom Gana Parishad, the BJP’s other regional ally, 35 years apart. “After forming the government in the Bodoland Territorial Council, the BJP and the UPPL will contest the Assembly elections in the BTR,” Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/first-kolkata-nearby/article33490454.ece

04 January 2021||Shivamogga,||Karnataka BJP rules out alliance with JD(S)||BJP national general secretary Arun Singh, who is also in charge of party affairs in Karnataka, has ruled out the possibility of the party forming an alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular). This resulted in JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who had of late become soft towards the BJP, hitting out at the party. Earlier, replying to a query from reporters on whether the BJP would join hands with the JD(S), Mr. Singh, in Shivamogga to take part in a BJP meeting on Sunday, said there was no need for an alliance with the JD(S). “We are the ruling party in Karnataka. Ours is the number one party in the State. We will come to power on our own, whenever the elections are held. Why should we go with someone else,” he asked. This angered Mr. Kumaraswamy, who took to Twitter to express his views. ‘BJP behind rumours’ He accused the BJP of floating rumours about an alliance and declared that his party did not require any friendship with the BJP. “The gram panchayat election results have made the BJP realise that efforts to finish off the JD(S) have failed. That is why the BJP is now trying to play a drama of deceit and there has been an organised way to spread rumours of the JD(S) joining the NDA,” he said in a series of tweets. He asked, “Who from the JD(S) has submitted an application to the BJP for an alliance?” He also tweeted that rumours were being floated that the JD(S) would join the NDA and that he would be made a Union Minister. “These are a bundle of lies. This is not ethical politics. By saying these things, the morale of JD(S) workers and sympathisers is being affected. There have been many who tried to break the JD(S) by offering friendship. It is now the turn of the BJP,” he said. The former Chief Minister also sought to remind Mr. Singh that he had an excellent relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi — one better than what many State BJP leaders had with the PM. “Yediyurappa is a senior leader and we have respect for him. We also do not want to oppose just because we are in the Opposition. If the BJP indulges in false propaganda, it will affect this respect and relationship. Let the BJP be cautious of the JD(S),” he said. D||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-bjp-rules-out-alliance-with-jds/article33489999.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Private hospitals keen on vaccine role||Private healthcare providers say they are keen on offering COVID-19 vaccination, with the Union government stating that its priority now is to vaccinate the most vulnerable groups immediately. “Currently, the vaccine is not available in the private sector. The government is focused on vaccinating its priority group with beneficiaries having to register with the government,” Randeep Guleria, Director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said in a video message released by the Union Health Ministry on Sunday. Senior health officials said the government could bring in measures to help a larger population to get vaccinated.  ‘Ready to back govt.’ K. Hariprasad, president of the hospitals division at Apollo Hospitals, said: “We will follow the government regulations. The government has drawn up good plans for what is probably the largest immunisation programme in the world, and the largest preventive healthcare programme in the world. We in the private sector have always responded to the healthcare needs of the country. Similarly, the private sector is prepared to support the government even in this initiative, as and when the government directs us to do so.” Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer, Serum Institute of India (SII), had earlier said its vaccine would be bought by the government to be offered to beneficiaries. “We cannot sell to the private market right now. Private players will come in only when the government looks into the matter and the permissions are granted,” he said. Y.K. Mishra, chief of clinical services, Manipal Hospitals, said that so far, the DCGI had not given approval to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. So there was no question of either private or any government agencies using these vaccines. “Once these vaccines get the approval from the authorities in India, there will be the possibility of private hospitals also giving these vaccines. The prerequisite for this possibility will be the availability of these vaccines in the open market,” he said. Bishnu Panigrahi, group head, medical strategy and operations, Fortis Healthcare, noted that the government would decide how to go about the roll-out. “Private healthcare providers need to be given permission by the government for [offering] vaccination. In case a go-ahead is given, they are prepared. As regards vaccines, the two approved so far are the Oxford/AstraZeneca/Serum Institute vaccine and the Bharat Biotech vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna approvals are yet to come in. They have logistical implications as regards storage [being] minus-70 degrees C and minus-20 degrees C, respectively,” he said. Figures released by the Health Ministry note that more than 75 lakh beneficiaries have been registered on the Co-WIN software till date.

04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||FSSAI slashes limit for transfat levels in foods||The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has capped the amount of trans fatty acids (TFA) in oils and fats to 3% for 2021 and 2% by 2022 from the current permissible limit of 5% through an amendment to the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations. The FSSAI notified the amendment on December 29, more than a year after it issued a draft on the subject for consultation with stakeholders. Broad spread The revised regulation applies to edible refined oils, vanaspati (partially hydrogenated oils), margarine, bakery shortenings and other mediums of cooking such as vegetable fat spreads and mixed fat spreads. Transfats are associated with an increased risk of heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 5.4 lakh deaths take place each year globally because of the intake of industrially produced trans fatty acids. The WHO has also called for the global elimination of transfats by 2023. “The FSSAI rule comes at the time of a pandemic where the burden of non-communicable diseases has risen. Cardiovascular diseases, along with diabetes, are proving fatal for COVID-19 patients,” says Ashim Sanyal, chief operating officer of Consumer VOICE, adding that the regulation must not be restricted to oils and fats, but must apply to all foods. “It is hoped that the FSSAI will address this as well before January 2022 to eliminate chemical trans fatty acids from the Indian platter.” 2018 pledge While the regulation comes into effect immediately, industry players were made to take a pledge back in 2018 that they would comply with the WHO’s call for action to reduce TFA by 3% by 2021 allowing them three years to comply with the latest norm. It was in 2011 that India first passed a regulation that set a TFA limit of 10% in oils and fats, which was further reduced to 5% in 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fssai-slashes-limit-for-transfat-levels-in-foods/article33490038.ece
04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Economy is on fast recovery track’||With GST collections hitting a record in December 2020, Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey is confident that the economy is recovering fast and will bounce back over 2021. The ‘Vivaad se Vishwas’ scheme for resolving tax disputes has already helped settle cases worth Rs. 83,000 crore out of an estimated Rs. 8 lakh crore, he says.  How much of a role did improved compliance play in the record GST collections last month? The economy is undoubtedly on the fast recovery track. We have also been working on improving compliance for over a year now. We now have a very close data exchange between Income tax, Customs, banks and GST [Goods and Services Tax], and are able to undertake data analytics, using artificial intelligence (AI). We are able to trace all dubious transactions from the inception of GST — if someone has issued or availed a fake bill in July 2017, we are able to detect that as well. Even if the bill may have passed through multiple layers of intermediaries, we are in a position to create a network diagram quickly through our AI tools and we are able to identify who all have been partners in the tax fraud and we are able to take action against them. You are bringing in more changes in the GST system from this month. Do you expect these to help sustain the collections and compliance levels seen in December? This is our endeavour. We have taken certain steps for improving overall compliance. For instance, earlier, any taxpayer could claim input tax credit. Now, we are actually showing to him at the time of filing returns, that he is entitled to only ‘x’ amount of credit, calculated based on the returns filed by his suppliers. Therefore, any excess input tax credit (ITC) claim and thereby, understating tax dues, will become very difficult. Till the last month, we had a rule that said one could not take ITC more than 10% of what is available from his suppliers. Now that is reduced to 5%. What it means, in turn, is that we have now 95% of invoices being matched. So these are the systemic changes we have made that is leading to easier compliance for honest taxpayers and deterring those who used to be on the fringe and were looking for an opportunity to game the system. Now, things are getting harder and harder for them. Revenue receipts stood at 40% of the Budget target by November 2020, corporate tax collections are sharply down ... I wouldn’t like to go into the exact numbers because we are amidst the budgetary exercise. We will present our revised estimates at the time of the Budget. So, it will be very premature for us to say what the deficit could be ... If you look at total direct tax collections in the current year, we are down by 9.9%, which also has to be seen in the backdrop of the severe impact of the first two quarters. Direct Tax collection is not always proportionate to turnover. If the turnover is below a certain level, one may go into losses and may not pay any direct tax at all. We will see the impact of this factor. In addition, we had also taken a series of steps to provide certain benefits to the taxpayers. The TDS amount that constitutes a major part of our collections, we reduced that by 25%. So, despite the 25% reduction in TDS and the abolition of dividend distribution tax and COVID, we are seeing only a 9.9% reduction in the direct tax collection by December, which shows an improvement in trends. Do you expect more shortfalls in compensation revenue for States over 2021-22? We will have to watch. Considering the current measures we have taken, the revenue position should improve. But how much, and to what extent it will meet the 14% compounded growth (in revenues payable to States), is something we will have to see. What has been the response to the Vivaad se Vishwas Scheme (VSVS) for resolving tax disputes? The VSVS dispute settlement scheme got a little setback at the outset as it was launched on March 15, 2020, and then we were immediately struck by the novel coronavirus pandemic. We have received 96,000 cases worth Rs. 83,000 crore out of 5 lakh appeals pending in various appellate forums. Now, we have further extended the last date till January 31 seeing the good response and we hope we will get many more cases by then.  We have made systemic changes that is leading to easier compliance for honest taxpayers||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/economy-is-on-fast-recovery-track/article33490019.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM congratulates scientists for vaccines||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday congratulated India and it’s scientists and innovators minutes after the Drugs Controller General of India granted approval to the vaccines against COVID-19 manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech. Calling the development an acceleration on the road to a COVID-free nation, Mr. Modi said it was a “decisive turning point to strengthen a spirited fight!” Stating that the vaccines are a fitting tribute to the “corona warriors”, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted his gratitude to all healthcare professionals and frontline workers for their exemplary efforts during these unprecedented times. “Congratulations to all the scientists and researchers for their untiring efforts. It’s now time to reap the benefits of the robust supply chain infrastructure we’ve put in place for quick and equitable distribution of the vaccine. Urge all citizens to entrust the stringent protocols followed for ensuring safety, efficacy and immunogenicity,” he said. Calling the approval of Covaxin for emergency use a giant leap for innovation and novel product development in India, Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Krishna Ella said, “It is a proud moment for the nation and a great milestone in India’s scientific capability, a kickstart to the innovation ecosystem in India.” She said while this vaccine addressesd an unmet medical need during this pandemic, “our goal is to provide global access to populations that need it the most. Covaxin has generated excellent safety data with robust immune responses to multiple viral proteins that persist”. Roll-out in coming weeks Responding to the DCGI decision, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla tweeted: “All the risks SII took with stockpiling the vaccine have finally paid off. COVISHIELD, India’s first COVID-19 vaccine, is approved, safe, effective and ready to roll out in the coming weeks.” Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia Region, in her statement, said the WHO welcomed the first emergency use authorisation given to COVID-19 vaccine in the Southeast Asia Region. “This decision taken today by India will help intensify and strengthen the fight against COVID-19 pandemic in the region,” she said. “Vaccination will begin soon,” Principal Scientific Adviser K. Vijay Raghavan said. “This is a result of focused work by scientists, national laboratories, government agencies, regulators, healthcare workers, and most importantly, all our people who have waited patiently.” He said full vaccination measures were in place in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-congratulates-scientists-for-vaccines/article33490032.ece
04 January 2021||ALAPPUZHA,||‘Forbidden rice’ finds its way to Kombankuzhy polder||Rice plants with violet panicles are the new attraction at the Kombankuzhy Padasekharam (paddy field) here. These panicles are of the Black Jasmine rice variety cultivated by Nayanan C.C., a Health Department employee-cum-paddy farmer. He is growing the rice variety, known for its medicinal properties, on one acre of leased land. He sowed the seeds two months ago and the harvest is expected in February. Nayanan says that his aim is to popularise rice varieties with medicinal properties. “In India, Black rice with numerous health benefits is mostly grown in Manipur, West Bengal and some north-eastern States. When I came to know about the benefits of it, I decided to cultivate it in the puncha crop season,” he says. He got 25 kg seeds of the Black Jasmine rice from a farmer in Wayanad. It is being grown in an organic way. “The farmer was reluctant to give the seeds saying that they might not germinate in our conditions. The germination was in fact difficult. I had soaked the seeds in water for several hours and repeated the process quite a few times before they germinated. Black rice can be grown in our conditions with slight changes in the germination process,” says Mr. Nayanan, a resident of Thirumala ward in the Alappuzha municipality. Black rice also known as the ‘forbidden rice’ is rich in nutrients and is deep dark in colour. It will turn deep purple when cooked due to the high level of antioxidant called anthocyanin. Studies have also revealed that the rice variety contains fibre and has anti-inflammatory properties. Apart from Black rice, he is also cultivating Rakthashali and Krishna Kamod varieties in another half an acre at the Kombankuzhy Padasekharam, which is spread over 110 acres. Flood resistance In August 2020, Nayanan C.C. had hit headlines after the Rakthashali rice variety cultivated by him on half an acre withstood three weeks of flooding. In November, the paddy was hand-harvested in the presence of farmers, scientists, and environmentalists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/forbidden-rice-finds-its-way-to-kombankuzhy-polder/article33490490.ece
04 January 2021||New Delhi,||PM cannot see the pain and struggle of farmers: Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday said a government that ignored public sentiments in a democracy did not remain in power for long, and described the Narendra Modi government as the first “arrogant regime in Independent India that cannot see the pain and struggle of farmers”. Ensuring profits for a select few capitalists has become the main agenda of the government, she said, and reminded the Centre that “democracy means protecting the interest of farmers-workers”. On the 39th day of farmers’ protests at the Singhu border in Delhi, Ms. Gandhi said in a statement that the government should shun arrogance and unconditionally repeal the three farm laws to end the agitation. “Just like fellow citizens, I am distressed to see the plight of our farmers who are protesting at Delhi’s borders for 39 days in this bone-chilling cold and rain to get their demands accepted,” she said. The Congress leader said over 50 protesting farmers had died because of the government’s apathy and a few ended their lives in the protest, but that had neither melted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s heart nor any Minister had a comforting word to say to the families of those who died. “After Independence, this is the first government that is filled with arrogance to such an extent that it is not only blind to the pain and struggle of common people but also those who feed the country,” she said. “In a democracy, a government or a leader who ignores public sentiments cannot govern for long. It is now absolutely clear that the agitating farmers-workers will not kneel before this government’s policy of tiring out the protesters and end the agitation.” CPI plea Communist Party of India general secretary, D. Raja, said the government must be sensitive towards the farmers and repeal the laws. “The government should be sincere in its talks with the farmers. Parliament will be meeting soon and it can debate and bring a new law,” he said.

04 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Little hope of breakthrough: BKU(U)||Ahead of the next round of meeting between farmers’ outfits and the Central government on January 4, Joginder Singh, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) (BKU-U), one of the largest outifts in Punjab, says there is “little hope” for any breakthrough on revoking the contentious farm laws amid what he terms the “stubborn attitude of the BJP-led government”. “The way the leaders of the ruling government at the Centre have been giving statements in favour of the new laws and terming them good for farmers, I am not too hopeful of any positive outcome from talks on January 4. Our stand is very clear — we want a legal guarantee for minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce, besides revocation of all the three farm laws. If our demands are not fulfilled, we will continue with our agitation indefinitely,” Mr. Singh told The Hindu on Sunday. ‘Partial achievement’ Mr. Singh said in the last meeting, the Centre had assured farmers of decriminalising stubble-burning and safeguarding electricity subsidies, but that is only a partial achievement. “The resolution of the ongoing impasse lies only in the government accepting our demand of revoking the new farm laws. Until our core demands are accepted, the struggle will continue and will only intensify further,” he said. Mr. Singh added that the government needs to understand that the prevailing mandi system under the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act (APMC) in Punjab and Haryana has been working well and it should continue. “Even contract farming had been in place before the new laws were enacted. Let it be the way it was,” said Mr. Singh. The government has been trying to justify the laws by saying that several farmers’ unions are supporting them, but this is only an attempt to weaken the ongoing movement and divert attention, said Mr. Singh. “The unions, that the government has been claiming are in favour of these laws are those which have no existence on the ground. These unions exist only in office records. How many of these unions have participated in any of the farmers’ movements? They are just a sham,” said Mr. Singh. “The government’s intent is to establish a parallel platform to weaken the ongoing agitation.” Mr. Singh said though the BKU (Ugrahan) is not part of the group of 32 farmers’ unions from Punjab, all outfits were working together to get the farm laws revoked. “We have started a tractor march in the villages of Haryana in support of our agitation. Over 1,000 tractors are participating in this march, which will increase in the coming days. The march started from Tikri border on January 3 and will continue for the next three-four days.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/little-hope-of-breakthrough-bkuu/article33490017.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELH,||Congress not proud of anything Indian: Nadda||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday said that statements by COVID-19 vaccine sceptics among Opposition leaders were playing into the hands of vested interests and demonstrated that the Opposition refused to be proud of “anything Indian”. Party chief J.P. Nadda took to Twitter to make these statements against certain Opposition leaders who termed the COVID-19 vaccines suspect and fraudulent, amid government regulatory clearance given to the Oxford AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine and conditional approval given to Covaxin by Bharat Biotech. “Congress and the Opposition is not proud of anything Indian. They should introspect about how their lies on the COVID-19 vaccine will be used by vested interest groups for their own agendas. People of India have been rejecting such politics and will keep doing so in the future,” Mr. Nadda tweeted. “Within a year of the COVID-19 pandemic coming to India, our scientists and innovators have worked hard for a vaccine to cure it. While the entire nation is happy about this, the Opposition led [by] the Congress is filled with anger, ridicule and disdain,” he said. “To further their own failed politics and nefarious agendas, Congress and other Opposition leaders are trying to cause panic in the minds of the people. I urge them to do politics on other issues, they should avoid playing with people’s previous lives and hard earned livelihoods,” he added. While Samajwadi Party leader and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has said he would not take the vaccine terming it a “BJP vaccine”, Congress spokesperson Salman Niazi said it was a “fraud”. Another Congress leader, Rashid Alvi, spoke to a TV news channel in support of Mr. Yadav. “The way the BJP and Prime Minister Modi have used agencies including CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), Income Tax Department and Enforcement Directorate against Opposition leaders, I think there’s nothing wrong with it if Akhilesh Yadav fears that vaccine can be misused. The way the government is working against Opposition leaders, fear is justified,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-not-proud-of-anything-indian-nadda/article33490026.ece
04 January 2021||Mysuru,||Bhyrappa defends proposed law against slaughter of cows||Kannada writer and Saraswathi Samman awardee S.L. Bhyrappa on Sunday defended the proposed law against cow slaughter on the grounds that the animal symbolised non-violence. Speaking at a function held at the RSS office here to mobilise funds for the construction of Sri Rama temple in Ayodhya, Dr. Bhyrappa said cow was symbolic of non-violence and “we shared a mother and child relationship with it”. He said everyone grew up consuming cow milk and children did not renounce their mother when she was of an advanced age. He said there were other benefits too and the animal produced dung, which had utility as a fertilizer. He said the menace of cancer was on the rise owing to the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture and farmers should harness cows for using its dung. Those critical of the law against cow slaughter lack basic knowledge, he opined. The writer also expressed support to the farm legislation passed by the Centre. Dr. Bhyrappa said the protests in Delhi were by farmers from Punjab alone and was not representative of the views of all the farmers across the country. Dr. Bhyrappa said the new legislation enabled farmers to sell their produce to anyone who made a better offer, instead of selling it at APMC yards. He expressed suspicion that “the Congress and the Communists” were behind the ongoing agitation. He said the new legislation provided benefits to farmers and they would receive money on the spot instead of waiting indefinitely for it to be transferred to their accounts. “There are political parties unable to digest the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They are hence instigating the farmers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhyrappa-defends-proposed-law-against-slaughter-of-cows/article33490137.ece
04 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Asad visits Furfura Sharif, says MIM to contest in Bengal||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday met the custodian family of Furfura Sharif, an important Muslim place of worship in Hooghly district of West Bengal, and announced that his party flag would flutter from there ahead of the Assembly polls in that State. The move comes barely a few weeks after the AIMIM won 44 seats in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). On the night of the election results, Mr. Owaisi organised a press conference and told the media that his party would contest the upcoming Assembly elections in West Bengal, even as he announced intentions of going to places like Malda and Murshidabad. Sunday’s move appears to be in line with Mr. Owaisi’s intention to contest the WB polls. Twitter announcement Taking to Twitter on Sunday, Mr. Owaisi announced, “At Furfura Sharif, West Bengal in a meeting with Pirzada Abbas Siddiqui sb, Pirzada Naushad Siddiqui sb, Pirzada Baizid Amin sb & Janab Sabir Ghaffar sb (sic).” He said that if the flag of the AIMIM is to flutter in West Bengal, it is imperative on him to pay homage at the Furfura Sharif. He said that he will work with, and stand behind Pirzada Abbas Siddiqui. According to sources, Furfura Sharif is an important centre for Muslims in West Bengal. The custodians have supported political parties, and enjoy widespread support for Muslims in the region. In a separate tweet quoting a media report, Mr. Owaisi demanded that the Centre ensure that the COVID vaccine reaches all Indians by procuring it in large numbers. He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately invoke relevant sections of the Patent Act and pharmaceutical companies to issue licences to genetic manufacturers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/asad-visits-furfura-sharif-says-mim-to-contest-in-bengal/article33490400.ece
04 January 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. questions ‘modification’ of protocols to approve Covaxin||Deputy leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma on Sunday expressed concern over the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) granting permission for restricted use of Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine by “dispensing” with mandatory protocols and verification of data. Mr. Sharma, who heads the Parliamentary Panel on Home Affairs that extensively dealt with the issue, said no country had dispensed with mandatory Phase-3 trials and verification of data, and the issue of granting authorisation needs to be taken carefully. He said that going by the submission made to the expert panel, Phase-3 trials have not been completed and, therefore, the data on safety and efficacy has not been reviewed. Frontline workers at risk “Verification of data and Phase-3 trials are mandatory requirements. The Health Ministry needs to give proper reasons for dispensing with the mandatory protocols and requirements in this case, since it involves the health and safety of those frontline workers who will be vaccinated under the restricted category,” Mr. Sharma told The Hindu . “The DCGI statement is puzzling and the government must reveal the final data on global efficacy trials and the final trials in the U.K., which has been shared officially by the U.K.’s MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority) following a government-to-government agreement signed between the two countries, which should be put in the public domain to avoid any confusion on the proven efficacy of the vaccine,” he added. The Congress leader, however, said that the news of the imminent arrival and roll-out of the nation-wide vaccination drive is “truly uplifting and reassuring” for a country paralysed by the pandemic. Mr. Sharma’s colleague in the Rajya Sabha, Jairam Ramesh, asked Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to clarify why internationally-accepted protocols on Phase-3 trials are being modified. “Bharat Biotech is a first-rate enterprise, but it is puzzling that internationally-accepted protocols relating to phase 3 trials are being modified for Covaxin. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan should clarify,” Mr. Ramesh said on Twitter. When Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including party president J.P. Nadda and Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, accused Congress leaders of being unhappy with “Made in India” vaccines, the Congress hit back. “Congress party has full belief in our scientific community. Whatever they decide, we are going to follow them, but we want that the best vaccine [be provided] after completing all protocols,” party spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said at a press conference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-questions-modification-of-protocols-to-approve-covaxin/article33490028.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Experts raise questions over ‘hasty’ nod to vaccines||Several experts have raised concern over the “hasty approval” granted to the COVID-19 vaccines despite the lack of adequate efficacy data. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation on Sunday accorded approval for restricted emergency use of the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and the indigenously developed vaccine Covaxin of Bharat Biotech. “I’m completely unaware of any data that suggests that Covaxin has any efficacy against any SARS-CoV-2 strain, let alone the U.K. strain,” Gagandeep Kang, Professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore, said in an interview to CNBC-TV18. A doctor-cum-research head of a lab affiliated to a government research lab also expressed reservations. “At this point, I wouldn’t advise Covaxin. All we seem to know is that it’s safe and so may not be harmful but efficacy is a different matter and needs to be proved,” the expert said requesting anonymity. Scientific logic “In the interest of transparency, we ask that the regulator share detailed rationale or the decision along with disclosure of data... We are baffled to understand what scientific logic has motivated top experts in the SEC (Subject Expert Committee) to approve this vaccine (Covaxin) post haste,” Malini Aisola, of the All India Drug Action Network, said in a statement. However, Randeep Guleria, Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, referred to Covaxin as a “backup vaccine” and added that it is to be used if it was not clear how efficacious the SII vaccine would be.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-raise-questions-over-hasty-nod-to-vaccines/article33490030.ece
04 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Haryana SIC seeks comment on rejoinders from Khemka||The Haryana State Information Commission (SIC) has issued a notice, asking the office of the Chief Secretary (Political Department), and the Town and Country Planning Department (TCPD), to give their comments on the rejoinders filed by senior IAS officer Ashok Khemka on the matter of an appeal under the Right to Information Act, in which he has sought initiation of “penal action” under Section 20 of the Act. The matter pertains to the seeking of information relating to the Justice S.N. Dhingra Inquiry Commission set up in May 2015 to the probe granting of Change of Land Use (CLU) licences in villages in Gurgaon during the rule of the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government, including that between Congress leader Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra’s Sky Light Hospitality and real estate developer DLF Universal Limited. The one-man Commission submitted its report to the State government on August 31, 2016. Mr. Khemka, Principal Secretary, Archaeological Department, Haryana, had in September 2020 approached the SIC with an appeal, complaining that complete information had not been not furnished by the respondents — the State Public Information Officer; the office of the Chief Secretary, Haryana (Political Department); and the office of the Director, Town and Country Planning Department, with regard to his application under the RTI Act. Mr. Khemka said he had sought five-point information, including the total amount paid to Tushar Mehta, advocate, presently Solicitor-General of India, in the defence of CWP No.24139 of 2016 titled as “Bhupinder Singh Hooda vs State of Haryana and others” in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Mr. Khemka came to the limelight after he cancelled the mutation of a land deal between Mr.Vadra’s company and DLF.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/haryana-sic-seeks-comment-on-rejoinders-from-khemka/article33490036.ece
04 January 2021||KOCHI,||Didn’t interfere with Abhaya case: ex-judge||Former judge of the Supreme Court, Cyriac Joseph, who is alleged to have attempted to interfere with the forensic analysis and judicial processes in the Sister Abhaya murder case, has defended himself saying that his hands were clean. It was alleged that Mr. Joseph had viewed the narco-analysis CDs of Father Thomas Kottoor, Sister Sephy and Father Jose Puthrukkayail at the Forensic Analysis Laboratory (FSL), Bengaluru, during the course of the investigation. While Fr. Puthrukkayail was let off earlier, a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Special Court convicted two others in the case last week. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Joseph said the visit took place on May 23, 2008, on an invitation from the FSL Director, seven months after the lab had handed over the report to the CBI and the agency had submitted it in court. Mr. Joseph, then Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court, denied that he was shown the videos of the narco-analysis tests of the accused in the case. The visit followed a workshop on scientific investigation techniques for judges organised by the Karnataka Judicial Academy, he said. There were no private meetings. All the interactions took place in the presence of four district judges and the media, he added. V.T. Raghunath, former acting chief judicial magistrate, Ernakulam, before whom the CBI filed a closure report in the case, had earlier alleged that it was at the behest of Mr. Joseph that the Registrar of the Kerala High Court had asked him not to visit the nunnery where Sr. Abhaya was found dead. “I left Kerala in 2005 to take charge as the Chief Justice of Uttarakhand and the reported developments took place in 2006,” he said. As the CJM’s order was found to be patently illegal and sans jurisdiction, the High Court initiated suo motu proceedings in the matter. The order was set aside by Justice K. Padmanabhan Nair and the CJM’s transfer to Kochi as Sub Judge was ordered by Justice Sankarasubban, the Judge in-charge of Ernakulam, on administrative grounds, he said. Mr. Joseph felt he was being targeted as he was born in the Knanaya Catholic community to which the deceased and the accused belonged. Also, he had married from a family which was related to Fr. Kottoor, he said. “It is meaningless to cast aspersions on individuals without evidence,” said Mr. Joseph, who is serving as the Kerala Lok Ayukta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/didnt-interfere-with-abhaya-case-ex-judge/article33489993.ece
04 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Banana grit for that good gut feeling||Here is some good news for the health-conscious public and banana farmers plagued by falling prices. Scientists at the CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST) at Pappanamcode here in Kerala have come up with a new product, banana grit or granules, developed from rawNendranbananas. Billed as an ideal ingredient for a healthy diet, banana grit can be used for making a wide range of dishes, according to the NIIST. The product resembles to ‘rava’ and broken wheat. “The concept was introduced to utilise the presence of resistant starch in bananas, which is reported to improve gut health. Hence, the dishes prepared with banana grit and its byproduct, banana powder, incline to the new focus on gut health, which the scientific community is widely discussing now to maintain health and well-being,” the NIIST said. The Institute added that years of research on the Nendran variety helped it open up a new application for the starch-rich banana. Generally consumed ripe, Nendran banana also finds use in typical Kerala dishes such asavialandthoran. The granules can be used for making upma , or it can be mixed with banana powder for porridge, with milk or coconut milk for use as a health drink. Banana powder can be used for making cakes and breads, along with refined wheat flour. Developing new uses for Nendran also comes as a boon to farmers who have often been struggling against falling prices, according to the scientists. The technology had been transferred to Kochi-based Moza Organic and the product is expected to be in the market soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/grit-from-nendran-for-the-health-conscious/article33489996.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘India still at risk of a biased citizenship regime’||Though the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) movement last year, India is still in danger of having an undemocratic and biased citizenship regime and there was no room for complacency, N. Ram, Director, The Hindu Group of Publications, and former Editor-in-Chief of The Hindu , said on Saturday. Addressing an online event organised by a diaspora group from Washington DC, Mr. Ram spoke about “Citizenship, the Constitution and Muslims in the time of Hindutva”. He said though the pandemic had trumped the issue of citizenship, there was “no room for complacency”. “It’s very clear we are in danger of having a citizenship regime that is arbitrary, undemocratic, biased and surveillance-oriented,” he said. Constituent Assembly Mr. Ram said there had been arguments made in the Constituent Assembly in favour of according citizenship on the basis of religion, but they were put down by leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer. Today, he said, some of the same themes have cropped up. He said the anti-CAA protests and the ongoing farmers’ agitation had “shown the limits of power of those who seek to seize more” at a time of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking about the Muslim population, which is estimated to be 207 million, or 14.6% of the total population, in 2021, he said, “It’s not as if the Muslim population as a whole is threatened. There are many States where Muslims and Hindus, and people belonging to other religious groups live in perfect harmony. But the Hindutva project is to divide and target the so-called other.” He said the political project of Hindutva had been around for a long time. “They have bided their time. They have played the long game,” he said. ‘Collective failure’ On the citizenship issue, he said, “At the heart is the question whether Hindu communal majoritarianism — the concept of Hindutva put into practice — will be allowed to trump the secular character of the Constitution.” He said political parties, including the Congress, could not escape accountability. For instance, they could not explain why the exercise of compiling a National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam was conducted. The proposed all-India NRC and the National Population Register (NPR), coupled with the CAA, which gives a path to citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, while leaving out Muslim refugees, posed a direct challenge to India’s secular polity and political stability,Mr. Ram said.  While there has been no timeline for the NRC, the NPR was supposed to have started in 2020, but was pushed back due to the pandemic.

04 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Sandalwood smuggling sees surge in Hyderabad||Sandalwood smugglers from the country have stepped up their illegal activity at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad. The temporary ban on international flights amid COVID-19 lockdown did not deter the smugglers with the growing demand for scented sandalwood, also known as ‘liquid gold’ in the underworld lingua franca for its lucrative value, in overseas markets. The demand has attracted new players into the game as the number of cases has gone up by four times from two cases in 2019 to eight cases last year. According to the data shared by the Customs officials, in 2019 they seized 69.4 kg of sandalwood, while in 2020, the number rose to 139 kg, apart from one litre of sandalwood oil. It is learnt that a large number of passengers smuggle the sandalwood chips in small quantities to Gulf countries, to further export it to African countries where it is used in traditional medicines, perfumes and pharmaceuticals. They also extract oil from the sandalwood and use it in medicines. “The bootleggers try to smuggle various products from India, which have a high demand in other countries, and as a result these days they are focusing on sandalwood,” a senior Customs officer told The Hindu . A few weeks ago, a passenger travelling to Sharjah by an Air Arabia flight was detained by the Customs officials after they found him carrying 5.30 kg of sandalwood chips in his baggage. And in July, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel detained five passengers who were trying to smuggle out 78.5 kg of sandalwood. Though the passengers manage to get local purchase bills, carrying sandalwood in passenger flights is a violation of the provisions of Customs Act, the officer said, adding that many African tourists or students become a conduit for this contraband during their return journey. As sandalwood is not grown in Telangana, it raises many questions on how it is being procured by foreigners in large quantities and later smuggled in small packets. However, smuggling of foreign cigarettes had seen a sharp decline this year with Customs officials seizing 5.21 lakh sticks in 11 cases, as against 17.85 lakh tobacco sticks in 37 cases in 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sandalwood-smuggling-sees-surge-in-hyderabad/article33489992.ece

It is approved for restricted use in an emergency by the Drugs Controller General of India and since this vaccine works on the whole of the virus, this is our additional weapon against it “Simply put it would work even with the mutations that we are seeing in the virus,” he added. Dr. Paul also said at least 12 countries had shown specific interest in Covaxin, with Bangladesh wanting to conduct clinical trials. “Qatar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives are among the countries following the vaccine closely,” he said. Samiran Panda, who is part of the team working on Covaxin and the head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division, ICMR, said the vaccine had the potential to mount a wider immune response against SARS-COV-2 as compared to any vaccine currently available and hence offered better protection against its mutation. “These are extraordinary times that call for extraordinary regulatory response but not at the cost of safety and immunogenicity. Covaxin has been approved after due process and we respect the regulatory mechanism of the country and the rigour that it follows. Covaxin cleared safety and immunogenicity trials with good results — data of which are available in public domain. Countries, including Bangladesh and Myanmar, have shown keen interest in the vaccine,” he noted. Speaking about the government now having to look at the vaccination schedule, K. Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India, said India should follow the trial protocol on the basis of which regulatory approval was provided. “If the trial demonstrated over 50% efficacy for the first dose itself, then the regulator may approve a delayed second dose. On the other hand, if it required two doses a month apart to demonstrate 62% efficacy, that schedule should be adhered to. It is not clear how much protection was conferred by the first dose alone, in terms of a statistically defensible claim of over 50% protection against symptomatic COVID-19, which is the primary endpoint of the trial. In the absence of that information, any deviation from the pre-specified trial protocol would be scientifically indefensible,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rollout-possible-in-10-days-niti-aayog-member/article33490004.ece
04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||India approves two COVID-19 vaccines||Both approvals accorded are for “restricted use in emergency situation” and in the case of Bharat Biotech, the approval wording notes that it is in “...public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains”. These conditions were not specified. Bharat Biotech, whose vaccine candidate is being tested in large Phase-3 trials in India, has provided safety and immunogenicity data. This data is proof that the inoculation doesn’t harm and is capable of stimulating an immune response in the body — but no efficacy data, that shows the vaccine achieves its primarily goal of protecting against disease. Doing such a trial would have, according to the company’s timeline, taken some more months. The head of the CDSCO, V.G. Somani, read out a prepared statement according approval and on the sidelines of the briefing told reporters that the vaccine was “110% safe” and that every adverse event, were they to happen, would be diligently followed up. Samiran Panda, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division, ICMR, defended the emergency approval granted to Covaxin on the ground that the existence of the pandemic, the detection of the U.K. strain and the vaccine’s safety profile meant that it could approved in “clinical trial mode”. “This isn’t the standard approval given to a vaccine. The scheduled trial (on 26,000) will continue and every person who gets the vaccine will be followed up and monitored for risk as well as benefit. It can also be withdrawn. This vaccine, as of now is not for everybody, and is being given under restricted use condition,” he said. Covaxin has been developed based on an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 strain cultured at the National Institute of Virology, an ICMR body. Because it was a whole virus (and therefore, more of it would be exposed to the immune system) the chances that it would mount a response against a variety of mutant virus types or strains were higher. “I would say scientifically Covaxin offers much better antigen presentation (and a consequent immune response) than a vaccine developed as a specific part of the (viral) protein,” Dr. Panda told The Hindu. “So this is potentially more effective against mutant strains.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dcgi-nod-for-restricted-use-of-2-indian-vaccines/article33490005.ece

The Bareilly police made a statement on Saturday that during surveillance, the boy’s mobile phone was not found in Faridpur on the day the girl alleged he asked her to convert and threatened to destroy her family. “The surveillance report was not enough to expunge the FIR registered under Sections 354, 504 of the IPC and Section 3/5 of the new ordinance.

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Quoteworthy words||There are people who want to keep to the path of righteousness, but do not do so, because of various reasons. Affection for their kin often keeps people away from the path of dharma, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. When someone in the family does something sinful, they do not correct him, but allow him to do as he pleases. Dritharashtra is an example of one who, even when he wanted to do what was correct, did not do so. Dritharashtra was ready to sin, because of his affection for his son Duryodhana. He did not use his authority to put an end to Duryodhana’s evil designs, but quietly submitted to all his son’s evil plans. Had he been assertive, war could have been avoided. And yet, there were occasions when he spoke words that should be remembered. Lord Krishna goes to the court of the Kauravas as a messenger of the Pandavas. In the normal course, He should have been welcomed with all the honours due to Him. But Duryodhana was adamant that the Lord should not be welcomed. The welcome should have been grand for more than one reason. Krishna was a messenger and deserved the respect customarily shown to all messengers. Krishna’s son Samba had married Duryodhana’s daughter Lakshmanaa. And yet, Duryodhana refused to treat Krishna with respect and tried to imprison Him. Krishna then assumed His Visvaroopa and showed that everyone and everything in the world was contained in Him. He granted Dritharashtra eyesight, so that he could see His Visvaroopa. Then when Krishna was about to depart, Dritharashtra said to Him, “Take away my eyesight. Having seen Your Visvaroopa, I have no wish to see anything again in this world.” So, even Dritharashtra, who stood by watching Duryodhana tormenting the Pandavas, did say something quoteworthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/quoteworthy-words/article33490024.ece

The commission said it found during a review that several cases had been pending in some organisations. They included stays granted by courts, issues pending in courts, cases kept in abeyance as the official had been terminated from service in another case and the delay in the recommendations from the disciplinary authority in the State government in cases where the official was working with the Central government at the time of the commission of misconduct. In some cases, the misconduct was committed in an organisation where the official was on deputation and later the official either reverted to the parent agency or was transferred to another agency and there was a difference of opinion between the authorities concerned in the two departments. On December 12, the commission pointed to a Supreme Court judgment of March 28, 2018, directing to limit the period of stay granted by a court to six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cvc-sets-timeline-for-vigilance-cases/article33490034.ece

04 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Poet-lyricist Anil Panachooran passes away||Poet and lyricist Anil Panachooran passed away late on Sunday at a private hospital here following health complications. He was 55. He had collapsed earlier in the day and was admitted at private hospitals at Kayamkulam and Karunagappally before he was brought to the city. The exact reason of death is yet to be ascertained, said sources from the hospital. A lawyer by profession, Panachooran came into the limelight in 2007 with the much appreciated songs in Arabikkadha , including ‘Chora Veena Mannil...’ and ‘Thirike Njan...’. ‘Chora Veena Mannil...’, sung with revolutionary fervour by the poet himself, grew beyond the movie and is played regularly in Left cultural events. Winning hearts ‘Thirike Njan...’, which had lines bringing out the pain of expatriates living away from their family members, became a huge hit with the non-resident Keralites. Even before he marked his arrival in films, he had attained popularity among the poetry aficionados in the State with poems such as ‘Anaadhan’, written in the 1990s. The poem, about a mentally challenged woman who gives birth to a baby on the street, later became a song in the film Makalkku , which tackled a similar subject. Some of his other famous poems include ‘Valayil Veena Kilikal’, ‘Pranayakalam’, ‘Oru Mazha Peythengil’, and ‘Kanneerkanalukal’. He followed up Arabikkadha with the song ‘Vyathyasthanam oru barber...’ from Kadha Parayumbol , a humourous song that topped the hit charts for a long time. Over the next decade, he continued to write lyrics consistently for Malayalam films, touching on a variety of subjects through his songs.  Notable works Some of his notable works include the songs in Bhramaram , Mulla , Cocktail , Madambi , Cycle, Minnaminnikkoottam, and Velipadinte Pusthakam . The song ‘Jimikki Kammal...’ from Velipadinte Pusthakam , with its catchy yet simple lyrics inspired from old folk songs, soon went viral, spawning several dance video covers from across the globe. Panachooran was working on his first directorial Kaadu when the end came. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled the poet’s passing away. He said that Panachooran’s songs, including ‘Chora Veena Mannil...’, will always be remembered by Malayalis. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that the State had lost a talented poet from the new generation with Panachooran’s death. He said he had maintained a close friendship with the poet.

At present, CMRL has embarked on a massive phase II project that runs for 118.9 km with three stretches — Madhavaram to Shollinganallur, Light House to Poonamallee and Madhavaram to SIPCOT and the construction will begin soon. Now, the State government has decided to extend the stretch from Poonamallee to Tirumazhisai. Sources said the detailed project report would be completed within six months. AECOM has been awarded the contract for the job. This report would be an important document before construction was taken up as it would contain all the details, from the areas that would have a station to traffic pattern and how the construction needed to be executed. The phase II project itself would have a depot at Poonamallee and Madhavaram. Now, it is expected that Tirumazhisai too may get a depot for maintenance of trains. “After the DPR is finished, it will be submitted to the State government and after decision on funding and other related issues are made, the construction can begin; but this will take some time,” a source said. Since there would be a moffussil bus terminus and Metro Rail at the township and it would be beneficial for commuters. This stretch from Poonamallee to Tirumazhisai was likely to go through Nazarathpet, Chembarambakkam and might provide quick connectivity to various educational institutions such as Saveetha Engineering College, Panimalar Engineering College and Sree Sastha College of Engineering. “There will be students who will be keen on travelling in the Metro in future, because road traffic is pretty bad during the peak hours in these areas,” an official said. CMRL has been doing the detailed project report for extending this system from Chennai airport till Kilambakkam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tirumazhisai-township-in-metros-future-plans/article33490201.ece

In 2019, the State attracted $1,641 million in private equity and venture capital investments through 54 deals, according to data sourced from Venture Intelligence, a research company. For 2020, the State got funding for 22 angel investment deals, compared with 16 in 2019. Traditional strengths “Tamil Nadu-based companies are benefiting from the growing investor interest in sectors such as software as a service (SaaS) and financial services that play to the traditional strengths of companies in the State,” says Venture Intelligence founder Arun Natarajan. Companies such as TVS Logistics and agritech start-up WayCool Foods also attracted investor interest during 2020. TVS Supply Chain Solutions had raised $100 million from gateway partners in the first quarter, while WayCool closed the Series C round of $32 million led by Lightbox. Mr. Natarajan says that since the start of the lockdown, investors, including angel networks like The Chennai Angels, have been reporting that the quality of start-up teams and their business plans have increased.

04 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. to build 30 km of stormwater drains to prevent flooding||Greater Chennai Corporation has decided to develop 30 km of new drains along 68 roads to mitigate flooding of 23 localities in the city. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash has ordered civic officials to complete the work on obtaining administrative sanction for the projects by the second week of January. “The new design of the drains will offer a permanent solution for flooding in the city. Work will start in the 23 localities shortly,” said an official. The Corporation has decided to build drains in areas with frequent reports of water stagnation. The areas to get new infrastructure in southern region include Velachery AGS Colony in ward 177, Alandur Kannan Colony in ward 164, Ram Nagar in ward 178, Periyar Nagar, MGR Main Road, Taramani in ward 180, Myilai Balaji Nagar, Pallikaranai in ward 188, Semmenchery Housing Board Colony in ward 200. In central region, Bazullah Road, Thirumalai Pillai Road in ward 136, Rajamannar Salai and R.K. Shanmugam Salai in ward 131, Baba Nagar, Villlivakkam in ward 94, Korattur North Avenue in ward 83, Pulianthope High Road in ward 73, Jagannathan Salai in ward 66, Periyar Nagar in ward 66, and Senthil Nagar in ward 65 will get infrastructure to mitigate flooding. In north Chennai, Kargil Nagar in ward 7, Meenambal Nagar, Kathivakkam High Road in ward 42, Prakasam Salai, Davidson Street in ward 55, 56 and 57, and Ripon Buildings in ward 58 will get infrastructure to reduce water stagnation. Velachery AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association secretary Geetha Ganesh said the flooding of an area covering 35 colonies with a population of 70,000 will be mitigated only by acquisition of private land that has been currently used by the Corporation to drain flood waters. “AGS Colony in Velachery West is topographically the lowest point and water from neighbouring colonies pass through AGS Colony to reach Veerangal Odai which ultimately drains into Pallikaranai Marshland. Our colony experienced two feet high water stagnation this year. In some areas, it is three feet high. T.K. Vijayakumar, former president of Baba Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association in Villivakkam, said the residents had requested the civic officials to remove 200 encroachments in Thathankuppam to facilitate flow of water during the rains. Former councillor S. Mangala Raj said residents had supported the acquisition of land to mitigate flooding. “The design of drains and canals has to be based on a proper study. Earlier, projects had failed because of inadequate planning,” he said.  Plan sought Disaster management expert N. Mathavan said a proper topo plan should be prepared, based on which the drain depth should be decided. “Wherever the depth varies, a bigger manhole may be designed to remove the deposited silt at that point.Wherever the reverse flow occurs due to excess flow a sluice gate or a properly designed one way valve arrangement should be provided to avoid reverse flow,” said Mr. Mathavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-build-30-km-of-stormwater-drains-to-prevent-flooding/article33490208.ece

This was informed to a petitioner A.S.B. Vignesh of Villupuram, who sought to know under the Right to Information (RTI) Act why (a section of) salespersons were charging Rs. 5, Rs. 10 and Rs. 20 above the fixed retail price on quarter (180 ml), half (360 ml) and full (720 ml) liquor bottles respectively and Rs. 10 for beer bottles. He wanted to know whether the employees at the State-owned liquor outlets were authorised to charge more than the fixed retail price and if so where the excess money was going. The Public Information Officer informed the petitioner that selling liquor above the price fixed by the State government was not permitted and any violations were being viewed seriously. While sharing the contact details of the officials who could be contacted for lodging complaints in such cases, the PIO said a penalty of Rs. 1,000 for every Rs. 1 charged extra plus GST will be levied on the salesperson. For instance, if Rs. 10 was charged extra, a fine of Rs. 10,900 would be imposed on the official responsible, who would have to deposit the same in Tasmac’s bank account and then face disciplinary action. Responding to other queries, the public authority said firm action was being taken on illegal bars and sale of liquor in black. The flying squad of Tasmac and special teams of Excise and Enforcement were deployed to check violations and take appropriate action. In recent weeks, unaccounted cash was seized in Tasmac outlets during searches by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption. For instance, between October 1 and December 14, 2020, DVAC teams seized unaccounted cash of Rs. 3.05 lakh from a liquor shop in Nagapattinam, Rs. 69,180 from an Elite liquor shop in Anna Nagar, Chennai, Rs. 1.13 lakh from four liquor shops in Cuddalore, Rs. 60,990 in three liquor shops in Vellore and Pennathur and Rs. 1.21 lakh from the office of the District Manager, Tasmac, Salem.

Satish, director, Paavai Group of Schools. For scheduling the exams, schools need to consider several factors, he adds. “For schools in semi-urban areas like ours that have a lot of students from across the State who need the hostel facility, we should plan the practical exams beforehand. Further clarity is needed from the CBSE as well as the State government on the rules for the educational institutions to follow.” Earlier in 2020, the CBSE announced a 30% reduction in the syllabus for Classes 9-12 because of the closure of schools. “The portions for the practical components in the science subjects have been reduced... While a further reduction would be welcome, we will need some time to prepare the students and meet them,” says Ashok Shankar, general secretary, CBSE Schools Management Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cbse-schools-focus-on-revision-sessions/article33490210.ece
04 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||VCK also wants to contest on own symbol: Thirumavalavan||After MDMK general secretary Vaiko, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) president Thol. Thirumavalavan on Saturday spoke in favour of parties contesting on their own symbols in the 2021 Assembly election. Both are allies of the DMK. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the VCK was allotted two seats. In one of the seats, Villupuram, it contested on the DMK’s ‘Rising Sun’ symbol. Smaller parties are keen on contesting on their own symbols in pursuit of recognition from the Election Commission. However, parties leading alliances want smaller allies to contest on their symbols to improve their prospects. Another advantage is that in the absence of a majority after the election, the party’s whip will be binding on these MLAs. “Contesting on a popular symbol has its advantages. But it is the aspiration of all parties to contest on their own symbols as their objective is to get recognition from the EC,” Mr. Thirumavalavan said. “A party’s vote share will come down by at least 10% when it contests on a non-popular symbol, as in the case of Mr. Thirumavalavan [in 2019, he won by a narrow margin]. But the VCK’s other candidate, Ravikumar, won with a huge margin in Villupuram because he contested on the DMK’s symbol,” political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy said. He, however, pointed out that contesting on their own symbols would free smaller parties from the clutches of alliance leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vck-also-wants-to-contest-on-own-symbol/article33490604.ece

The birds were found to have been traded illegally. Officials from the department said that they initially rescued around 11 parakeets from two persons near Santhome and based on information from them, found 40 parakeets kept in a house of Mohammed Ramali, a resident of Royapuram. Two more persons were arrested from the Muscanchavady market in Broadway for engaging in the illegal trade of the birds. The Parakeets come under Schedule lV of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Clement Edison, Forest Range Officer, said the rescued birds would be under the care of the forest department. “More people should be aware that it is illegal to keep these birds as pets, confined in cages and we encourage people who have these birds to come and hand them over to the department directly. Additionally, the public can call 044-22200335 and inform us,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/53-parakeets-rescued-five-persons-arrested/article33490198.ece
04 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Congress releases a long list of office-bearers||The All-India Congress Committee on Saturday announced a list of 32 vice-presidents, 57 general secretaries, 104 secretaries, 56 executive committee members, 5 ex-officio members and 32 district committee presidents for the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC). The list has accommodated almost all leaders and their supporters — P. Chidambaram; TNCC president K.S. Alagiri; former presidents E.V.K.S. Elangovan, K.V. Thangkabalu, Su. Thirunavukkarasar, Kumari Ananthan and M. Krishnaswamy; and former MPs R. Prabhu and E.M. Sudarsana Natchiappan. Ruby Manoharan has been appointed the treasurer. However, MP Karti Chidambaram expressed his displeasure. “These jumbo committees serve no purpose. None will have any authority, which means no accountability,” he wrote on Twitter. Rejecting his opinion, senior leader A. Gopanna, who has been appointed one of the vice-presidents, said such a big list was necessary to accommodate as many leaders as possible since the Congress was out of power for 50 years. “We are not in a position to give them posts in government. Offering a position in the party will encourage them to do election work. The list was finalised after many rounds of consultations with senior leaders,” he said. Mr. Gopanna said Mr. Karti Chidambaram could have questioned the appointments had he worked to expand the party base. “Can he take credit for any work outside his Sivaganga constituency?” he asked. A senior leader said it was an achievement because after the tenure of B.S. Gnanadesikan as the TNCC president, the central leadership was able to appoint office-bearers. “Leaders like Karti Chidambaram have family and social status... But we have ordinary people on the committee, and their position will get them recognition in their area,” he said.  We are not in a position to give them posts in govt. Offering a position in the party will encourage them to do election work A.

04 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cooum to get 4.5 lakh saplings for eco-restoration||Flood preparedness is set to improve in residential areas along the Cooum banks, with the start of riverine plantation this week. Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust will plant 4.53 lakh saplings of 108 species along the 30-km stretch from Napier Bridge to Paruthipattu. “We will plant the saplings along a five-metre-wide stretch on either side of the river. At least 25 km of the riverbank will get walkways,” says an official. Residents expected nature trails along the river in areas such as College Road, Nungambakkam. For this project, the Bus Route Road Department of the Chennai Corporation had prepared a project report after senior officials visited San Antonio in the United States of America, 10 years ago. But officials are unlikely to focus on the project now. Instead, saplings will be planted along the entire stretch of the river, tweaking the eco-restoration project to suit the flood preparedness of each residential area, says an official. According to the revised plan, the residents are not likely to be permitted to have a morning walk after the infrastructure is developed. A decision will be made only after the eco-restoration is completed, says an official. Corporation officials say the construction of the wall has resumed after the COVID-19 restrictions were eased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cooum-to-get-45-lakh-saplings-for-eco-restoration-flood-mitigation/article33490212.ece
04 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai tops the world in CCTV surveillance||Chennai has the maximum CCTV coverage per square kilometre and per 1,000 population among the 130 cities studied worldwide, according to a recent report published in South Asia Journal.  According to the report, the world’s first CCTV camera was installed in Germany in 1942, and now there are nearly one billion devices. The report maps out how prevalent the CCTV cameras are in 130 of the world’s most populous cities. “China and India are the countries with the highest densities of CCTV surveillance cameras in urban areas. Chennai, India, has 657 cameras per sq km, making it the number one city in the world in terms of surveillance,” it says. Extensive coverage City police commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said, “We have extensive coverage of CCTV cameras in the entire city. The presence of CCTV cameras is very helpful in maintenance of law and order and detection of crimes. It has provided, time and again, vital clues for investigation. We are hoping to extend the coverage... The Tamil Nadu government has sanctioned funds for maintenance of CCTV cameras. Under the Nirbhaya Fund, we are going to install more CCTV devices that will have connectivity with control rooms for live streaming.” The installation of CCTV cameras gathered pace during the tenure of Mr. Aggarwal’s predecessor A.K. Viswanathan. He was instrumental in the installation of CCTV cameras with public participation. “With the advent of CCTV devices, policing has changed entirely. In any crime investigation, the CCTV is the first instrument and handy tool to crack the case. Detection in criminal cases has increased,” said Mr. Viswanathan, who is now Additional Director-General of Police, Operations. He said: “Without political will, it is impossible for us to achieve this status. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had himself encouraged the project. We advised individuals, shopkeepers and commercial establishments to install CCTV on their premises, focusing on streets or public places. We conducted continuous campaigns in every area.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-tops-the-world-in-cctv-surveillance-says-journal-report/article33490183.ece

Stalin’s contribution when he was a Municipal Administration Minister and Deputy Chief Minister, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani asked at a meeting the AIADMK had organised at Thondamuthur, near here, on Sunday to condemn the assault of a woman at the ‘Makkal Gram Sabha’ meeting the DMK had organised on Saturday. There was nothing that either he, Mr. Stalin, or the DMK could claim to have to done for the State and Coimbatore in particular. In the last few years under the AIADMK rule, the district had witnessed unprecedented development – something that it had no witnessed in the last 50 years, Mr. Velumani said and listed a number of schemes. “Why is that the DMK had failed to implement the Athikadavu-Avinashi groundwater recharge scheme,” he asked. Mr. Velumani also said that the DMK president would do well to remember the needle of suspicion in the 2G spectrum allocation scam, the death of Sadiq Batcha and few others pointed towards the DMK. Mr. Stalin had targeted him because Electricity Minister P. Thangamani and he were instrumental in bringing together the two factions in the AIADMK and retrieving the ‘Two Leaves’ symbol for the party. Milk and Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji said Mr. Stalin was unsure of what he spoke. His calculations would go awry in the Assembly election as people vote the AIADMK to power. Mr. Stalin’s elder brother M.K. Alagiri had also said that Mr. Stalin’s dream to become a Chief Minister would remain just that, Mr. Bhalaji said. The DMK would not be a challenge to the AIADMK as the party had successfully implemented several schemes and taken care of their needs like giving financial assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and now for Pongal 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/what-was-stalins-achievement-as-municipal-administration-minister-asks-velumani/article33490229.ece

HC order In his notice, the CCC’s Secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said it was unfortunate that the Corporation had gone ahead and encroached upon the Muthannankulam, more so when there was opposition to encroachment in Valankulam tank and Madras High Court order banning such encroachments. Detailing the extent of encroachment in Valankulam, the consumer body said the Corporation reduced the tank’s extent and water holding capacity. This was violation of the Madras High Court order, which was based on a public interest litigation. During the PIL hearing, the Corporation had assured the Court that it would not carry out any work in waterbodies or waterways. And, the Court said it would monitor the progress in removing the encroachments.

04 January 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||MoEF urged not to grant approval for PVC paste resin plant in Cuddalore||Environmentalists and Citizen’s Collective have urged the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) not to grant approval to the Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) paste resin plant of 70,000 TPA by Chemplast Sanmar Limited at Sipcot-Phase II in Cuddalore. Members of the environment watchdog Sipcot Area Community Environmental Monitors (SACEM) and Citizens’ Collective comprising members from Semmankuppam, Echangadu and Sangolikuppam have sent a memorandum to the MoEF EIA committee chairman J.P. Gupta asking him not to grant permission until environment carrying capacity and comprehensive cumulative impact of the Sipcot area is assessed. ‘Red category’ A committee should also be formed to inspect the project site and conduct a comprehensive study to assess the cumulative, social and environmental impacts of every single industry in Cuddalore Sipcot. The proposed project is in close to many large chemical industries in the ‘Red’ category and needs a comprehensive cumulative impact assessment, they pointed out. “The project site is located in Cuddalore Sipcot, a critically polluted industrial cluster, which has high levels of pollution with a Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) score of 62.56,” members of SACEM stated in the memorandum. According to S. Pugazhenthi, resident of Sangolikuppam and former member of Local Area Environment Committee (LAEC), “The locals have already faced the wrath of industrialisation after seeing its effects on water, air, agriculture and health in and around Sipcot. Any new burden to the community and the environment without assessing the environmental carrying capacity is not justified. The status quo should be maintained without any further deterioration.” In 2010, the Union Ministry for Environment and Forests had imposed a moratorium on new projects on 43 industrial clusters across India, including Cuddalore. In 2011 the moratorium was lifted on the condition that a time-bound action plan for improving the air and water quality and bringing down the pollution level to 53.6 % would be executed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB). However, no such action plan had been prepared or enforced till date and the air and water quality continue to remain severely polluted, the SACEM alleged. According to Shweta Narayan, an environmentalist, “The fact is this place is critically polluted and the air, water and land quality has been severely compromised. The government’s focus should be on restoring this place first and investing in environment and health here.” Wrong signal “This is not a new issue and the government knows about it. There have been complaints that have been made over the years. Ignoring these complaints and public health concerns and just going ahead with expansion of polluting industries only sends a wrong signal that the government does not care about the people and environment,” Ms. Narayan said. “A scientific report on volatile organic compounds in the Sipcot area in 2007 prepared by the Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) had estimated that residents of Cuddalore Sipcot are more likely to be affected by cancer in their lifetime due to their exposure to high levels of toxic gases from chemical industries in the region,” the SACEM said. The latest report of the CEPI submitted by the Central Pollution Control Board to the National Green Tribunal shows that no tangible measures have been taken to bring down pollution levels so far. In the report, Cuddalore had scored 62.56 out of 100. According to S. Ramanathan, a resident of Semmankuppam village, “The site is located 55 metres from the Uppanar River and requires Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) clearance. “The site is already surrounded by several polluting industries and setting up of PVC paste resin plant rather than addressing the existing pollution would pose a serious threat to the life of fisherfolk and the locals.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/moef-urged-not-to-grant-approval-for-pvc-paste-resin-plant-in-cuddalore/article33490303.ece

Stalin on Sunday said the State government’s Amma Mini Clinic scheme was a ploy to cheat the public, as it had no full-time doctors, nurses or equipment. Addressing a ‘makkal gram sabha’ (people’s gram sabha) at Vellode in Erode district, Mr. Stalin said crores of rupees were spent on advertisements for starting mini clinics across the State. ‘Cheating people’ “Let them start [the mini clinics]. We are not opposing it. But this is tantamount to cheating the people as only emergency care or minor treatment can be provided at the clinics,” he said. He said each panchayat had a primary health centre (PHC), but many of them were not functioning or did not have doctors or medicines. “We welcome the mini clinics scheme. But does it have the necessary doctors, nurses or equipment,” he asked, pointing out that the government was roping in doctors from primary health centres to attend to patients at these clinics. Help to needy Mr. Stalin said the party’s ‘Ondrinaivom Vaa’ (let’s unite) campaign, launched to help the needy during the COVID-19 pandemic, has helped people irrespective of their political affiliation. “Even when we have not been in power for 10 years, we are serving the people,” the DMK leader said. Addressing local issues, Mr. Stalin said an increase in the price of yarn was affecting lakhs of textile manufacturing units, and steps would be taken to prevent hoarding and for the revival of the industry.

04 January 2021||Karur,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK has failed to protect farmers’ interests, says Stalin||Accusing the AIADMK government of failing to protect farmers and their interests, DMK president M. K. Stalin on Sunday said that the alleged suicide of a Thoothukudi-based farmer in distress was a reflection of the indifferent attitude of the ruling dispensation towards the plight of farmers. Speaking at a ‘Makkal Grama Sabha’ at Kuppuchipalayam near Vangal, Mr. Stalin said it was shocking to know that the farmer, belonging to Pillayanatham in Thoothukudi, who could not bear the failure of his maize crop, had ended his life leaving a note to his two-year-old granddaughter. It was an example of the plight of farmers in the State. More than 100 farmers, faced with crop failure and other issues, had ended their lives during the AIADMK government. But, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who claims to be a farmer, had failed to address the issues faced by the farmers, said Mr. Stalin. Neither Mr. Palaniswami nor Prime Minister Narendra Modi were worried about the farmers, who have been waging a prolonged battle against the Centre for repealing the three new farm laws. Launching a tirade against the AIADMK government, the DMK president said that Mr. Palaniswami was heading one of the most corrupt governments. Mr. Stalin alleged that the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues had amassed wealth by illegal means. Their misdeeds had been listed and submitted to the Governor. The petition had gone to the Central government, Mr. Stalin said and added that it was certain that the charges would be probed after the Assembly election and those who indulged in corruption would have to face the music. He would soon submit a second list of corruption charges against the Ministers to the Governor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-has-failed-to-protect-farmers-interests-stalin/article33490283.ece

More than three years had gone since the formation of the commission. It had so far issued nine summons to Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam to appear before the commission, but he was yet to appear, the DMK president added. The mystery behind the death of former Chief Minister was yet to be unravelled, he said.

04 January 2021||KOVILPATTI,TAMIL NADU||DMK staring at serious split, says Palaniswami||DMK president M.K. Stalin should take immediate and effective steps to prevent serious splits within his own party as his elder brother (M.K. Alagiri) was “all set to launch his party”, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Sunday. He also said the Leader of the Opposition was levelling baseless corruption charges against his government while comfortably forgetting that it was his party people who were facing serious charges in various courts, including in the 2G spectrum case. ‘Corruption list’ At a party campaign event here, Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK president, who was indulging in mud-slinging against the Tamil Nadu government by levelling baseless corruption charges, had submitted a “corruption list” to the Governor, even as the State government had adopted an e-tendering system in all Departments to ensure transparency. Moreover, the tender being referred to by Mr. Stalin was cancelled 18 months ago. Hence, there was no room for nepotism and corruption, he said. The DMK had given Rs. 430 crore for constructing the new Secretariat after floating the tender only for Rs. 200 crore, the Chief Minister added. “Where did the Rs. 230 crore go? The DMK, which was involved in the Rs. 1.76 lakh crore 2G spectrum auction case and is now facing the case in the court following the appeal preferred by the CBI, will have to submit a convincing reply to the court,” Mr. Palaniswami said. On the gram sabha meetings being conducted by the DMK, the Chief Minister said the Opposition party was attempting to trigger unrest among the public. Referring to Mr. Stalin’s prediction about the split in the AIADMK, Mr. Palaniswami said it was the DMK that was seriously starring at a major split, with the “Madurai-based man” (M.K.

Hence, the voters should be beware such false propaganda. “If the DMK faces the election in the upright manner, the voters will at least give the party ‘Opposition’ status. Else,it will be trashed once again,” he said. Referring to Mr. Stalin’s prediction about the split in the ruling AIADMK even as rumours are doing rounds that Deputy Chief Minister O.

Hand sanitisers were provided at the entrance of the centres and all candidates were compulsorily asked to wear face masks. But there were some tense moments at S.E.V Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Narayanapuram, one of the examination centres, as a few candidates were not allowed inside as they reached the centre after 9.15 a.m. Brother of a candidate, M.R. Arun, complained that his sister, who was nine months pregnant, was not allowed to write the exam though they reached the EXAM centre at exactly 9.15 a.m. “ We travelled all the way from Pappapatti near Usilampatti. The New Natham Road was extremely bumpy and difficult to negotiate for the drivers of vehicles.

One way is to engage men in domestic work and thereby sharing the household chores equally, said V. Christopher Ramesh, Associate Professor of English, Government Arts College, Melur, here on Sunday. Speaking at the 14th anniversary celebration of Madurai group of Alcoholics Anonymous, Mr. Ramesh said women also faced several problems and hardships in their lives, but they seldom took refuge under alcohol. According to data from the World Health Organisation, in more than 80% of violent crimes, the perpetrators are usually men. “Violence and alcohol is linked to each other in most of the cases. Alcohol addiction also leads to domestic violence against women,” said Mr. Ramesh. “Alcoholics Anonymous is an excellent support group which helps the addicts to give up drinking habit,” he said. A. Sugaparaneetharan, consultant psychiatrist with Ahana Hospital, said drinking habit was rising among people across the country. “This habit starts at an young age. Drinking alcohol from a young age affects brain growth. It might even develop problems in the thinking pattern in the long run,” he said. There are several medical options and psychiatric support available to help alcoholics give up the habit, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/learn-from-women-to-stay-away-from-alcohol/article33490500.ece
04 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Stress on registering children’s homes||Recently, five children were rescued from an unregistered children’s home in Kadachanendal and an FIR was registered against the person running the home. Similarly, 16 children were rescued from an unregistered children’s home in Tirumangalam in April last during the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown. Following these incidents, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) officials have stressed the need to register all children’s homes in the district to ensure protection of children and their rights. CWC Chairperson V.M. Vijaya Saravanan says the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, mandates that all children’s homes must be registered. While the District Child Protection Unit helps in registration of child care institutions (CCIs) with the Department of Social Defence, it is the CWC which can take the decision regarding admission of children to the CCIs. There are 36 registered child care units, two special adoption agencies and one reception unit in the district. Jim Jesudoss, Director of Childline, says once a children’s home is registered, it comes under the surveillance of the government. The Home Management Committee will conduct meetings in all the CCIs once in every three months. Grievance redressal “During these meetings, the committee discusses the functioning of that particular CCI with the inmates. The children can air their grievances and the problems can be sorted out,” he says. The surveillance by the government can also help prevent any possible abuse of inmates, says Mr. Vijaya Saravanan. “We create awareness of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, to the children of the CCIs,” he says. All the CCIs are being periodically inspected by the officials, he says. In many cases, non-governmental organisations are not aware that they need to separately register under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. ‘Alert CWC’ “Any children’s home that has not been registered can approach us and we will help them register. Similarly, the public can contact us atmaduraicwc@gmail.comto inform us if they come to know about any unregistered children’s home,” he says. CWC member B. Pandiaraja says people should donate only to registered children’s homes.  In many cases, NGOs are not aware that they need to separately register under the Juvenile Justice Act V.M.

04 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Madurai needs metro rail services’||The State government must urge the Centre to introduce metro rail services in Madurai, said Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In a press release, the trade body said the Prime Minister had announced that metro rail services would be extended to 25 more cities in the country by 2025. “Madurai, with a population of more than 25 lakh, is the second most populous city in the State. Traffic congestion is one of the major problems of the city. None of the steps taken have been effective to address the issue of traffic congestion. While vehicular movement is increasing, the city lacks wide roads and flyovers to handle the huge traffic flow. The introduction of metro rail services would help address the issue. While the government has planned metro rail services for Coimbatore, leaving out Madurai had disappointed the people of southern parts of Tamil Nadu. ‘Stands eligible’ The parliament had approved an amendment that metro rail services would be introduced if the State governments shared 50% of the total cost and recommended the project for any city with a population of more than 10 lakh. Introduction of metro rail services on two corridors - north-south and east-west - should be considered for covering the length and breadth of the city and suburbs. The first line should be laid from Melur to Tirumanagalam via Agricultural college, Madurai Bench of Madras High Court, Velammal Hospital, Madurai airport, and the proposed AIIMS at Thoppur. The second line should be laid from Tiruppuvanam to Chekkanoorani via Silaiman, Pandikoil intersection, Velammal Hospital, Madurai airport, proposed AIIMS at Thoppur, proposed new bus port at Karadikkal, Madurai Kamaraj University and TIDEL Park. The State government must take steps to introduce metro rail services in Madurai, the release added.

04 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Stalin can never become Chief Minister without my support, says Alagiri||Former Union Minister M.K. Alagiri said on Sunday that his younger brother and DMK president M.K. Stalin can never become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu without his backing. Though he remained non-committal on his plans to float a party, Mr. Alagiri told his supporters that they should unanimously accept whatever decision he took on the issue. “I never wanted to become the Chief Minister. But you (Mr. Stalin) can never become one. My supporters will never let you become Chief Minister,” Mr. Alagiri said, amidst cheers. He claimed that his father and former Chief Minister and DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi had not wanted to contest the 2016 Assembly election from Tiruvarur citing poor health. “But, he was forced to contest as Chief Ministerial candidate so that (subsequently) he (Mr. Stalin) could become the Chief Minister … and his [Karunanidhi’s] health went downhill after that,” Mr. Alagiri charged. Having served as the party’s south zone organising secretary for the DMK, he was later removed for ‘anti-party activity’. “They conspired against me and threw me out,” he complained. Claiming that Karunanidhi had promised to take him back into the party, he said, “Unfortunately, he fell sick. They levelled several charges against me and forced him (Karunanidhi) to issue statements against me.”  Takes credit  Taking credit for many victories of the party in the bypolls and local body elections in the southern districts, Mr. Alagiri said he had always remained an ordinary party member and never aspired for any post or power. “Even when Mr. Vaiko broke away from the DMK with many party district secretaries to float the MDMK, I managed to keep the cadre base intact in the southern districts,” he said. Mr. Alagiri also took credit for the elevation of Mr. Stalin to the post of party treasurer and his becoming Deputy Chief Minister in Karunanidhi’s Cabinet. “When his (Mr. Stalin’s) supporters wanted me to take up the issue of making Mr. Stalin the party treasurer, I immediately called up the party chief…and he was made treasurer the same day,” Mr. Alagiri claimed. He also said that in a private conversation during the Tirumangalam bypoll campaign, he had assured his younger brother that he would be the next party chief after Karunanidhi. “It told him that he would be the next party president and Chief Minister… I would always work for him. He cannot refute this,” Mr. Alagiri said. Subsequently, when he became Union Minister, without a second thought, he accepted to Karunanidhi’s proposal to make Mr. Stalin the Deputy Chief Minister. “What wrong did I commit (for being expelled from the party)?” he asked. Tirumangalam victory Mr. Alagiri also accused the DMK of having forgotten Karunanidhi, whose hard work, he said, had set an example to him. It was the hard work that resulted in the bypoll victory in Tirumangalam, and not the alleged distribution of money, he said. Stating that he had waited patiently for seven years, he said he would take a decision on launching a party. “Whatever be the decision, you should accept it. I am ready to work for you and you should be willing to take up any challenge,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-greets-supporters-says-stalin-can-never-become-cm-without-his-backing/article33490195.ece
04 January 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK has now forgotten Karunanidhi, says Alagiri||Stating that the DMK has forgotten its former president M. Karunanidhi, former Union Minister M.K. Alagiri said that hard work was Tirumangalam formula that helped the DMK achieve a huge victory in the 2009 by-election. Addressing his supporters here on Sunday, he said the media created a hype over ‘Tirumangalam formula’. “We were accused of distributing Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 2,000 for votes. But we did not give money to anyone,” he said. Stating that he initially kept away from the by-poll works, he said his entire family members, including Mr. Stalin, urged him to work for the party to ensure its victory. “I stood my ground complaining that I was shamed in the party. But after party chief (M. Karunanidhi) asked me, I agreed to work,” he said. He recalled that in his childhood, he had accompanied his father for the 1962 election when he contested from Thanjavur Assembly constituency. “I had seen his hard work then. He used to visit the party office even in the dead of the night. I followed him on the hard work and that is the formula behind Tirumangalam by-poll victory,” he added. Taking a dig at a recent comment by a DMK leader who had said that Mr. Stalin was a better leader than Karunanidhi, he said no one in the world had the intelligence of Karunanidhi. “Be it in oration, writing, art or literature, there is no match to him. They have now forgotten Karunanidhi. We need to remind everyone that Karunanidhi is our life,” Mr. Alagiri said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-has-now-forgotten-karunanidhi-says-alagiri/article33490640.ece
04 January 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||MP demands NRB recruitment exam centre||Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has flagged the need to set up a written examination centre in Chennai to enable local youths to participate in the recruitment to the posts of Stipendiary Trainees Category I and II in Nuclear Recycle Board Tarapur and Kalpakkam. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Venkatesan said it was surprising to note that the written examinations for recruitment would be conducted only in Mumbai when there were vacancies in Kalpakkam too. “It would put candidates in much difficulty during COVID-19 pandemic time. Moreover, candidates belonging to marginalised sections of society would suffer financially,” he said. Stating that it was heartening to note in the notification that the government strived to have a workforce which reflected gender balance as women candidates were encouraged to apply. Age relaxations had also been given to widows, divorced women and women legally separated from their husbands. “But the choice of single centre in a far-off place lacks sensitivity,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-demands-exam-centre-in-chennai/article33490302.ece
04 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry will stay a U.T., says Minister||Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy on Sunday said Puducherry will remain a Union Territory and dismissed the rumours about a merger with the neighbouring State as a “campaign of lies” spread by the Congress. Addressing BJP party workers at the AFT Grounds, Mr. Reddy said Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy was at the forefront of this false campaign that said the Centre was trying to merge Puducherry with Tamil Nadu. The Union Minister exhorted the people to teach Mr. Narayanasamy “a fitting lesson in the next Assembly election for propagating lies”. “On behalf of the BJP government at the Centre and as the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, I assure you that there is no such plan. Puducherry will retain its identity as a Union Territory,” he said. ‘PM’s vision’ Stating that several States where the BJP swept to power on the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for a new India were rapidly developing, Mr. Reddy called upon the people of Puducherry to ensure that the Union Territory, too, joined the league of these entities. He contrasted the various development schemes rolled out by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) under Mr. Modi with the “corruption and misrule” under the Congress government here. The Union Minister said while the Centre was willing to help Puducherry with open arms, it was the non-cooperation of the local government that prevented the benefits of several projects from reaching the people here. While Mr. Modi had envisioned the One Nation One Card scheme, Puducherry had dismantled its ration shops, he said. Mr. Reddy said the Union Territory was also an exception in implementing the Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which was providing relief to millions of beneficiaries. According to the Minister, the Congress was blindly opposing every scheme introduced by the BJP, whether it was the National Education Policy or the reforms-driven farm laws, and this was why the party was being rejected by the people. He appealed to the people to oppose the Congress in the election and make a new beginning by choosing the BJP, which alone worked to deliver the fruits of development to all citizens. “I urge you to give the BJP a chance in the next election to secure a good future for Puducherry. This appeal is not merely for electoral victory but to bring good governance, public welfare and democracy that would change the lives of the people here,” Mr. Reddy said. The Minister also promised free COVID-19 vaccines to all the people in the Union Territory. ‘Corrupt’ rule Actor-turned-politician Kushboo Sundar said the people of Puducherry were reeling under the “corrupt” rule of the Congress and its ally, the DMK. Employees were denied salaries, ration shops were closed and women were not safe, she said. Stating that neither the Congress nor the DMK had any right to speak about corruption, Ms. Sundar raised the “hypocrisy” of the parties in opposing the farm laws when farmers in the south had not raised concerns. The tradition of mutual respect that was a hallmark of the DMK under former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi was no longer in the party in which she had commenced her political journey, Ms. Sundar added. Time was up for these parties and the BJP will ride to power in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, she said. Nirmal Kumar Surana, BJP leader in charge of Puducherry, said the Congress government was steeped in corruption and was a complete failure. The Chief Minister was trying to shift the blame of the government’s ineptness on Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, he said. He urged the people to ensure that Mr. Narayanasamy was the last Congress Chief Minister of Puducherry. V. Saminathan, BJP president in Puducherry, also addressed the gathering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-will-stay-a-ut-says-kishan-reddy/article33490216.ece

04 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Defer reopening of U.T. schools’||Vaiyapuri Manikandan, AIADMK MLA, has sought the intervention of the Ministry of Home Affairs in postponing the reopening of schools scheduled for Monday, in view of the unabated COVID-19 situation in Puducherry until a Central team took stock of the preparedness of the institutions. Mr. Manikandan, in a memorandum submitted to G. Kishan Reddy, Minister of State for Home Affairs, said the Government of Puducherry had decided to reopen all schools from January 4 even though the Union Territory was still facing the pandemic and amid the threat of new strain of the virus. In the absence of proper arrangements for social distancing, thermal body check-ups and sanitisation, parents were being compelled to send their children to schools by private managements. Online classes had been stopped to force students to attend classes from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., the MLA said. Moreover, with public transport still out of service, children, especially in rural areas, would find travelling difficult. Shortage of teachers in government schools would make it difficult to enforce social distancing. The memorandum also sought counselling for students. Schools need to deploy additional staff for sanitisation. Importantly, there had been no syllabus for the current year and no plans for examinations. Mr. Manikandan requested the Minister to arrange for a team of health experts from the Central government to review the situation of schools in Puducherry before they open and to issue necessary orders to the government in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/defer-reopening-of-ut-schools/article33490608.ece

04 January 2021||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK-Congress alliance will surely win: Chidambaram||Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Sunday said the DMK-Congress alliance would surely win the Assembly election as it did in the 2019 Parliamentary polls. The victory of the DMK-led front was assured as soon as the AIADMK-BJP alliance was announced, he said, speaking to reporters here. Asked whether problems would crop up during seat-sharing talks as there were many parties in the combine, Mr. Chidambaram said this was a query that needed to be asked to the DMK leader M.K. Stalin. However, Mr. Chidambaram hoped that there would be no problem. He said he welcomed the decision of actor Rajinikanth to opt out of politics. Taking a dig at some BJP leaders’ claim that the party would announce the Chief Ministerial candidate of the NDA alliance, Mr. Chidambaram said the BJP’s State-level leaders would often come up with such “jokes”. On the current state of the country’s economy, Mr. Chidambaram said exports had declined again and the unemployment rate in urban areas had risen. The Centre had not given up its “adamant attitude” towards farmers’ agitation, the GST and China. The BJP government did not care for people’s sentiments, Parliament or Parliamentary debates, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-congress-alliance-will-win-chidambaram/article33490220.ece

04 January 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||‘Women must have equal rights, remuneration’||Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan said that their party’s policy was that women should be offered equal rights and remuneration. Interacting with coffee estate workers at Yercaud, Mr. Haasan said that he was aware that wages were not the same for men and women workers there. His party’s policy was that from farm to space, women should have equal rights and equal remuneration. “If voted to power, 50% of the Cabinet will be women,” he said. On his promise of offering wages for homemakers, Mr. Haasan said that they have an action plan for it and those who teased it earlier were now curious and asking how much would be paid. Spelling out plans for the hill station, Mr. Haasan said that a sanctuary would be formed for Indian gaurs in Yercaud and added that MNM was the only party that talked about environment. Addressing the public at Alagapuram, he said that wherever he went, he was able to see that Tamil Nadu was on the cusp of change. Some said that the crowds came to see a film star. “If it is to see a film star, they could see him freely in the comfort of their homes on Saturdays.

Launching a campaign to remove nails hammered on tree trunks at Aranmanaipudur Vilakku, he said it was important to protect old trees, which were giving green cover and rain. It was unfortunate that people used tree trunks to advertise their business by fixing steel boards. Environmentalists, who were part of various associations in the district, said they had started it in a small way two years ago. As residents of various towns in Theni district, they removed nails silently on weekends. They educated people to ensure that there was no nail on trees. Youths have formed a Whatsapp group in Chinnamanur and posted pictures of tree trunks with nails and after removal of nails. Some Rotarians, doctors and NGOs have taken a pledge to keep trees free from any damage in 2021. Friends in Uthamapalayam, Cumbum, Chinnamanoor and Theni joined together and removed at least 500 kg of nails so far. Not a single tree in Theni Municipality has nail now. It would be probably the first such achievement in the State, Mr. Muthusamy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/save-trees-from-nails/article33490316.ece
04 January 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘Choose between violent DMK and development-oriented AIADMK’||Voters of Tamil Nadu should choose between the “violent” DMK and the “people-friendly” AIADMK, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has said. “The DMK cadres, who unleash violence of all sorts, especially against women, even when they are not in power, will be extremely dangerous if they come to power. Hence the voters should support the AIADMK to ensure the continuation of the peaceful rule which has ensured all-round development,” he said. Addressing the public from his election campaign vehicle at Vilathikulam on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Palaniswami recalled the two-acre free land distribution promise made by the DMK in its poll manifesto in 2006, and asked the voters, who had gathered in large numbers near the old bus terminus, if anyone in the crowd received the promised land. “Instead of fulfilling this promise, the DMK men forcibly and illegally grabbed lands from the vulnerable people which forced Amma (former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa) to establish Anti-Land Grabbing Cell in every district to take action against the DMK functionaries to give the lands back to the rightful owners. “Even now when they are not in power, they coerce and attack hoteliers, industrialists, traders, women in beauty parlours and conduct ‘kangaroo court’. So, people should choose between the development-oriented and peace-loving AIADMK rule and the violent DMK,” the Chief Minister told the gathering. He also came down heavily on the Opposition party, saying that if it came to power it would be rule for the welfare of ‘Karunanidhi’s family’. When the Chief Minister met weavers at Ettaiyapuram while on his way to Vilathikulam, he reminded them of the 200 unit free power given to powerlooms and green houses built for weavers by the AIADMK government and sought their support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/choose-between-violent-dmk-and-peace-loving-aiadmk-cm-tells-people/article33490221.ece
04 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Haphazard parking chokes Singarathope, Super Bazaar||Haphazard parking of two and four wheelers compound the woes of motorists at Singarathope and Super Bazaar, shopping areas in the city. Right from morning to late in the night, Singarathope and surrounding commercial places are abuzz bustle with business activities. The area houses a number of wholesale and retail cloth and readymade garment showrooms, electronic sales and repair shops, footwear showrooms and others. Hundreds of customers and traders throng the streets. Many commercial complexes are also located in the area. But, unlike the up-scale and upcoming commercial roads such as Shastri Road or Karur Bypass Road, Singarathope and Super Bazaar are characterized by narrow lanes and by-lanes. They do not have sufficient space for people to walk freely. Two-wheelers and cars move at a snail’s pace on Singarathope, even though it is one-way traffic. Traffic comes to a grinding halt if a vehicle come in the opposite direction or if vehicles occupy the public space. No vehicle is supposed to park in any part of Singarathope but in the absence of any parking lot, customers invariably park their vehicles in front of the shops. Vehicles are parked in a haphazard manner, making it extremely difficult for cars to move freely. It often leads to traffic hold-ups and chaos. Drivers often have to step out to move parked two-wheelers, so as to make space for their vehicles. Although a four-wheeler parking lot is functioning at Super Bazaar, in the absence of any regulating mechanism, car owners park their vehicles at will. In peak hours, many have to patiently wait to find space. Car drivers, who lose their patience in finding space, prefer to park on road, obstructing free flow of vehicles. “Customers hardly obey traffic rules and park on public space. If we follow strict rules, they go to other shops. The acutely feel the absence of a proper parking system in the area,” said M. Senthil, who runs a studio at Singarathope. A cross section of traders feels that it is high time to explore a suitable location for building a parking lot in Singarathope. They also urge the City police to deploy at least a dozen policemen to regulate traffic and parking in the areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/haphazard-parking-chokes-singarathope-super-bazaar/article33490293.ece
04 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||U.K. returnees are being closely monitored, say health officials||Authorities in the central districts had, through the last few weeks of December, pulled out all stops to track and trace travellers from the United Kingdom in view of the spread of a new strain of COVID-19. Officials of the Health Department in the districts, led by the respective Collectors have managed to identify most travellers, they say. In Thanjavur three patients who travelled to the district from the U.K. and three of their primary contacts tested positive. A total of 53 travellers were from Thanjavur. Samples were lifted from them and their immediate contacts and of the over 80 samples, six returned positive, District Collector M. Govinda Rao said. The samples of the six who tested positive were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, to check whether they had the new strain of virus and the results are awaited. “All the 80-odd people have been home quarantined and are being regularly monitored by a dedicated team of health officials,” Mr. Rao said. Travellers from other countries to the district too are being traced and tested, he added. “Two patients who travelled from Dubai tested positive last week. Their samples have also been sent to Pune for genomic analysis, and reports are awaited,” he added. No other district in the central region has so far reported travellers from the U.K. testing positive. In Tiruchi, where a list of 105 travellers was prepared, only four are untraceable. “We found that one had returned to the U.K. The remaining patients were traced, including those who travelled to other districts after reaching Tiruchi. Samples were lifted from all of them and none has tested positive so far,” said Aravind Kumar, district epidemiologist. In Pudukottai too, 41 samples were lifted from 20 travellers and their immediate contacts, all of whom reported negative for COVID-19. “Most of the travellers were knowledgeable and knew that it was important to quarantine themselves after travel. It was not a difficult process to trace them,” a senior health official in the district said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/uk-returnees-are-being-closely-monitored-say-health-officials/article33490295.ece
04 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Input relief for farmers affected by recent cyclones welcomed||Farmers organisations have welcomed Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami’s announcement sanctioning input relief for farmers affected by recent cyclones – Nivar and Burevi. Expressing gratitude to the government for accepting their pleas for increasing the relief given under the disaster relief fund to Rs. 20,000 from Rs. 13,500 a hectare, P. R. Pandian, president, Tamil Nadu All Farmers Associations Coordination Committee, observed that for several years the relief given under fund had not been increased. “We have been pressing for a hike taking into account the increase in input and cultivation costs,” he said, expressing delight over the hike in the quantum of compensation. He also welcomed the government’s decision to do away with the distinction between small and big farmers by sanctioning relief for the entire affected area instead of restricting it to two acres. “This is a historic announcement made by the Chief Minister,” Mr. Pandian observed thanking all government officials who took efforts to get the relief sanctioned. The general secretary of Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Cauvery S. Dhanapalan, while pointing out farmers had staged a massive demonstration in Nagapattinam demanding relief on Saturday, expressed happiness over the removal of distinction between small and big farmers in the sanction of relief. He also welcomed the government’s decision to increase the relief to Rs. 20,000 a hectare by coming forward to bear the additional expenditure over and above the relief given under the National Disaster Relief Fund. The sanction of funds for perennial crops and affected farmers in rain-fed areas also is another welcome step, he added. “Through the measures, the government has definitely extended a helping hand to farmers though the relief amount may not fully meet the expenses incurred by them,” Mr. Dhanapalan said. Satisfaction While expressing satisfaction on sanction of the relief, R. Raja Chidambaram, state secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, said it was essential to ensure that it was disbursed to all affected farmers by ensuring that the enumeration was conducted properly at the village level. “There were complaints that the enumeration was not done properly in some villages. The disbursement of the relief should be done without giving room for any irregularity or discrepancy,” he said. Mr. Pandian too urged the government to ensure that the relief was disbursed speedily and in a transparent manner. “Transparency should be ensured by making public the list of beneficiaries at the village-level,” Mr. Pandian suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/input-relief-for-farmers-affected-by-recent-cyclones-welcomed/article33490286.ece

04 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Sketching portraits at Ponmalai Market||A city-based artist makes portraits of visitors at the Ponmalai market for a nominal fee. The artist takes around 15 minutes and even offers portraits for free to people visiting the market, he said. Sithan Siva, who resides in Senthaneerpuram is an architecture professor at a Thanjavur college and a private art teacher for students in Kattur on weekdays. On Sundays, he dons the cap of an artist, sketching portraits of visitors to the Ponmalai market. The idea to make nominally-priced portraits came to Mr. Siva when he was confined to his home during the COVID-19 lockdown, he said. He would teach classes online to his architecture students and would feel disappointed that he was unable to practice his artistic skills. “I began working on a 6 feet by 16 feet piece drawing on COVID-19 itself. Nurses, doctors, police personnel, conservancy workers have all been featured in the work,” he said. The work hangs at his art studio ‘Creative Space’, in Kattur. After relaxation of lockdown norms, families have started visiting the Ponmalai market. Using this opportunity to entertain the public, he began drawing visitors. “I would chat up an autorickshaw driver and draw him, sometimes I would draw children playing. If I make ten portraits a day, I give at least eight for free,” he said. Children interested in his work have even given him Rs. 1, he laughed. The intent is not to earn money, Mr. Siva said. “People charge as much as Rs. 1.500 to Rs. 2,000 for a portrait. I charge Rs. 250 to Rs. 300. I want everyone to have access to art that makes them happy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sketching-portraits-at-ponmalai-market/article33490285.ece

04 January 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Less than expected attendance in pvt. schools in some districts||Private schools clocked only around 20 % attendance in North Karnataka districts on Friday and Saturday, the first two days of after schools reopened after a gap of nearly 300 days. Private school managements say that around 60 % students had indicated that they will attend offline classes and obtained consent letters from their parents. However, only a third of these seem to have attended classes, Muneshwar Lakha, director, Gyan Sudha Vidyalaya Committee that runs schools and colleges in Bidar, said. He estimates that most parents are waiting for feedback from other parents whose children have attended schools on the first two days. Since these two days went off smoothly, “we expect more children to join on Monday,” he said. Basavaraj Nemagoudar, who manages a private education society, said that attendance in four of the committee’s high schools had recorded attendance between 15 % to 20 %. However, “our children will start trickling in, from next week,” Mr. Nemagoudar said. Government schools, however, recorded around 50 % attendance, officials say. “It may be because government high schools have seen higher enrolment due to reduced paying capacity of the parents who were hit by the lockdown and the emotional reason of not sending children out of their own village or town. There may be other reasons, but we found these to be dominating,” said A.B. Pundalik, Deputy Director of Public Instruction. Officials also notice that 10 % to 15 % more girls are attending schools. More girls are attending schools than those who attended last year in the same period, a senior officer said. “That may be because girls as a community are more studious. It may also be because parents are sending their boys to work due to reduced earning post the lockdown,” said Jayashree Gurannanavar, social activist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/less-than-expected-attendance-in-pvt-schools-in-some-districts/article33490350.ece

But that is my personal opinion, district in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi said in Gokak on Sunday. He was speaking at a function to felicitate BJP-backed candidates who won the gram panchayat polls. He, however, clarified that he would work for the victory of any candidate who gets party ticket. He asked gram panchayat members to work hard for the development of the villages. “That you have won the polls does not matter much. What you did for your village matters more,” he said. “A gram panchayat member is nearer to the village as he lives in the village and is easily accessible. What is more, the MLA is asked to come to Bengaluru regularly and an MP is expected to carry out his duties in New Delhi by travelling frequently. But a gram panchayat member is not expected to go either to his taluk or district. That is why, he should remain among the people and work hard for the development of the village and welfare of villages in his region,” Mr. Jarkiholi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/angadi-family-member-should-get-party-ticket/article33490346.ece

04 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rise in demand for plastic surgeries, cosmetic procedures||Plastic surgeons in the city are seeing a sharp rise in the number of consultations over the past few weeks, with most clients booking appointments for procedures after January 1. Hospital managements, which had recorded a drastic but expected drop in appointments since March 2020 owing to the pandemic, say there appears to be a reversal of the trend. Most of the patients had put off elective procedures as they are ‘cosmetic in nature’ and could be postponed. Gunasekar Vuppalapati, chief plastic surgeon, GVG Invivo Hospital, said that they were seeing a demand for procedures such as hair transplants, rhinoplasty, body sculpting, fat reduction, breast reduction and augmentation. Besides this, Dr. Vuppalapati said that there is a huge demand for botox, filler and facial makeovers. “Last month, we were were doing three procedures a week, but since January 1, we have been booked for three procedures every day,” he said While doctors resumed non-aesthetic and surgical practice from November 2020, the surge in demand was from January 1. All precautions for COVID-19 are in place, as though the number of cases in the city has dropped, the virus, especially the U.K. strain, is a cause for concern. “We are taking all the COVID-19 precautions in the OPD for the quick in and out procedures such as botox, fillers, and non-surgical body sculpting. We are getting a COVID-19 antigen test for local anaesthesia surgeries and RT-PCR for the general anaesthesia procedures for the safety of our staff and to prevent any cross infection,” Dr. Vuppalapati added. The sudden demand for cases has surprised surgeons who said they did not anticipate people requesting such procedures until the vaccine was out. According to Aditya Patil, consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon, Sagar Hospitals, Jayanagar, at one point, many plastic surgeons wanted to go back to reconstruction surgeries rather than depend on cosmetic procedures alone as they were not getting clients. Over the past few days, however, he has been doing around two to three consultations per day. “People are keen on undergoing cosmetic surgeries now as the number of COVID-19 cases is low and many professionals have work from home options till mid-2021. This gives them the opportunity to recuperate post the surgery or procedure,” said Dr. Patil, but added that they are yet to pick up to pre-COVID-19 levels. Madhusudan G., lead and senior consultant, plastic surgery, Aster CMI Hospital, said that in the last couple of weeks, they had seen a 10% increase in the number of people opting for elective surgeries. “This rise is owing to fears that a second wave of COVID-19 may occur in the coming months. People have now started coming forward to get their elective plastic surgeries done while the virus spread is restricted. We have also recently operated on some patients who recovered from COVID-19,” he said.

04 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Not many businesses to stay open all night||Allowing shops and commercial establishments to remain open 24X7, is a step towards making Bengaluru “a truly international city” with a vibrant nightlife, senior functionaries of the government said. However, the all-night business proposal has few takers and is expected to have little impact on Bengaluru’s nightlife. A wide cross-section of traders is of the opinion that any such business will be unviable owing to the lack of an “all-night culture” and supporting public transport infrastructure. “Our public transport shuts down by 11.30 p.m., which dictates the lifestyle pattern. Not many autos and cabs are available. Those that are charge a premium for late-night trips. In such a scenario, you can’t expect people to stay out late,” said the owner of an ice cream parlour. Most of the independent shops in retail, including in market hubs like Commercial Street, Brigade Road, Jayanagar and Malleswaram, have ruled out operating through the night. Additional costs involved, such as hiring more labour and service utility charges, are unlikely to make good the additional business, said many owners. The only ones expected to consider doing business all night are large supermarket chains, malls, cafes and certain eateries, sources said. Uday Garudachar, who owns four malls in the city and is the BJP MLA from Chickpet, said that mall owners are likely to try it out as an experiment after discussions with retailers. “The city should have developed an all-night culture by now, given that we started being the back office of the world with the IT boom and catering to varying time zones from the mid-1990s. Being a laidback city, once called a pensioner’s paradise, probably culturally, it is not in us to become a city that never sleeps, like New York,” he observed. However, he acknowledged that Bengaluru is changing rapidly and today boasts of a vibrant subculture in the night, especially in the food and beverages sector. “It is an experiment we need to carry out and see if the city responds,” he said. Celebrity chef Manu Chandra, Bengaluru Chapter Head, National Restaurants Association of India, said that this would be a shot in the arm for the struggling food businesses. “Working hours are so heavily varied in Bengaluru that those who work late shifts are often left with no choice for meals. Packaged food cannot be the answer to everything. It's not viable across the board, of course, but there will be several businesses that will see an upside. The late night economy globally caters to a small percentage of people. So, it’ll be applicable correspondingly to a small percentage of businesses,” he said. But there is no enthusiasm in the F&B sector on expected lines, and the devil lies in the details. Those serving liquor are governed by the Karnataka Excise Act, 1965, which has strict deadlines and remains unchanged. Excise Commissioner Dr. Lokesh M. said there was no proposal to allow outlets to function 24 hours. Not just the bars, the entire sector, including food counters at establishments that serve liquor, are governed by these rules and will have to shut down early. “Most of the restaurants and pubs that can viably be open all night also serve liquor. Hence, the impact of the order will be very limited,” said a pub owner.  RWAs worried The government’s decision to boost nightlife in the city has triggered panic in residential pockets, like Indiranagar, which is already fighting reckless commercialisation. “If the eateries in residential areas decide to be open all night, our lives will become more miserable. Despite being residential areas, Indiranagar and Koramangala have the highest concentration of F&B establishments and have the potential to become all-night hubs for the entire city. If it does happen, we will be forced to counter the development legally,” said Sneha Nandihal of I Change Indiranagar. This is also expected to create a huge challenge to policing in the city. “Our resources are already stretched. If the city really takes to all-night business, we will be under severe strain. But we expect this to take root only in certain hubs, including those with office spaces working night shifts,” said Police Commissioner Kamal Pant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/not-many-businesses-to-stay-open-all-night/article33490155.ece
04 January 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||CM to meet BJP MLAs over two days||In an attempt to defuse the brewing discontent among party MLAs, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has launched an initiative to reach out. He will meet all legislators of the party over two days — Monday and Tuesday — at Capitol Hotel. He has no other programme scheduled for the two days and the entire time he will be available for the MLAs. The meetings will take place region wise, with scope for one-on-one meetings as well, party sources said. The Chief Minister had recently announced that he would meet party MLAs to hear them out and resolve any issues they had. With a faction within the party actively working to dislodge him, this move is aimed at taking MLAs into confidence and ensuring that the dissenters’ ranks don’t swell, sources close to him said. Mr. Yediyurappa has come under criticism for “not being accessible” to MLAs and asking the legislators to meet his son B.Y. Vijayendra. Moreover, there has been discontent over the lack of funds for constituency works since the BJP came to power. The grouse of even a dissenter such as Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has consistently been hinting at leadership change, is the cancellation of grants to his constituency in Vijayapura. “There seems to be no difference between [the state of things under] the coalition government and now when our party is in power. We are unable to secure funds for development works. When we were in the Opposition, at least we could tell our constituents that we were not in power and they would understand. Now that won’t do,” a senior party MLA said. Mr. Yediyurappa who holds the Finance portfolio, is caught between a rock and a hard place, with floods in 2019 and later the pandemic in 2020 putting enormous stress on the State’s financial health, leaving him with very little elbow room, sources said. “The Chief Minister will give a patient ear to the MLAs, their woes, and take them into confidence and explain to them the financial situation of the State,” a strategist close to him said. However, not all MLAs agree. “There are clear disparities in the allocation of funds. The defectors have not only been made Ministers at the cost of party workers, but also continue to enjoy top priority even in constituency works. We who have toiled hard for the party have been left high and dry,” an MLA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-to-meet-bjp-mlas-over-two-days/article33490166.ece
04 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Keep private companies out: Civic activists||Civic activists have welcomed the development of the important rajakaluve that runs through many populated areas in the city, but fear privatisation of public spaces with the involvement of the private sector. They want the project to conform to the orders of the High Court of Karnataka on protection of rajakaluves and lakes in the city, and for civic agencies to execute the project without the involvement of private companies. Leo Saldanha from the Environment Support Group pointed out that the proposed Design, Build, Operate and Transfer model privatises public space. There are many examples of such models not yielding the desired result and ending with a lot of arbitration. “We should not allow corporates to colonise. Such projects should ideally be executed and maintained by a public agency,” he said. Kshitij Urs, professor of public policy at National Law School of India University, welcomed the development of the rajakaluve, but wondered if basing it on the European model is the way forward. “A water front is needed, but it should be based on a natural green corridor,” he said. He also said that in the context of climate change, the city needed adaptive governance where ecological sustainability is a major goal. “Unless you have a 10-year plan, you cannot have a two-year plan,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/keep-private-companies-out-civic-activists/article33490142.ece

He acted in over 380 films as a character artist and also as a villain. The actor is survived by his wife and two children. He was born in 1933 and hailed from Malavalli, Mandya. His father was also a theatre actor. He started his career on stage at a very young age. His role in the play ‘Shaneeshwara Mahatme’ brought him acclaim and he came to be known as ‘Shani’ Mahadevappa. He acted in lead roles in several plays staged by drama companies, including Gubbi Company. He debuted in films in 1962, playing small roles. He later became a close associate of Dr. Rajkumar and was a regular in most of the thespian’s films, playing character roles. ‘Shani’ Mahadevappa is said to have acted in over 60 films with Dr. Rajkumar, including Shankar Guru, Mooroovare Vajragalu, and Kavirathna Kalidasa.  He had been suffering from age-related healthproblems for the past few years and was recently hospitalised after being diagnosed with COVID-19, sources close to the family said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shani-mahadevappa-actor-passes-away-aged-88/article33490169.ece
04 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||E-tenders for high-speed rail link survey||The proposed Chennai-Bengaluru-Mysuru high-speed rail link, the cost of which has been pegged at Rs. 92,400 crore, is likely to bypass the core city area and instead run along expressways, the Outer Ring Road, and national highways. The ambitious project, which has many activists up in arms, is slated for implementation in 2051. The National High-Speed Rail Corporation Ltd. (NHSRCL) has invited e-tenders for the survey and identification of overhead, overground and underground utilities, and the identification of power sourcing options along the corridor. The last date for bids is January 12, 2021. Another tender for carrying out a ridership study has been floated. The nine stations proposed are Chennai, Poonamalle, Arakkonam, Chittor, Bangarpet, Bengaluru, Chennapatna, Mandya and Mysuru. “The proposed corridor is planned along major expressways and national highways, greenfield areas and may be passing through arterial roads of the intermediate city road network...,” the tender reads. However, transportation activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar questioned the need for the proposed corridor. “There was an earlier proposal of a high speed rail corridor between the three cities. However, after the initial study, there was no news of it,” he said and added that the existing lines may be utilised better by increasing the train speed to around 200 kmph. By increasing speed on the existing lines, the commute time can be reduced to three hours, he claimed. “Already, we have lost a lot of tree cover and fertile land to the widening of Bengaluru-Mysuru highway, the tolled highway and NICE Road,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/e-tenders-for-high-speed-rail-link-survey/article33490147.ece
04 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ordinary bus fares for non-AC electric buses||If all goes as planned, commuters will not have to shell out extra money when the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) introduces non-air-conditioned electric buses into its fleet. The fare in non-AC e-buses will be on par with ordinary buses. The BMTC is likely to issue work orders within two weeks to lease e-buses under the Smart City Project. NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd. won the tender for leasing 90 non-AC e-buses, which will be operated as feeder services to Namma Metro. The buses will be nine metres long with 31 seats. A BMTC official said that such short-length buses are ideal for providing feeder services. “They can be operated on small roads, especially from residential areas to metro stations,” said the official. BMTC Director (Information Technology) K. Santhosh Babu told The Hindu that the operator will provide 45 buses within three months after issuing work orders. “Necessary approval has been sought from the government on awarding the tender. We are likely to complete formalities within two weeks. The operator will provide all the buses in a six-month period. Under the Smart City project, these buses will be run as feeder services,” Mr. Babu said. As per the tender details, the BMTC will provide Rs. 51 per kilometre as operational cost to the operator. The operational cost includes power consumption cost. Mr. Babu added that the operational cost quoted by the lowest bidder is ‘feasible’ for the Corporation. The BMTC has been operating metro feeder service since 2011, but so far, ridership has not been promising on all the routes due to various factors. For instance, most of the metro stations built under Phase I of Namma Metro do not have bus bays, and buses are forced to stop on the road, which blocks traffic. Passengers are demanding the introduction of a common mobility card, which will help them use both metro and buses for their daily commute with ease. Mr. Babu expressed confidence in getting competitive bidding for operating e-buses under FAME-2 scheme of the Central government. The BMTC has been making attempts to run e-buses since 2014. In the last three years, it made several attempts to lease buses under the Centre’s FAME scheme but did not succeed.  The operator will provide all the buses in a six-month period. Under the Smart City project, these buses will be run as feeder services K.

Setting a target of winning 140 to 150 seats in the 2023 polls, he declared that he would tour the State soon to galvanise the workers. Speaking after inaugurating a special meeting of the State unit of BJP in Shivamogga on Sunday, Mr. Yediyurappa said, “I will also travel across all districts from next week and hold meetings with workers.” The byelections to Belagavi Lok Sabha seat and two Assembly seats could be held in April this year. Similarly, the elections to taluk panchayats and zilla panchayats, where candidates willcontest on party symbols, could be held soon. “The party’s performance in these elections will have an impact on the next Assembly polls.Our workers just have to maintain a good rapport with the people,” he said. Regarding the K. Kasturirangan report on the Western Ghats, he said the State Cabinet had decided to reject the report.

Minister for Animal Husbandry Prabhu Chauhan has said that the inauguration of a 100-bed mother and child care hospital in Bidar and laying the foundation stone for the much-awaited Anubhava Mantapa in Basavakalyan are on the list.

04 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Answer eludes why work on flyover remains incomplete||Remaining incomplete even a decade after its construction was taken up by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the Shastri Circle Flyover in Kundapur town in Udupi district is threatening to become a monument on National Highway 66 in the town. “There was no reason as to why construction of this flyover, part of four-laning of NH 66 between Talapady in Dakshina Kannada and Kundapur in Udupi district, has remained incomplete even after a decade,” wondered Kishore Kumar from the Rashtreeya Heddari Horata Samithi, Kundapur. “As such, we have every reason to fear that it may become a historical monument in the town,” he said. There were no issues pertaining to land acquisition nor opposition from the general public to the project; yet the flyover as well as about a stretch of a kilometre of the highway within the town from Vinayaka Talkies to Shastri Circle have remained incomplete, he said. Being the vice-president of the Udupi District Bharatiya Janata Party, Mr. Kumar does not hesitate stating that people’s representatives as well as government officials have let the people of the region down by not ensuring speedy completion of the project. All five Assembly constituencies in the district are represented by BJP legislators and even the four MPs representing the coastal region are from the BJP. “Yet, these representatives as well as government officials sympathise with the ‘condition’ of the project concessionaire, Navayuga Udupi Tollway Ltd., instead of with the general public who are the actual victims of the project,” he said. Still, Mr. Kumar said, the work appears to have gathered pace since a fortnight and people are hopeful of it being completed at least before the next monsoon. The project has seen multiple deadlines without there being any concrete reason for the delay in its execution. A visit to the project site last week revealed very few men and machinery deployed, right from Vinayaka Talkies to Shastri Circle. Looking at the pace of work, it is unlikely to get completed before the next monsoon. However, Kundapur Assistant Commissioner K. Raju was optimistic and told The Hindu that the concessionaire has promised to complete the work before March this year. “At present, the company has deployed men and machinery at the incomplete stretch at Padubidri on the same highway and the work is expected to be completed soon. Thereafter, work would be expedited in Kundapur,” Mr. Raju said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/answer-eludes-why-work-on-flyover-remains-incomplete/article33490523.ece

The routes will pass through lanes and main roads at different identified stretches.

04 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Bandipur sees surge in tourist footfall||Bandipur National Park, known for tigers and elephants, is witnessing a surge in tourist footfall since the last two weeks. The tourist rush began in the run-up to the Christmas and has continued unabated since then and over 600 people have been availing themselves of the safari facilities on a daily basis. Park officials said the tourist rush peaked on weekends and it was no different on Sunday when the parking lot in front of the booking office at Melkamanahalli was packed with vehicles. “We reckon the tourist footfall to decline again as the hangover of Christmas and New Year celebrations, which were a low key affair due to the pandemic, will subside from Monday,” according to a park official. Though December and January tend to be a holiday season, the pandemic has kept outstation tourists away though there were quite a few visitors from the bordering Tamil Nadu and Kerala. By and large, it is tourists from Mysuru-Bengaluru region and those drawn from rest of Karnataka as the thrust is on tapping local clients during the recovery period. The weather condition and increased rate of sighting tigers and other wildlife also make Bandipur a preferred choice for tourists and this is being witnessed since the third week of December. Though sighting a tiger is a matter of chance despite their huge numbers in the park, elephants and leopards have been sighted regularly during the last few days, according to local staff in charge of running the safari. More than 50% of the tourists make an online booking for safaris as the vehicles tend to get full and hence one bus has been reserved for walk-in tourists. Bandipur is well connected to places of tourist interest, including Ooty and Wayanad, and hence tourists enroute to these places make it a point to visit the park. Its ideal location and proximity to Mysuru has shored up its popularity quotient but is also turning out to be a bane. Wildlife activists have called for studying the carrying capacity of the park to restrict the tourist footfall. But park officials maintain that it was well within the limits as less than 10% of the 874 sq km tiger reserve was open to tourists. Besides, the tourism counter has been shifted from the reception to Melkamanahalli to prevent large congregation in the core area and it was paying dividends by way of greater freedom for animal movement, aver the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bandipur-sees-surge-in-tourist-footfall/article33490558.ece

04 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysuru’s street lights to switch to energy-efficient LED soon||The long-awaited project to illuminate the streets of Mysuru with the energy-efficient Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights will take off soon with the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) inviting global tenders from qualified bidders for replacing all street lights in the city, estimated to be more than 60,000. Though the energy-efficient LED project dates back to an announcement made by the State government in its budget for 2015-16, proposing to replace the existing conventional lights, including tubelights, metal halides and sodium vapour lamps with LED lamps in all city corporations of the State outside Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to enable savings on energy costs, Mysuru city has been selected for the pilot project. The State government’s order issued in March 2018 to implement the project on Public Private Partnership (PPP) model has now paved the way for MCC to invite global bids. The project envisages installation of a Centralized Control and Monitoring System (CCMS) with smart meters and Internet of Things (IOT) controllers for operating the integrated LEDs remotely through wireless communication. The bids invited on December 19 are scheduled to be open on January 21. The successful bidder will have an implementation period of eight months along with operation and maintenance for a period of seven years, including the implementation period. If everything goes as per schedule, all the streets of Mysuru city will glow with LED lamps by the end of 2021, MCC’s Assistant Executive Engineer (Electrical) Sujatha told The Hindu . According to the Request for Proposal (RFP), the project covers replacement of the 50,639 conventional street lights along with 9,539 existing LED lights, totalling 60,178 street lights. The concessionaire will also have to install a new set of static smart meters in place of each of the 2,752 existing street light control points, where meters have been installed, besides geotagging each LED luminaire. The energy savings by implementing the LED street light project is expected to be in the range of 45% to 55%. The annual energy consumption for the 50,639 conventional street lights that will be burn for 10 hours a day from January to June and 11 hours a day from July to December is expected to come down from 3,58,64,201 kWh to 1,35,71,474, which accounts for a saving of 58.77%. Also, the CCMS ensures remote operation and monitoring of the street lights. “When implemented, we won’t need to deploy personnel to physically go around switching the lights on and off,” said Ms. Sujatha. Also, in case any street light is not glowing, partially glowing, defective or flickering, the concessionaire will replace or repair the same within 24 hours of receiving the complaint. The concessionaire will also maintain a call centre to attend to complaints received by phone, email, SMS and Janahitha-MRC. If complaints are not addressed within 24 hours, the concessionaire will be penalised, states the RFP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysurus-street-lights-to-switch-to-energy-efficient-led-soon/article33490552.ece
04 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Initiative to conserve Kumarabeedu artefacts gains traction||A local initiative to conserve and exhibit Jain artefacts belonging to ancient times that were unearthed over the last two decades in a village on the outskirts of Mysuru is gaining traction. Located about 15 km from Mysuru off the Bogadi Road is Kumarabeedu village, where a slew of inscriptions and sculptures belonging to the Ganga (3rd century CE to 11th century CE) and the Hoysala period (11th century to 14th century) were unearthed and have been preserved locally. A trust has been constituted to take forward the preservation and conservation exercise so that the artefacts recovered in the village are properly showcased to highlight the past glory and historicity of the region. N.S. Rangaraju, convener, INTACH, Mysuru, said that members of the Jain community have formed this trust and there are plans to give greater protection to the artefacts. Apart from a few sculptures, pillars belonging to Jain temples too have been found underlying the antiquity of the region. “The pillars are in a dilapidated state but can be restored. By using the same type of stones and other materials, even the roof can be rebuilt,” said Prof. Rangaraju. Among the sculptures that have been unearthed in the place is that of Parswanatha and a stone commemorating a local Jain guru who had embraced death by observing sallekhana, he added. He said Varuna, Vajamangala and Varkodu in the region are known to have considerable Jain influence in the past of which there is evidence only in Varuna at present as the ancient artefacts have been preserved. Kumarabeedu falls in the same category and all efforts will be made to preserve its heritage, said Prof. Rangaraju. There are also efforts to purchase the land where some of the artefacts were unearthed by the local farmers while tilling. Many farmers are unable to continue with agriculture and hence negotiations are on to purchase the land so that the artefacts could be exhibited after ensuring protection to it. Prof. Rangaraju said the issue will also be taken up with the State Archaeological Department to take the initiative forward. They are trying to buy the land and are negotiating with the farmer. The latter finds it difficult to till because of the hardy and stone nature and wants to sell it off, said Prof. Rangaraju. A meeting of the Jain community was also held recently to underline the imperatives of preserving the artefacts for posterity. One of the sculptures unearthed at Kumarabeedu and found to be in good condition is now reckoned to be missing. Prof. Rangaraju said in the absence of protection, artefacts and sculptures tend to be stolen as there is an international market for it and stressed the urgency to safeguard them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/initiative-to-conserve-kumarabeedu-artefacts-gains-traction/article33490556.ece

Honorary Legal Adviser of MEM and president of VKET Mandetira N. Subramani put forth the demand for reconstitution the committee at a Shram Dhan programme organised by MEM and VKET to clean the 1,000 steps leading to Chamundi Hills and their surroundings early on Sunday morning. The proposal to establish a war memorial in Mysuru was pending since two decades, Mr. Subramani said and urged the authorities to reconstitute the committee by involving only retired senior armed force officers and serving officers posted in Mysuru. He claimed that the committee had only civilian authorities and had outlived its tenure without any tangible result. While addressing the ex-servicemen, Mr. Subramani said he had proposed to the Mysuru district administration in 2000 to establish a war memorial when he was the president of Air Force Friends’ Association, Mysuru. His proposal had been accepted and the land adjacent to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and in front of NCC Group headquarters, which used to be a parade ground in the British era, was earmarked for building the war memorial by the then Deputy Commissioner Basavaraju, Mr. Subramani said. But, the war memorial is yet to become a reality even after two decades, he said. Mr. Subramani said he would approach former Army Commander Lt. Gen P.C. Thimmaya, who has chosen Mysuru to lead his retired life and request him to impress upon the district administration and also the Army Headquarters to establish a grand war memorial in Mysuru at the earliest. He also said that the district administration will be requested to invite willing architects to provide a few more new designs so that one of the best designed war memorials can come up in southern part of India and in Mysuru. Fund sanctioned Additional Deputy Commissioner of Chamarajanagar district C.L. Anand, also an army veteran, who participated in the Shram Dhan programme on Sunday, said the government had sanctioned Rs. 1.44 crore for establishing the war memorial in Mysuru about three years ago. But, the work on constructing the memorial is yet to start for various reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. Meanwhile, more than 100 ex-servicemen, who are members of MEM and the public undergoing training at Sainik Academy, Mysuru, participated in the Shram Dhan conducted between 7 a.m. to 10.30 a.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ex-servicemen-seek-reconstitution-of-war-memorial-committee/article33490554.ece

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Facelift for drain connecting K.R. Market and Bellandur lake||The BBMP is set to give a facelift to the rajakaluve (major stormwater drain) connecting K.R. Market to Bellandur lake after the State government’s approval of the Rs. 160-crore ‘Citizens Water Way Project’. The ambitious project found mention in Bengaluru Mission 2022 that was announced by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on December 2020. Considered to be one of the most historically significant rajakaluves, the K-100 connected the erstwhile Dharmabudhi lake, where the Kempegowda Bus Station now stands, with Bellandur lake. The primary drain is 11.4 km in length, with a total 28.06-km network, including secondary drains. The project is envisaged to establish the rajakaluve as a waterway and ecological corridor in the city, on the lines of the development of Pasig River in Manila, Cheong Gyecheon in Seoul, South Korea, Klong Ong Ang Canal rejuvenation in Bangkok, Lu Chuan Canal in Taiwan, and many water canals running through residential neighbourhoods in Singapore. It calls for pathways for walking and cycling lanes, while ensuring that drain capacity is not reduced. BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad told The Hindu that the project has been proposed to be taken up under Design, Build, Operate and Transfer scheme, with the operation and maintenance for five years. It will be funded under the 15th Finance Commission. He said that the BWSSB had already ensured that sewage has stopped flowing in the drain by constructing an underground drainage pipeline. “There is still around 10% sewage flowing in the drain due to unauthorised activities along the drain. This too will be tackled at the earliest,” Mr. Prasad said, and added that the BBMP would be floating tender for the project next week. The BBMP had been working on the project proposal for the past three months. “We even filed a petition before the National Green Tribunal, which directed the Monitoring Committee led by former Lokayukta N. Santosh Hegde to look into it,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/facelift-for-drain-connecting-kr-market-and-bellandur-lake/article33490146.ece

We have alerted check post staff to gather details on all vehicles that passed through in the evening and whether they saw anything unusual,” a senior officer said. Wild animals being victims of hit-and-run accidents is a common occurrence. A two-and-a-half- year-old leopard was run over by a vehicle near Channarayapatna forest range in October last year. “We have put up signage at strategic locations asking motorists to be more careful, but such incidents unfortunately keep happening,” a forest officer said.

This year, however, the popular the street art festival was launched online, and inaugurated virtually by Sudha Murthy, chairperson of Infosys Foundation. Stressing on social responsibility to help out artists who are struggling since the outbreak of COVID-19, Ms. Murthy said, “Santhe means festivities and people coming together to celebrate. Hopefully, Chitra Santhe will get back to being a street art festival, like it was earlier.” Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said traditional art forms should be encouraged and promoted. He hoped that the art festival being held despite COVID-19, albeit online, would help artists. This edition of Chitra Santhe has been dedicated to ‘Corona Warriors’. Over 1,500 artists are participating in the month-long online art festival, with each artist exhibiting a maximum of 10 works.

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||COP||MP for Dakshina Kannada and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel(in picture)became the butt of jokes after he claimed at a function that the government was taking steps to provide sand at Rs. 2,000 per (lorry) load to people’s doorsteps in the district. This was a time when the price for a load was more than Rs. 10,000 and the district administration was yet to start granting licence for extraction of sand in Mangaluru and other parts of the district. A video clip of the MP’s statement became the subject of ridicule on social media. A few days ago, a video clip of an empty lorry ramming into a compound wall was used along with Mr. Kateel’s statement of taking sand to doorsteps. When a reporter questioned Mr. Kateel on this issue recently, the BJP leader said, “I had said Rs. 2,000 per unit of sand. With a rate of Rs. 6,000 per lorry load fixed by the district administration, the per unit cost comes to Rs. 2,000. My statement was wrongly reported,” he said. The usual escape route of being misquoted, although video evidence suggested otherwise.   After much talk in the media over a leadership change in the State, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on December 31 went into overdrive to deflate speculation. Dismissing rumours of any leadership change, he asserted that he would complete his term and focus on the development of the State in the coming years to ensure the BJP’s victory in the 2023 Assembly polls. On the matter of Cabinet expansion, the CM remained silent. Home Minister Amit Shah’s visit to Shivamogga on January 15 and 16 is expected to clear the confusion on the issue, sources said.   Former Minister and the Chief Minister’s political secretary M.P. Renukacharya, MLA, claimed Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah(in picture)had insulted the Hindus of the country by saying that he liked eating cattle meat and questioning the date of birth of Lord Hanuman. “The Congress leader indulged in votebank politics by appeasing to minority community voters by opposing the anti-cow slaughter Bill. While Siddaramaiah visited Sri Kshethra Dharmasthala Sri Manjunatha Swamy temple by eating fish, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the temple by drinking coconut water. This shows the difference between them,” he said. He also said the Congress leader remembered the date of Tipu Jayanti but forgot the history of Lord Ram, the Ram temple, and the date of Hanuman Jayanti. Saying that the people had voted the Congress out in two Lok Sabha elections for its appeasement politics and insulting of Hindus, Mr. Renukacharya demanded an apology from him. Raghava M.

It was inaugurated by District Collector A. Alexander on Alappuzha beach. As part of the campaign, 104 street dogs were administered vaccines. Besides, reflective collars have been put on the dogs to prevent accidents on roads. Medicines needed for the inoculation drive were provided free of cost by Curapets Pet Hospital director Dr. Gopikrishnan. Alappuzha municipal chairperson Soumya Raj presided. The stray dog menace has become a major issue in the Alappuzha municipality and several other parts of the district in recent times. In a bid to control the stray dog population, authorities have decided to strengthen the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme with the help of animal welfare NGOs. As part of the ABC programme, sterilised dogs will be provided special care before being released back at the place of their capture after affixing ear tags for identification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/104-street-dogs-vaccinated/article33490476.ece

The tourism facilities at Vazhachal were thrown open on New Year’s day. The activities at Athirappilly had been launched immediately after the local body polls. The entry of tourists to the destinations will be permitted on a limited scale. On a given day, only 2,000 visitors will be permitted at the site. Of this, 1,000 tickets will be allotted online and the remaining can be purchased at the ticket counters at the site. One-and-a-half hours Each visitor will be allowed to stay at the site for one-and-a-half hours. Tickets may be booked atwww. athirappillyvazhachal.comand the payment made at the counters. The road that runs through the forest area between Vazhachal and Malakkapara has also been opened for vehicles. However, travellers may not be able to freely access Tamil Nadu areas through the route. For reaching the Tamil Nadu side, one needs to obtain travel permission by registering on the State e-portal, according to forest officials. As the threat of the pandemic continues, tourism activities are being permitted as per the health protocol. Members of the Vana Samrakshana Samithis and visitors would have to follow the protocol at the sites, said S.V. Vinod, Divisional Forest Officer, Vazhachal. The areas adjoining the tribal hamlets at Vazhachal, Pokalappara and Sholayar were closed down earlier after they were declared containment zones as a few tribespeople had tested positive for the virus. The infected persons were quarantined and road access regulated to contain the spread of the disease. Revenue loss Usually, the days preceding Christmas would see thousands of tourists thronging the destination. The restriction on the number of visitors meant plummeting of revenue from ticket sales as one visitor was charged only Rs. 40 as entry fee, he said. Earlier, visitors used to arrive in buses and other vehicles in large numbers. Each bus would bring at least 50 tourists. However, the restriction on the number of tourists travelling in such vehicles has reduced the number of visitors reaching the area, said Mr. Vinod. With ecotourism operations being scaled down, the revenue has plummeted and a loss of Rs. 3 crore was recorded. The department had to pull out members of the Vana Samrakshana Samithis aged above 65 years from service, considering the health risks they faced, said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/athirappilly-vazhachal-open-to-tourists/article33490412.ece
04 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Antimicrobial resistance plan hit||The implementation of the Kerala Antimicrobial Resistance Strategic Action Plan (KARSAP), launched two years ago, laying down priorities to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), has taken a hit following the spread of the novel coronavirus. The virus, however, is only likely to exacerbate antimicrobial resistance, says Sarada Devi K.L., head of the Department of Microbiology at the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. Antibiotics, like azithromycin, are prescribed as part of the treatment protocol for COVID-19 for nearly all patients who test positive, often with no rationale, but to avoid secondary bacterial infections in most cases, she says. The Kerala AMR Surveillance Network (KARSNET) has 27 participating institutions, of which 10 are in the public sector. Infections and pathogens are tracked in patients arriving at these institutions, contributing data on AMR. Due to the pandemic, several institutions are not participating since few patients mean that samples cannot be collected, and the microbiology departments in these institutions have also been attempting to handle the coronavirus, says Dr. Sarada, who is also the nodal officer for the implementation of the action plan. “No funds have been set aside at the State-level to implement the plan. Allocating funds is crucial at this stage. The institutions for AMR surveillance, particularly in the private sector, need to be given some support to keep them motivated,” she said. The antibiotic stewardship programme has also not been functioning from March onwards, she says. “As part of the antibiotic stewardship programme, if a clinician wants to start high-end antibiotics, they must consult the infectious diseases specialist or the microbiologist at the hospital on antibiotic use and whether its administration is to be escalated or de-escalated. We have been focusing on infection control practices, but everything else has been put on hold.” General Hospital Since there had been no dearth of patients at the Ernakulam General Hospital, AMR surveillance continued, says Anitha A., Superintendent at the hospital. The hospital follows a hub-and-spoke model, collecting samples from six other government hospitals in the district for surveillance of microbes. Sample collection from the hospitals might have fallen to some extent during the pandemic, she adds. “We hoped to make the State antibiotic literate by 2021. NGOs and the Kudumbashree Mission were to be a part of this awareness project, but nothing has happened this year,” says Dr. Sarada. The action plan follows the World Health Organisation’s ‘One Health’ approach, which means that several sectors, like animal husbandry, fisheries, agriculture and environment, are all crucial in dealing with AMR. “We do not have a good laboratory to incorporate the environment aspect, and ensure investigations on antibiotic residues in the environment, since there isn’t enough funding. Collecting unused drugs was initiated in Thiruvananthapuram to incinerate them and prevent them from being disposed directly into the environment. Expanding this to other districts also requires funding,” adds Dr. Sarada. The General Hospital has also been able to keep its antibiotic stewardship programme afloat during the pandemic. The programme is crucial to ensure that patients are administered proper antibiotics in the proper dose, says Dr. Anitha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-antimicrobial-resistance-action-plan-hit-by-pandemic/article33490432.ece
04 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Tourists opting for shorter stay||The influx of domestic tourists to Kerala in the run-up to the Christmas-New Year festive season brought some cheer to tourism stakeholders, even as quarantine norms are keeping away guests who generally stay put in the State for a fortnight. Apart from hospitality stakeholders, it has severely hit the Ayurveda and wellness sectors, which together contribute a major chunk of income from tourism. Most guests thus prefer short vacations lasting less than a week. The Ayurveda Promotion Society recently submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, citing the plight of operators and staff at Ayurveda hospitals, clinics, and resorts, which offer treatment packages ranging from 11 to 28 days for guests. “We have demanded that the sector be exempted from the mandatory quarantine norms at least till April, since guests from other States and West Asia are willing to stay put for over a week for various treatments, but for quarantine norms,” said Sajeev Kurup, president of the society. They include those from West Asia who are willing to opt for medical visa and confirm booking. Many are keen to visit Kerala for annual and follow-up treatments too. The State will otherwise have to wait till September when the tourist season begins, he added. Responsible Tourism Mission State coordinator K. Rupesh Kumar said domestic tourism was on the revival path, as can be gauged from the arrival of guests from other States. “Knowing that responsible tourism is the way forward post-pandemic, they come in search of experiential tourism. Stakeholders have readied unique packages where care is taken to avoid crowding and adhere to hygiene,” he said. “In keeping with the new trend, we are promoting micro destinations, hitherto unheard-of locales which have not been marketed so far. They have units which offer ethnic cuisines, which are a hit among guests,” he added. Discerning guests have begun flocking to destinations in the suburbs of Kochi to be in the lap of nature. Among their favourite locales is the Thattekkad bird sanctuary. “Tourist footfall is increasing, since migratory birds have arrived in large numbers,” said Girish Chandran, who owns a homestay and accompanies nature lovers on forest and bird watching treks. “We open our doors only to nature lovers and families, since the time is not yet ripe for regular tourism,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourists-opting-for-shorter-stay/article33490434.ece

The school is holding a variety of programmes to make Braille reading more popular, besides spreading awareness about the system. The programmes include a short play on the life of the French inventor of the Braille system, he said. Braille is named after its developer Louis Braille, who lost his sight in an accident at the age of 15. He successfully developed a system to enable the visually impaired to read both normal writing and musical notations. The system gained great popularity in the later years. The campaign launched by the Aluva school focuses on methods to use the Braille system easily.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/giving-a-ray-of-hope-to-the-visually-impaired/article33490431.ece

A plan by the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) to operate a hybrid Roll on-Roll off service (e-Ro-Ro) in the Vaikom-Thavanakkadavu route that connects the Kottayam and Alappuzha districts has been approved by the State government. A study ascertaining the feasibility of the service, carried out in association with the Department of Ship Technology, Cochin University of Science and Technology, has received an administrative sanction from a working group of the State government. Technical committee A technical committee under the department will soon finalise the technical specifications of the vessel, followed by the initiation of tender proceedings. Confirming the development, Shaji V. Nair, director, SWTD said the vessel would be operated using the electricity stored in lithium titanate batteries recharged during navigation. Cost “It will be a combination of both electric and solar power, at a proportion of 60% and 40% respectively,” he explained. The vessel, to be built at a cost of around Rs. 8 crore, will be 30 meter long and 15 meter wide and will have a capacity to carry 80 tonnes. Upon realisation of the project, SWTD will again take lead in introduction of electric Ro-Ro vessel in the country. The environment-friendly service, according to SWTD , will incur around 30% of operational cost when compared to that of a diesel-powered vessel. According to the SWTD director, the three-kilometre inter-district route is proven in terms of the movement of cargo and people as evident from the demand for the jankar service here. The solar service will offer a cheaper option while the roll-on-roll-off facility will ensure convenient movement of vehicles on both sides. Diesel boats “The introduction of electric Ro-Ro, is part of the department’s plan to replace its fleet of diesel boats with solar-powered vessels, that offers a cost-effective and pollution free travel,” the water transport department director said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/countrys-first-e-ro-ro-to-be-rolled-out/article33490474.ece

Almost every river in the State is facing a similar situation,” said T.V. Rajan, State secretary of All Kerala River Protection Committee. The accumulation of plastic in rivers is an indirect after-effect of COVID-19, he added. The State government had banned single-use plastic in January 2020, and several local bodies had succeeded to a great extent in implementing it. But then, COVID struck, and all implementing agencies were busy tackling the pandemic. This led to widespread flouting of rules, especially after home delivery of food became a norm. “Use of single-use plastic has gone up tremendously in the last nine months, and it is mostly ending up in rivers,” Mr. Rajan said. At the same time, direct dumping of waste in rivers has reduced thanks to awareness programmes. But plastic dumped anywhere on the land will ultimately reach rivers in rain. “What you find in Mampuzha must have been washed away in the rain from Kuttikkator town,” Mr. Rajan observed. The situation may escalate in the coming days if the local bodies concerned fail to take proper action. “It is not just this issue. The pandemic has triggered various other environmental issues that need to be addressed immediately,” Mr. Rajan said. The committee has prepared a Haritha Pathrika (Green manifesto) to be sent to the Chief Minister as well as heads of local bodies across the State, expecting them to implement at least a few of its recommendations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plastic-waste-choking-rivers/article33490417.ece
04 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||A day of three elephant deaths||Three elephant deaths were reported from the northern parts of the State on Sunday. One was a wild elephant recently rescued by a Forest Department squad from a deep well at Muthappanpuzha, near Anakkampoyil, in Kozhikode in a widely followed operation. Though the animal had not sustained any serious external or internal injuries, it was in distress because of dehydration. Forest officials said the elephant had collapsed after it was released to the forest. Though food and water was given to it on time, apart from first aid, its survival chances seemed bleak, they said. It was on last Friday that the elephant was spotted inside the abandoned well by a patrol team. The animal was reportedly spotted two days after it fell in. It had taken almost 13 hours to rescue the elephant by digging a parallel trench. In Wayanad, forest officials found the carcass of an elephant calf at Vandikkadavu under the Kurichiyad forest range of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. The carcass of the calf, less than a year old, was found on a rivulet of the Kannarampuzha inside the sanctuary, Warden S. Narendra Babu told The Hindu . Forest officials’ attempts to remove the carcass from the rivulet were yet to succeed because of the presence of a herd of elephants around the carcass, Mr. Narendra Babu said. Autopsy could be done only after the herd left the place, he said. Electrocution suspected On Sunday, a female elephant was found dead in a private farmland at Karulai, near Nilambur, in Malappuram. The 20-year-old elephant is suspected to have been electrocuted. The carcass was found at a banana field at Mailambara, Chakkikkuzhi, within the Kalikavu forest range in Nilambur South Forest Division. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Saji Kumar and Range Officer P. Suresh said the reason for death was mentioned as heart failure in the postmortem report. The carcass was buried on Sunday afternoon. A case has been registered against the owners of the farmland.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-day-of-three-elephant-deaths/article33490441.ece
04 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Roads leading to tourism spots turn plastic dumps||Even as several months have already passed since the ban of plastic carry bags, the huge quantity of plastic waste getting piled up on waysides in Kozhikode rural area continues to be a concern for local administrators. Futile exercise The setting up of material recovery facilities for waste collection and their management have turned out to be a futile exercise in many locations on account of poor public response. Though waste collection points fixed by local bodies concerned are properly being used by residents, passers-by continue to throw plastic waste on waysides. Because of this, roads leading to trekking points and eco-tourism spots are an eyesore now. “Village roads leading to eco-tourism spots such as Kariyathumpara, Kakkayam, Peruvannamoozhi, and Vayalada are the worst examples. Those who come to such spots recklessly dump mineral water bottles, plastic containers of food and unclean carry bags,” says Jose Chokkattu, a resident of Kuttiyadi. He adds that the isolated stretches of tourism spots are now emerging as small plastic dumping yards. During heavy rains, the piled-up plastic waste along the road spread over other areas. Though the grama panchayat authorities had been keen on clearing them earlier, the continuing menace has almost doused the spirit of cleaning labourers. Now, National Service Scheme volunteers are undertaking some cleaning drives with the support of residents’ forums. Poor management The poor management of material recovery facilities in villages is also cited as a reason behind the growing menace of plastic waste. Rijo Sebastian, a Plus Two student from Balussery, says many waste collection bins erected along the road are not emptied and cleared on time, and it has been prompting visitors to Vayalada hill destination to throw plastic waste on the road. Meanwhile, secretaries of some of the local panchayats say the continuing distribution of plastic carry bags below permitted microns was the main reason for the increasing menace in public places. They say stringent action will be planned soon with the support of the newly elected local body members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/roads-leading-to-tourism-spots-turn-plastic-dumps/article33490418.ece
04 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Varsity Syndicate member to approach Governor against regularisation of staff||A member of the Calicut University Syndicate, aligned to the United Democratic Front, is planning to approach the Governor to annul the recent decision of university to regularise the services of daily wage employees who have put in more than 10 years of service. P. Rasheed Ahammed, the Syndicate member, had registered a dissent note when the decision was taken at a meeting on December 30. According to him, Rule (3) of the Kerala Public Service Commission (Additional Functions as respects the service Under Universities), Act, 2015, appointment to non-teaching posts in universities in Kerala had been left to the Kerala State Public Service Commission. A special rule had been issued prescribing the appointment, qualification, age limit for the posts of assistants and computer assistants and appointments to all universities had been completed. Also, a similar special rule had been issued for posts such as last grade servants, librarian, pump operator, electrician etc. and the vacancies reported to the PSC. The government had informed universities on January 28, 2016, that regularising daily wage employees or those on contract in government or government institutions after October 9, 2006, would violate a Supreme Court judgment. Mr. Ahammed pointed out that the appointment of people on daily wages or on contract does not entitle them for being regularised in government service. He noted that daily wage or contractual staff are re-engaged after a mandatory service break from time to time. Thus, their service is not continuous. The re-engagements are approved with a condition that they would not have any right for claiming it for permanent appointment, Mr. Ahammed claimed. He claimed that the note to Syndicate on the issue did not contain the number of temporary staff who had completed 10 years of service. Thus, the Syndicate was not in a position to calculate the actual financial commitment it would incur. The regularisation of temporary staff in supernumerary posts, if there are no vacancies, would result in excess expenditure, Mr. Ahammed added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/varsity-syndicate-member-to-approach-governor-against-regularisation-of-staff/article33490422.ece

04 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Demand for IFFK venue in Kozhikode||Even as the inclusion of three more venues for the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) has kicked up a controversy, film enthusiasts in Kozhikode, which was the first venue of the festival, are vying for an additional venue in the city. “The silver jubilee of IFFK is an occasion to commemorate the first edition of the festival. Kozhikode, with a large chunk of festival goers, has every right to be one of the venues,” said K.J. Thomas, secretary of the Bankmen’s Film Society that has been organising film festivals in the city for decades, even online festivals during the COVID times. Their demand is not to shift the venue from Thalasseri to Kozhikode as many had perceived. “Thalassery is an ideal venue, which is quite accessible to people from Kasaragod and Kannur, besides parts of Wayanad district too. We are asking for a fifth venue in Kozhikode, which has hosted the regional edition of IFFK in the past,” said Mr. Thomas who was the festival director then. He assumed that the non-availability of Kairali and Sree theatres under the Kerala State Film Development Corporation could have been the reason for neglecting Kozhikode. However, the theatres will be ready for use by March, when the festival is scheduled to be held. The Bankmen’s Film Society, among other film enthusiasts, has written to the Minister concerned about the issue. “We have time till March to sort it out,” Mr. Thomas said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-for-iffk-venue-in-kozhikode/article33490420.ece

The police cracked the missing case of Irshad, son of K.V. Haneefa, with the arrest of his friends Subhash and Ebin. Based on their statements, the police began searching the well with the help of experts on Saturday. The search continued on Sunday until parts of his body were recovered. The police said Irshad had been killed by Subhash and Ebin in order to escape from returning Rs. 5 lakh that they collected from Irshad. The money was reportedly collected in the name of procuring a panchaloha vigraha . The police said they killed Irshad by ripping his head apart after blindfolding him and making him attend a puja. Irshad’s father had registered a complaint at Changaramkulam police station saying that his son had been missing from June 11, 2020. Although the police were clueless in the initial phase, they cracked the case after six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/missing-youths-body-parts-recovered-from-well/article33490414.ece

A State leadership camp of the Youth Congress held at Malampuzha, near here, on Sunday raised the demand, warning that the Congress with the current leadership would have to face a worse defeat in the upcoming Assembly elections. Youth Congress State president Shafi Parambil, MLA, said that the failure was due to favouritism displayed in seat sharing by local group leaders of the Congress. Many good candidates were struck down to accommodate personal choices of group leaders, he said. State general secretary Rajesh Chandran said that accompanying leaders and driving their cars were being considered a qualification for becoming a candidate. The camp demanded that action be initiated against anti-people candidates along with the action against the Congress’s rebel candidates. Addressing the media later, Mr. Parambil said that young candidates had won wherever they were given opportunities. He demanded that the Youth Congress’s criticism should be viewed by leaders with the mind of the old-time Youth Congress workers. He said that the civic body election victory was no clean-chit for the Left Democratic Front (LDF).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/disband-kpcc-leadership-says-youth-cong/article33490425.ece

04 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||LDF hopes to get most standing committees||With an increase in its strength in the city Corporation council, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is looking at ways to wrest control of the maximum number of standing committees while the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to improve upon its record in the previous term, when it had just one standing committee. The elections for the heads of the standing committees are scheduled to be held this week. A final date for the same will be decided on Monday. As the Deputy Mayor usually heads the Finance Standing Committee, P.K.Raju of the Communist Party of India (CPI) will be in charge of the committee. Within the Left Democratic Front (LDF), demands could be raised by the various constituent parties for the head posts of one or the other standing committee. In addition to the CPI, there are councillors from Congress(S), Indian National League (INL), Janata Dal (Secular) and Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy (JSS). According to LDF sources, the CPI(M) is unlikely to give away control of some of the major standing committees including works, health and development. Some of these committees will be reserved for women this time. A few of the young councillors as well as a couple of councillors who had headed standing committees in the previous tenures stand a chance to become heads. A dearth of experienced hands among the LDF, filled with several first-timers, makes its task tough in constituting the standing committees, where key decisions on various sectors are initially taken. The BJP which was reduced to having just one standing committee under its control, despite having 35 councillors, is expected to be better prepared for the elections this time. Some intelligent number crunching by the LDF last time had ensured that it got control of seven of the eight standing committees. With an increased strength of 52 this time, and possible support from the three Independents who voted for it in the Mayor and Deputy Mayor elections, the LDF hopes to repeat its show from the previous term. No contest for UDF The United Democratic Front (UDF) with just 10 seats in the council will find it hard to even put up a contest for any of these posts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-hopes-to-get-most-standing-committees/article33490635.ece
04 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Sero surveillance study across districts||In The State government has finally decided to do a sero surveillance study across districts to ascertain the baseline prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the community, which will give an indication of the proportion of the population which has had prior, silent exposure to the virus. A press note issued by the office of Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said a sero prevalence survey would help determine the possibility of yet another wave of COVID-19 and help policy makers evolve appropriate preventive or control strategies. A sero prevalence study (measuring the SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in blood samples) will help the State determine the actual extent of the spread of the virus in the community regardless of what the official numbers say because there is still no estimate of the asymptomatic disease transmission. The sero survey, which is being conducted under the supervision of the Additional Director of Health Services (Public Health) and the nodal officer of the State Prevention of Epidemics and Infectious Diseases Cell, will be coordinated in districts by the respective District Surveillance Officers (DSO). Sample size The study will be conducted in an adult population of 12,100 across districts, with at least 350 samples collected from households in each district. DSOs would choose 10 random healthcare institutions in every district, and 12 healthcare workers from each institution. From five random local self government institutions and five police stations in each district, another 120 samples are being collected. The State also intends to subject 5,000 blood samples collected from selected blood banks and laboratories in all districts to sero study. Likely by next week Officials said that the Health Department intended to launch the survey next week itself, after finalising the details. While COVID-19 second wave has led to a major surge in cases across the Western world, in India and in Kerala, the second wave has not been very evident. An analysis of India’s COVID numbers by a panel formed by the Department of Science and Technology had reported recently that till November, India was missing about 90 infections for every case, while Kerala was missing about 25 infections for every case it detected. Undetected cases The committee said the country would not see another peak, because of the large number of undetected infections – which meant that even if it was not reflected in the official numbers, infection has spread far in the country, rendering a sizeable population immune. In November first week, the test positivity rate amongst symptomatic health-care workers in Kerala had been 20%, 10.5% in asymptomatic yet high-risk groups, 3.2% in people with no symptoms but who had been tested for COVID-19 prior to surgeries, and 8.3% in people who had reached outpatient clinics in hospitals, as per official data.  Samples will be collected from, among others, healthcare institutions, LSGIs, police stations, blood banks||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sero-surveillance-study-in-kerala/article33490344.ece

Test positivity rate stayed unrelenting at 9.73%. Disease transmission has been continuing at a steady level throughout the State for the past several weeks.

04 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Cong. slump to benefit LDF: CPI(M)||The State committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] on Sunday felt the “incremental disintegration” of the Congress would benefit the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the Assembly elections in May. CPI(M) acting secretary A. Vijayaraghavan, who chaired the meeting, said voters had punished the Congress in the local body polls for embracing radical Islamist groups such as the Jamaat-e-Islami and its political arm, the Welfare Party of India (WPI). A "radicalised" Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) had subsumed the Congress. It had emerged as the dominant partner in the United Democratic Front (UDF). Polarisation bid  The IUML had tried to polarise the electorate into competing caste and communal factions by attempting to stir up bitterness over the government's decision to accord 10% reservation in employment to impoverished persons hailing from forward communities. The Congress had abandoned its secular principles and played second fiddle to the IUML. The disavowal had caused secular elements in Congress to rise in revolt against the UDF leadership. They would gravitate towards the LDF. The Congress had ceased to be a secular alternative to the Left in State politics. The alliance with the WPI had tainted the party permanently. Kerala's political landscape had changed. A coming together of communal forces could not upend the LDF. "There is no scope for a second Liberation Struggle in Kerala," he said. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has realised the fact. It could make little headway in the polls. The Hindu majoritarian BJP and Islamist parties shared a symbiotic relationship. One justified the existence of the other. A robust attempt at household level welfarism in the wake of the economically crippling COVID-19 pandemic had helped the government counter the Opposition's recriminatory tactics and coast to victory in the local body polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-slump-to-benefit-ldf-cpim/article33490444.ece

It would also be a return to action for the theatre scene in the city, which has remained inactive just like every other sector since the COVID-19 outbreak last year. The group is planning to launch its initiative called 'Theatre Lab', to promote new experimental work.  Kingdom Animalia: The Dance of Death directed by Vishnu Hari, will be its first production. According to Vishnu, the play is conceived as the happenings within the field of view of a CCTV camera, over several generations. “We are looking at a particular space through the CCTVs, where several generations are born and die. Imagine the happenings in a space over a long period of time caught in a video footage and history is recorded as mere movements in this space. For us, the starting point was George Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ as well as the work of 16th century Dutch painter Pieter Bruegel. He had made a painting called ‘The Triumph of Death,’ which we also connected with the dancing mania in Europe during that period, wherein large numbers of people would mysteriously dance until they collapsed. All the characters in our play are animals, and hence the language too is that of animals. The play will be in five acts,” says Vishnu. The second play to be staged as part of the Sankara Pillai commemoration will be Priyappetta Avivaahita written by P.M.Taj. Shahul Hameed Maraikkar is directing the play which will be performed by Theatre Collective, the alumni association of the School of Drama.

04 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Colleges set to reopen today||The State capital is set to witness a flurry of activity with the resumption of classes in colleges on Monday. While college authorities have already undertaken a thorough clean-up and sanitisation of campuses, college councils have evolved plans for regulating student movement and seating arrangements in a manner that enables adequate distancing. Display boards have been erected to propagate awareness on the pandemic. Moreover, the students will be briefed about the precautionary measures prior to the classes. While most institutions will resume functioning in accordance with the government guidelines, the reopening will be delayed in a few others. University College will resume offline classes only on January 12 owing to the university examinations that will continue until January 11. While the government has recommended conducting classes on a shift basis, the college has decided to prepare schedules in a manner that each student at the undergraduate (UG) level will have to attend classes only three days a week. Citing the possibility of gatherings in the campus, he pointed out that holding morning and afternoon shifts would be impractical. College principal B. Unnikrishnan said the UG final-year batch, numbering roughly 800 students, will be split into two divisions with one requiring to attend classes on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and the other on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The college will function from 9.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. He added that strict measures will be enforced in the college canteen that will only provide parcels for the time being. Such hangouts will come under strict vigil to avoid congregations. Split UG classes While classes will be formally resumed at the Government College for Women on Monday, they will then be suspended until January 11 in view of the ongoing examinations. Principal Aravind Krishnan K. said they will split UG classes that have more than 30 students to ensure physical distancing by accommodating two students on a bench. The students will, however, be required to attend classes on all days except Sundays from 9.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. Considering schools have already reopened partially, the city is likely to witness a considerable surge in traffic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/colleges-set-to-reopen-today/article33490634.ece

M. Sunil has said. EICL, which has been shut since August 10, is in the news after a 50-year-old contract employee was found dead on the company premises on Saturday. The Department has initiated action against the company for denying lay-off compensation to the employees and ordering illegal transfers, the Additional Labour Commissioner said. The EICL management has also been slapped with a notice in this regard under Section 29 of the Industrial Disputes Act, he said. Operations halted After the company halted operations in August last year, Labour Minister T. P. Ramakrishnan had held discussions with the EICL management. Follow-up discussions were conducted five times by the office of the Labour Commissioner. Subsequently, the management had agreed to restart operations at the Thonnackal unit on a small scale. However, the Kochiveli unit has not been reopened. The Labour Department had also taken steps to ensure that the employees were issued their bonus, ex gratia and salary arrears in two installments, according to the Additional Labour Commissioner.

04 January 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Officials worry as elephants stray into Chittoor outskirts||A herd of three wild elephants from the forests abutting the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary and Tamil Nadu border have made their way into the outskirts of Chittoor town, much to the concern of the people and forest officials. This is considered first time that the pachyderms were seen roaming in the non-forested stretch covered with hillocks and fields. During the last 24 hours, the elephants were found in the vicinity of half a dozen hamlets. The herd comprising two full-grown males and a sub-adult male had entered Chittoor district from the hilly terrain at Naraharipeta check-post on the Chittoor-Vellore road, and forayed into the rural side along the riverbed in GD Nellore mandal and Chittoor outskirts. As their movement is mostly confined to the areas close to sparse jungles and hillocks, the forest officials pressed drones into service to track the movement of the animals. The officials said forest watchers and elephant trackers were also deployed to drive the animals back into the thickets in Bangarupalem mandal to the west of Chittoor. “The elephants have been found roaming in the Chittoor East range for the last few days. Chittoor city and its surroundings have no thick forests and fodder. Poor vegetation At present, the herd is moving between the hillocks and fields. It is very congenial for these animals to camp in the hillocks with poor vegetation. This terrain makes it difficult to track the elephants. Apart from using drones, we are using manpower to divert the attention of the herd back into their habitation,” Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor East-Wildlife) G.G. Narentheran told The Hindu.  Villagers cautioned Meanwhile, several youth ventured close to the elephants to take selfies. The forest staff at the field level cautioned the villagers and youth to remain alert and avoid night vigils at fields, and if necessary to move in groups. Some farmers in G.D. Nellore mandal complained that the elephants had damaged a vast stretch of banana plantation. Hitherto, the wild elephants from the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary and neighbouring forests in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were found roaming in Ramasamudram, Punganur, Chowdepalle, Somala and Sadum mandals towards Piler division.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/forest-staff-deploy-drones-as-wild-elephants-enter-chittoor/article33489990.ece

The BJP conducted a meeting of its OBC Morcha in Srikalahasti town on Sunday, commemorating the birth anniversary of Savitribai Phule who championed the cause of the Backward Classes. Even as the meeting was said to be an attempt to reach out to the OBC community ahead of the by-election to the Tirupati parliamentary constituency, Mr. Deodhar used the opportunity to flay the YSRCP government over the attacks on temples and religious structures. Dig at Naidu “The YSRCP government is hurting the religious sentiments of the Hindus and testing their patience. Not even a single person involved in the attacks has been arrested so far, which is a pointer to the ineffective functioning of the government,” said Mr. Deodhar. He also accused former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu of shedding crocodile tears and said that Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy should keep his ‘brawling nature under control’. OBC Morcha national president K. Lakshman described the BJP as the only party that could ensure the economic and political independence of the communities. He maintained that the BJP– Jana Sena combine would form the next government in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Speaking on the occasion, BJP State president Somu Veerraju said no other party could ever stake claim in ensuring dignity to the OBC communities. OBC Morcha State president Bitra Venkatasiva Narayana announced that more such programmes would be organised to strengthen in future.

In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Raju said the Minister failed to visit Ramateertham immediately on coming to know of the desecration of Lord Rama’s idol at the 400-year-old temple and order a thorough inquiry. The Endowments Minister had no answer when silver lions on the chariot belonging to the Kanaka Durga temple in Vijayawada went missing, he alleged. “The Minister has remained a mute spectator even as desecrations continued unabated at the temples in the last 19 months,” Mr. Raju alleged. ‘Withdraw remarks’ He demanded that the Minister withdraw the “highly objectionable” remarks he made against TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu. “Mr. Srinivasa Rao has no moral standing to criticise Mr. Naidu. Thousands of acres of temple lands are slipping into the hands of private persons ever since Mr. Srinivasa Rao became the Endowments Minister. His inefficiency is causing great harm to the Hindu temples. He no longer deserves to continue as Endowments Minister,” Mr. Raju said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/velampalli-should-quit-for-failing-to-protect-temples/article33490573.ece

This is another instance of the Chief Minister’s vindictive attitude. Instead of nabbing the culprits, the police are framing the TDP leaders who expose the government’s failure,” Mr. Naidu said.

Sridhar Babu. He said that the said laws were passed in Parliament against all norms, and they would adversely affect food security and deprive farmers of remunerative prices. The heavy-handed manner in which the farmers’ agitation was being suppressed reflected the NDA government’s authoritarian mindset, Mr. Sridhar Babu alleged. The financial support extended by the union was in solidarity with the farmers’ protests which, Mr. Sridhar Babu exuded confidence, would ultimately force the Central government to annul the laws that were detrimental to farmers’ interests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/postal-employees-extend-financial-aid-to-farmers/article33490574.ece

The State economy is directionless. The government lacks a deep understanding and is clueless as to what the economy needs now. The per capita debt touched Rs. 20,000 in the last 19 months,” he said. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said that the government borrowed Rs. 1.5 lakh crore during the last 19 months, and levied taxes of Rs. 75,000 crore. The tax burden was Rs. 4,000 crore additionally per month. Physical and social infrastructure development was literally nil. The government had deferred payment of TA and six DAs to employees. The pensioners were not receiving pensions in time. The fiscal deficit was touching Rs. 1,10,320 crore, he said. ‘Publicity stunt’ On the one hand, the prices of essential commodities were on the rise and on the other, the government was making tall claims on welfare programmes. Except government’s publicity on welfare schemes, people hardly benefited , he said. The revenue collections went up by 6% in the last six months, the State borrowings doubled and the expenditure increased by 23% compared to previous years. The government also received an additional assistance of Rs. 7,700 crore from the Centre. “Where has all this money gone?” he asked. “Andhra Pradesh earned a bad reputation due to ‘government terrorism’ and the law and order deteriorated,” he alleged||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/states-economy-is-directionless-yanamala/article33490585.ece

There is both revenue and forest land and there are some ‘gap’ areas in between. The officials had reportedly given mining permissions to 20 granite companies on 80 acres in the ‘gap’ area. Girijana Sangham district honorary president K. Govinda Rao said that the tribal villagers of Dolavanipalem, Ramannadorapalem, K. Gadavapalem, Kotnabilli and K. Kotnabilli have been cultivating cashew gardens on 198 acres of land on the hills for over three decades. He alleged that the permissions were given without conducting the mandatory ‘gram sabhas’ by the mining and revenue officials, who had failed to give ‘pattas’ to the tribal farmers for the land on which they were cultivating cashew. He alleged that the local revenue officials and mining owners sent back the survey officials, who were deputed by the State government, for the issue of ROFR (Recognition of Forest Rights) pattas. He alleged that the local officials were saying that there was no need of a survey as the lands on the hill were in the ‘gap’ area. The Girijana Sangham leaders demanded conduct of a survey for the lands being cultivated by the tribal people on the hills and issuance of ROFR pattas. They said that a ‘vanta varpu’ protest would be staged at the Mandal Revenue Office at Raavikamatam on Monday to protest against the alleged indifference of the officials towards their demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/half-naked-tribal-people-stage-stir/article33490660.ece

04 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Shock therapy resumes at IMH after 8 months||Three major issues dogging the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for long have finally been resolved. After a gap of over eight months, Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT) is again being offered at the largest mental healthcare facility in Telangana. The institute, which did not have an ambulance for the past several years, has been sanctioned one by the government. The stock of drugs prescribed to people for depression and anxiety has also been partially replenished. ECT, commonly known as shock treatment, was stopped at the institute from April last year given that an anaesthetist was not available. Hundreds of patients suffering from psychosis and chronic depression lost out on the option. “Being a tertiary health centre, most patients consult us in chronic stage and they require ECT,” a source at the institute said. One cycle of the treatment costs around Rs. 10,000 in private hospitals. Majority of the patients who opt for IMH belong to financially poor background and their family members had to either shell out that amount for the treatment or wait indefinitely for the service to resume at IMH. The issue was highlighted in these columns (‘Patients with depression pushed to the brink’) on October 3, 2020. Anaesthetist provided Sources at the institute said the ECT resumed from the second week of December. The issue was taken to the notice of officials by IMH administration. Superintendent M. Uma Shankar said an anaesthetist from Gandhi Hospital is visiting them once a week to conduct the treatment. “Another anaesthetist from Osmania General Hospital might visit our institute. Thereafter, we can offer ECT twice a week,” Dr Uma Shankar said. The institute, which has around 250 patients, did not have a functional, dedicated ambulance for the past many years. They had to rely on ‘108’ ambulance to shift patients in emergency cases. Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao has facilitated the resource to the hospital. Another issue that troubled patients who opted the institute was lack of medicines used in treatment of depression, anxiety, and epilepsy associated with mental illnesses. In absence of new-generation drugs, doctors relied on old-generation drugs which have side effects. The issue lasted at least five months. Dr Uma Shankar represented the issues to authorities on multiple occasions. At long last, drug stock has been replenished. “We need a few more medicines. We are hopeful those too will be provided,” a source added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/shock-therapy-resumes-at-imh-after-8-months/article33490380.ece
04 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Consumers in other States unaware of Telangana Sona’||The Indian School of Business (ISB) that carried out a study for evolving a marketing strategy for Telangana Sona rice has found that the superfine variety rice with the unique selling proposition of having the lowest glycemic index among all popular varieties in the country is popular solely in Telangana, although it has a strong market potential. The study carried out between July first week and October first week in 2020 in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and West Bengal has stated that the new variety of rice developed by Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) has low awareness not only in other States, but within Telangana too, and is known significantly less among the popular varieties. In the 50-page report submitted to the State government recently, the ISB study has revealed that “the availability of Telangana Sona accounts for 70% of the market in Telangana at present and the remaining 30% is split between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Mumbai.” Stating that Telangana Sona is in the introductory stage in terms of marketing, a substantial number of respondents who participated in the study stated that they were unaware of the existence of the product. Marketing cornerstones The study carried out by the premier business school has concluded that the cornerstones of the marketing potential of Telangana Sona include its favourableness with farmers and millers, an affordable price point, preferred grain size and the growing consumer interest in shifting to healthier diets. “The key gaps to look for are the name similarities between Telangana Sona and Sona Masoori, post-cooking textures that may not appeal to certain consumers, and a strong association with diabetics that may deter normal consumers from associating with it,” they study stated. It has suggested that the strongest markets for Telangana Sona would be consumers who prefer separate and slender grains post-cooking and healthier lifestyles. The report suggested that the branding campaigns for Telangana Sona should focus on communicating the places where the product is available and its tasty and healthy attributes. “Additionally, given the nascent stage of the product introduction in the market, it is essential to create powerful brand symbols to derive long-term benefits from the advertising campaigns,” the study recommended. Further it suggested that a strong brand symbol can be created by creating a brand logo associated with Telangana Sona. “Over time, we believe that Telangana Sona will also have significant potential in overseas markets such as the United States that already has a strong health revolution underway and has a significant population of the Indian diaspora,” the report added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/low-awareness-about-telangana-sona-isb/article33490402.ece
04 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Stepwell collapses mid-restoration||A well-intentioned move to restore a centuries-old stepwell at the Yamjal Ramalayam has turned into a disaster. Three of the small temples among the 28 that surround the unique stepwell near Hakimpet airbase appeared collapsed on Saturday. The damage was first pointed out by a heritage activist who noticed the difference in images shared by one of his friends. “A friend shared a video and I noticed three of the small temples that surround the stepwell were not in their location,” said the activist, unwilling to go on record. NRI benefactor The priest, K. Seetramachary, said the stepwell has not been damaged but is in the process of being restored. “The stepwell and the 28 temples have suffered a lot of damage over the years. We are in the process of restoring them, thanks to an NRI benefactor from the US who hails from the village,” informed the priest. The 28 temples are dedicated to the nakshatras where people born under a particular nakshatra pray for their well-being. But a visit to the rear portion of the stepwell showed scattered large stones, some of them broken into pieces. “We are trying to repair them. You can notice that the stones are numbered. But the work has been affected as the workers went away for Deepavali holidays,” said the priest. While three of the temples are no longer in their original position, four others have been coated with reinforced concrete mixture for a smoother finish in the joints. The stepwell is constructed with ashlar masonry where large stones are finished and placed one on top of other without bonding material. The temple is under Endowments Department. “The rough finish of stones that cap the smaller temples show that they are older than the main temple. The pillars of Ramalayam have a smooth finish like the Kakatiya-era Ramappa temple,” says the activist. Till a few decades ago, the temple dominated the village life with annual functions, including Ramanavami celebrations that went on for 11 days. Now, the temple is limited to a small patch of land as it has been cut off from the Hanuman temple which is at a distance as well as from the village lake. “Lot of the temple land has been encroached upon. We are able to develop some utilities in the temple, thanks to benefactors. But if the Endowments Department or the Archaeology Department take up work in restoring the temple, we will be more than happy,” said the priest. Stepwell restoration plan Incidentally, Telangana government has announced a plan to restore stepwells in the State, some of which date from the Kakatiya era and are marvels of engineering. “As part of our plan to revive & restore #stepwells (Baolis) in #Telangana, as advised by Min @KTRTRS, feasibility documentation is commenced in Narayanpet dist. We intend to restore about 15 stepwells in phase I with 10 in #Hyderabad,” MA&UD Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar had tweeted on August 28 last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/stepwell-damaged-mid-restoration/article33490378.ece

Kodandaram asserted that his party will continue its struggle for the cause of people till the government takes steps to resolve their problems. Prof. Kodandaram launched a two-day protest at his party office in support of the demands of youth, farmers, private sector teachers and other sections on Sunday. He lamented that the police denied permission for his protest at the Dharna Chowk. Hence, it was decided to continue the protest at the party office, he said. TDP, Left parties and others extended their solidarity with the protest launched by the TJS president. Stating that the protest would continue for the next 48 hours, Prof. Kodandaram exhorted the TJS supporters to come to the State capital for extending their support and stage protests in their respective places in the event of police resorting to preventive arrests. Prof. Kodandaram expressed concern that the government had not taken steps to provide unemployment allowance to the youth in the last six year since the TRS took over the reins. The agriculture sector is in deep crisis and there is a need to take steps to alleviate the problems faced by farmers. ‘Huge debts’ TTDP president L. Ramana demanded that the government fulfil the promises it made to people. Though the State is saddled with huge debts since the TRS government took over the reins, the government has not initiated steps to bring about changes in the lives of the common people, he said. Educationist and former MLC Chukka Ramaiah said unemployed youth are demoralised since steps have not been initiated to provide jobs. Lauding Prof. Kodandaram for launching the selfless protest in the interests of the youth of the State, he said the development should send a warning to the government. Farmers are facing acute hardship in the absence of remunerative prices to their produce and the protest would lend a supporting voice for their cause, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kodandaram-launches-protest/article33490404.ece
04 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Shramik Specials, Kisan Rail mark SCR’s pandemic journey||South Central Railway (SCR), like rest of Indian Railways, saw the entire train movement coming to a grinding halt for the first time in history when the government declared lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March last year. Since then while the freight train movement has picked up in terms of speed and quantity, limited number of passenger trains are being run as the Railway Board awaits for the current situation to ease. The unprecedented crisis caused a huge revenue hole yet the railway story last year is about how the entire railway machinery was galvanised into action to move scores of migrant labour up northwards towards Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, etc., during the peak of the pandemic safely. Incidentally, ‘Shramik Specials’ began from here when the maiden train from Lingampalli took off towards Hatia (Jharkhand) on May 1. In all, 243 such labour specials originating from 32 stations helped transport more than three lakh labour to over 88 stations in 15 States. “We additionally dealt with another 795 Shramik special trains passing through our zone. Our staff, despite the virus threat, has provided food and drinking water to all of them besides providing security,” pointed out General Manager Gajanan Mallya. The zone was also think in the action of ensuring movement of foodgrains, vegetables, fruits, milk and so on across the country to keep the feeder chains alive amid the lockdown and had introduced three ‘Kisan Rails’ from the south for transporting agriculture produce exclusively. “We clubbed two freight trains into one to enable faster delivery of food grains and our ‘Doodh-Duronto’ for milk supply to Delhi from Renigunta station, starting from March has till date transported five crore litres,” he explained. Time tabled parcel trains — to benefit small and medium freight customers to transport essential commodities — was another pioneering effort with over 600 such trains moving one lakh tonnes. Freight trains had even crossed to Bangladesh transporting dry chillies, turmeric, onions, dry, ginger etc. for the first time. Passenger services started in a trickle from May 15 and 83 pairs of regular special trains are being run with more than 3,000 trips a month. Another 78 festival specials are being operated with more than 1,300 trips for month, an average of 100 regular trains and 35 festival specials are being run, senior officials say. This is a far cry from operating over 700 trains a day before lockdown and carrying little over 363 million passengers (252 million between AprilNovember) to 4.34 million or a steep nosedive of -98.2% in 2020. It has had an impact on revenue, which went down from over Rs. 15,000 (Rs. 9,00 crore between April-November) to Rs. 5,342 crore or a reduction of about 41%. On the freight front, if it was 113 million tonnes last year or 73 MTs (April-November), it is down to 56 MTs or - 21% in 2020. Mr. Mallya stated the relatively limited train services helped complete infrastructure works with 88 km of new lines, 43 of gauge conversion and 261 km of doubling/tripling/quadrupling works completed, added CPRO Ch. Rakesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/shramik-specials-kisan-rail-mark-scrs-pandemic-journey/article33490383.ece

According to police, the victim, Shyam (36), a watchman, who hails from Warangal, got married to Saroja and the couple had three children. Shyam was allegedly addicted to alcohol and used to beat his wife and children almost daily, Keesara Inspector J. Narender Goud said. On Saturday night too, he came home in an inebriated condition and started assaulting Saroja, following a heated argument. “When he started beating their daughter, Saroja hit his head with a pestle, and as a result, he fell on the ground. She assumed that Shyam fell unconscious and was sleeping and left him unattended,” police said. Next morning (on Sunday), she found Shyam dead in a pool of blood and alerted the neighbours, who in turn informed police about the offence. A case was registered and Saroja was taken into custody. Meanwhile at Nandigama in Rangareddy district, a 40-year-old farmer was found murdered at an agricultural field. The victim, Rayappagari Srinivas Reddy, was stabbed to death by unidentified assailants.

04 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Deposit post-matric scholarship: BJP||BJP president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Sunday demanded the TRS government to immediately implement the post-matric scholarship scheme for SC students by direct transfer of money into their respective bank accounts. “Scores of SC students have been hit because of the stoppage in fee reimbursement scheme and scholarships. The government should follow the Centre which gives 60% of the money through direct transfer by releasing the rest of 40%,” he said at a press conference. The BJP leader claimed that the number of SC students beneficiaries had increased from 1.36 crore to four crore for the post-matric scholarship given for higher studies after Class X, and the funding has been enhanced to Rs. 58,048 crore of which the Centre's share of Rs. 30,534 crore has been released already since the Modi-led government does not want education to be deprived to the deprived sections, he said. “Instead of diverting funds for other purposes and trying to thwart the Centre from getting any credit, the government here should ensure SC students get the benefit. There is no point in sidestepping the issue by appointing another committee to look into it,” he said. Mr. Sanjay Kumar also criticised the government for lack of teachers recruitment in the last six years and for indirectly promoting private schools by making the government schools irrelevant. “Many SC families involved in daily labour are unable to pay the fee in private schools, whereas the government schools do not have sufficient number of teachers,” he charged. He once again taunted the employee union leaders for their “silence” when teachers and civil constables have been complaining of lack of promotions for many years. Earlier, the BJP chief admitted political leaders from other parties hailing from Nizamabad. MP D. Aravind while introducing the newcomers said there has been a groundswell of support for the party at the grassroot level and this is only bound to increase in the next couple of years making it ready to come to power after the next Assembly elections. The Nizamabad MP also commented on TRS leaders rushing to endorse Minister for Municipal Administration K.T. Rama Rao as the next Chief Minister and wondered if it meant the current Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao’s regime has been “inefficient” and hence the time has come for him to call it a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/deposit-post-matric-scholarship-amount-into-accounts-of-sc-students-bjp/article33490407.ece

In a statement issued here on Sunday, the KVPS district secretary N Manohar alleged that the TSNPDCL field staff concerned disconnected agricultural service connection of the Dalit farmer A Koteswara Rao, 26, at Putanithanda despite the latter's repeated requests to give some time to produce the bill receipt of the customer charges on December 30. "The staff further lodged a police complaint against the farmer by levelling false allegations against him," he charged, alleging that the farmer consumed pesticide at his house on Saturday unable to bear the "vindictive attitude" of the staff towards him and worried over the fate of his chilli crop. He was admitted to the District Headquarters Hospital the same day, where his condition was stated to be serious, Mr Manohar said, demanding that better medicare be provided to the farmer to save his life and stern action be initiated against those "responsible" for his plight. Meanwhile, the sources in the TSNPDCL denied the charges made by the KVPS leaders against the field staff concerned. “The staff disconnected agricultural service connection when the farmer failed to produce the receipt towards payment of the long pending dues of customer charges only and not consumption charges as power supply for agriculture is free,” an official of the TSNPDCL Khammam circle said, alleging that the farmer obstructed the staff from discharging their duties.

04 January 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Going the extra mile to reach the needy||Making ‘friendly policing’ a reality, the police of Sadashivapet near Hyderabad extended a helping hand to the needy. Police, during their regular patrolling in the mandal headquarters town, frequently came across some people living on the road with nobody to look after them. Most of them were found begging and had no roof over them. Recently, a 60-year-old street dweller died of ill health. This moved the police patrolling team and they wanted to bring an end to the woes of these homeless souls in the district. On Saturday, while the police were patrolling in the town and the nearby villages between 9 a.m and 1 p.m., they came across 14 persons begging on the streets. Inquiries by the police revealed that four of them had relatives, but were not looked after properly. The families of these people were counselled and told to take them back and look after them. The remaining 10 elderly were handed over to an orphanage, being run at the government hospital in the district headquarters town. Before sending them, they were given a bath and groomed properly apart from being fed. The initiative was taken by Sadashivapet Circle Inspector N. Sridhar Reddy. “I felt bad about these people when I saw them on the road left unattended shivering in the cold at night. Though we provided them blankets, it was not enough. So, we contacted Manohar, who is running the orphanage at the government hospital. He readily accepted to admit them,” Mr. Sridhar Reddy, a native of Dharmaram village in Veldurthi mandal of Medak district, told The Hindu .

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||State government does a flip-flop over farm laws||The recent decision of State government to wind up crop procurement centres from villages on the ground that the farmers were permitted to sell their produce anywhere in the country under the new farm laws enacted by Centre has raised strong doubts whether the TRS had diluted its tough stand on the laws. It became an open secret that the party was no longer against the new laws after the decision of the government was announced by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. The impact of the u-turn was so much that the government has also called-off one of its flagship initiatives, regulated farming, just after one season of implementation. Giving more clarity on the govt’s changing stand, Minister S. Niranjan Reddy went on to state that there’s nothing wrong in watching “how the new laws help farmers” at least for a couple of seasons. The Opposition Congress, however, did not mince words by observing that the change in TRS stand has taken place of KCR’s Delhi visit.   The three-member Pay Revision Commission has finally submitted its report to the government after 31-month-long detailed exercise, but three days after the submission of the report, information about the fitment and other benefits is hardly forthcoming. This has obviously raised the anxiety levels among the employees who are deliberating on the likely recommendations made by the commission. A section of employees feel that the fitment benefit is likely to be on a par, if not more than the previous commission’s report. The previous PRC recommended close to 30% fitment, but the government had announced 43%. Given the government’s response to the previous edition, employees are confident that they would get handsome pay hike.   Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has announced his determination to resolve the long pending demands of the employees like pay revision, promotions and other aspects. He has constituted a three-member committee of senior IAS officers to examine the matter and submit its recommendations in this regard. But the issue has come in handy for the opposition parties to take on the government. Some parties cited the results of the recent bypoll to Dubbak segment and GHMC polls behind the decision while some others say the CM is trying to woo employees who reportedly distanced themselves from the govt.     Top police brass were exposed to the glare of arc lights while shooting for a documentary which is to be released shortly. The New Year brought in the starry image to them as this production would be beamed into drawing rooms of households. On Saturday, the busy Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar’s office turned into a virtual film studio with constant commands of lights, camera and action which are hurled at crew in shootings. A documentary on cyber crime awareness with youngsters as their target audience was being shot there with the interviews of a few police officers from three commissionerates - Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda. However, the officers were found acting a bit too unnatural as they had to redo the performance in front of cameras. For instance, an officer was seen doing three or four takes for a ‘walk-in’ shot.

Denying these allegations, a senior district official said on Sunday that the import of paddy was banned to protect the interests of local farmers and to prevent profiteering. The official cited the order prohibiting the entry of paddy from other states to Gondia, issued last month by the Food and Civil Supplies Ministry of the Maharashtra government. Hundreds of trucks laden with paddy have been detained at the borders of Gondia district following the order. Rice Millers Association president Ashok Agrawal has alleged that district authorities have misinterpreted the prohibition order, which he said was in the violation of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and against the Ease of Doing Business policy. Mr. Agrawal said, “In districts of Gondia, Bhandara and Gadchiroli, the economy revolves around rice trade as thousands of families are dependent on it. But this wrong action of authorities to prevent the entry of paddy from other States has affected the trade.” He said paddy was being brought for milling and not to avail of any benefit by taking it to State-run procurement centres in Gondia. Mr. Agrawal said if the ban on the entry of vehicles transporting paddy is not lifted, rice millers will find it difficult to repay loans to banks. A representative of rice millers said their association has written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, and party leader Praful Patel seeking lifting of the ban. District Supply Officer Devrao Wankhede said, “We received complaints that paddy was being sold at government procurement centres to get benefit of the MSP, following which we prohibited the import of paddy from other States. Rice millers should ensure that paddy is not taken to these centres. Violators will face action as per law.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rice-millers-in-gondia-district-seek-lifting-of-paddy-import-ban/article33490468.ece

He added that the State government will take all steps to prevent black marketing of the vaccines. He said, “People aged over 60 years and those above 60 years with the existing comorbidies will be the second priority group for vaccination in the State.” Mr. Deshmukh’s remarks came on a day when the Drugs Controller General of India approved the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and the indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive. “The State government has decided to vaccinate health workers, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, on priority along with the police personnel,” Mr. Deshmukh told reporters. “Police will also ensure that there is no blackmarketing of COVID-19 vaccines,” Mr. Deshmukh added.

04 January 2021||Mumbai,||Kangana attacks Urmila on Twitter over new office||Actor-politician Urmila Matondkar on Sunday said she bought a new office with her “hard-earned money” after Kangana Ranaut took a dig at the purchase, linking it with her joining the Shiv Sena. Ms. Matondkar, who had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Mumbai North constituency as a Congress candidate, joined the party led by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, on December 1. Ms. Ranaut took to Twitter and shared a screenshot of a report which claimed Ms. Matondkar bought the office for over Rs. 3 crore, “weeks after joining Shiv Sena”. Ms. Ranaut claimed that Congress, the Sena’s ally in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, is trying to demolish her house and took a potshot at Ms. Matondkar for being “smart” enough to maintain good relations with her former political party. “Dear @UrmilaMatondkar ji, the houses that I built from my hard-earned money are being demolished by Congress. By impressing BJP, I have only gotten 25-30 legal cases against me. I wish I was as smart as you and would’’ve kept Congress happy. How foolish of me, no?” the actor tweeted. Tagging Ms. Ranaut, Ms. Matondkar shared a video on Twitter and asked her to fix up a meeting where she would be present with all documents as fair proof. “It has proof how I bought the flat in 2011 with my own hard-earned money after working for nearly 25-30 years. The document has papers of the sale of the flat in the first of week of March. It also has papers of how I bought the office with that money, which I had earned through my hard work. The flat that I had bought was way before I entered politics,” she said in the video. Ms. Matondkar also took a dig at the Y-plus category security given to Ms. Ranaut “against the money of crores of tax-paying citizens”. In September 2020, Ms. Ranaut was given Y-plus category security by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs amid controversy over her comment in the State that she feared the Mumbai Police. ‘Present proof to NCB’ Ms. Matondkar also asked the actor to present a list of people from the industry, who she had claimed were involved in drugs. “You had promised them [the government] that you have names of several people you wish to give to the Narcotics Control Bureau to fight the drug menace. I request you to please bring that list. I’ll be waiting for your answer,” she added. In September 2020, Ms. Ranaut had called Ms. Matondkar a “soft porn star”, after the Sena leader criticised her claims about nepotism in the industry and Bollywood being riddled with a drug problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/kangana-attacks-urmila-on-twitter-over-new-office/article33490465.ece

04 January 2021||Nagpur,||Hundreds of farmers, students from State leave for Delhi||Hundreds of farmers from various regions of Maharashtra, joined by students and people from various walks of life, on Sunday night left for Delhi from Nagpur to join cultivators who have been protesting at the borders of the national capital for over a month seeking the repeal of farm laws, a Kisan Sabha leader said. He said widows of those farmers who had committed suicide over farm debt and related issues from east Maharashtra and Marathwada regions, have also joined the ‘Chalo Delhi’ march. Earlier in the day, students, youngsters and people from various walks of life hailing from Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Nashik, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar and other districts gathered in Nagpur under the aegis of the Maharashtra Rajya Kisan Sabha. They took out a march in afternoon and a meeting was held at Sanvidhan chowk in the evening. “These farmers and others have left for Delhi in 40-odd vehicles, including buses and four-wheelers,” said Nagpur district secretary of Kisan Sabha Arun Wankar. He said about 800 members of the Maharashtra Rajya Kisan Sabha are also going to Delhi to join the protesting farmers. “We want to support the farmers who are protesting in a peaceful manner against the three anti-farmer laws which were passed in a dictatorial manner by the Central government,” Mr. Wankar said. Savita Jadhav (26), who came from Parbhani district in Marathwada region along with 35 other women, said her farmer husband and her father committed suicide in 2010 and 2017, respectively, over their failure to repay loans taken for farming. “I am going to Delhi to support the cause of farmers. I request the government to rehabilitate the families of those farmers who have committed suicide over loans. I also urge the government to scrap the farm laws in the interest of agriculturists,” she said. Braving the cold, thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month against the three laws. The government has presented these laws as major agriculture sector reforms aimed at helping farmers and increasing their income, but the protesting unions fear that the new legislations will leave them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the minimum support price and mandi systems. Talks deadlocked After the sixth round of formal negotiations on Wednesday, the Central government and farm unions reached some common ground to resolve protesting farmers’ concerns over the rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hundreds-of-farmers-students-from-state-leave-for-delhi/article33490467.ece
04 January 2021||Navi Mumbai,||4 brothers held for murder in Belapur||The Belapur police have arrested four brothers for allegedly killing a man who was in a relationship with one of their wives. The accused have been identified as Nagesh Koli (31), Datta Koli (29), Prasad Koli (27), and Yogesh Koli (23), who resided in Diwale village. The police said the accused abducted Somnath Koli (39), murdered him, and dumped his body near Diwale creek. The police said Mr. Prasad Koli’s wife eloped with Somnath around a month ago. On the night of December 29, Somnath went missing and the next day his brother Devnath Koli approached the police. A case of kidnapping was registered after the police obtained CCTV footage of Somnath being attacked by the four brothers. “The footage showed the four accused chasing Somnath with bamboo sticks. We nabbed three brothers from Diwale village the same day the case was registered,” senior police inspector Anil Patil said. On December 31, Mr. Nagesh Koli was also arrested. The police said the accused confessed to abducting Somnath on December 30 at 10 p.m. and taking him in an autorickshaw to the retibunder at Diwale village. The brothers then assaulted him with bamboo sticks and stones. Later, the accused hid the body beneath a rock near Diwale creek. “Prasad Koli said he was angry because his wife had abandoned him and their five-year-old son,” Mr. Patil said.

04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Police completes COVID vaccination dry run for over 80,000 personnel||The Delhi Police has completed the second dry run to check the best way to vaccinate around 87,000 personnel against COVID-19, a senior officer said on Sunday. The entire process will be done in three phases. Muktesh Chander, the Special Commissioner of Police and nodal officer for the COVID-19 action plan, on December 26 passed an order to Delhi Police to update the cellphone number in the Personal Information System (PIS) on IntraDP system. All the policemen were instructed to update their mobile numbers by January 3, 2021. All district and unit heads were also instructed to ensure completion of the exercise in time so that no one is left out of the vaccination programme. The officer said till now, they have conducted two dry runs in the past one week to find out any loopholes in communication and logistics. Both the dry runs were successful and they managed to approach the entire force, the officer said. A message sent to police personnel had their PIS numbers, names, and mentioned that they will be intimated about the date, time and venue of the vaccination on this mobile. “After the successful completion of the dry run, the police personnel will be informed about the location where they will be vaccinated. In the first phase, the infected personnel will be administered the vaccine, in the second — those above 50 years or with any medical issues will be covered — while in the last phase, the entire force will be vaccinated,” said the officer.

04 January 2021||New Delhi,||‘Decision of armed forces’ doctors on fitness is final’||The Delhi High Court has reiterated that once the doctors of the Armed Forces, who are well aware of the demands of duties of the Forces, have formed an opinion that a candidate is not medically fit for recruitment, opinion of private or other government doctors to the contrary cannot be accepted. A Bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Justice Asha Menon noted that private or other government doctors are “unaware of the demands of duties” in which the recruited personnel are required to work in the Forces. Stringent standards “We have on several occasions observed that the standard of physical fitness for the Armed Forces and the Police Forces is more stringent than for civilian employment,” it said while declining a petition by an aspirant to the post of constable in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs). K.M. Priyanka, after qualifying the written test and the subsequent physical standard test/ physical efficiency test (PST/PET) was called upon for a medical examination. Unfortunately, she was declared medically unfit due to ‘Cubitus Valgus’ a medical deformity in which the forearm is angled away from the body to a greater degree than normal. Ms. Priyanka then approached the specialist orthopaedic surgeon in the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital in Karnataka, who, after conducting a thorough examination, declared her fit, observing that “there is a bit Cubitus Valgus carrying angle < 20° (18°)”. Medically unfit Later, she appeared before the Review Medical Board which again declared her medically unfit for the same reason — “Carrying Angle > 20° Both Side”. Further, in order to assure herself that she was not suffering from any defect, she got herself examined at Aster CMI Hospital, Bangalore. The specialist, D. Akshay Yadav examined her and concluded that the carrying angle was: “right elbow 18°, left elbow 19°”. The HC pointed out that even the specialist consulted by Ms. Priyanka found that she suffered from ‘cubital valgus’. “What may seem as a minor difference in the assessment of the civil doctors in comparison to the assessment of the medical boards, may blow up into a serious health condition during the course of service with the CAPFs,” it said. “The general health of candidates would be permanently impacted due to the stress, both physical and mental,” it remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/decision-of-armed-forces-doctors-on-fitness-is-final/article33490250.ece

04 January 2021||Pune,||Renaming row a ploy to divide Hindus, Muslims, says Prakash Ambedkar||The controversy over renaming Aurangabad to ‘Sambhajinagar’ was a ploy to sow seeds of division between the city’s Hindu and Muslim communities, said Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar on Sunday, hitting out at both the Shiv Sena, which heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi, as well as the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr. Ambedkar said it was Pune which had a fair claim of being renamed after Chhatrapati Sambhaji (son of Chhatrapati Shivaji) as Sambhajinagar, given that the samadhi of the Maratha king, who was tortured and murdered by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1689, was in Vadhu Budruk village in Pune. “What is the need for such religion-based politics? There are about 80% Hindus in this country, so why play politics based on religion?” said the VBA chief, who is the grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. Echoing Babasaheb’s thoughts, Mr. Prakash Ambedkar said disintegration of the country’s social fabric was certain once religion-based politics began to hold sway in the general discourse. “This is exactly what is happening in the country today. The established political parties want to do politics based on caste and religion and are not interested in the politics of development,” he said. A tussle had recently erupted between the Sena and the Congress, both coalition partners in the MVA government, after the latter said it would oppose the renaming of Aurangabad to ‘Sambhajinagar’. The Sena has been mooting the name change of the city for decades with the suggestion first originating from late Sena founder Bal Thackeray. The BJP, while stating that it resolutely stood for the name change, attacked both the Sena and the Congress, accusing the former party (its estranged saffron ally) of raising the issue only before local elections and forgetting it afterwards. Contrarian stand The Ambedkarite Republican Party of India (A) led by Ramdas Athawale stepped into the cauldron of the controversy, with Mr. Athawale remarking that he would oppose the renaming of Aurangabad. Mr. Athawale is a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. The RPI (A) chief’s stance puts him at odds with the BJP’s diametrically opposite view on the contentious matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/renaming-row-a-ploy-to-divide-hindus-muslims-says-prakash-ambedkar/article33490463.ece

04 January 2021||Washington,||11 GOP Senators to oppose Biden win||The U.S. Congress convened its new session on Sunday, kicking off an explosive week in Washington as Republican lawmakers vow to challenge Joe Biden’s election win, pro-Trump protesters gather and voters in Georgia decide who controls the Senate. The rebel push by a group of 12 Senators loyal to President Donald Trump to block formal certification of Mr. Biden’s November victory is all but certain to fail, but has raised tensions on Capitol Hill as lawmakers return to work. In the House of Representatives, top Democrat Nancy Pelosi faces a possibly tricky battle for reelection as Speaker — an office that places her only two heartbeats from the presidency. The 80-year-old Ms. Pelosi’s Democratic Party holds a slim majority in the 435-seat chamber and she is facing no open challenge, but she will need her caucus to remain firm. Then on Monday, Mr. Trump stages one of his big, boisterous rallies in Georgia to campaign for two Republican candidates in a fiercely fought pair of runoff elections that will determine the balance of power in the Senate. Republicans hope he can fuel a surge in in-person voting, but the President —who narrowly lost to Mr. Biden in Georgia — has fanned confusion by tweeting that the races are “illegal and invalid.” The special elections take place on Tuesday, with Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler facing Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Wednesday’s vote to certify the November election results, which Mr. Biden won handily with 306 Electoral College votes to 232 for Mr. Trump, would usually be a dry, pro-forma exercise. Pro-Trump rally But Mr. Trump has infused it with unprecedented drama as he continues to insist, without foundation, that the election was stolen from him, and as scores of Republican lawmakers back his efforts. “An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can’t let it happen!” he tweeted. He has urged thousands of his supporters to come to Washington on Wednesday for protests. Similar past events have led to sporadic violence. Eleven Senators, led by Mr. Cruz, said they will demand the creation of a special commission to conduct an “emergency 10-day audit” of the election results. They join Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who said earlier that he planned to raise objections on Wednesday. Beyond the 12 Senators, more than 100 Trump loyalists in the House have vowed to join the challenge, thereby forcing both houses of Congress to debate the objections raised before confirming Mr. Biden’s victory. With Democrats controlling the House and many Republicans expected to vote to certify Mr. Biden’s election, the bid seems certain to fail. The manoeuvre places Vice-President Mike Pence in an awkward position: law requires him, as presiding officer of the Senate, to tally each state’s votes and announce the result — his boss’s loss. On Saturday, Mr. Pence’s spokesman said he “welcomes” efforts “to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people on Jan. 6th,” though he opposed a legal bid that sought to allow him to invalidate the result. The attention-getting initiative has sharply divided Republicans. Senator Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential candidate, on Saturday dismissed it as “nonsense,” saying: “The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic.” The move represents a clear defiance of powerful Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who has urged members to respect the Electoral College result.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/11-gop-senators-to-oppose-biden-win/article33489974.ece
04 January 2021||Quetta,||11 Shia miners shot dead in Pakistan||Gunmen opened fire on a group of minority Shia Hazara coal miners after abducting them, killing 11 in southwestern Baluchistan province early on Sunday, a Pakistani official said. Moazzam Ali Jatoi, an official with the Levies Force, which serves as police and paramilitary in the area, said the attack took place near the Machh coal field, about 48 km east of the provincial capital Quetta. Mr. Jatoi said armed men took the coal miners to nearby mountains, where they opened fire on them. He said six of the miners were dead on the spot and five who were critically wounded died on the way to a hospital. Mr. Jatoi said an initial investigation revealed the attackers identified the miners as being from a Shia Hazara community and the gunmen took them away for execution, leaving others unharmed. No group immediately claimed responsibility but banned Sunni extremist organisation Lashker-e-Jhangvi(LeJ) has targeted the minority Hazara community in Baluchistan in the past. Sparks protest Police video of the bodies revealed the miners were blindfolded and their hands tied behind their backs before being shot. Local television showed security troops working in a mountainous area to traffic and guide ambulances to the bodies. Security forces were also seen spreading out in the mountains to search for the perpetrators. News of the killings spread quickly among the Hazara community and members took to the streets in Quetta and surrounding areas to protest, blocking highways with burning tires and tree trunks. Officials quickly closed the affected roads to traffic. The violence was largely condemned across the country with Prime Minister Imran Khan saying the perpetrators would be taken to task and the affected families would be taken care of.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/11-shia-miners-shot-dead-in-pakistan/article33489978.ece
04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||China amends defence law to boost war preparedness||China’s President Xi Jinping has signed an order that has amended China’s National Defence Law, giving the Central Military Commission (CMC), which he heads, greater power in mobilising resources to protect a new and broader definition of what constitutes the national interest. The revised regulations on military equipment, which are effective as of January 1, focus on “war preparedness and combat capabilities”, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday, adding that they “define the basic tasks, contents and management mechanisms for military equipment work under the new situation and system.” The document, which State media said comprised 100 stipulations in 14 chapters, follows “the general principle of the CMC exercising overall leadership, theater commands responsible for military operations and the services focusing on developing capabilities.” Draft amendments released last year noted that “when China’s sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity, and security and development interests are under threat, the country can conduct nationwide or local defense mobilisation”. The phrase “development interests” was a new addition to the law, with experts noting this also included the protection of China’s economic activities and assets overseas, such as those under the Belt and Road Initiative, as a reason for defence mobilisation. Expanded scope The amendment broadened the scope of key security fields beyond land borders, maritime and air defence, to include outer space and electromagnetic networks. The amendment also said China “will participate in global security governance, join multilateral security talks and push for and set up a set of international rules that is widely accepted, fair and reasonable”, State media reported. Greater control The amendments, experts said, were also aimed at increasing the control exercised by the CMC and transferring some decision-making previously exercised by the State Council, or Cabinet, that runs the government, to the CMC. The broader goal is to speed up the modernisation plans for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). After Mr. Xi assumed the role of General Secretary of the Communist Party in 2012 and as President the following year, a number of measures have restructured the Party-State apparatus, handing back greater political control to Party bodies that previously had left decision-making to the government machinery. In 2016, Mr. Xi pushed sweeping reforms of the PLA and brought its various departments under more direct control of the CMC, which he heads. Seven military regions were reorganised into five integrated theater commands. The Western Theater Command, the largest, is responsible for the border with India. The revised regulations would push Chinese military development “in two major aspects”, according to Song Zhongping, a military expert in Beijing, who told the Party-run Global Times the amendments would push faster research and development as well as improve management of existing military equipment. Mr. Song said the theater commands would be given a greater role “to provide the direction for the future development of weaponry based on the demand of winning a future war.” The change comes amid a push for closer civil-military fusion, with a target to make the PLA a “world class” military, or on par with the United States military, by 2049, when the People’s Republic of China turns 100. The South China Morning Post reported the amendment underlines the need “to build a nationwide coordination mechanism for the mobilisation of state-owned and private enterprises to take part in research into new defence technologies covering conventional weapons, as well as the non-traditional domains of cybersecurity, space and electromagnetics.” The new moves, the Post said, have “ expanded the power” of the CMC “to mobilise military and civilian resources in defence of the national interest, both at home and abroad” and would also “weaken the role of the State Council” in “formulating military policy” by “handing decision-making powers to the CMC.” “The CMC is now formally in charge of making national defence policy and principles, while the State Council becomes a mere implementing agency to provide support to the military,” Zeng Zhiping, a former PLA colonel who is a military law expert at Soochow University, told the paper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-amends-defence-law-to-boost-war-preparedness/article33489976.ece
04 January 2021||London,||U.K. set for tougher virus restrictions||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday he was “reconciled” to the prospect of tougher restrictions to combat spiralling coronavirus cases, as a row flared over whether schools should reopen. “It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in many parts of the country,” Mr. Johnson told the BBC. “I’m fully, fully reconciled to that.” Highest daily rise Britain recorded 57,725 new cases on Saturday, its highest total of the entire pandemic. Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer urged the Prime Minister to immediately impose national lockdown measures. “It’s no good the Prime Minister hinting that further restrictions are coming into place in a week or two or three,” he said, adding the virus was “clearly out of control”. “So I say bring in those restrictions now, national restrictions in the next 24 hours.” Much of Britain is already under regional lockdown, although primary schools are set to reopen in most of the country when the Christmas holiday ends on Monday. However, around one million four to 11-year-olds will learn remotely after the government announced primary schools in London, where case rates are particularly high, would remain closed. Mr. Johnson told parents elsewhere that they should “absolutely” send their young children to school when term begins. “I understand people’s anxieties but there is no doubt in my mind that schools are safe and that education is a priority. “We’ve really fought very hard throughout this pandemic across the country to keep schools open,” he added. But Jerry Glazier, national executive member of the National Education Union, said on Sunday that “schools are now playing a significant part in the spreading of the infection” and called for them all to be closed for at least two weeks. “Schools are unsafe for the kids and unsafe for the education workers... Many teachers are very anxious about going back into the workplace.” Mr. Johnson said that public health experts had highlighted the long term health and social costs of children being kept out of school.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-set-for-tougher-virus-restrictions/article33489987.ece
04 January 2021||BAGHDAD,||Iraq rally marks 1st anniversary of Soleimani’s killing||Chanting anti-American slogans, thousands of Iraqis converged on a landmark square in central Baghdad on Sunday to commemorate the anniversary of the killing of a powerful Iranian general and a top Iraqi militia leader in a U.S. drone strike. Roads leading to Tahrir Square were closed off and security was tight as the crowds gathered in response to a call by powerful Iran-backed militias for a rally marking the occasion and demanding the expulsion of U.S. troops from Iraq. ‘You killed our guest’ ‘“No, no to America!” shouted some in the largely mask-less crowd. “You killed our guest. There is no place here for your Embassy,” read some of the banners. Protesters at one point set fire to a large U.S. flag, drawing cheers from the crowd. The killing of General Qassim Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad’s airport pushed Tehran and Washington perilously close to all-out conflict and sparked outrage in Iraq, leading Parliament to pass a non-binding resolution days later calling for the expulsion of all foreign troops from Iraq. Sunday’s rally was being held amid heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. in the final days of President Donald Trump’s administration. U.S.-Iran tensions Already, America has conducted B-52 bomber flyovers and sent a nuclear submarine into the Persian Gulf over what Mr. Trump’s officials describe as the possibility of an Iranian attack on the anniversary of the strike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis. Carrying Iraqi and militia flags and posters of the two men, thousands of Iraqis marched toward Tahrir Square for the rally Sunday, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops in implementation of the parliamentary resolution. The event was organized by mostly Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. “We call upon the government and the parliament to expel the occupying foreign forces, especially the brutal American forces, the infidels, the immorals, who killed the heroes and leaders of victory,” said Muhammad Shubr al-Husseini, a protester. Abbas Ali, a 27-year-old protester carrying a poster of Soleimani, said he was there because it was a day “to remember those who sacrificed their souls for Iraq.” Soleimani headed the elite Quds Force of Revolutionary Guard, responsible for Iran’s foreign operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iraq-rally-marks-1st-anniversary-of-soleimanis-killing/article33489982.ece
04 January 2021||London,||‘Scotland must wait a generation for new vote’||Another Scottish independence referendum should not take place for a generation, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday, as Scotland’s leader renewed calls for a fresh vote in the wake of Brexit. “Referendums in my experience, direct experience, in this country are not particularly jolly events,” the Prime Minister told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “They don’t have a notably unifying force in the national mood, they should be only once in a generation.” Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon at the time called it a once-in-a-generation vote, but now argues that Britain’s departure from the European Union, which a majority of Scots opposed, has changed the game. Recent polls have shown consistent support for independence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/scotland-must-wait-a-generation-for-new-vote/article33489986.ece

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Time to resurrect a popular front||“The UPA is dead and it lies buried in a kabristan in Bharuch.” This pithy observation was made by a senior Congressman, though he dare not publicly claim its authorship. The reference was to the last resting place of Ahmed Patel who was generally acknowledged to be the informal ‘convenor’ of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) that ruled India from May 2004 to May 2014. Sooner or later, the polity will need to address the central issue: Is the United Progressive Alliance truly dead and has the time come to put in place a different understanding and arrangement to take on the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). UPA, blunted and a target As a tender of political currency, the UPA is worth as much as a pre-demonetisation two thousand rupee note. Its only notional value is to provide a false sense of exalted importance to Mrs. Sonia Gandhi who remains its titular head. As a working political arrangement, the UPA is a blunted and useless instrument. Yet, the “UPA” remains a convenient shorthand for the amorphous political groups and parties arrayed in opposition to the NDA, even though the grouping has no common theme or purpose. Past loyalties and solidarities are not remembered among the erstwhile UPA partners, but it remains a handy object of abuse and ridicule for the Prime Minister, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its designated abusers. The UPA is dubbed the enemy, an unholy congregation of unprincipled leaders and parties. The BJP gets some purchase because of the Congress’s insistence on preening itself as the centre of the UPA as it happens to be the largest party, even though its paltry kitty of 50 odd seats is not enough for it to demand the Leader of the Opposition status in the Lok Sabha. This claim, in effect, boils down to an expectation on the Congress’s part that its leader, Rahul Gandhi, be acknowledged as the potential ‘shadow’ prime minister, the only national alternative to Narendra Modi. And that remains the rub because all potential partners are painfully aware that the Congress’s feebleness and infirmities have much to do with the whole unresolved question of a Rahul Gandhi leadership. These possible allies concede that the BJP has laughed its way to bigger and bigger Lok Sabha tallies by mocking and ridiculing the Rahul Gandhi pretensions. Nonetheless it is pertinent to keep in mind that, on its part, the NDA, as per the 2019 results, still does not command the majority of popular vote; its combined vote share was nearly 45%, of which the BJP’s contribution was 37.4%; but, now with the departure of the Shiv Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal, the NDA figure stands reduced. The majority can be said to remain firmly immune to the Modi charm. A credible alternative The task before the non-BJP forces and groups will remain about how to cohere in a manner as to present a credible alternative to Mr. Modi’s BJP. But before it can convert itself into an electoral entity, it will need to graft for itself a collective political persona. It should be taken as axiomatic that these last seven years of the Modi raj have, inevitably, produced a new political economy of satisfaction and anger, a new matrix of anxieties and resentments, and a new calculus of fear and triumphalism. The political challenge is how to mobilise the emerging aspirations and unaddressed discontents; how to provide hope and encouragement to those who have been made to feel helpless, powerless, even disenfranchised. These frustrations manifest themselves in a million mutinies, big and small, all over India. Meaningful terms such as “struggles,” “resistance” and “movements” may have disappeared from the mainstream media’s lexicon, but these continue to have a meaning and relevance as unjustness and inequities continue to define our society. The Congress cannot be an honest partner in this venture. Both the Congress and the BJP are parties of status quo and both are unsympathetic to the masses’ yearning for a gentler India. Except for a pro forma different take on the Hindu-Muslim divide, the Congress and the BJP represent the same coin. Platform not Congress-centric A Congress-centric alternative to the BJP no longer works. A new national front is needed: an umbrella platform under which very many forces and individuals may get incentivised to take shelter. The Indian political class is remarkably expedient; a new consortium should enable a Naveen Patnaik to firmly de-wean away from the BJP or offer a way out to Nitish Kumar or, as also to accommodate and tame an Asaduddin Owaisi. Just as there are no permanent enemies, there can be no permanent disenchantment. Maharashtra has shown the extent to which partners and allies can be remulched. A new national ‘front’ will have to anchor itself in a common political purpose and a shared sense of national destiny. A minimum understanding can be forged around four imperatives: first, restoring a balance between the Centre and the States — the Centre has made a mockery of the federal spirit and arrangement; restoring a sense of partnership and participation to the minorities—it is entirely unhealthy that a ruling party of 303 MPs cannot boast of a single Muslim member; restoring the constitutional institutions to their original vitality as a much needed check on arbitrary and absolute power; and, restoring a semblance to sensitivity and civility to our political life — there is too much violence and ugliness against citizens. As a serious endeavour All this is predicated on a premise that the non-Congress, non-BJP platform will not just be a feast of vultures but a serious endeavour in national responsibility and moral seriousness. And such a congregation should be able to hold out an assurance that these leaders are cognisant of the fault lines gnawing the polity; they will need to project a confidence that not only do they have a good idea how these breaches can be plugged but they also have what it will take to ensure that new fault lines do not ensnare the polity. That it can deliver governability and coherence, unity and stability — and, that, it would not push India into uncertainty and anarchy. Too much of strong leadership has robbed India of its democratic exuberance and constitutional dynamism. Come to think of it, there is nothing inevitable about an extravagantly flamboyant Virat Kohli; a quiet, effective Ajinkya Rahane can also deliver.

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||An anti-disclosure amendment that hits public health||The central government recently published the Patent (Amendment) Rules, 2020 (https://bit.ly/3oaJZqZ), amending the format of a statement that patentees and licensees are required to annually submit to the Patent Office disclosing the extent to which they have commercially worked or made the patented inventions available to the public in the country. The amendment has significantly watered down the disclosure format, and this could hamper the effectiveness of India’s compulsory licensing regime which depends on full disclosure of patent working information. This in turn could hinder access to vital inventions including life-saving medicines, thereby impacting public health. Disclosure of information In exchange of a 20-year patent monopoly granted to an inventor, India’s patent law imposes a duty on the patentee to commercially work the invention in India to ensure that its benefits reach the public. In fact, the purpose of granting patents itself is to not only encourage innovation but also ensure that the inventions are worked in India and are made available to the public in sufficient quantity at reasonable prices. A failure of this duty could trigger compulsory licensing (https://bit.ly/3pKKhVI) or even subsequent revocation (https://bit.ly/3nc9Ptj) of the patent under the Patents Act, 1970. Further, courts have refused an interim injunction in cases alleging infringement of a patent which has not been worked in India. Thus, the information on the extent of the working of the invention in India is critical for the effectiveness of these public interest measures provided by law to check abuse of patent monopoly (e.g. excessive pricing or scare supply of the invention). Accordingly, section 146(2), a unique provision not found in patent laws of most other countries (https://bit.ly/34ZOvB5), requires every patentee and licensee to submit to the Patent Office an annual statement explaining the extent to which they have worked the invention in India. The disclosure is to be made in the Form 27 format as prescribed under the Patent Rules, 2003. This statement is meant to help the Patent Office, potential competitors, etc. to determine whether the patentee has worked the invention in India and made it sufficiently available to the public at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, patentees and licensees as well as the Patent Office have blatantly disregarded this statutory requirement. Also, there has been significant pressure from multinational corporations and the United States government to do away with this requirement. The PIL The recent amendment to the form was made pursuant to a PIL (https://bit.ly/3b08Jyt) filed by Shamnad Basheer before the Delhi High Court in 2015. The PIL brought to the Court’s attention the rampant non-filing and defective filing of Form 27 by patentees/licensees and sought a direction to the government to strictly enforce the patent working disclosure rules and take action against the violators. The PIL also called for a reform of Form 27 (https://bit.ly/3pIfkl9), arguing that the information it sought was grossly insufficient to ascertain the extent of the working of the patent. Dilution of disclosure The government acknowledged that the Form 27 format was problematic and provided an undertaking to the court to effect appropriate amendments. The court accordingly disposed of the PIL in 2018 (https://bit.ly/2JJcXiK), directing the government to complete the amendment process within the timelines mentioned in the undertaking. However, in non-compliance of the court’s order, the government published the amended form recently after a delay of almost two years. More importantly, instead of strengthening the form, the amendment has significantly weakened it further, thereby defeating the entire purpose of the amendment exercise. Instead of calling for more elaborate details of the information already sought in the Form as suggested in the PIL, the amended form has removed the requirement of submitting a lot of such important information altogether, thus damaging the core essence of the patent working requirement and the Form 27 format. The form now requires the patentees and licensees to provide only for the following information: whether the patent has been worked or not; if the invention has been worked, the revenue or value accrued in India from manufacturing and importing the invention into India; and if it has not been worked, reasons for the same and the steps being taken towards working. They are no longer required to provide any information in respect of the quantum of the invention manufactured/imported into India, the licenses and sub-licenses granted during the year and the meeting of public requirement at a reasonable price. How will the data on merely the revenue/value accrued from manufacturing/importing the invention enable one to determine the extent to which it has been worked and its public requirement has been met? The most basic data required for this assessment is the quantum or the total units of the invention manufactured/imported in India. It is the disclosure of this data by Bayer in Form 27 that played a crucial role in grant of India’s first compulsory license to Natco for the anti-cancer drug Sorafenib/Nexavar (https://bit.ly/3n8g9lx). The deletion of the requirement of its disclosure is thus shocking and defeats the very purpose of this Form. The removal of the requirement of submitting any licensing information, including the disclosure of even the existence of licenses (instead of seeking further details such as names of licensees/sub-licensees and the broad terms of the licenses as suggested in the PIL), means that the patentees/licensees can just self-certify that they’ve worked the patent without having to support the claim with the data on how they’ve done so, including through licensing/sub-licensing the patent. Further, the omission to mandate disclosure of details such as the price of the invention, its estimated demand, the extent to which the demand has been met, details of any special schemes or steps undertaken by the patentee to satisfy the demand, etc., as recommended in the PIL, makes it extremely difficult to ascertain whether the invention has been made available to the public in sufficient quantity and at an affordable price. Impact on public interest To conclude, the government has significantly weakened the critical duty imposed by the law on patentees/licensees to disclose patent working information, so much so that it has defeated the very purpose of it. The lack of this information could prevent invocation of compulsory licensing and other public interest measures in cases of patent abuse and make certain inventions inaccessible to the public. Such lack of accessibility in case of patented medicines could in turn have adverse consequences for public health of the country. Therefore, the government must reconsider its amendments to the form taking into account the PIL recommendations and re-amend it to restore as well as strengthen its spirit.

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The importance of an otherwise routine vote||While there is little doubt that Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021, the coming week will have major implications not only for the effectiveness of his administration but also for the future direction of U.S. politics and society. At present, Republicans hold 52 seats and the Democrats 48 seats. Therefore, Republicans control the Senate. Unless the Democrats win both the runoff elections in Georgia, this situation will continue. Even winning one seat, which under normal circumstances would be a credible achievement, will not do any good as the Republicans will still have a majority of 51 against 49. Depending on the loyalty Donald Trump commands after January 20th and the political ambitions of the Senate majority leader, Mr. Biden may find it difficult to get even some, if not many, of his appointments ratified by the Senate let alone some of his major legislative bills. Therefore, the first issue of consequence for the Biden administration will be the results of the January 5 Senate by-elections in Georgia. Announcing electoral votes The second issue that will not have any direct impact on the Biden administration but would definitely affect the future course of party politics in U.S. will be on January 6 when the electoral votes are formally announced and tabulated in a Joint Session of Congress. Normally this is a sedate affair lasting less than a couple of hours and hardly attracts any attention. This year, however, it is likely to stretch out over a longer period and is likely to get minute-by-minute TV coverage and commentaries. (But that would not be unusual this election. In normal times, neither the media nor the public even notices the State Electoral College voting. This year, however, there was a day-long minute-by-minute media coverage of this process across all States.) Why is this important this year? This process is a rather routine affair set out in the Electoral Count Act of 1887. It requires the opening and counting of electoral votes from the States — as required by the Twelfth Amendment — to commence at 1:00 p.m. on January 6, with both the Senate and the House of Representatives present in “the Hall of the House of Representatives” and the President of the Senate serving as “their presiding officer”. Making objections It then provides that the opening and counting of each State’s electoral votes will proceed State-by-State in alphabetical order. If there is only one submission of electoral votes from a State, the operation of the statute is acceptably straightforward and comprehensible: this submission must count according to the electoral votes contained therein unless there is an objection to the State’s electoral votes. The Act takes into account a situation where such objections are made. According to the Act, “Upon such reading of any such certificate or paper, the President of the Senate shall call for objections, if any. Every objection shall be made in writing, and shall state clearly and concisely, and without argument, the ground thereof, and shall be signed by at least one Senator and one Member of the House of Representatives before the same shall be received.” In the present instance, already a number of Republican Senators and Congresspersons have made known their support for such objections to be made when the results of some States carried by Mr. Biden are read out and announced. What happens when such objections are made? The Act requires in such case: “When all objections so made to any vote or paper from a State shall have been received and read, the Senate shall thereupon withdraw, and such objections shall be submitted to the Senate for its decision; and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, in like manner, submit such objections to the House of Representatives for its decision.” What happens then? In the present instance where, from all accounts, only one “return” of electoral votes have been submitted for each of the States, the Act provides that“no electoral vote or votes from any State which shall have been regularly given by electors whose appointment has been lawfully certified to according to section 6 of this title from which but one return has been received shall be rejected, but the two Houses concurrently may reject the vote or votes when they agree that such vote or votes have not been so regularly given by electors whose appointment has been so certified.” In plain language, both the Houses must agree separately to uphold the objections and reject the votes. In the present instance, the objections will only be in respect of electoral votes won by Mr. Biden. On January 6th, the Republicans will control the Senate with a majority of 51-48. Theoretically all the Republican Senators can vote to sustain the objection. However, the Democrats, having a strength of 222 members in a full house strength of 435, will control the House of Representatives. The House will, therefore, in all likelihood reject the objections. Since there will, under the circumstances, be no agreement between the two Houses to sustain the objection, it will be rejected and Mr. Biden’s electoral votes will not be disturbed. Therefore, the objections raised by some Republican Senators and Congresspersons are destined to fail. The lack of unanimity will be ascribed to partisan politics. Danger for the Republicans The real danger (to the Republican Party) is, however, that there may be unanimity between both Houses in rejecting the objections. As mentioned earlier, on January 6th there will be 51 Republican Senators and 48 Democrats. If two or more Republican Senators vote with their Democratic colleagues in rejecting the objections, then the Senate, too, would be rejecting the objections. Already according to press reports, a number of Senate Republicans have acknowledged Mr. Biden’s victory, and several — including Senator Susan Collins (Maine), Patrick J. Toomey (Pennsylvania) and Mitt Romney (Utah) — have said that they plan to oppose any challenge to the electoral college vote. In addition, the Republican Senate Majority Whip John Thune isn’t whipping for or against Mr. Trump saying that the GOP leadership is letting members “vote their conscience.” Therefore, those Republican Senators who vote to sustain the objections cannot fall back on the excuse that they were following party directives. They will have to admit that they were either following their “conscience” or Mr. Trump. Both are unlikely to go well in future electoral battles. Therefore, there is a strong possibility that there will be a unanimous rejection of the Republican objections to Mr. Biden’s electoral votes on January 6. It cannot but have some repercussions on the future direction of the Republican Party and U.S. political developments. Dr. G.

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Metaphor for hope||In this first column of 2021, after a year of pandemic-induced hardships, I return to the topic that has been close to my heart for nearly four decades: journalism as a metaphor for hope. From reports on war to investigations that bring out the failures of the various arms of modern nation states, journalism’s focus is often on all the darkness around us but this is aimed at eventually bringing light to our lives. Past, present and future The Canadian media scholar, Herbert Marshall McLuhan, observed: “We look at the present through a rear-view mirror. We march backwards into the future.” His 1964 book, Understanding Media, was written with a perspective that human beings are “shuffling toward the twenty-first century in the shackles of nineteenth century perceptions.” At some level, past was presented both as a burden and Utopia in McLuhan’s analysis. But writer Toni Morrison looked at the rear-view mirror from a different point of view. Her fulcrum was firmly rooted in an egalitarian future — a destination towards which we drive with nearly 25% focus on the rear-view mirror (or the past) and 75% focus on the road called the present. In her brilliant six-part ‘The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures’ at Harvard University, Morrison demonstrated how to be aware of the harshness of the past and the present and work out a way forward. She said: “But for humans as an advanced species, our tendency to separate and judge those not in our clan as the enemy, as the vulnerable and the deficient needing control, has a long history not limited to the animal world or prehistoric man. Race has been a constant arbiter of difference, as have wealth, class, and gender — each of which is about power and the necessity of control.” Her writings and approach give us not only tools to understand the world but also immense hope despite the reality of a very grim past and present. I firmly locate good and responsible journalism within her idea of hope where past excesses are not romanticised. The pain and poignancy of struggle never become roadblocks in our march forward; they tend to become guiding markers instead. In this model, the agency is clearly with the citizens and it never gets transferred to strongmen leaders. Some critics of journalism have asked me over the last few years what the benefits are of the two tracks of journalism: bearing witness and making sense. They argue that journalism focuses on a narrative of gloom that forces many people to avoid news altogether. However, for many, these two tracks contribute to strengthening the agency of citizens as they help them retain their curiosity to know about the happenings around them and cultivate a will for change. Silicon Valley is celebrating ideas like a custom-built news feed, personalisation, and machine learning. Its focus is more on capsuling news and analysis, which are propelled by metrics and analytics. The ideas of ‘echo chambers’ and ‘information silos’ are natural corollaries of this model. At a deeper level, the metrics-driven model looks at the present through a rear-view mirror. It successfully eschews the plurality of views as it focuses excessively on catering to the exclusive needs of an individual or an interest group. Public good It is my earnest view that journalism functions as a conscious breaker of silos. It has an inclusive approach where the focus remains on the idea of a public good. Despite the sway of WhatsApp, which has become the fountain head of disinformation, citizens turned to journalism when it mattered most. A survey by YouGov under its Covid-19 Consumer Monitor programme validated my theory that the ‘public good’ element in journalism will protect the sector from the vagaries of the market. The numbers for India are really encouraging. The important find of the survey was that 76% of the respondents in India said they had watched or read more news lately than they did earlier. This was the highest, followed by Japan, with 61%. The survey, contrary to popular belief, found that even those who are worried about the future opt to consume more news rather than avoid it. Journalism creates a better-informed citizenry, which in turn creates a better collective future. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/metaphor-for-hope/article33489967.ece
04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Don’t ignore the women farmers||Eminent agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan once said, “Some historians believe that it was women who first domesticated crop plants and thereby initiated the art and science of farming. While men went out hunting in search of food, women started gathering seeds from the native flora and began cultivating those of interest from the point of view of food, feed, fodder, fibre and fuel.” A common misconception In India, whenever we talk about agriculture, we think of men as farmers. However, this is far from the truth. According to the agricultural census, 73.2% of rural women are engaged in farming activities but only 12.8% own landholdings. Due to cultural, social and religious forces, women have been denied ownership of land. This stems from the perception that farming is a man’s profession. The India Human Development Survey reports that 83% of agricultural land in the country is inherited by male members of the family and less than 2% by their female counterparts. Thus, women are mostly left without any title of land in their names and are excluded from the definition of farmers. Besides, 81% of women agricultural labourers belong to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, so they also contribute to the largest share of casual and landless labourers. The government too turns a blind eye to their problem of non-recognition and conveniently labels them as ‘cultivators’ or ‘agricultural labourers’ but not ‘farmers’. Without any recognition, women are systematically excluded from all the benefits of government schemes. Moreover, they are not guaranteed the rights which they would otherwise be given if they were recognised as farmers, such as loans for cultivation, loan waivers, crop insurance, subsidies or even compensation to their families in cases where they commit suicide. Non-recognition as farmers is only one of their problems. As the Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch (MAKAAM) notes, they have unequal access to rights over land, water and forests. There is gendered access to support systems such as storage facilities, transportation costs, and cash for new investments or for paying off old dues or for other services related to agricultural credit. There is also gendered access to inputs and markets. Thus, despite their large contribution to the sector, women farmers have been reduced to a marginal section, vulnerable to exploitation. The farm laws Now they have a new worry: the farm laws. Since the government’s policies never aimed to reduce disparity or alleviate their distress, women farmers fear that the farm laws will further deepen gender inequality in the sector. MAKAAM, in its statement, has highlighted several issues with the laws. The first is the lack of any mention of MSP (minimum support price) that protects farmers from exploitation. It also highlights how women are barely in a position as empowered agents who can either understand or negotiate (written) agreements with traders and corporate entities who are seeking to enter into agreements with the farmers to purchase their produce or for other services. It is clear that farmers will have no bargaining power in the corporatisatisation of agriculture, where corporates will decide the price with no safety net or adequate redressal mechanism for the farmers. Consequently, the small marginal and medium farmers will be forced to sell their land to big agro-businesses and become wage labourers. But while this struggle rages on, we must not forget the troubles of our women farmers. Perhaps that is why they are at the front line of this protest — to remind us that they are too are farmers and have an equal stake in this fight. T.

04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A hurried gamble||The stage is set for the biggest vaccine rollout in India’s history with the Drugs Controller General of India formally approving two vaccines for restricted use under emergency conditions: Covishield by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin by Bharat Biotech. Though other vaccine candidates are in the fray too, these two set a precedent for how future COVID-19 vaccines will be evaluated and administered. India has been long known as a manufacturer of vaccines but less so as one that can develop from scratch, test and then provide it to the world. The pandemic offers an unprecedented opportunity to establish those credentials, but already a key step — of establishing the vaccine’s efficacy in the Indian population before rollout — has been side-stepped. A double-blinded phase-3 trial — where some volunteers get the vaccine and some do not and the rate of disease in both arms is compared to determine the vaccine’s ability — is among the foundations of evidence-based medicine. The SII because of its agreement with AstraZeneca has furnished data from a phase-3 trial in the U.K. and Brazil, but nothing publicly on how protective the vaccine was in 1,600 Indian volunteers. All of the leading vaccine candidates — Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca itself — made public at least partial results of the vaccine’s abilities in their own populations before these were given a go-ahead by the respective regulators. Bharat Biotech, which is conducting such a phase-3 trial in India, is yet to furnish similar data because it has not been able to finish recruiting the required number of volunteers. The Indian data furnished by the companies only attest to the vaccine’s safety and its evoking some immune response. However, this pandemic has revealed multiple instances of therapies and interventions — from convalescent plasma therapy to a slew of antivirals — that seemed to work well under idealised lab conditions but did not measurably protect in real-world hospital conditions. The concern from approving an untested vaccine is that it makes it nearly impossible to conduct a proper phase-3 trial. It will be unethical to expect volunteers to participate in a trial where there is only a 50% chance of being administered the actual vaccine, when they have the option of the real dose elsewhere. Both SII and Bharat Biotech, given the pace of recruitment and potential pool of volunteers, would have been able to generate much more data within mere weeks. So, it is hard to imagine why an emergency use authorisation of these vaccines was hurried through. Opacity marks the government’s communication strategy in a country where distrust of vaccines remains in spite of years of vaccination programmes and elimination of grave diseases. The government neglects this at the country’s peril.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-hurried-gamble/article33489955.ece
04 January 2021||January 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A tortuous recovery||For a fiscally strapped government, scrambling to arrest the economy’s recessionary decline, the GST collections in the last month of 2020, of over Rs. 1.15-lakh crore, come as welcome tidings. With revenue receipts at just 40% of the Budget target in the first eight months of 2020-21, the government would hope that December’s indirect tax inflow, the highest since the indirect tax regime’s launch in July 2017, shall sustain over the last quarter of the year. GST inflows have now stayed above Rs. 1-lakh crore for three months in a row, averaging Rs. 1.05-lakh crore through October and November, before the December spike. After two quarters of a sharp shrinkage in the economy following the COVID-19 lockdown last March, this also infuses hope that the third quarter might see India’s headline growth rate resurfacing from subterranean depths. The Finance Ministry has stressed that the 12% year-on-year buoyancy in GST’s December kitty, the highest growth rate recorded in 21 months, reflects ‘rapid post-pandemic economic recovery’, bolstered by improvements in compliance following a recent crackdown on indirect tax evaders. It is important to discern how much of an impact stricter oversight and better compliance had on these revenues so as to distil what came from normal economic activity in November, which is what December revenues largely account for. Moreover, November included the fag end of India’s festive season so the numbers may moderate in the months to come, even though growth rates may stay high due to a low base effect as it gets close to a year after the lockdown. But new GST rules, effective January 1, are expected to tighten GST compliance further so that part of the revenue booster should persist. Second, the GST on imports grew a robust 27% in November, even though overall merchandise imports contracted 13.33%. With December recording a 7.6% surge in imports, growing for the first time since February 2020, GST on imports should rise further in the coming month. Similarly, car sales surged for the fifth month in a row in December, which should not only boost the GST receipts in January but also bring in precious compensation cess. Whatever trajectory revenues take from here, pain points persist and some key niggling issues seem to be aggravating further. Core sectors recorded yet another contraction in November, with cement and steel slipping back after a minor uptick. New investments in the October to December 2020 quarter declined a whopping 88% from a year ago, as per the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Employment levels declined significantly in October, followed by almost 35 lakh job losses in November and continue to deteriorate through December, CMIE reckons. The Centre needs to address some of these challenges — in the coming Union Budget or outside — to recover lost ground faster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tortuous-recovery/article33489956.ece

The Government, it is alleged, are disappointed that the leaders of Sinn Fein offered no more effective guarantee than a mere truce. Granted a genuine desire for conciliation, this degree of stiffness on the part of Sinn Fein should not be such a violent disturber; the Government, it is open to guess, is still on the resolve that there is no parleying with Sinn Fein except as between master and servant. The glimmerings of a change of heart, which we seemed to discover a few days ago, have vanished. In spite of the Home Rule Bill, the suspicion is forced that the Georgian Cabinet finds the more effective panacea in terrorism. The policy of reprisals, upon which the Government embarked some months ago in defiance of all enlightened advice and warning, is being worked with an intensiveness suggestive of desperate agony rather than of ordered government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/irelands-agony-from-an-editorial/article33489963.ece

The crime was witnessed by the other patients in the ward who could not resist the intruders. Dr. T.L. Narasimha Rao, Superintendent of the Hospital said the incident occurred in the ward when the Medical Officer on duty, the staff nurse and the ward boy were assisting the surgeon in the operation theatre. The Medical Officer, on hearing cries for help from patients, rushed to the ward from the operation theatre and saw Thavva Chinna Subbi Reddi lying in a pool of blood on the ground. He saw three persons armed with deadly weapons walking out of the ward and the hospital staff on duty could do nothing to seize them. The Superintendent said he informed the Cuddapah Town Police immediately about the incident. He also requested the Superintendent of Police to post a regular armed guard at the hospital. In the year 1968 a stabbing incident occurred near the out-patient ward of the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/patient-murdered-in-hospital/article33489964.ece

The procedures and income tax formalities are fairly simple. As for insurance, policy proceeds will be paid in the name of the policyholders in Indian currency into an Indian bank account, regardless of their current nationality. For this, please ensure insurance firms are provided with KYC and details of a compliant bank account even before the claim date. The claim documents are something that your insurance company or its intermediaries would be able to help you with.  (K.

04 January 2021||Sydney,||India wants to give Brisbane a miss||The Australia-India Test series schedule seemed to be under threat on Sunday following reports that the tourists were unhappy at the prospect of re-entering strict quarantine for the fourth Test in Brisbane. The third Test in the four-match series is slated to start at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday after Cricket Australia decided not to move the match despite an outbreak of COVID-19 cases. Border closed On Monday, both squads will fly to New South Wales, which reported eight new locally transmitted cases on Sunday. Queensland has closed its border with New South Wales and although agreement has been reached to allow the players to fly to Brisbane for the fourth Test on January 15, they will have to quarantine having been in Sydney. "No different from anyone else, if they are coming from a declared hotspot they will have to quarantine," Queensland Chief Health Officer Dr. Jeannette Young said on Sunday. Reports in the Australian media, citing sources within the touring party, said Indian players, many of whom have been in some form of quarantine or other for six months, would refuse to travel if they were going to be subjected to a hard lockdown. The Indians underwent 14 days of strict quarantine on arrival in Australia but have since enjoyed more freedom while preparing for and playing matches in Adelaide, Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. There are still some restrictions, however, and five Indian players were placed in isolation on Saturday after a video surfaced showing them eating inside a Melbourne restaurant on New Year's Day. The Australian and Indian cricket boards are investigating the alleged breach of biosecurity protocols. Travelling together  PTI reports from New Delhi  Meanwhile it is learnt, the Indian squad, including the five players in precautionary isolation, will travel on the same chartered flight to Sydney. Vice-captain Rohit Sharma, opener Shubman Gill, stumper Rishabh Pant, pacer Navdeep Saini and batsman Prithvi Shaw, who are in “isolation”, have not been barred from travelling with the team. The CA statement never said it was a breach, said a senior BCCI official. “They were seeking to determine if it's a breach. So there is no restriction on these five players travelling with the team to Sydney. The entire team is flying tomorrow afternoon," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-wants-to-give-brisbane-a-miss/article33490076.ece

An angioplasty was performed on him later in the evening. Hospital sources said that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi called and spoke to Ganguly. Prominent personalities, including politicians, visited the hospital to inquire about his health. Uneventful night Rupali Basu, MD and CEO said of Woodlands Hospital, said that Ganguly had an “uneventful last night”. She said that Ganguly’s blood pressure and other parameters were normal. “It was an emergency. It is over now. He got treatment at the right time and is stable,” Asish Patra, one of the doctors treating him, said. A statement by the hospital said Ganguly has tested negative for COVID-19.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Wade said, “The schedule has been rolled out and, we will prefer to stick to that. I would expect to go to the Gabba regardless, even if that is more of a quarantine-based hotel-to-ground (situation). We fully expect to be going to Brisbane to play the Gabba Test.” Wade said his team was ready for any restrictions the local government in Queensland would ask of them. “If that is what the government is going to make us do to play a game at the Gabba, we are willing to sacrifice. “I knew coming into it, and, a lot of other players knew coming into it, it wasn’t going to be an ideal situation. “If something went south, we were going to have to make some more sacrifices along the way. As a group, we understand that and, we are ready for the challenge,” he said. Record The Australians have good reason to want to stick to playing at the Gabba, considering the hosts have not lost a Test there since 1988, to the West Indies. “There is no secret that we like starting our summer there. Our record is very good there and, we tend to play good cricket there,” Wade said. “India has a great bowling line-up and a great team. So we won’t take them for granted when we get there. But if it went two games back-to-back at the SCG, it would not be something we would want to do. We will be much more comfortable playing the schedule. There is no secret we love the Gabba and, we want to get there,” he added.

04 January 2021||London,||Arsenal runs riot||A rare Kieran Tierney goal, a superb team effort finished by Bukayo Saka and a brace from Alexandre Lacazette gave Arsenal its third Premier League win in a row as it beat West Bromwich Albion 4-0 in snowy conditions on Saturday. Fullback Tierney cut in from the left and curled home his second goal for Arsenal in the 23rd minute, then Saka combined brilliantly with Lacazette and Emile Smith-Rowe before tapping home a simple second for the visitors five minutes later. West Brom had an early second-half strike ruled out for offside before Lacazette blasted two goals in five second-half minutes as the Baggies’ woeful defence, which with 39 goals conceded is the leakiest in the league, fell apart once again.

04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Time to test the shooters in competition’||The Indian shooters have been preparing away from the glare of the media, diligently following COVID-19 protocols. After two stints of training at the Dr. Karni Singh Range in recent months, the cream of Indian shooters will be joined by a larger bunch for the ensuing selection trials. Perfect timing “I was very happy with the training camps. The timing was perfect, in terms of getting the Olympic team back on track. Now, the trials are also timed well to kick start the national activities. It is time to test the shooters in competition,” said the high performance coach for rifle, Deepali Deshpande. Quite forthright, Deepali stressed that it was important to keep the shooters on their toes. “We must have coaching camps and competitions at regular intervals till the Olympic Games,” she said. The first World Cup for rifle, pistol and shotgun is scheduled to be staged at the Dr. Karni Singh Range from March 18. The Olympic quota winners will be fielded in the World Cup, irrespective of their national rank, while the rest will earn their berth on the basis of rank. Four sets of trials, two each in January and February, will give a clear indication of where the shooters stand in terms of being able to match world standards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/time-to-test-the-shooters-in-competition/article33490099.ece
04 January 2021||KOCHI,||Masters Royal Centurion wins maiden Pooja crown||For the last couple of months, the Tripunithura Cricket Club here was caught in a dilemma. The club organises the annual Pooja tournament, one of the oldest limited-over cricket tournaments, and its members were worried how they would hold the event this time in the times of the coronavirus pandemic. The Pooja all-India tournament also marked a landmark year, 70th, this time and the members did not want to cancel the event. So, they held a miniature tournament, with just six teams — all from Ernakulam District — and made it a six-day affair. And Masters Royal Centurion Cricket Academy, a club formed just three years ago, won its maiden Pooja trophy defeating host Tripunithura CC ‘B’ by four wickets in the final.  The scores: Tripunithura CC ‘B’ 165/9 in 45 overs (Abdul Basith 88, Asok Menon 25) lost to Masters Royal Centurion CA 166/6 in 35.4 overs (Arun Paulose 73, Atul Diamond 32). MoM: Abdul Basith.

Pakistan was anchored by a sterling 93 from Azhar Ali. Jamieson returned five for 69, the third five-wicket haul in his sixth Test. New Zealand won the toss and bowled first on the green strip and as Jamieson found bounce and movement to claim wickets at one end, Azhar was defiant at the other, saying he enjoyed his battle with the 6ft 8in New Zealander. In a destructive three-over burst before lunch, Jamieson removed Abid Ali (25), Haris Sohail (one) and Fawad Alam (two).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jamiesons-five-for-blunts-azhars-93/article33490077.ece

04 January 2021||Los Angeles,||Wall steps up again for Rockets||John Wall delivered a game-high 28 points as Houston Rockets won a second straight game over Sacramento Kings 102-94, despite playing without NBA All-Star James Harden. Eric Gordon replaced Harden and scored 21 points, while Christian Wood finished with 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Rockets, who also beat the Kings 122-119 on New Year's Eve. Harden was a late scratch on Saturday, ostensibly because of a sore ankle, although he has not been placed on the injury list. Without Harden, Wall carried the offensive load for the Rockets. He had missed their first two games of the new season because of COVID restrictions and was out all of last season because of injuries.  In Philadelphia, Ben Simmons had a triple-double, and Joel Embiid tallied 19 points and 14 rebounds as Philadelphia 76ers dominated Charlotte Hornets 127-112.  The results: Houston Rockets bt Sacramento Kings 102-94; Indiana Pacers lost to New York Knicks 106-102; New Orleans Pelicans bt Toronto Raptors 120-116; Orlando Magic lost to Oklahoma City Thunder 108-99; Philadelphia 76ers bt Charlotte Hornets 127-112; Atlanta Hawks lost to Cleveland Cavaliers 96-91.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wall-steps-up-again-for-rockets/article33490087.ece

Under Rahane, India made a remarkable comeback in Melbourne after a humiliating loss in the first Test in Adelaide, winning by eight wickets. Rahane is stand-in for regular skipper Virat Kohli, who is on paternity leave. “It was no surprise that Ajinkya Rahane captained India flawlessly at the MCG.

04 January 2021||New Delhi,||Getting back on track||Since the resumption of metro services in September, post lockdown, the Delhi Metro saw a ridership of 3.29 lakh (11%) as compared to the 29.66 lakh same month last year, according to data provided by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in response to an RTI query filed by The Hindu . The metro services in the national capital had remained suspended since March 22 after the pandemic outbreak. But five months later, on September 7, passenger operations resumed, following a nod from the Centre. Metro services had resumed in a graded manner with staggered timings and it took around a week to make the nearly 400 kilometre-long network to become fully operational. In September last year, the average daily ridership on the network was 29.66 lakh with a line utilisation of 53.49 lakh, which was also highest for the year 2019. According to the DMRC, line utilisation indicates the number of passengers who travel on a particular line or a portion of that line during their overall journey across the metro network. Marginal increase  Data provided by the DMRC showed that over the next two months post lockdown, the average daily ridership on the network in November this year rose to 22% of the highest ridership of last year. The figures for November last year, however, were 28.55 lakh with a line utilisation of 52.77 lakh. The network, excluding the Airport Express Line and Rapid Metro Gurugram, saw an average daily ridership of 6.64 lakh in November this year with a line utilisation of 13.24 lakh. The lowest average daily ridership recorded by the DMRC in 2019, was in March when it recorded a line utilisation of 45.82% with a ridership of 25.38 lakh. However, this year before the lockdown was announced, the Delhi Metro saw a daily average ridership of 22.01 lakh. The corresponding line utilisation figures up to March 21 were recorded to be 42.15 lakh. Before the pandemic hit, the first two months of the year had recorded a daily average of 28.97 lakh and 29.10 lakh respectively. The corresponding line utilisation figures had been 56.61 and 56.06 lakh. According to an internal note of the DMRC dated December 21, for the 2019-20 period, an operational ratio of 80.55% was recorded, which facilitated the public transporter to meet the daily expenditure. However, post lockdown and suspension of operations, the traffic earnings had reduced to “nil.” “Even after reopening of the metro system, due to several restrictions and fear in public, the ridership is very low and consequently the revenues are also very low. In the last eight months the DMRC has earned only Rs. 247.65 crore whereas expenditure was Rs. 2208.24 core [approximately] including JICA loan and their interest payment due during this period,” the note read. Safety measures  Following resumption of services, the DMRC had also issued a detailed guideline to ensure compliance of COVID-19 norms that included mandatory social distancing in terms of seating, restricted number of commuters inside stations, wearing masks throughout the journey and so on and so forth. The public transporter had also introduced flying squads to ensure compliance of the guidelines and had said that violators would be penalised. Among other offences, fines collected for spitting inside the premises, which was also an offence earlier, saw around 1.82% of commuters being fined in the month of September soon after resumption of services. However, in the subsequent months, the number declined and the DMRC collected a fine of Rs. 5,200 and Rs. 5,400 in October and November this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/getting-back-on-track/article33490273.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||A show of kabaddi skills at Singhu border for protesting farmers||An all-woman bunch of professional kabaddi players, including some national and state-level athletes, on Sunday, organised a kabaddi tournament at Singhu border, the site of farmers’ protest. Most of these players are from farmer families of Punjab and Haryana and they had converged at the site to express solidarity with the protesters. A total of 12 teams participated in the tournament, which started around 11 a.m. The first match was organised between Sonipat and Fazilka and a team from Jind district in Haryana won the tournament. Sukhwinder Singh (55), joint secretary of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, Punjab, from Tarn Taran district of Punjab said that the teams participate in the tournament on their own. “Teams from different States came forward and said they wanted to organise a kabaddi tournament. We have planned to do different activities every day for the entertainment of people here at Singhu border,” Mr. Singh said. Prizes The winning team will get Rs. 2,100 and the runner-up Rs. 1,100. The prizes have been announced by people who have donated the amount, he said. “Most of the kabbadi players or wrestlers belong to farmers’ families. In villages, sports are mainly supported by farmers who keep organising tournaments. So, these people get to showcase their talent at the international level. It is now their turn to stand with the farmers,” said Kavita Kumari, a player.  Jagbir Singh from Jind district of Haryana, who was the head coach of the tournament, said that a majority of the players here are college students and they volunteered to participate. “Teams from Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have participated in the tournament. They all have come here to support the farmers. There are also some national and international players who participated in the match,” he said. Ritika Dalal, a second-year student, said, “I have played at state and national level from Delhi. The match was good. We could not, however, win it and make it to another round.” The matches were played on the temporarily turf. Narender Kumar, a kabaddi coach from Rohtak, said: “I received a message on Whatsapp yesterday [Saturday] regarding the matches. It was mentioned that the only girls will play, following which I took my team of 10 girls, including my twin daughters, and reached here this morning. It is a knock-out tournament and you have to win each and every match. My team lost by two points but they performed really well.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/a-show-of-kabaddi-skills-at-singhu-border-for-protesting-farmers/article33490275.ece
04 January 2021||LAMBA (JODHPUR),||Bilara villagers mobilise to tackle menace of addiction||Reeling under the drug menace for several years, people in a few villages of Jodhpur district’s Bilara block have come together to tackle addiction among the youth. Along with the boycott of persons consuming liquor, tobacco and narcotics, villagers have decided to impose a penalty on the sellers and buyers of these substances. A unique campaign has been launched in the villages as a social reform exercise to create a situation where there is no demand for illicit drugs. Though the COVID-19 lockdown affected the supply chain of drugs earlier this year, narcotic substances became freely available again after the restrictions were eased. Villagers in Lamba, situated 19 km from the Block headquarters, held a meeting at the village square last month and announced fines ranging between Rs. 2,100 and Rs. 11,000 after a unanimous decision. “We are concerned not just about addiction. The repercussion of an increase in the crime rate warranted urgent action,” Sarpanch Ghewar Ram Bishnoi told The Hindu . As part of the penalties, individuals found selling heroin will be required to pay Rs. 11,000, while those consuming the substance will pay a fine of Rs. 5,100. A fine of Rs. 11,000 will be imposed on sellers of liquor and Rs. 2,100 on those drinking liquor. The Bishnoi-dominated village with a population of 6,000 is also concerned about the increasing consumption of tobacco and gutka . Mr. Bishnoi said a separate penalty of Rs. 1,100 and Rs. 501 was also proposed for those selling and buying gutka , cigarette and beedi within the community. The meeting was attended, among others, by panchayat members and village elders. Ripple effect The initiative taken in Lamba has had a ripple effect in the villages of the Bilara block. The people in the villages such as Bhavi, Hariyada, Jetiwas, Hapat and Jelwa have supported the move and asked their panchayat representatives to formally take a similar decision. The mobilisation of villagers in support of de-addiction has encouraged them to voluntarily abstain from the consumption of narcotic substances. “Since the announcement of penalties, there has not been a single instance of the fine actually being imposed. Lamba is set to become a model village in healthy lifestyle,” Bhuta Ram Bawri, 45, a farmer in the village, said. Bhairon Singh Prajapat, a shop owner in Bhavi, said he has stopped selling tobacco pouches and cigarettes since he came to know of the collective decision in Lamba. Addiction among youngsters was a major reason for rising crimes, illiteracy and backwardness of rural areas in this part of western Rajasthan, he said. The Bilara Panchayat Samiti is also planning to start a counselling service for helping out youth willing to quit drug addiction. De-addiction camps to be organised in association with voluntary groups will highlight the impact of narcotics on the health of young people and the financial condition of their families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bilara-villagers-mobilise-to-tackle-menace-of-addiction/article33490266.ece
04 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Heavy rain, cold fail to dampen spirit of farmers||The unseasonal rainfall over the past couple of days failed to deter spirits of protesting farmers despite the material damage it caused and the weather severity it induced. Farmers said that the water ruined the firewood and blankets that were their only guard against the cold and even spoilt food kept with them. Fumigation drive Volunteers from Mohali district of Punjab held fumigation drive at Singhu border to protect protesters from water-borne diseases. “The rain has caused a lot of damage at the protest site. They have no place to sleep as their tents are waterlogged and they have nothing to wrap themselves in this biting cold as their blankets are wet. They are specially focusing on health and other logistics for aged protesters who are more prone to fall sick,” said Kuldeep Singh, a protester. Another protester said that he waters his crops at his farms in Punjab when the temperature is around one degree Celsius. He said the cold in Delhi is nothing compared to the harsh weather in which farmers work and survive across the country and that one should come and see how farmers are braving the cold. “The weather will not dampen the spirit of farmers who have been protesting for over a month now. We will bear it. The government is not taking us seriously, but we will not leave the site until our demands are met,” said Harvinder Singh, a protester. Protesters claimed they also tried contacting the local municipal body for clearing the drains as they entire area was waterlogged, but they did not receive any response. Unflinching spirit “The protest will continue and we will not back off. People from Delhi and other States have come to their support. We will die but will not go back until the farms laws are withdrawn. We have made arrangements for tea and wood to keep the protest site warm for everyone,” said Amandeep Singh, a protester. Maninder Singh, an associate professor at a university in Punjab, said, “In view of the ongoing pandemic situation and due to the rain, we have decided to spray pesticides to maintain hygiene.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/heavy-rain-cold-fail-to-dampen-spirits-of-farmers/article33490277.ece
04 January 2021||New Delhi,||Submit timeline for declaration of results, Delhi University told||The Delhi High Court has ordered the Delhi University (DU) to submit a timeline for declaration of results, issuance of mark sheets and holding convocation on an annual basis for students. Justice M. Prathiba Singh gave the direction to make sure that the students are not inconvenienced every semester and are not forced to approach the court for obtaining their transcripts, mark sheets and degree certificates, as was done in this case. “This court is of the opinion that in order to ensure that there is a comprehensive, streamlined procedure for declaration of results, issuance of transcripts, mark sheets and degree certificates, etc., DU ought to have a prescribed timeline… ,” the court said. ‘Unsatisfactory affidavit’ It also remarked that the previous affidavit submitted by the university was not satisfactory as it did not contain any specific timelines for the issuance of digital degree certificates and for transmission of data to Digilocker. “The affidavit is quite cryptic,” the High Court remarked. It asked the university to provide a timeline for declaration of results after conclusion of the last exam in a particular semester for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. It also asked for timeline for issuance of mark sheets/ transcripts or making them available online after the results. The court further asked it to provide the timeline for issuance of digital transcripts for such students who may require the same for further education or for employment and for transmission of data relating to mark sheets/ transcripts to Digilocker after the same has been announced by DU. The High Court asked the university to submit its affidavit before the next date of hearing on February 17. It was hearing a bunch of petitions by former DU students seeking direction for issuance of degree certificates on an urgent basis to enable them to pursue higher education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/submit-timeline-for-declaration-of-results-delhi-university-told/article33490278.ece

04 January 2021||guwahati,||BJP to change ally in poll-bound Assam||Old political alliances are being overhauled and new ones are being forged in poll-bound Assam. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to replace the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), one of its two regional allies, with the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), in areas under the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) for the upcoming Assembly elections. The State BJP confirmed the change of allies around the time the newly-formed Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal found a common ground — opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act — to get closer to a pre-poll tie-up. The AJP evolved from the same student organisations as the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), the BJP’s other regional ally, 35 years apart. “After forming the government in the Bodoland Territorial Council, the BJP and the UPPL will contest the ensuing Assembly elections in the BTR,” Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who also holds the Health portfolio, said at a function held in Kokrajhar district, the headquarters of BTR.  ‘Massive corruption’ BTR straddles 12 of Assam’s 126 Assembly constituencies. Dr. Sarma said massive corruption by the Hagrama Mohilary-led BPF, which ruled the council until its dissolution in April 2020, was the primary reason for the BJP opting for an electoral alliance with the UPPL. The BPF has three Ministers in the BJP-led alliance government. A few key BPF leaders, including former Rajya Sabha member Biswajit Daimary and MLA Emmanuel Mushahary, joined the BJP a few weeks ago. AJP president Lurinjyoti Gogoi on Sunday ruled out the possibility of his party forging a pre-poll alliance with the Congress but said a tie-up with the Raijor Dal was likely by the Magh Bihu festival that would be held in mid-January. Union Home Minister Amit Shah at a rally in Guwahati last month indicated that the Congress was propping up the AJP in a bid to eat into the votes of the BJP in Assam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-to-change-ally-in-poll-bound-assam/article33490269.ece
