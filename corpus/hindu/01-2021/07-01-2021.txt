07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC to study anti-conversion laws of Uttarakhand and U.P.||The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine the constitutional validity of laws enacted by States, such as Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, that criminalise religious conversion via marriage and mandate prior official clearance before marrying into another faith. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, however, did not stay the implementation of the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018, despite fervent pleas by petitioners that “rampaging mobs are lifting off people in the middle of wedding ceremonies,” buoyed by the enactment of the laws. ‘Horrifying move’ “What we have here is multiple States like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh enacting these laws which are absolutely horrifying. They require prior permission to marry,” senior advocate C.U. Singh submitted. Mr. Singh argued that the burden of proof was on those who married to show they were not doing so to get converted. “Those who are found guilty under these laws stare at a 10-year prison sentence. The offences are non-bailable. We are getting reports that people are being picked up in the middle of weddings on suspicion of religious conversion,” he said. However, the Bench, which asked the petitioners to go to the respective State High Courts with their challenge, did not stay the implementation of the laws. “This is the problem. We have already issued notice. You have come here under Article 32 of the Constitution...” Chief Justice Bobde said and resisted the plea for stay. Mr. Singh said the laws concerned violation of the fundamental rights of dignity and liberty enshrined under Article 21. They had been enacted despite a series of judgments by the Supreme Court, including in the Hadiya case, that right to marry a person of one’s choice was part of an adult’s privacy. “Under the laws, a person marrying into another faith should give a month’s prior notice to the authorities. There will be an inquiry. The provisions are oppressive,” he argued. Hearing soon The court fixed a hearing in four weeks. The petition filed by advocates Vishal Thakre and A.S. Yadav and researcher Pranvesh, who were represented by advocates Sanjeev Malhotra and Pradeep Kumar Yadav, said the laws were against public policy and society at large. Grave injustice: petition “These laws will create fear in society and become a potent tool in the hands of bad elements to falsely implicate anyone. A grave injustice will be done by the ordinances... They will create a chaotic situation,” it said. A series of Supreme Court verdicts underline that the choice of a life partner, whether by marriage or outside it, was part of an individual’s “personhood and identity”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-to-study-anti-conversion-laws-of-uttarakhand-and-up/article33515629.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||R-Day security meet factors in farm stir||The farmers’ protest took centre stage at a meeting between the Delhi police and the Defence Ministry on Wednesday to discuss arrangements for the Republic Day parade. A senior police officer said the meeting was called to discuss security arrangements for the parade. The Delhi police take care of the outer ring of security. The discussion was over visitors entering enclosures. To prevent any disruption by farmers protesting at the Delhi borders, adequate security measures will be put in place. “During the meeting, a discussion was held on whether visitors with only Delhi ID proofs be allowed or it should be open to all. Several suggestions were made by the officers but the final call will be taken after the next meeting,” the officer said. ID proof necessary As per the guidelines, the visitors have to show their ID proof to get ticket for the parade and they have to keep their ID with them while getting entry to the enclosures on January 26. Due to COVID-19, there will be only 25,000 visitors to witness the parade compared with over one lakh usually. Children under the age of 15 will not be allowed. Another police officer said there were intelligence inputs that protesters might attempt to disrupt the parade. The intelligence wing is also keeping a watch on protests going on in the city. There will be more than 40,000 security personnel in the New Delhi area during the parade. Last year, there were strict instructions to security personnel to frisk visitors when there were anti-CAA protests across the country. The visitors were asked to open their jackets by the security officers to ensure that they were not wearing anything with anti-CAA slogans written on them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/r-day-security-meet-factors-in-farm-stir/article33516248.ece
07 January 2021||COIMBATORE,||AIADMK cadre, 2 others held in Pollachi sexual assault case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested a student wing leader of the ruling AIADMK and two others in connection with the Pollachi sexual assault case that rocked Tamil Nadu in 2019. The CBI team arrested K. Arulanantham, 34, of Vadugapalayam, who was the AIADMK Pollachi town students’ wing secretary, Haron Paul, 29, of Achipatty, and P. Babu alias ‘Bike’ Babu, 27, late on Tuesday. On Wednesday, AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami issued a statement expelling Arulanantham from the party. The three accused were produced before the Mahila Court in Coimbatore on Wednesday, and judge R. Nandhinidevi remanded them in judicial custody till January 20. Sources said Arulanantham, Paul and Babu were arrested based on a statement given before a magistrate two weeks ago by three girls, allegedly sexually assaulted and blackmailed by the trio and others. K. Thirunavukkarasu, 28, N. Rishwanth alias Sabarirajan, 26, M. Sathish, 30, T. Vasanthakumar, 25, and R. Manivannan, 31, all hailing from Pollachi, are the other accused in the case, which pertains to the sexual assault of a 19-year-old girl near Pollachi, on February 12, 2019. The investigation found that the accused also allegedly filmed the act and blackmailed the girl. Following the arrest of Thirunavukkarasu, Rishwanth, Sathish and Vasanthakumar, video clips of unknown men sexually assaulting some girls were leaked. The CBI took over the investigation in April 2019 and filed a chargesheet against the five accused in May 2019.  AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K.

07 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Anganwadi worker dies after alleged gang-rape in U.P.||A 50-year-old anganwadi worker died after she was gang-raped, allegedly by a priest and his two aides, in a village in Ughaiti area of Budaun, Uttar Pradesh, on Sunday night. However, an FIR was registered only on Tuesday after a post-mortem confirmed severe injuries to her private parts. Two of the accused have been arrested, but the main accused is absconding. The Station House Officer of Ughaiti has been suspended by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Budaun, for “insensitivity” and “delaying the due process”. ‘Police didn’t help’ The woman’s son told reporters that she used to go to the village temple which, according to locals, is more like an ashram. “On Sunday, she went to her mother’s place and while returning, followed her routine practice. Around 11.30 p.m., the priest and his two aides dropped her home in a car and left. They said she had fallen into the dry well on the ashram premises. She was bleeding profusely and soon she died.” He alleged that the priest Satya Narayan, 45, and his aides, Jaspal and Vedram, were lying as they didn’t take her to hospital. “We approached the police as we felt somebody had raped her but the police didn’t help,” he said. The woman’s husband said he requested the priest to take her to hospital as she was still alive but they refused and ran away. The son-in-law of the victim told The Hindu that his father-in-law was “slightly mentally unstable” and his mother-in-law was the sole bread earner in the family of five children, two of whom were married.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/anganwadi-worker-dies-after-alleged-gang-rape-in-up/article33515636.ece
07 January 2021||Alok Deshpande Mumbai,||Cabinet upholds tax waiver to Michael Jackson’s 1996 concert||More than 24 years after a concert in Mumbai by King of Pop Michael Jackson, Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday retrospectively upheld the entertainment tax waiver granted for it. The program was conceptualised by the now defunct Shiv Udyog Sena — then headed by Raj Thackeray, estranged cousin of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and now Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president — and organised by Wizcraft Entertainment. The then Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition government under Manohar Joshi had granted waiver of entertainment tax stating it was a charity event. The Mumbai Grahak Panchayat, a consumer rights organisation, had moved the high court in 1996 challenging the entertainment tax waiver. A division bench of the Bombay High Court had set aside the old order, citing “non-application of mind”, and sent the matter back to the government for reconsideration. The profit from the event, around Rs. 3.4 crore, had been deposited with the high court treasury as per court orders. In 2011, the high court had ruled that the state government has a right to extend waiver under section 6(3) of the Maharashtra Entertainment Duty Act. In court, Wizcraft had claimed the profit. Wednesday’s decision, will now allow Wizcraft International to get back the amount earned as profit from the show.

07 January 2021||Bengaluru,||No cut in syllabus for classes 1 to 9||Barely a few months before the 2020-21 academic year comes to a close, the State government has decided that there will be no cut in the syllabus for students of classes one to nine. Although, the department had maintained that the syllabus would be cut by 30%, given that schools were closed owing to the pandemic, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said on Wednesday that an alternative schedule had been finalised with no part of the portion omitted. Not welcome The sudden U-turn has not gone down well with students, parents, teachers, and school managements. While conducting online classes, teachers had mapped out lesson plans keeping in mind that a significant chunk of the portion would be omitted. The Karnataka Textbook Society had even published a trimmed syllabus in July 2020, but it was later withdrawn by the government after it was criticised for either cutting or trimming chapters on Tipu Sultan, the Constitution, Jesus Christ, and Prophet Mohammed. Last month, The Hindu had reported how months into the academic year, schools were waiting for the government to finalise portions.    D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said students were finding it difficult to grasp concepts during online classes. “So far, our teachers have completed teaching around 50% of the syllabus. We will not be able to complete teaching the entire syllabus by March and ensure that the children have understood everything,” he said. Impact on learning Another school management member, who did not want to be named, said this would have a “disastrous impact” on the learning outcomes of several children who have nobody at home to help them with their studies. With criticism from stakeholders across the board, an official said the department was considering allowing school principals to take a call on what part of the syllabus to retain or cut.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-cut-in-syllabus-for-classes-1-to-9/article33515797.ece
07 January 2021||Bengaluru,||II PU examination in May, SSLC in June||Ending months of anticipation of students preparing for board examinations, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Wednesday announced that the second pre-university (PU) examination would begin in the second week of May. The SSLC examination would be held in the first week of June. The Department of Primary and Secondary Education, however, is yet to give details on the trimmed syllabus. The department had announced that around 30% of the syllabus would be cut this year. It was only on January 1 that schools and colleges opened their doors to class 10 and second PU students after over nine months. Although online classes began in June/July last year, department officials said they wanted to conduct at least four months of contact classes before the board examinations. The pandemic The decision to postpone the examinations was taken in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic upsetting the academic calendar. The examinations had been postponed in 2020 as well on account of the pandemic. In 2020, the SSLC examination was held in June and July. While most of the II PU examination was completed in March, students had to appear for one paper on June 18 after lockdown restrictions were eased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ii-pu-exam-in-may-sslc-in-june/article33515793.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Democrats set to win Senate as Georgia results come in||Democrats inched closer to taking control of the U.S. Senate on Monday as African American pastor Raphael Warnock defeated incumbent Republican candidate Kelly Loeffler — a former businesswoman — in one of two run-off elections in Georgia. Mr. Warnock became the first black Senator elected from the southern State. The other run-off race was too close to call with incumbent David Perdue, a Republican, trailing his challenger, 33-year-old Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, by over 16,000 votes with 98% reporting on Wednesday morning (U.S. time). Both run-offs were necessary because no candidate had won more than 50% of the vote in the November elections. A number of votes remained outstanding on Wednesday morning (U.S. time) — military and overseas ballots and votes from heavily Democrat leaning areas (Atlanta and DeKalb counties, for instance). The Associated Press called the election for Mr. Warnock early on Wednesday (U.S. time) and at the time of this writing, Mr. Warnock was leading Ms. Loeffler by over 53,000 votes and 50.6% of the vote against her 49.4%. If Mr. Ossoff wins the race, the Senate would be split 50-50 between the two parties. Democrats, who already control the House of Representatives, would also have Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris’s vote in the case of a tie. If Republicans win the second run-off, they will control the Senate 51-49. The high-stakes races consequently broke fundraising records and compelled Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden to campaign for the candidates earlier this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/democrats-set-to-win-senate-as-georgia-results-come-in/article33515625.ece
07 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Akhila Priya arrested in kidnapping case||The former Tourism Minister Bhuma Akhila Priya Reddy and former A.P. Seeds Corporation chairman A.V. Subba Reddy were arrested by the Hyderabad police on Wednesday for their alleged involvement in the kidnap of former national hockey player Praveen Rao and his brothers. While Akhila Priya was taken into custody from her residence at Kukatpally in the early hours, Mr. Subba Reddy, a close confidante of former MP Bhuma Nagi Reddy, father of the former, was picked up at Madhapur later in the evening. However, Akhila Priya’s husband, Bhargav Ram, was at large, Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said. He said that the victims, Praveen Rao, Naveen Rao and Sunil Rao, were reportedly involved in a dispute pertaining to 25 acres of land located at Hafeezpet with the accused. According to Mr. Kumar, around 7.20 p.m. on Tuesday, a group of 10 people claiming to be Income Tax officials barged into the victim’s house at Manovikas Nagar, Bowenpally, and started questioning them. One of them was wearing a police uniform. Soon they locked the women and children in a room on pretext of search and interrogation, while the victims were confined in the hall. An hour later, Sunil’s wife Sarita, who was in the neighbour’s house, returned home and found that other inmates were locked in a room. As three brothers were missing, the family members started looking at the CCTV footage and realised that it was not an IT search and that the brothers were whisked away in three different cars, the officer said. The kidnappers also took their laptops, and mobile phones. Soon the police swung into action, verified the details and alerted their counterparts in Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates. Even Andhra Pradesh was informed about the offence, as the investigators assumed the kidnapper might take the victims to Kurnool district. “As there were several checkposts and tight vigil across the city, the accused could not take them anywhere and around 3.30 a.m. they released Praveen Rao, Sunil Rao and Naveen Rao, in Kokapet-Narsingi area on the outskirts of Hyderabad,” Mr. Kumar said, adding that victims safety was their top priority. “They were rescued and brought home safely,” he said. The trio were at a farmhouse after Moinabad, where the kidnappers allegedly forced them to sign some documents. Efforts are on to arrest the absconding accused persons, who reportedly hail from Allagadda and other places in Kurnool district, the officer said. Some of the accused, who barged into the Raos residence were identified as Srinivas Choudary alias Guntur Srinu, Sai, Chanti and Prakash. Based on the complaint lodged by one of the family members Katakaneni Manish, the police have arrested Ms. Akhila Priya and Mr. Subba Reddy, Mr. Kumar said, and added that later even they found that the former Tourism Minister and her husband had allegedly planned and executed the kidnap. Further, a medical examination of Akhila Priya before producing her in the court noted that she was pregnant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/akhila-priya-subba-reddy-held-in-kidnapping-case/article33515627.ece

A senior official in the Tamil Nadu government told The Hindu, “We have taken it to the notice of the Chief Minister.” The State government’s decision to allow full occupancy in cinema halls followed a representation from the Theatre Owners’ Association.

07 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Former A.P. Minister arrested in kidnapping case||Andhra Pradesh’s former minister Bhuma Akhila Priya Reddy was arrested by the Hyderabad police on Wednesday for her involvement in the kidnap of former national hockey player Praveen Rao and his brothers. TDP leader and former AP Seeds Corporation chairman A.V. Subba Reddy who was detained in this connection was later freed. While Akhila Priya was taken into custody from her residence at Kukatpally in the wee hours, Subba Reddy a close confidant of former MP Bhuma Nagi Reddy, father of the former, was detained at Madhapur later in the evening. However, Akhila Priya’s husband Bhargav Ram is at large, Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said. He said the victims, Praveen Rao, Naveen Rao and Sunil Rao were involved in a dispute pertaining to 25 acres of land located at Hafeezpet with the accused persons. According to Mr. Kumar, around 7.20 p.m. on Tuesday, a group of 10 people claiming to be Income Tax officials barged into the victim’s house at Manovikas Nagar, Bowenpally, and started questioning them. One of them was wearing a police uniform. Soon, they locked women and children in a room on pretext of search and interrogation, while the victims were confined to the hall. CCTV footage An hour later, Sunil’s wife Sarita, who was in the neighbour’s house, returned home and found that other inmates were locked in a room. As the three brothers were missing, the family members started looking at the CCTV footage and realised that it was not an IT search and that the brothers were whisked away in three different cars, the officer said. The kidnappers also took their laptops, and mobile phones. Soon the police swung into action, verified the details and alerted their counterparts in Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates. Even the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh was informed about the offence, as the investigators assumed the kidnapper might take the victims to Kurnool district.  “As there were several checkposts and tight vigil across the city, the accused could not take them anywhere and around 3.30 a.m. they released Praveen Rao, Sunil Rao and Naveen Rao, in Kokapet-Narsingi area on the outskirts of Hyderabad,” Mr. Kumar said, adding that the safety of the victims was their top priority. “They were rescued and brought home safely,” he said. The trio were at a farmhouse near Moinabad, where the kidnappers forced them to sign some documents. Efforts are on to arrest the absconding accused persons, who reportedly hail from Allagadda and other places in Kurnool district, the officer said. Some of the accused, who barged into Raos residence were identified as Srinivas Choudary alias Guntur Srinu, Sai, Chanti and Prakash. Based on the complaint lodged by one of the family members Katakaneni Manish, the police have arrested Akhila Priya and Subba Reddy, Mr. Kumar said, and added that later they found that the former tourism minister and her husband had planned and executed the kidnap. Further narrating details of the land dispute, the city police chief said that in 2016, Praveen Rao and one of his six brothers had purchased 25 acres of land near Hafeezpet. As there were some issues on the land, which were mediated by Subba Reddy with the assistance of late Bhuma Nagi Reddy. After the issue got resolved, an understanding was reached between Praveen and Subba Reddy, he said. However, Subba Reddy did not honour the terms of the understanding with Nagi Reddy and after the death of the latter, Akhila Priya and her sister Mounika approached Praveen for their share in the land. When Praveen infomed the Bhuma sisters about his transactions with Subba Reddy, Akhila Priya started threatening him, Mr. Kumar said. “Settling for the share in the land, Akhila Priya and her husband hatched a conspiracy and kidnapped the victims with the help of henchmen,” Mr. Kumar added. .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/former-ap-minister-arrested-in-kidnapping-case/article33515566.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||R-Day security meet factors in farm stir||The farmers’ protest took centre stage at a meeting between the Delhi police and the Defence Ministry on Wednesday to discuss arrangements for the Republic Day parade. A senior police officer said the meeting was called to discuss security arrangements for the parade. The Delhi police take care of the outer ring of security. The discussion was over visitors entering enclosures. To prevent any disruption by farmers protesting at the Delhi borders, adequate security measures will be put in place. “During the meeting, a discussion was held on whether visitors with only Delhi ID proofs be allowed or it should be open to all. Several suggestions were made by the officers in the meeting but the final call will be taken after the next meeting,” the officer said. As per guidelines, the visitors have to show their ID proof to get ticket for the parade and they have to keep their ID with them while getting entry to the enclosures on January 26. Due to COVID-19, there will be only 25,000 visitors to witness the parade compared with over one lakh usually. Children under the age of 15 will not be allowed. Another police officer said there were intelligence inputs that protesters might attempt to disrupt the parade this year. The intelligence wing is also keeping a watch on protests going on in the city. There will be more than 40,000 security personnel in the New Delhi area during the parade. Last year, there were strict instructions to security personnel to frisk visitors when there were anti-CAA protests across the country. The visitors were asked to open their jackets by the security officers to check if they were wearing any black outfit and to ensure that they were not wearing anything with anti-CAA slogans on them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/r-day-security-meet-factors-in-farm-stir/article33515576.ece
07 January 2021||New Delhi,||12 avian flu epicentres in India||Avian flu has been reported at 12 epicentres in four States — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala. Directions have been given to enforce culling of sick birds as per the government’s 2015 National Avian Influenza Plan, according to a press statement from the Ministry of Fisheries and Animal Husbandry on Wednesday. In these States, cases of bird flu have been confirmed in crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, in “migratory birds” in Himachal Pradesh, and in poultry and duck in Kerala. Influenza (AI) viruses have been circulating worldwide for centuries with four known major outbreaks recorded in the last century. India notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006. Infection in humans is not yet reported in India though the disease has an animal origin. “There is no direct evidence that AI viruses can be transmitted to humans via the consumption of contaminated poultry products. Implementing management practices that incorporate bio security principles, personal hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection protocols, as well as cooking and processing standards, are effective means of controlling the spread of the AI viruses,” the Health Ministry advisory added. In India, the disease spread mainly from migratory birds coming into the country during the winter months from September-October to February-March. However, secondary spread by human handling cannot be ruled out. In 2005, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, had prepared an action plan which was revised in 2006, 2012, 2015 and 2021, for the guidance of State governments in the prevention, control and containment of avian influenza.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/12-avian-flu-epicentres-in-india/article33515585.ece
07 January 2021||Kochi,||Acquittal in Walayar case set aside||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday set aside the verdict of the Palakkad special court for POCSO cases acquitting all the accused in a case relating to the death of two minor Dalit siblings at Walayar in Palakkad in 2017. The Bench comprising Justice A. Hariprasad and Justice M.R. Anitha also remanded the case to the special court for retrial. The court also directed the special court to consider the plea for permission to conduct further investigation in the case, if any, raised by the investigating agency by filing appropriate applications under Section 173(8) of the Cr.PC. The Bench directed the accused to appear before the special court on January 20. The prosecution’s case is that the two minor girls had died by suicide due to repeated sexual harassment by the accused. The girls, aged 13 and 9, were found dead inside their one-room home at Walayar 52 days apart in 2017. The court passed the judgment while allowing appeals filed by the State government and the mother of the girls challenging the special court verdict. The acquitted accused are Madhu, alias Valya Madhu, Madhu, alias Kutti Madhu, Shibu, and Pradeep Kumar. Pradeep died by suicide when the appeals were pending before the High Court. Unmerited acquittals The judges observed that “the perfunctory initial investigation and cursory, desultory, and unskilled prosecution coupled with the lack of involvement by the trial judge resulted in miscarriage of justice and the consequential unmerited acquittals in all these cases”. Observing that the special court judge had failed to perform a proactive role at the time of taking evidence, the court said “the two important functionaries in the criminal trial have egregiously failed to perform their duties”. The government, in its appeal, submitted that there was lack of coordination between the investigation agency and the prosecutor. It was submitted that the conduct of the case by the special public prosecutor was “totally blameworthy”. The court added that the trial was an empty formality. Besides, the lack of involvement of the trial judge had also contributed to a great extent in not digging out the true facts. The court observed that the accused could not cling on to “the unmerited acquittals in the sham trials”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/acquittal-in-walayar-case-set-aside/article33515557.ece
07 January 2021||New Delhi,||‘Cases of crime against women reduced in U.P.’||The Uttar Pradesh police on Wednesday informed the parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs that the number of cases of crime against women had reduced in the State, even as many members flagged various incidents, including the gang rape and subsequent death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras in September last. This was the fifth meeting of the committee headed by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma on Atrocities and Crimes against Women Children. Sources said a BJP member of the committee pointed out that the number of cases may have been dipping simply due to the police’s reluctance to register complaints. “The BJP MP said and rightly so, that when the government doesn’t register cases, naturally the number of cases will decline,” a member said. Even in the Hathras case, the family had to struggle to get the police file an FIR and in the initial investigation, the police insisted that the girl had not been raped contrary to her own statement, before her death, two weeks after the incident. Mr. Sharma, however, said the case had been transferred to the CBI and was no longer under the police’s jurisdiction. The committee members said the U.P. police, unlike other States, had not registered a single zero FIR. A zero FIR can be registered in any police station irrespective of where the incident took place. The provision of a zero FIR came up as a recommendation in the Justice Verma Committee Report in the new Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, devised after the December 2012 gang rape of a 23-year-old girl in the territory. In Wednesday’s meeting, representatives from the Rajasthan police and administration were also present. It has met representatives of the Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, U.P. and Maharashtra governments. The West Bengal government refused to send its representatives after it had a spat with the Union Home Ministry over forcible transfer of three IPS officers. The Chief Secretary and the DGP of Haryana also could not attend the Wednesday meeting, citing the ongoing farmers’ protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cases-of-crime-against-women-reduced-in-up/article33515580.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Another vaccine dry run in all districts tomorrow||The Health Ministry will organise another “dry run” to test the vaccine roll-out on January 8 in all districts, said a Health Ministry release on Wednesday. “As a simulation of actual execution, another round of dry run/mock drill in all 700-plus districts of all States/UTs [Union Territories] is planned on 8th January 2021 to ensure efficient planning and management for vaccine delivery in each district of all States/UTs. Each district will identify three types of session sites, similar to the previous dry run, including a public health facility (District Hospital/Medical College), private health facility and rural or urban outreach sites,” the Health Ministry release said. The only exception will be districts in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana that had a dry run on January 5 and will have one more on January 7. The dry run was important to check the performance of the CO-WIN software, whereby all beneficiaries will be informed and tracked on matters of vaccine administration. “The dry run will also familiarize the State, District, Block and Hospital level officers on all aspects of COVID-19 rollout. This activity will help administrators in strengthening the linkages between planning, implementation and reporting mechanisms, identification of any residual challenges prior to the actual implementation and provide confidence to the programme managers at all levels to carry out a smooth implementation of the vaccination drive,” the release noted. Around 1.7 lakh vaccinators and 3 lakh vaccination team members had been trained on the process to be followed at the vaccination sites, which include beneficiary verification, vaccination, cold chain and logistics management, bio-medical waste management and adverse events following vaccination, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/another-vaccine-dry-run-in-all-districts-tomorrow/article33515589.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.S. meddling in stand-off: Chinese envoy||A day after the U.S. Ambassador said India and the U.S. were cooperating against Chinese “aggressive activity” at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), China’s Ambassador responded accusing the United States of “meddling” in the India-China standoff. “We have noticed recent remarks with reference to China by the U.S. side. We firmly oppose any third-party meddling in China-India border issue and hope the U.S. relations with others not target any specific country,” Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. In his farewell address on Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Juster had referred to India-U.S. “close coordination” on India’s challenge from “aggressive Chinese activity” on a “sustained basis” on its border, calling America’s cooperation during the eight-month long stand-off as “very positive and very supportive”. While he refused to divulge specifics, which he said it was for the Indian government to disclose, the U.S. was understood to have helped India with geospatial map information and the expedited supply of extreme weather suits for soldiers. Military experts said Mr. Juster’s comments simply reflected “growing strength” in the relations. “As far as the Chinese Ambassador’s statement is considered, he must realise that after China’s unilateral actions on the LAC, and its stubborn position in talks to resolve the issue, China should not expect that other countries will not react or that the matter can remain purely bilateral,” Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda, former chief of the Army’s Northern Command, told The Hindu . This is not the first time China has reacted sharply to comments by U.S. officials over the stand-off since April 2020, after the PLA amassed troops at the LAC and claimed Indian territory. In May, its Foreign Ministry had termed remarks by outgoing State Department official Alice Wells on “provocations and disturbing behaviour by China” at the LAC and South China Sea as “just nonsense” and said the border issue had “nothing to do with USA”. In October, after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo promised to “stand with India” against what he described as China’s threats to India’s “sovereignty and their liberty”, the Chinese MFA had accused the U.S. of “preaching confrontation and geopolitical games”. When asked about the diplomatic spat between the Ambassadors of the U.S. and China over the issue, the MEA declined to make any immediate comment. The government has maintained that it is resolving the situation at the LAC “bilaterally and diplomatically”. In an interview to The Hindu last month, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had even called for China to “take a bilateral path that is mutually respectful and mutual sensitive”. India and China have held a number of bilateral talks at various levels. While there has been no breakthrough on the ground in terms of disengagement or withdrawal of troops, the two sides have held eight rounds of Corps Commander-level meetings, and are “in consultations” to hold the ninth round shortly, an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-meddling-in-stand-off-chinese-envoy/article33515593.ece
07 January 2021||Kolkata,||Amid war of words, Mamata meets Governor||As the war of words between West Bengal’s ruling party and the Governor continued to rage unabated, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday made a surprise visit to Raj Bhavan and met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. While there was no word from the Chief Minister about the hour-long meeting, Mr. Dhankhar tweeted a photograph of the meeting with Ms. Banerjee. “Myself and Mrs Sudesh Dhankhar greeted Hon’ble Chief Minister @MamataOfficial when she visited Raj Bhawan today (sic),” Mr. Dhankhar said, sharing the photograph on social media. According to sources, Ms. Banerjee is likely to induct new members to her Cabinet after two Ministers — Suvendu Adhikari and Laxmi Ratan Shukla — resigned recently. Ms. Banerjee is most likely to have discussed a suitable date for the swearing-in. It is also seen as an attempt by the Chief Minister to break the ice. Hours before the meeting, Trinamool Congress spokesperson and MP Kakuli Ghosh Dastidar reiterated the party’s stand on the Governor, saying that it wanted him removed from the post. Five TMC MPs, including Ms. Dastidar, had only a few days ago written to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking the Governor’s removal. Mr. Dhankhar had earlier in the day reiterated that the 2021 polls in the State should be free of violence. He added that it pained him when he heard that some people called fellow countrymen “outsiders” in the State. The last one-to-one meeting between Ms. Banerjee and the Governor was almost a year ago, when the former visited the Raj Bhavan in February. With the recent acrimonious public utterances by both Raj Bhavan and the Trinamool Congress, relations have hit a new low. Plea to HC The West Bengal government on Wednesday filed an application before the Calcutta High Court urging it to recall or modify its judgment directing the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to audit cyclone Amphan-related relief over allegations of irregularities. As the process of disbursement of funds is continuing, the direction for audit by the CAG at this stage is premature, the State government said. It also prayed for a stay of operation of the judgment of December 1 last year passed by the Division Bench of Chief Justice T.B.N. Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee. Claiming that absolute transparency was maintained regarding disbursement of funds, the application stated that direct benefit transfer to beneficiaries’ bank accounts was adopted to curb any kind of foul play in rendering financial assistance to the cyclone-affected people in 16 districts of the State. The State government submitted that the process of disbursement of funds is still going on and as such District Magistrates would not be in a position to submit utilisation certificates. In its judgment on December 1, 2020, the Division Bench had urged the CAG to conclude the performance and financial audits within three months of receiving a copy of the order. Praying for recalling the order, the State government stated in the application that a list of 20.7 lakh accepted applications for house building grants was displayed on ‘Egiye Bangla’, the official website of the West Bengal government.

07 January 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Using God’s name to sell articles illegal’||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has declared that advertisement of any article using the name of any God and claiming that it has supernatural qualities, is “illegal” and falls under the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act. A division bench of justices T.V. Nalawade and M.G. Sewlikar was hearing a petition filed by Rajendra Ambhore, a teacher, seeking a direction and injunction to prevent advertisements on television channels that promote the sale of articles like Hanuman Chalisa Yantra. Mr. Ambhore said that in March 2015, he came across advertisements on TV claiming special, miraculous and supernatural properties/qualities in Hanuman Chalisa Yantra prepared by one Baba Mangalnath, who had achieved ‘Siddhi’ (supernatural powers) and was blessed by Lord Hanuman. The Yantra costs Rs. 4,900 and was said to be made of 24-carat gold. Singers and such other celebrities were shown in the ads talking about their experience, the plea said. The court said telemarketers change the names of companies, Gods and Babas to show that each was a different Yantra. The court went on to say, “The objectives quoted in the Black Magic Act can be achieved mainly through education. Reformists like Mahatma Phule and Babasaheb Ambedkar, who worked to remove evil practices and spread awareness against superstition, were born on this soil.” ‘Laws required’ It could safely be said that at least basic education was available to everybody in the State. But even highly educated people were attracted tomantra-tantraand black magic. In such a situation, the Black Magic Act was required to be enacted even in a progressive State like Maharashtra. “The propagation for sale by advertisement of any article, naming it Yantra or otherwise, by attaching the name of any God to such an article, including Lord Hanuman or any Baba, with the representation that these articles have special, miraculous and supernatural properties and that they will help people to become happy, make progress in business, see advancement in career, show improved performance in education, recover from disease etc., is illegal,” it held. Such propagation and advertisement, falls under the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, the court held. The court directed the State and Vigilance Officers to register such crimes, giving reports against persons who make such advertisements and sell such articles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/using-gods-name-to-sell-articles-illegal/article33515798.ece
07 January 2021||New Delhi,||China surging ahead, says NITI Aayog||At a meeting of the Standing Committee on Finance headed by BJP MP Jayant Sinha to discuss the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, trade flows and financial markets, NITI Aayog officials said China continued to outstrip India and, in fact, had managed to narrow the gap with the U.S. in the post-pandemic scenario. The officials did not give any specific details about the current economic state of India. A presentation given by Ajit Pai, consultant to NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar, said the global economy was at the same stage as it was in 1918 after the First World War. The committee members asked whether COVID-19 had proved to be an inflection point in the global supply chain and if China would still continue to be the factory of the world. Painting a grim picture, the officials said China had been closing the gap between it and the U.S. This could very well be a flashpoint between the two big economies of the world. China, the officials said, had readjusted faster than the other economies in the post COVID-19 world. The reforms NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, according to sources, equated the 2020 reforms with the 1991 opening of the Indian economy. “He claimed that the impact of 1991 reforms initiated by then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh is equivalent to the opening of mine and coal sectors done by the Narendra Modi government. He was lambasted by Trinamool MP Saugata Roy, who asked for more details about the so-called reforms,” one of the members said. There were no specific answers to the current state of the Indian economy. “They claimed that India should become an export-based economy without actually laying down the specifics. It was a rhetorical statement,” another member said. The NITI Aayog officials, sources said, have assured that a separate presentation would be made about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-surging-ahead-says-niti-aayog/article33515601.ece
07 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala opposes motor vehicle aggregator norms||Kerala has opposed the implementation of Motor Vehicle Aggregator Guidelines 2020 as it will allow private bus services on any route without permits, alter the public transport scenario and hit the state-owned Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC). Transport Minister A. K. Saseendran who met the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari in Mumbai shared the State’s concerns and pointed out that the monopoly now enjoyed by the State transport undertakings such as KSRTC on inter-State routes will go when Section 36 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 is implemented. The Minister, who was accompanied by Biju Prabhakar, Secretary, Transport, who is also the Chairman and Managing Director, KSRTC, has sought financial assistance from the Centre for the KSRTC to overcome the problems encountered by the undertaking. The daily revenue from the KSRTC fleet has dipped from Rs. 6.50 crore to Rs. 3 crore after the lockdown and the aggregator licence norms will create problems as the public transport will come under the Centre’s control, the Minister pointed out. About 50% of the revenue received from the fleet is being used for the fuel bill of the KSRTC. The alternative is to shift to CNG, LNG and electric buses. Compared to the Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 55 lakh needed for a diesel-powered bus, the electric bus costs Rs. 1.50 crore to Rs. 2 crore. The CNG pump kicked off in 2018 in the capital is yet to be commissioned. Converting 300 ordinary buses to CNG and LNG is another option and the MoRTH should provide Rs. 500 crore for it in a phased manner, the Minister told Mr. Gadkari. The Transport Minister also demanded that the Centre reduce GST on CNG from the present 28% to 18%. Mr. Saseendran said the Union Minister had given assurance that the proposal to avoid permit for 22-seaters would be withdrawn and that the aggregator licence norms would not affect Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-opposes-motor-vehicle-aggregator-norms/article33515898.ece
07 January 2021||Kalaburagi,||Foundation stone laid for ‘New Anubhava Mantapa’||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, on Wednesday, laid the foundation stone for “New Anubhava Mantapa” in Basavakalyan, the place where 12th century poet-philosopher Basaveshwara lived for most of his life. He promised completion of the Rs. 500-crore project within two years on a 7.5-acre area and said that it would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While a project to highlight the teachings of Basaveshwara (an icon of Veerashaiva-Lingayat community) was first proposed back in 2016 when Siddaramaiah was the Chief Minister and a committee led by Go. Ru. Channabasappa was set up to draw a plan, the project getting a push now is politically loaded. Political significance Basavakalyan, an important pilgrim centre for Lingayats, is bound for bypolls soon, following the death of its MLA B. Narayan Rao from Congress. In fact, the government’s controversial decision to set up Maratha Development Corporation was also in the backdrop of bypolls, given the strong presence of the Maratha community here. The New Anubhava Mantapa project is also expected to bolster Mr. Yediyurappa’s image as an undisputed Lingayat strongman, especially when leadership issue has emerged prominently within the BJP and there is one-upmanship to claim community’s support. Interestingly, while the government has not released the approved funds of close to Rs. 2,000 crore for Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board (KKRDB), the Chief Minister has said that there will be no dearth of funds for the Rs. 500 crore New Anubhava Mantapa project. He also announced Rs. 50 crore for Maratha Development Corporation with alacrity. Grand structure The New Anubhava Mantapa, as envisaged now, will be a six-floor structure in the midst of the 7.5-acre plot and represent various principles of Basaveshwara’s  philosophy. It will showcase the 12th Century Anubhava Mantapa (often referred to as the “first Parliament of the world”) established by him in Basavakalyan where philosophers and social reformers held debates. The circular building will adopt Kalyana Chalukya style of architecture. The grand structure supported by 770 pillars will have an auditorium with a seating capacity of 770.

07 January 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Take note of nexus between Yediyurappa, complainant’||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has suffered multiple setbacks as the High Court of Karnataka has directed the trial court and the Lokayukta police to take note of the “unscrupulous, immoral, and unholy nexus between Mr. Yediyurappa and the complainant, and other offenders” and take suitable action as per law at an appropriate stage in connection with an alleged corruption case related to denotification of land. Besides dismissing Mr. Yediyurappa’s petition challenging the legality of registration of a first information report (FIR) on the orders of a special court based on a complaint lodged by social activist Jayakumar Hiremath, the High Court also imposed a cost of Rs. 25,000 on the BJP leader. Also, in yet another case, the High Court restored the complaint of alleged corruption against Mr. Yediyurappa, former Minister Murugesh Nirani and the former managing director of the Karnataka Udyoga Mitra Shivaswamy K.S. while setting aside the trial court’s 2016 order of rejecting the complaint filed by A. Alam Pasha. Justice John Michael Cunha passed the separate orders while dismissing Mr. Yediyurappa’s petition, filed in 2017, challenging the 2015 order of the special court, which had ordered investigation by the Lokayukta police into the complaint lodged by Mr. Hiremath. It was alleged in the complaint that Mr. Yediyurappa, during his tenure as Chief Minister in 2010, had illegally denotified 34 guntas of land among the land acquired for Matadahalli Layout way back in 1970s by the Bangalore Development Authority, contrary to the advise of officials. The beneficiary of the denotified land was Vimala, mother-in-law of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy in whose tenure as Chief Minister the process of denotification of this land had commenced. Complaint’s conduct Though Mr. Hiremath, who vehemently opposed the petition till recently, on December 9, 2020, suddenly filed a memo with an affidavit indicting that complaint against Mr. Yediyurappa cannot be continued as there was no sanction for investigation as per amended provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, he also contended that he had now laid his hands on some documents that demonstrate that the BJP leader acted on the “recommendations” from the officers concerned. Mr. Hiremath filed this affidavit after Mr. Yediyurappa’s petition was amended recently to contend that probe cannot be continued in view of introduction of Section 17A to the PC Act in 2018 requiring prior consent of the competent authority for investigation against a public servant. However, the High Court, noticing contents of the complaint and objection filed by Mr. Hiremath at the initial stage opposing the petition, and the memo filed in December 2020, observed that it is evident that “an ingenious attempt has been made to bail out the petitioner [Mr. Yediyurappa] and other accused persons named in the FIR.” “The hidden motive of Mr. Hiremath is glaringly evident from the manner in which he has made audacious statements in the affidavit contrary to the records, which he claimed to have been able to advert...,” the court observed. “From the reading of the affidavit and the memo, one can readily draw an inference that Mr. Hiremath has either fallen prey to the allurements or has yielded to the pressure of the petitioner [Mr. Yediyurappa] or other accused persons named in the FIR, as it is evident that at the instance of the petitioner, petition was amended solely with a view to create a ruse for respondent No. 2 to seek withdrawal of the complaint,” the High Court observed. “... the allegations made in the complaint and the material produced in support thereof, in my view, prima facie disclose the ingredients of the offences alleged against the petitioner warranting a thorough investigation,” the court held while declining to quash the FIR registered in 2015. In Pasha’s case The High Court directed the trial court to proceed as per the law against Mr. Yediyurappa and two others based on the second complaint filed in 2015 by Mr. Pasha. Mr. Pasha, alleging illegality and corruption in the process of withdrawal of 26 acres of industrial land allotted to him near Devanahalli, filed a complaint before special court in 2012 against Mr. Yediyurappa and others. The Lokayukta police, who were asked to investigate the complaint, had filed chargesheet against them. However, the High Court in 2013 quashed the criminal proceedings solely on the ground that there was no prior sanction for their prosecution. Mr. Justice Cunha, in his order of partly allowing Mr. Pasha’s petition, has said that there was no bar on the complainant to file afresh a complaint on the same allegation after Mr. Yediyurappa and others demitted the public offices held earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/take-note-of-unholy-nexus-between-yediyurappa-and-complainant-hc/article33515792.ece
07 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Forest dept. taking measures to prevent and report disease||In view of the reports about spread of avian flu in states such as Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, and Rajasthan, and the subsequent directions by the Union Minister for Environment, Forests & Climate Change, the Telangana Forest department has taken several measures to prevent and report the disease. The MoEF has, during a video conference on January 5, requested all states to take preventive measures to control the spread of bird flu and detect and report all cases of deaths of birds to the authorities concerned for necessary action. Accordingly, the curator of Nehru Zoological Park and all officials in charge of Kakatiya Zoo, Warangal, Manjeera Bird Sanctuary, Sangareddy, Pakhal Wildlife Sanctuary including Pakhal lake, Sivwaram Wildlife Sancturay, Kinnerasani Wildlife Sanctuary including Kinnerasani Lake have been instructed to constitute rapid response teams for patrolling in the areas where migratory birds congregate. Similar directions have been issued to all the circle and division heads, a statement from the department said. The winter season attracts a large number of migrant birds from Northern region of Himalayas to Southern States, which nest and breed in water bodies. Since these birds travel over long distances crossing several states, it is essential to keep track of them at the nesting and breeding sites. Suitable instructions have been issued in this regard, the statement said. The field officers have been instructed to collect the carcasses of birds detected during this period, pack them safely and send them to veterinary science laboratories for analysing and identifying cause of death. The department has requested the general public to be on alert during this period, and report any dead birds to Wildlife Crime Control Cell at Aranya Bhavan on the toll free number 1800-425-5364 which functions round the clock. District officers have been requested to coordinate with the Animal Husbandry department as well as respective district administrations to take required preventive measures and enhance the vigil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/forest-dept-taking-measures-to-prevent-and-report-disease/article33516297.ece
07 January 2021||New Delhi,||Pranab was ready to break norm in 2014||Former President Pranab Mukherjee was ready to break the convention and invite a Congress-led coalition to form a government if the 2014 Lok Sabha election had thrown up a hung Parliament. In the final volume of his autobiography, The Presidential Years, formally released on Tuesday, the late Mukherjee said he could not be “neutral between stability and instability”. However, he said he did not vote in 2014, keeping in mind the constitutional position he occupied. He said the Congress would have not faced a drubbing in 2014 had he been a Minister in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. In a no-holds-barred description of his years in the Manmohan Singh government, Mukherjee criticised decisions such as the creation of Telangana and targeted the party’s leadership for allowing leaders like Mamata Banerjee to walk out of the coalition. Parliament disruptions He blamed the Narendra Modi government for the repeated parliamentary disruptions in its first term. He talked about “expecting the unexpected” from Mr. Modi in terms of foreign policy, and pointed out how the Prime Minister had come to him to seek support for the November 2016 demonetisation. “I had expected a hung Parliament with the BJP emerging as the single largest party with about 195-200 seats. In such situation, it would have been my constitutional responsibility to ensure stability. Had the Congress emerged with fewer seats but promised a stable government, I would have invited the leader of the party to form the government, keeping in mind their previous track record in managing coalition governments successfully,” he said. Congress’s defeat “This would have been in contravention of the convention established by the former president, Shankar Dayal Sharma, of inviting the single-largest party to form the government. He had invited Vajpayee to form the government after a hung House in 1996 despite lack of clarity on Vajpayee’s numbers,” he said. Talking about the Congress’s defeat in the 2014 polls, Mukherjee noted that among many reasons the party had failed to realise was the end of “charismatic leadership” and the “establishment was reduced to a government of averages”. “If I had continued in the government as Finance Minister, I would have ensured Mamata’s continuity in the coalition. Similarly, Maharashtra was handled badly, partly due to decisions taken by Sonia Gandhi. I would have brought back Shivraj Patil or Sushil Kumar Shinde, considering the dearth of a strong leader from the State, like Vilasrao Deshmukh,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pranab-was-ready-to-break-norm-in-2014/article33515582.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Science policy to boost journal access||The proposed Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP) aims to establish a system whereby all researchers in India can access research published in top international journals at no cost. The government will negotiate, said Akhilesh Gupta, senior adviser in the Department of Science and Technology, on behalf of all research bodies with publishers to enable access. Currently, it costs around Rs. 1,500 crore annually to subscribe to these journals. “The price of subscription is very high and individual colleges cannot negotiate with publishers. Only a small fraction of our researchers are now able to benefit from these subscriptions and we would like to change that,” Mr. Gupta said at a media briefing on Wednesday. The Science Ministry has not yet drawn up a plan of execution as the STI policy is still in draft mode. Mr. Gupta said it was possible that the eventual cost to the exchequer would be higher but it would come with the benefit of increased access. Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, Ashutosh Sharma said, “Times have changed with the future coming at us at a much faster pace. This policy will help us prepare for the fast pace of change. New problems are emerging that can only be tackled through science, technology, and innovation, and this policy is a right step in that direction to build a strong foundation for the future.” The policy sets a target for doubling the number of full-time equivalent researchers, gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) and private sector contribution to the GERD every five years. The policy has been drafted through a “four track” process of consultation and endeavours to implement major changes through short, medium and long-term mission mode projects. Dr. Gupta said the process involved nearly 300 rounds of consultations with more than 40,000 stakeholders. The policy is to identify and address the strengths and weaknesses of the Indian STI (Science, Technology, Innovation) ecosystem to catalyse the socio-economic development of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/science-policy-to-boost-journal-access/article33515587.ece
07 January 2021||Hyderabad,||‘No trace of bird flu in Telangana’||Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav has asserted that there were no traces of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, in the State and hence, there was no cause of concern. The Central government has announced that instances of bird flu were identified in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Himachal Pradesh. In the light of reports on incidence of bird flu in some States, the Minister held a review meeting with senior officials on Wednesday to assess the situation. As many as 1,300 rapid response teams had been constituted to constantly monitor the situation and take precautionary measures. Samples tested The government had, so far, collected 276 samples from different parts of the State and tests were conducted accordingly. Officials at different levels had been put on alert to meet any eventuality. Steps had been taken to create awareness among poultry sector on the precautionary measures that should be taken to prevent scope for incidence of bird flu. Accordingly, senior officials were giving suggestions to poultry breeders and other stakeholders and camps were being conducted from time to time in this regard. Though there was scope for incidence of the disease through migratory birds, its impact would be confined to certain pockets, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-trace-of-bird-flu-in-state-minister/article33516296.ece
07 January 2021||Srinagar,||2 die, over 100 houses damaged due to snow||Two persons died and over 100 houses were damaged in snow in the Kashmir Valley on Wednesday. The Valley remained out of bounds for the fourth straight day, while 22 stranded families were rescued and shifted to safer locations. An official said a CRPF sub-inspector H.C. Murmu died after a structure collapsed under the weight of snow and hit him at the residence of a former legislator in the Hazratbal area here. Rehami Begam, 70, from Shah Mohalla at Trehgam in Kupwara, died after snow accumulated on the house roof fell and buried her in. A police spokesman said 22 stranded families were rescued and shifted to safer locations in Kulgam. “The families were living in the avalanche-prone areas in the upper reaches of Merasinallah-Kraloo -Kund and Kanchloo-Kund,” the police said. Scores of patients and the families of the dead also faced immense difficulty due to snow accumulation. According to official figures, Kashmir recorded one to six feet of snowfall in the past four days in the plains of the Valley. “Around 76 houses, which suffered damage to their roof-tops, were provided an immediate assistance of Rs. 5,200 each, three houses damaged in the snowfall were sanctioned an amount of Rs. 3.05 lakh,” Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar, Dr. Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said. Air and road traffic, connecting the Valley with the rest of the country, has remained closed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-die-over-100-houses-damaged-in-snow/article33515573.ece
07 January 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Using God’s name to sell articles illegal’||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has declared that advertisement of any article using the name of any God and claiming that it has supernatural qualities, is “illegal” and falls under the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act. A division bench of justices T.V. Nalawade and M.G. Sewlikar was hearing a petition filed by Rajendra Ambhore, a teacher, seeking a direction and injunction to prevent advertisements on television channels that promote the sale of articles like Hanuman Chalisa Yantra. Mr. Ambhore said that in March 2015, he came across advertisements on TV claiming special, miraculous and supernatural properties/qualities in Hanuman Chalisa Yantra prepared by one Baba Mangalnath, who had achieved ‘Siddhi’ (supernatural powers) and was blessed by Lord Hanuman. The Yantra costs Rs. 4,900 and was said to be made of 24-carat gold. Singers and such other celebrities were shown in the ads talking about their experience, the plea said. The court said telemarketers change the names of companies, Gods and Babas to show that each was a different Yantra. The court went on to say, “The objectives quoted in the Black Magic Act can be achieved mainly through education. Reformists like Mahatma Phule and Babasaheb Ambedkar, who worked to remove evil practices and spread awareness against superstition, were born on this soil.” ‘Laws required’ It could safely be said that at least basic education was available to everybody in the State. But even highly educated people were attracted tomantra-tantraand black magic. In such a situation, the Black Magic Act was required to be enacted even in a progressive State like Maharashtra. “The propagation for sale by advertisement of any article, naming it Yantra or otherwise, by attaching the name of any God to such an article, including Lord Hanuman or any Baba, with the representation that these articles have special, miraculous and supernatural properties and that they will help people to become happy, make progress in business, see advancement in career, show improved performance in education, recover from disease etc., is illegal,” it held. Such propagation and advertisement, falls under the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, the court held. The court directed the State and Vigilance Officers to register such crimes, giving reports against persons who make such advertisements and sell such articles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/using-gods-name-to-sell-articles-illegal/article33515624.ece
07 January 2021||Bengaluru,||HC notice to Bangalore Turf Club on PIL plea||The Karnataka High Court has directed the Bangalore Turf Club Ltd. and the Animal Welfare Board of India to respond to the recommendations made in an inspection report for setting up a state-of-the-art horse stable at BTC, and for laying down guidelines on the number of horses to be kept in a turf club. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Satish Chandra Sharma issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed by Compassion Unlimited Plus Action, an NGO. The Bench passed the order as the inspector Capt. Ravi Raidurg, in his report of the inspection of BTC, had recommended construction of state-of-the-art stables on a war footing in BTC, though he had termed as “satisfactory” the maintenance of track. “About 80% of the stables are over 50 years old, and temporary measures like puff panelling won’t be fruitful in the long run,” the report said, while recommending construction of the state-of-the-art stables. Though the petitioner had alleged that BTC had violated certain provisions of the Performing Animals (Registration) Rules, 2001, in not providing proper veterinary care, suitable stables, track etc., the inspection report found that treatment done by the then chief veterinary officer was “satisfactory”. However, the report recommended setting up of a state-of-the-art operation theatre, regular training for the vets, and filling vacant posts of CVO and junior veterinarians. The report said that no evidence was found on the allegation made by the petitioner about withholding of food and water for horses seven hours prior to the race. While pointing out that BTC at present is overcrowded as there were 887 horses as on November 28, 2020, and 600 to 650 syces, the report said infrastructure at BTC is not capable of holding such a large number of animals and syces. As there is no guideline on the number of horses to be kept in a particular turf club, the report recommended that the AWBI and the Ministry of Animal Husbandry issue guidelines on the number of horses to be kept in a particular turf race club based on infrastructure available. The report also recommended the need to issue standard operating procedure for rehabilitation of horses after their racing age. Further hearing has been adjourned till January 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-notice-to-bangalore-turf-club-on-pil-plea/article33515555.ece
07 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala to share cost of Sabarimala rail project||The Angamaly-Sabarimala rail project has got a new lease of life with the State agreeing to bear 50% of the estimate of Rs. 2,815.62 crore. Bowing to the stance of the Railways and the Centre that the State should share 50% of the cost of the Sabari rail project, the Cabinet on Wednesday decided to make available funds from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). 116-km line The Railways will be responsible for the construction and maintenance of the 116-km Angamaly-Azhutha Sabari rail while the en route station development will be through public-private partnership and a special purpose vehicle. The income will be shared 50:50 between the State and the Railways after deducting the expenses, official sources said. The possibility of extending the line up to Punalur and chances of extending it to Tamil Nadu also had bearing on the change of stance on the part of the State. The railway line, sanctioned in 1997-98, is one of the 10 stalled rail infrastructure projects of the Southern Railway. The Railways decided to keep the project in abeyance in December 2019 and not to infuse funds due to non-cooperation of the State. Not on KRDCL list The project also failed to figure on the priority list of Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL), the special purpose vehicle set up for executing viable rail projects on cost-sharing basis with the Railways. The Transport Department had earlier cancelled a government order issued for cost-sharing citing it as a sanctioned project. Quoting the order, the Railways were adamant that the State should bear 50% of the cost. “The Railways cannot pay for the huge escalation in project cost due to the inaction of the State government,” Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had said in a letter on January 11, 2020 to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The proposed line would be of help tolakhs of devotees visiting the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple. Though the Railways provided Rs. 225 crore in the 2017-18 Union budget for the Sabari line, not much headway could be made due to opposition various quarters. The estimate of the rail line had gone up from Rs. 550 crore to Rs. 2,815.62 crore now.  Onus on Centre The decision of the State to share the cost of the project will put pressure on the Centre to infuse more funds in the forthcoming Union Budget. As much as 470.77 ha is needed for the line which passes through Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam, and Pathanamthitta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-to-share-cost-of-sabarimala-rail-project/article33515558.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Anganwadi worker dies after alleged gang-rape||“She carried the only mobile phone of the family and it was found smashed in her clothes. The family was not in a position to call the police immediately. When they reached the police station, they were told that the police were busy in some operation. Later, policemen took away the phone,” he said. Locals said a video of the priest saying she fell into the well was circulating but the police could not nab him. They said the well was in an isolated area and not at a place where somebody could fall in by accident. “The SHO also believed the theory of the accused till the post-mortem report revealed that she had been brutalised,” said social activist Shafi Ahmed. More than 18 hours It took the police more than 18 hours to take the body to the mortuary. “It was around noon on Monday that the police received a call on 112 and by the time the body reached the mortuary, it was evening. So, the post-mortem was conducted on Tuesday and an FIR was registered under sections 302 and 376D of the IPC,” Sankalp Sharma, SSP, Budaun, told The Hindu.  Mr. Sharma said initially both the SHO and the family members believed the theory of the priest because he himself brought the body to the victim’s residence. “It was when the family realised that she was bleeding from private parts that they approached the police. In fact, tehreer [complaint] came to us on Tuesday when I insisted. But the SHO should have been much more sensitive and alert,” he stated. Yashpal Singh CMO, Budaun, said prima facie it seemed like a case of rape. “There were injuries on the private parts. Her ribs were broken and there was a fracture in one leg.” Dr. Singh said the injuries suggested that she was dragged. “There was excessive bleeding and death was because of shock. The viscera has been preserved and the sample has been sent to the forensic lab,” Dr. Singh added. District Magistrate Kumar Prashant said the case would be heard in a fast-track court and all possible government help would be provided to the victim’s family. CM’s directive Taking note of the case, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed ADG Bareilly to visit the spot and submit a report on the incident. In what appears like an adverse comment on the ability of the local administration, the U.P. Special Task Force has also been instructed to provide assistance in the investigation of the case. The incident created a massive outrage on social media and Opposition parties took the government to task. A delegation of the local Congress unit met the victim’s family and promised all possible support.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anganwadi-worker-dies-after-alleged-gang-rape/article33515569.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||No progress in talks with farmers, says SC||Several rounds of talks between the government and farmer leaders have been inconclusive so far. The CJI posted all the petitions concerning the farmers’ issue on Monday but said that it could be adjourned if the Attorney General found it necessary for the sake of the ongoing talks. “We may adjourn the matter if you say so,” he addressed Mr. Venugopal. The court also issued notice to the government on a separate petition filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, challenging the Third Constitutional Amendment of 1954 that included Entry 33, concerning food and essential commodities, in the Concurrent List. “This is one of Mr. Sharma’s startling petitions... He says you [government] have been committing illegalities since 1954,” Chief Justice Bobde told Mr. Venugopal in a lighter vein. Mr. Venugopal, however, wondered how a person could challenge a constitutional amendment in a writ petition. In the last hearing in the farmers’ case on December 17, the court said farmers had a constitutional right to continue with their “absolutely perfect” protest as long as their dissent against the three controversial agricultural laws did not slip into violence. The court had also cautioned the Centre against trying to “instigate” violence. The CJI had stressed that as fellow Indians, the judges too understood farmers’ problems. But Mr. Venugopal had strongly objected to the farmers’ conduct. He had said they could not corner the government into a ‘yes or no’ to their demand to repeal the laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-progress-in-talks-with-farmers-says-sc/article33515570.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Supreme Court to study anti-conversion laws||The court fixed a hearing in four weeks. The petition filed by advocates Vishal Thakre and A.S. Yadav and researcher Pranvesh, who were represented by advocates Sanjeev Malhotra and Pradeep Kumar Yadav, said the laws were against public policy and society at large. “These laws will create fear in society and become a potent tool in the hands of bad elements to falsely implicate anyone. A grave injustice will be done by the ordinances... They will create a chaotic situation,” it said. A series of Supreme Court verdicts underline that the choice of a life partner, whether by marriage or outside it, was part of an individual’s “personhood and identity”. The court had said in its Hadiya case judgment, “Matters of dress and of food, of ideas and ideologies, of love and partnership are within the central aspects of identity. Neither the State nor the law can dictate a choice of partners or limit the free ability of every person to decide on these matters.” In the K.S. Puttaswamy case, or ‘privacy,’ judgment, a Constitution Bench said the autonomy of the individual was the ability to make decisions in vital matters of concern to life. Any interference by the State in an adult’s right to love and marry had a “chilling effect” on freedom. Intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone of privacy, which is inviolable, the court has said. “The absolute right of an individual to choose a life partner is not in the least affected by matters of faith”. Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind has sought to be made a party in the case, saying the Uttar Pradesh law violates the fundamental rights of the Muslim youth, who are being targeted and demonised.  The court had said in its Hadiya case judgment, “Neither the State nor the law can dictate a choice of partners or limit the free ability of every person to decide on these matters.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-to-study-anti-conversion-laws/article33515571.ece

Bobde observed orally at a hearing on Tuesday. It was among the worst forms of crime, he said. The Chief Justice, leading a three-judge Bench, was hearing the case for granting bail to 11 former khap panchayat members who ordered the murder of a Dalit boy, his cousin and a girl. The boy had eloped with the girl. The cousin had helped them run away. They returned to the village a few days later, thinking the anger had cooled. They were caught and hanged from a tree. The genitals of both the boys were burnt before they were hanged. The gruesome incident happened at Mehrana village in Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh in 1991. The Uttar Pradesh government objected to the bail plea on health grounds.

However the approval for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was more problematic as the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the CDSCO had called for additional data from the Phase-III trials, but “appears to have been pressured overnight into reconsidering its decision.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/criticism-of-vaccine-approval-continues/article33515598.ece

Tapan Misra alleged he was poisoned with deadly arsenic trioxide on May 23, 2017, during a promotion interview at ISRO headquarters here. “Fatal dose was probably mixed” with chutney along with dosa, in snacks after lunch, he said through a Facebook post.

He had earlier served as Director of Ahmedabad-based Space Application Centre of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). In a Facebook post titled ‘Long Kept Secret’, Mr. Misra further claimed that in July 2017, Home Affairs security personnelmet him and alerted him of arsenic poisoning and helped doctors to focus on exact remedy. He claimed he suffered from health issues including severe breathing difficulty, skin eruptions, skin shedding and fungal infections. He also posted the medical report on social media to claim he has been diagnosed with Arsenic toxication by AIIMS. “The motive appears to be espionage... to remove a scientist with critical contribution of very large military and commercial significance, like expertise in building Synthetic Aperture Radar,” he alleged.

She said, “The Uttar Pradesh government’s intention towards women security is suspect.” “In Hathras, the government administration did not listen to the pleadings. The government protected officials and suppressed the victim’s voice. In Budaun, the police officer neither listened to the pleadings nor did he examine the place of the incident. The U.P. government’s intention on women’s security is flawed,” Ms. Vadra tweeted. The 50-year-old woman was gangraped allegedly by a priest and two others at a temple complex.

Mr. Jagga Reddy said that it has been two years since the TRS government was voted to power again and it concentrated only on elections, not promises. “All the MLAs including those from the TRS are under tremendous pressure to perform.” “Development is seen only in Siddipet, Gajwel and Sircilla constituencies at the cost of the entire Telangana.

07 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Crime Branch launches probe into lending apps||The Crime Branch has opened a prefatory investigation into the workings of increasingly popular mobile phone applications that extend loans and cash advances to subscribers without much collateral or red-tape. S. Sreejith, Additional Director General of Police, Crime Branch, told The Hindu that the inquiry would determine whether such impromptu financing land citizens in extortionate debt traps, rendering borrowers vulnerable to intimidation and suicide. The Crime Branch would also probe whether the attractively packaged mobile phone-based loan schemes had Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sanction. Mr. Sreejith said so far the police have not stumbled upon any criminality. However, the agency would investigate whether the digital financial operations violated the law. The CB has sought information from police stations across Kerala on money lending-related crimes and unnatural deaths. SPC directive State Police Chief (SPC) Loknath Behera had ordered the probe based on reports that the law enforcement in Telengana had busted a racket that threatened borrowers who defaulted payment. The police learnt from their counterparts that the “mobile phone loan application” racketeers stole the personal information stored on the mobile phones of debtors and used the data to blackmail, vilify or harass them into repaying loans. The suspects also created WhatsApp groups of borrowers. They used the groups to threaten and shame them into meeting the conditions of their mortgage. The police said women were victims of the racket in several States. Many borrowers seemed unable to escape the vicious debt cycle and had attempted suicide. However, Kerala has not reported any such incident so far. Mr. Behera has asked the CB to get more information about the racket from other State law enforcement and the Interpol. He has asked the agency to use the High-Tech Cyber Inquiry Cell services to gauge the penetration of mobile phone application-based advance-pay and loan services in Kerala. Another official said offshore investors beyond the pale of the country’s law appeared to control the operations. However, the police could book their local agents if found guilty of charging excessive interest or using high-handed methods to recover loans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/crime-branch-launches-probe-into-lending-apps/article33515559.ece

Once the culling and sanitation drive was completed, the Animal Husbandry Department would carry out a surveillance activity over a radius up to 10 km from the hotspots for one week, Mr. Raju said. Regarding the compensation to farmers, he said that the amount would be transferred to the beneficiary bank accounts. District Animal Husbandry Officer P.K. Santhosh Kumar said that the culling operations were nearing completion. “Culling of birds is almost over except in one place at Karuvatta. The process will be completed by Thursday,” he said.

07 January 2021||Aruppukottai,TAMIL NADU||Tension near Tiruchuli over non-release of water||Tension prevailed at Maili, a village near Tiruchuli, after villagers blocked a road leading to Keezha Idayankulam as people of that village had failed to let surplus water flow from their tank to Maili tank, on Tuesday. Tiruchuli police have booked two cases against people of Maili on several counts for unlawful assembly, preventing Government employees from discharging their duty and criminal intimidation. The villagers have been demanding the Revenue officials to let the water “blocked” by the people of Keezha Idayankulam flow to their village tank. The dispute has been going on for nearly three years. “After we appealed, Revenue officials dug up a channel to allow the overflowing water from their tank to drain into Maili tank. However, it was blocked again,” said a resident of Maili, B. Karuppiah (37). Villagers of Maili had surrendered their ration cards at the Tiruchuli Taluk office in November after the officials failed to help them. Though the Tahsildar then promised to resolve their issue at the earliest, no action was taken till Tuesday. “The tahsildar is avoiding us and not meeting for the past several days,” he added. Irked over this, scores of villagers, including women and children, blocked the Tiruchuli-Rameswaram road at Maili junction. After prolonged protest, they surrendered their voter identity cards. Suddenly, when they blocked the road leading to Idayankulam with stones and mud, the police chased them away. Revenue Divisional Officer (Aruppukottai), K. S. Murugesan, said that water that used to flow from Keezha Idayankulam to Maili had stopped years back after the supply channel got silted up over the years. “In the intervening period, water was being released into Maili in a local adjustment. But, after the issue was taken up to the Court and as the case is still pending, officials were unable to help,” he said. After the Tuesday’s protest, police have been deployed to prevent any untoward incident. The villagers demand that a permanent solution be found so that the water was available for irrigating around 140 acres of land in Maili and Nattakulam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tension-near-tiruchuli-over-non-release-of-water/article33515743.ece
07 January 2021||B. Tilak Chandar,TAMIL NADU||HC notice to Centre, State on plea against online loan apps||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered notice to the Centre and the State on a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to the government to ban online instant loan apps. The petitioner complained that the apps were not regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and were charging interest at exorbitant rates. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi ordered notice on the PIL petition filed by advocate S. Muthukumar of Madurai. The petitioner said several people had ended their lives due to harassment at the hands of the employees of online loan providers for default in payments. Pointing to several such instances of harassment, the petitioner said when there was default in payment, the employees of online loan providing companies would indulge in verbal and sometimes even physical harassment of the debtors. Their photographs would be circulated on social media as those of defaulters, he said. Representing the petitioner, advocate A. Kannan submitted that many people had fallen into the trap of these online loan providers without verifying their antecedents. These online applications which had not obtained approval from the RBI were available on platforms like Google Play Store, he said. He submitted that the apps were run by people headed by Chinese nationals. These Chinese nationals were transferring huge sums to shell companies which were registered as non- banking financial companies (NBFC) in India with Indians as directors. A thorough probe was required into such transactions, he said. Apart from seeking a direction to the government to ban online loan applications, the petitioner also sought a direction to the Centre and the State to frame appropriate laws in this regard to tackle online loan providers and websites charging exorbitant rates of interest and to constitute a special team to investigate the shell companies. Taking note of the submission, the judges observed that such activities had to be regulated and sought a response from the Centre and the State. Assistant Solicitor General L. Victoria Gowri accepted the notice on behalf of the Centre and Special Government Pleader K.P. Krishnadoss accepted it on behalf of the State. The case was adjourned till February 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-notice-to-centre-state-on-plea-against-online-loan-apps/article33515737.ece
07 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Another study likely to be done on ECR stormwater drain plan||Another independent study is likely to be prepared to ensure that natural habitats will not be affected by the Rs. 270 crore project to construct an integrated storm water drain (SWD) network in localities along the East Coast Road (ECR), the German funding agency that has agreed to fund the project said recently. However, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), the implementing agency, said it had not received any communication in this regard. A letter written by Norbert Barthle, MdB (Member of the German Bundestag), Parliamentary State Secretary to German Members of Parliament, and its English translation was circulated in social media. In the letter, Mr. Barthle said construction would not be carried out near the beach, and no payments would be made until this was clarified. R. Balakrishnan, treasurer, VGP Golden Seaview Residents Welfare Association, Palavakkam, whose association has been fighting against the project, said that the translation of the letter stated the project proponent prepared an extensive study, also including an environmental and social impact assessment as part of the project preparation. The study concluded that no additional environmental clearance was required because stormwater management projects were exempt by law and the project was not located in a permit-required zone under the Coastal Zone Regulation Notification. These findings were confirmed in 2017 by an independent consultant prior to the signing of the financing agreements and were supplemented by another study, the letter said.  Official sources in the Corporation said they did not receive any such communication. “We have not requested any funding since 2016, the day the agreement was signed by the Corporation and KfW. Till date, we have not sought any transfer of funds,” sources said. This work was taken up based on a retroactive financing agreement that after the civic body incurs full expenditure, it would be reimbursed after producing bills, sources added. “Till date we have not paid for any of the works as not even 5% of the work has been completed in the project,” the official said. It may be recalled that five German Members of Parliament had recently written to the German Development Bank, KfW, expressing concern over financing the construction of stormwater drains along ECR, allegedly without assessing environmental impact. This came after a representation from residents of various welfare associations along the ECR, who are against the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/another-study-likely-to-be-done-on-ecr-stormwater-drain-plan/article33516214.ece

Radhakrishnan said on Wednesday. A dry run has already been conducted at 17 sites, in five districts, on January 2. “We need to check the designs of rooms for waiting, vaccination and observation, the entry points and the availability of space and time taken to cover 100 persons a day. All these aspects will be rehearsed during the dry run,” the Health Secretary told reporters, following an inspection of the Government Medical Stores Depot, of the Union Health Ministry, in Periamet. The State has readied 51 walk-in coolers, he said, adding: “Vaccine supply will be through the Central government. The Government Medical Stores Depot of is located in Chennai, and we conducted a rehearsal here, along with the Joint Director (Immunisation) and those in-charge of cold chain, receipt and despatch. There are two walk-in coolers, exclusively for COVID-19 vaccines, here.” The Government Medical Stores Depot covers southern States, and is preparing to reserve private storage facilities too, he said. “We are waiting for clarity on supply from the Centre. We have a storage capacity of 2.5 crore doses. The Government Medical Stores Depot has to cover all southern States. So we have said that if necessary, they can store the vaccine in our facilities as well,” he said. The State already has a stock of 17 lakh syringes. “The Centre has allotted 33 lakh syringes for the State in the first phase. Of these, we have received 28 lakh. This will be allotted to every health unit district, on the basis of the population of healthcare workers. When the Centre gives us the vaccine supply schedule, we will be ready with all measures to start vaccinations,” the Health Secretary said. The syringes will be sent to the 45 warehouses in these districts, from Wednesday night, he said. In the first phase, six lakh healthcare workers in the government and private sector, and the Armed Forces, will be vaccinated. While 47,000 vaccine sites have been readied, healthcare workers will be covered at nearly 3,000 sites, with 100 persons being vaccinated in a day. Along with the dry run, a physical inspection of the facilities will also be conducted to ensure a hassle-free environment for vaccination. FAQs on the vaccine and pamphlets on COVID-19 awareness are being prepared for distribution, he said. “The Union Health Minister is holding a meeting with Health Ministers of all States on January 7. A suppliers’ meeting is also going on,” he said.  Once the healthcare workers and frontline staff are covered, vaccination will be open for the elderly, he said. Noting that vaccination is voluntary for the general population, he said many were showing interest in the COVID-19 vaccine. He said the government had prioritised persons aged over 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccine-dry-run-from-tomorrow-health-secy/article33515708.ece

Shihabudeen alias Sirajudeen alias Khalid, 39, of Chennai, was arrested soon after his arrival from Qatar at Chennai airport. He was cited as an absconding accused in the murder of Wilson on January 8 last year, by suspected ‘jihadi’ terrorists while he was on duty at the check-post along Kaliyakkavilai Market Road in Kanniyakumari district. The case was re-registered by the NIA in February 2020. Two murder suspects Abdul Shameem and Thowfeek were later arrested. During the course of investigation, the roles of suspects Khaja Mohideen, Mahboob Pasha, Ejas Pasha, Jaffer Ali and Shihabudeen in the conspiracy to carry out the “terrorist act” was revealed, the NIA said in a press release on Wednesday. Besides, the assistance provided to the assailants in procuring illegal firearm and prohibited ammunition for waging “violent jihad” also came to light. In July 2020, the agency had filed a chargesheet against Abdul Shameem, Thowfeek, Khaja Mohideen, Mahboob Pasha, Ejas Pasha and Jaffar Ali under various sections of IPC and also invoked provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention Act) and the Arms Act. Investigation continued against Shihabudeen. Evidence revealed that he had arranged the illegal fire arm used by Shameem and Thowfeek to commit the offence, the NIA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nia-arrests-suspect-in-si-murder-case/article33515724.ece

The EAC directed the sub-committee to also discuss the findings with a team from the National Institute of Ocean Technology, the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), the Tamil Nadu State Coastal Zone Management Authority and the Department of Fisheries. The Department of Fisheries proposed to construct two training walls on the north and south side of the lake at the bar mouth, which will provide access to fishermen throughout the year. It also proposed to dredge the channel after the construction of the wall. The EAC deferred the proposal for want of further details. Impact on wildlife The EAC directed the project proponent to submit the report of a study already conducted by SACON on the proposed project’s impact on migratory birds since the Pulicat Bird Sanctuary is located within 10 km of the project site. It has also sought data on fisheries and their decline observed in the past years. Since the proposal is related to making a permanent opening at the bar mouth, data on salinity of the lake is also important. Available data on salinity of the lake over the past 10-20 years shall be submitted, the EAC said. The committee also said it would be too premature to consider the proposal for construction of the training walls from a Coastal Regulation Zone perspective as the Comprehensive Shoreline Protection Management Plan of Tamil Nadu was awaiting approval.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eac-defers-pulicat-lake-wall-proposal-seeks-more-details/article33516221.ece

But the thespian’s acting in the scene, depicting the hanging of the warrior, is broadly in tune with an account of Major John Bannerman of the East India Company. Bannerman, who led a force to take on Kattabomman (1760-1799), the poligar (local chieftain) of Panchalankurichi (now in Thoothukudi district), paid encomium to the latter in his eight-page report, written in cursive style and sent to Governor Edward Clive (1754-1839), who held the post during 1798-1803 and who was the son of Robert Clive, the first British administrator of Bengal. The report, which spelt the name of the warrior as “Cataboma Naigue,” was prepared on October 17, 1799, the day after the execution of Kattabomman. It was received at the Fort St. George, the seat of power of the authorities, on November 8, 1799. Being preserved at the office of Archives and Historical Research here, this report is among the documents to be digitised soon. At present, a software is being developed for indexing and retrieving scanned documents. The retrieval software will be installed initially on local intranet and later on the Internet, according to a plan of the department. Among the benefits of the digitisation project is to do away with physical handling of the records and facilitating easy search and retrieval of the documents. Initially, survey records, most sought-after government orders and records of the East India company and British administration, prior to the 1857 uprising, will be covered, an official said. Describing the manner and behaviour of Kattabomman at the time of his trial as “undaunted and supercilious,” Bannerman had this to say in his document: “It was reported to me that in his way to the place of execution [in Kayathar of Thoothukudi], he expressed some anxiety for his dumb brother [Oomaithurai] alone...” During the trial, Kattabomman “frequently eyed” the Ettayapuram (also in Thoothukudi) poligar, who “had been so active in attempting to secure his person” and the poligar of Sivagiri (now in Tenkasi district) with “an appearance of indignant scorn”. When he went out to be executed, he “walked with a firm and daring air, and cast looks of sullen contempt on the poligars to the right and left as he passed”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kattabommans-execution-record-to-be-digitised/article33516232.ece

07 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ensure right of passage to elephants in Coimbatore forest division: HC||The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the State government and the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) to come up with a plan on ensuring the right of passage to elephants and consequently, avoiding frequent man-animal conflicts in Coimbatore forest division. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy observed that at least some elephant corridors, if not all, should be cleared of human intervention and the pachyderms must be given the freedom of movement that they deserve.  Illegal brick kilns The first Division Bench directed the PCCF to chalk out a plan and submit a detailed report before the court after serving a copy on S. Muralidharan who had filed a public interest litigation petition complaining about numerous illegal brick kilns in Thadagam valley. The directions were issued after finding that the PCCF, in his counter affidavit, had conceded there was an increase in man-animal conflicts in the recent years due to development activities extending up to forest fringes where the elephants used to move about freely. However, the PCCF went on to add that securing elephant corridors involved “a lot of social issues and it needs lot of coordination between various departments and cooperation of the local public. It also involves huge implications mainly to be paid as compensation to the affected people.” According to PCCF Syed Muzammil Abbas, all elephant corridors across the country were affected by development activities and human interference in one way or the other. He agreed with the PIL petitioner that only Masinagudi-Segur corridor had been secured so far due to court intervention.  Many impediments “Securing a corridor anywhere in the country will face several impediments… Every form of life has a right to survive and any action taken to safeguard one should not adversely affect the survival of other form of life. Humans and wildlife must co-exist,” the counter read. Mr. Abbas went on to state that in Coimbatore forest division, the elephants move from Kerala towards the forests in the Nilgiris eastern slopes every year. “The forest is contiguous and strictly speaking, it is not a corridor at all as per the true meaning. “During such migration, the elephants tend to stray out attracted by juicy horticultural/agricultural crops grown in the vicinity of the reserved forests,” he said and submitted data of the number of human and elephant deaths recorded in the forest division in the last nine years. He also agreed that mushrooming of brick kilns in the vicinity of the forest area had some adverse effect on the wildlife and the environment. He said elephants used to stray into human habitations on being attracted towards palmyra used as fuel wood in the brick kilns. Stating that the forest department had sensitised the brick kiln owners against the use of palmyra, he said the kilns had now stopped using palmyra as firewood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ensure-right-of-passage-to-elephants-in-coimbatore-forest-division-hc/article33515789.ece

The Education Department has asked schools to submit feedback by January 8 and has laid down guidelines for conducting these meetings. The department has already released a draft Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) covering safety protocols to be followed on campus and in hostels for the students. “We have been calling parents in batches of 10 and will be speaking to them till Thursday. A clearer picture of what the parents are in favour of will emerge tomorrow,” said R.C. Saraswathi, headmistress, Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Ashok Nagar. With students of Classes 10 and 12 scheduled to take their board examinations this year, several private schools and teachers’ associations have been stressing the need to meet the students for at least a month or two to help them prepare. The draft SoP released specifies that students will be allowed in batches of not more than 25 and that physical distancing norms will have to be strictly maintained. “For students availing themselves of hostel facilities in residential schools like ours, we are speaking to the parents about the safety measures that will be put in place in their dormitories, dining halls as well as hygiene with regard to laundry, sanitising the campus regularly and other such aspects,” said C. Satish, director, Paavai Group of Institutions. Schools hosting the meetings have been asked to brief the parents in detail about the SoPs and ensure that they are aware of the steps to be taken before they arrive at a decision. Similar consultation meetings were held in November to discuss the possibility of reopening schools for Classes 9 to 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/meetings-on-reopening-schools-under-way/article33515685.ece
07 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Theatre owners mull raising ticket prices||The Centre’s letter, asking the State government not to dilute the Disaster Management Act by allowing cinema halls to operate at full seating capacity from January 10, has come as a rude shock to the film industry that was pinning its hopes on actor Vijay’s much-awaited Master to rekindle business in Tamil Nadu.  However, in light of pandemic-related concerns taking centre stage, they have proposed raising ticket prices. Actor Vijay had reportedly met Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to urge him to allow theatres to screen movies with 100% seating capacity. Much-awaited release Mr. Vijay’s latest action film, rumoured to have been produced at well over Rs. 100 crore, has been widely anticipated for almost a year, and theatre owners and producers were eager to see if fans and families would return to the theatres in good numbers. But the new lockdown, in international Tamil movie markets such as England, and the rising cases in the United States and Europe, coupled with the State government’s decision being questioned by the Centre has left investors staring at a steep economic loss. Tiruppur Subramanian, president, Tamil Nadu Theatre and Multiplex Owners’ Association, said the ball was now in the State’s court. “We will wait for the State government’s decision tomorrow. The producer will also take a call based on what the decision is,” he said. Stakeholders in the film business said the producer of such a big budget film would not be able to recoup his money if theatres are allowed to operate only at 50% capacity. However, theatre owners that The Hindu spoke to said that a few had reportedly advised producer Lalit Kumar to request the State government to issue a special government order, allowing theatres to charge special rates, until restrictions on seating capacity are removed eventually. “We have told the producer to seek a G.O. that will allow us to double the rate of tickets or fix special prices while operating movie halls at 50% seating capacity. This will resolve the issue of economic loss for the producer even if a film releases at just 50% seating capacity,” the owner of a well-known multiplex in the city said. A well-known producer said the film’s producer was left with few choices. “They can wait for a few more months until vaccines become available for COVID-19 or they can sell the film to an OTT platform. But a simultaneous release on an OTT platform and in theatres is out of the question,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/theatre-owners-mull-raising-ticket-prices/article33515712.ece

Residents said all the hard work and money spent to renovate the lake a few years ago had been made futile by the unauthorised dumping of garbage. The lake is located a few kilometres from the Pallavaram Periya Eri, and was spread over more than 10 acres but was split into two portions with the laying of Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road. While the south portion of the lake was renovated by the Pallavaram Municipality last year, the north portion was desilted and deepened in 2019 through the efforts of the residents in the locality at a cost of over Rs. 20 lakh. Pasumai Babu of Pasumai Peruga Sutham Sey, a non-governmental organisation, involved in protecting waterbodies in and around Pallavaram, said all the effort and funds to clean the northern portion had been wasted. He alleged that the lake was already falling victim to encroachments. Though the officials of the Municipality were removing the garbage from the lake using excavators on Sunday, residents complained that mounds of plastic waste had ingressed and ecologically damaged the lake. Social activist V. Santhanam said while the State government took steps to protect Pallavaram Periya Eri, the local officials had failed to maintain the lake. He also complained that the police had not taken any steps and was yet to even give a community service report for the complaint filed against the waste dumpers on December 31, he charged. Pallavaram Municipality Commissioner C. Mathivanan said the south side of the Putheri Lake was renovated through the Corporate Social Responsibility funds. He said the municipality had removed over four lorry loads of garbage and has proposed to install CCTV cameras to prevent further illegal dumping.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dumping-of-garbage-in-putheri-lake-irks-residents-and-activists/article33516216.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the direction on a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate A.P. Suryaprakasam. The judges directed the Health Secretary to file a detailed report before the court after eight weeks. Though the petitioner had confined his plea to the Greater Chennai Corporation limits, the judges extended the relief to other cities and towns also where unhygienic conditions were prevailing, leading to the growth of the larvae in stagnant water. Educating citizens The court stated that regular attempts must be made to clear such stagnant water and to educate the citizens to cover water collected for future use. It also insisted on regular monitoring by officials, especially in areas vulnerable to dengue outbreaks. Special attention must be paid to places such as fishing colonies, which were prone to water stagnation, the Bench added.

Four fishermen, Arumugam, 60, Jayaseelan, 30, Madhan, 25, and Mahendran, 45, the owner of the boat, ventured out to sea to fish. As they were returning around 8 a.m., they waited for a rip current to move away. However, a piece of cloth got caught in the boat’s propeller and it was toppled by strong waves. Marine Commandos Loganathan and Sandhana Sekhar, who were patrolling the shore, saw this and blew the whistle to alert their teammates — Gunasekara Pandian, M. Jeevanandam, P. Isakki Raj and M. Mohamed Firdouse — who were at the Marina Beach Rescue outpost on the shore. “The wetsuit-clad commandos swam into the sea with life buoys and jackets and rescued the fishermen. All of them were caught in the net, and after much struggle, they brought them back to safety. A. Satish Kumar, owner of SUP Marina, a paddling club, and its member Dhanush, also joined in the rescue efforts,” a senior TNFRS officer said. Arumugam and Jayaseelan were injured badly and were rushed to hospital. Following the inauguration of the TNFRS Marina Beach rescue station last year, a rescue outpost was also set up on the shores of the beach recently. “We have been provided All Terrain Vehicles and Jet Skis. Our team members are trained in kayaking, swimming and paddling, among other water rescue methods,” said Priya Ravichandran, Joint Director of the TNFRS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnfrs-commandos-rescue-fishermen-from-capsized-boat/article33516219.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy ordered notices to the Government of Puducherry, the Centralised Admission Committee (CENTAC), the National Medical Commission and the colleges concerned. When senior counsel A.R.L. Sundaresan, representing the colleges, stated that first round of counselling was already over, the first Division Bench ordered that the admissions made this year would be subject to the result of the writ appeal. In his verdict, the single judge had criticised the Government of Puducherry and CENTAC for issuing a prospectus for admissions and then making a claim that the three private colleges in the Union Territory must hand over 50% of seats to the government quota. He said that if the government was very sure about the requirement, it should have included it in the prospectus itself. Instead, a prospectus had been issued stating that each college would share only 55 seats, out of their permitted intake of 150, to the government quota, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-admits-appeal-on-allotting-medical-seats-to-government-quota/article33516437.ece

The doctors implanted the new heart valve through the femoral vein, a blood vessel in the groin. According to a press release, the 23-year-old patient had undergone open heart surgery for ventricular septal defect at the age of five. He had undergone a repeat open heart surgery to replace the tricuspid valve with a prosthetic heart valve five years ago in Delhi as he developed leakage of blood on the right of his heart through the valve, causing fatigue, leg swelling and rapid heart beating. He presented with degeneration of the prosthetic tricuspid valve, while a balloon valvuloplasty done at a different hospital did not yield satisfactory results. He approached the Cardiology department of CMC where the structural heart and valve clinic team evaluated him and found that the prosthetic tricuspid valve had become very narrow and was causing his symptoms. If left untreated, this could lead to progressive deterioration of right heart function. The structural heart team of Cardiology unit-2 has been running a non-surgical or percutaneous valve implantation programme for the last five years. A team of cardiologists of the unit — John Jose, Harsha Teja, Jesu Krupa, Abraham Speedie and Paul V. George — along with the cardiac anaesthetic team planned the procedure. Doctors said that their experience in replacing the aortic and pulmonary heart valves through the percutaneous route helped in implanting the artificial tricuspid valve. Despite the challenges in the patient — such as risk of acute deterioration of right ventricular function since his pulmonary pressures were already high, risk of valve thrombosis and alteration of anatomy due to previous procedures — the implantation was done without any complications and he was discharged in a week, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cmc-doctors-perform-non-surgical-replacement-of-tricuspid-valve/article33516515.ece

Last week, the CCB arrested four persons, including two Chinese nationals, in Bengaluru for operating illegal online instant loan apps. A team conducted a raid at a call centre in Bengaluru where 110 telecallers were working. Two directors of the company were arrested. Upon being interrogated, they revealed the involvement of three Chinese nationals in the operation. Two of them were also arrested. The team analysed call records of a mobile phone used by one of them, and the inquiry revealed that the SIM card was obtained in the name of a Chennai-based firm.

Justice S. Vaidyanathan rejected the plea after Advocate General Vijay Narayan said there was absolutely no need to employ pharmacists since the doctors themselves would be dispensing medicines to patients at the mini clinics. According to the A-G, the mini clinics had been planned in villages that do not have primary healthcare centres. The clinics would be situated in small buildings of 200 sq ft with just three personnel — a doctor, a nurse and a hospital worker. The hospital worker would be dressing the wounds and the clinics were expected to cater to only about 20 to 30 patients a day. He said the writ petitioners, S. Vasanth Kumar and D. Karthik, office-bearers of the Tamil Nadu Registered Pharmacists Association, were under a wrong impression. Allaying their apprehension that nurses might dispense medicines to the patients at the mini clinics, the A-G said only the doctors would be doing so. He asserted that failure to employ pharmacists at mini clinics would in no way violate Section 42 of the Pharmacy Act of 1948, which states that no person other than a registered pharmacist can dispense medicines on the prescription of a medical practitioner.  The clinics would be situated in small buildings of 200 sq ft with just three personnel — a doctor, a nurse and a hospital worker||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-appoint-2000-pharmacists-at-amma-mini-clinics-dismissed/article33516228.ece

TNTJ members gathered in large numbers and besieged the officers who had come to seal the premises on Armenian Street, in Mannady, under the Enemy Property Act (EPA), for violation of condition of assignment of the building. CEPI officials had approached the Chennai District Collector to seal the property, assigned to TNTJ vice-president B. Abdul Rahman, for the specific purpose of running a lungi firm. Mr. Rahman is the general power of attorney holder, from Tuba Khaleeli, who is now in Pakistan, and is the title holder of the property [acquired before the partition of India]. “The power of attorney holder should not use the premises for any other purpose as per conditions of assignment. The assigned purpose is only to run a lungi firm. Since the premises is used for other purposes [housing the TNTJ office], it is considered a violation of conditions,” said an officer. CEPI officials, accompanied by revenue and police authorities, came to seal the premises around 2.45 p.m. However, TNTJ members resorted to a protest at the spot, leading to heavy police deployment. The incident sparked protests in other parts of the State as well. ‘In use for 12 years’ TNTJ north Chennai unit president M.A. Shahul said, “We have been using the property for 12 years. They wanted to seal the property without any notice. This is against the principles of natural justice.” Mr. Rahman contended that the premises was used “for several philanthropic and social activities”. The TNTJ has been paying rent, as stipulated, he said. Joint Commissioner of Police (North) V. Balakrishnan and other officers held talks with the cadre, promising to examine their demands, after which the protesters dispersed. “Talks are on to resolve the issue,” said an officer. CEPI is a statutory authority under the provisions of the Enemy Property Act, 1968 (amended in 2017), and a subordinate office under the Ministry of Home Affairs, Freedom Fighters Division. There are 9,406 “enemy properties” in India, of which 9,280 belong to Pakistan nationals and 126 to Chinese. The properties are vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property for India.  The assigned purpose is only to run a lungi firm.

07 January 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||MNM campaign remains urban-centric||Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan, who launched a spirited campaign urging the people to vote for ‘a change’ in the Assembly election, has energised supporters across the State. However, there is a feeling that he has not reached out to rural voters in significant measure, though he has toured some rural districts, including Dharmapuri. A dilemma While the party garnered much of its 3.72% share of votes in urban and semi-urban centres in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the fact that the MNM lacks popular leaders other than Mr. Haasan is proving to be an issue, as the onus falls completely on him to reach out to people in rural areas, party workers say. This has resulted in a dilemma: whether to retain the urban and semi-urban voters or to reach out to new voters in rural areas. “We are going to small towns to reach out to the people. We are a party that completely depends on our leader. We don’t have other popular faces, and he [Mr. Haasan] has already been campaigning from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m,” said Murali Appas, a spokesperson of the MNM who is accompanying Mr. Haasan on his tour. Star power MNM members hope Mr. Haasan’s star power, the media spotlight and his role as a television anchor would overcome these apparent issues. “The rural population is anyway watching television and using cell phones. The media attention he has received will compensate for not reaching out to the voters in villages. We will try to reach out to them in the second phase of the campaign. There are still four months left for the election,” an MNM leader said. There have been reports that Mr. Haasan would start shooting for a film titledVikram, to be directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, in the next few weeks. The film is expected to be politically loaded, aimed at a pre-election release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mnm-campaign-remains-urban-centric/article33516439.ece

07 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Centre told to spell out steps to prevent spread||The Madras High Court has directed the Centre to examine whether it is necessary to prescribe seven days of institutional quarantine to asymptomatic passengers arriving from all foreign countries, as well, and then conduct COVID-19 tests on them, at their personal cost, to prevent the spread of the new strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said the court was not an expert body to take a call on such issues. Therefore, they directed the Centre to obtain expert advice and inform the court of the developments, since a public interest litigation petition had been filed, raising certain genuine concerns. The judges also directed Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan to file a report by January 18 on the steps taken by the Centre, so far, to keep the new virus strain at bay. The direction was issued after the ASGI informed the court about India having banned all flights from the U.K., after the new strain was discovered there. However, a counsel representing the PIL petitioner, B. Ramkumar Adityan, told the court that it was not sufficient to just ban flights from the U.K. The petitioner’s counsel insisted that all international passengers arriving from other countries must be subjected to mandatory institutional quarantine for seven days and then be made to undertake COVID-19 tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-told-to-spell-out-steps-to-prevent-spread/article33515713.ece
07 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘People can differentiate politics from spiritualism’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday said the people of Tamil Nadu knew the difference between politics and spiritualism, and they could not be taken for granted. “Some try to make bhakti a commodity for politics. They try to take advantage of people’s spiritual leaning, since they do not have any ideology or achievements to boast about,” he said. Addressing a conference, ‘ Idhayangalai Inaippom’ (Let us unite hearts), organised by the DMK minorities’ wing in Chennai, Mr. Stalin said that while politics was the people’s right, spiritualism was something to do with their soul. “These two cannot be confused and used for short-changing people. Tamil Nadu’s politics has proved that,” he said. Reiterating that the relationship between the DMK and the minorities had continued for generations, Mr. Stalin said the late DMK leader, M. Karunanidhi, used to keep issues of Kudiarasu and Darul Islam publications, in the initial years of his political career, in Tiruvarur. “It was the Muslim community that acted as a bridge between DMK founder Anna and Kalaignar (Karunanidhi). Anna, who came to Tiruvarur to participate in Milad-un-Nabi, asked about Kalaignar and the meeting brought them together,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) became a reality because of the votes polled in favour of it by the AIADMK and PMK Lok Sabha MP Anbumani Ramadoss. “The Act has betrayed the interests of the Muslims and the Sri Lankan Tamils. But Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said it would not affect anyone. If a census is conducted, a lot of people will lose citizenship,” he said. Recalling late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s speech that her biggest mistake was an alliance with the BJP, he wondered whether Mr. Palaniswami was aware of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-can-differentiate-politics-from-spiritualism/article33515716.ece
07 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rainfall to continue till January 10: IMD||Rain over Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is expected to continue till January 10. However, it may not be as heavy as it had been over the past two days, according to the India Meteorological Department. Noting that the easterly waves impacted the wet weather over the State, officials said very heavy rainfall lashed some places, particularly Chennai’s suburbs, on Tuesday. During the last 24 hours, ending 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday, Kelambakkam recorded a maximum of 21 cm of rain, followed by Anna University and Tambaram with 16 cm. Many other places in and around the city, including M.G.R. Nagar (15 cm); Sholinganallur and DGP Office (14 cm); and Poonamallee, Korattur and Meenambakkam (13 cm) recorded appreciable downpours. Meanwhile, the weather station at Nungambakkam received 9 cm of rain. Officials noted that January’s record rainfall of 21 cm in 1915 was yet to be broken as Kelambakkam, that received torrential downpour, was in Chengalpattu. A few places in the State are likely to receive light to moderate rain till Friday and showers will pick up pace from Saturday and cover many places. While heavy rain may subside over Chennai, some areas may continue to experience light to moderate showers for two days. The city’s monthly rain during January has already reached 15.3 cm, which is one of the highest in recent decades. The Water Resources Department stopped discharge from Cholavaram lake as inflow had dropped since Wednesday. A marginal amount of water is being released from the Red Hills reservoir. Officials noted that a discharge of 30-40 cusecs would be maintained till the rain subsides. The department is letting out nearly 1,500 cusecs from the waterbody in Chembarambakkam and 750 cusecs from the Poondi reservoir as both the waterbodies continue to get considerable inflow from catchment areas upstream.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rainfall-to-continue-till-january-10-imd/article33515686.ece

07 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Congress leaders look to end ‘quota system’ in giving party tickets||Senior All-India Congress Committee and Tamil Nadu Congress Committee leaders are believed to have decided to end the “quota system” in distributing party ticket for this year’s Assembly election. Usually, a majority of the tickets are given on the basis of familial connections with leaders and associates of influential functionaries. A senior Congress leader told The Hindu that tickets would be distributed in an “objective, data driven manner”, instead of on the basis of the whims and fancies of some leaders. AICC Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Goa in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao is also expected to meet senior leaders and newly-appointed office-bearers on January 9 and 10 in Chennai. A party source said the Congress leadership had, through data in all constituencies, examined possible scenarios like the number of seats the DMK could win, with and without the Congress. “Previously, what used to happen was that leaders would pick constituencies based on where they had some [viable] candidates or they would field their sons and daughters. This time, Rahul Gandhi and senior leaders like P. Chidambaram have agreed that we are not going to go down that route,” he said. Another leader said the Congress had identified around 75 seats where it had a presence and could make a difference. “We have made three lists of 25 constituencies, based on our preferences. We will decide on the candidates based on what they have done in the constituency, rather than whose relatives they are,” he said.  Gopanna, vice-president, TNCC, said the “quota system” should be eliminated. “What should matter is the winnability of the constituency and the candidate,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-leaders-look-to-end-quota-system-in-giving-party-tickets/article33516230.ece

Mr. Alagiri said the Madras High Court must monitor the CBI investigation to ensure that the real culprits are brought to book. “Only because of the Opposition’s pressure has the investigation now led to the arrest of the guilty AIADMK member.

07 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sagayam wants to retire on Jan. 30||The Tamil Nadu government has issued an order relieving IAS officer U. Sagayam from official duties, accepting his request for Voluntary Retirement from Service (VRS). However, Mr. Sagayam has requested that he be relieved on January 30, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He refused to receive the relieving orders issued on January 2. Mr. Sagayam had applied for VRS on October 2, 2020, the birth anniversary of Gandhi. He had indicated that he wished to be relieved either on December 30, the completion of 90 days of his request, as per rules, or on January 30, the death anniversary of Gandhi. The IAS officer is hoping for a favourable reply to his request from the government. He sought an appointment to meet the Chief Secretary in this regard. ‘Well within my rights’ “I only wanted to be relieved on a specific day. It is within my rights to make that request. When I sought an appointment, it was denied,” he said. A top official privy to the developments said, “We had issued the orders on January 2, after 90 days’ statutory period for withdrawal [of request for VRS]. As he had not withdrawn [his request], the orders were issued. He refused to receive it and wanted the date of retirement according to his convenience. There is no such provision. Hence, a reply is being sent to him.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sagayams-plea-on-retirement-date/article33515727.ece
07 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Bus stand work delayed as Corpn. takes time to settle land issue||Almost a year after it announced ‘Mission 365’ to complete in a year the Rs. 168-crore integrated bus stand project in Vellalore, the Coimbatore Corporation, it appears, has made little progress. The reasons for the slow progress were the civic body’s financial constraints and the title deed of the land where the bus stand was coming up showing Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board as the owner, said sources familiar with the developments, adding that the two issues were linked. At the time of finalising the project, the Corporation had said that the State Government would finance 50% of the project cost and it would meet the rest by raising a loan with Housing and Urban Development Corporation ( HUDCO). As it began construction and made some progress, the Corporation approached the Government for funds to be told that the civic body spend its share first and that the Government would chip in after sometime. So, when the civic body approached HUDCO for loan, it discovered that it was seeking loan for a project on a land whose records showed that the TWAD Board was the owner, the sources said. And, the TWAD Board was the owner of the land because after it executed more than 30 years ago the underground drainage scheme for the then Corporation covering Gandhipuram, R.S. Puram and a few other areas in core city, it did not go ahead and have the revenue records changed to show that the Corporation was the owner. The TWAD Board had worked on the land that measured 650 acre spread over two villages – Kurichi and Vellalore. While it managed to change the name in the part of the land that fell in Vellalore village it could not get in changed in the Kurichi part of the land and that was what was now causing the delay for the Corporation to tap HUDCO for funds, the sources explained Senior officials said the Corporation had begun steps to have the revenue records changed so that the records reflected its ownership and the civic body could avail of the loan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bus-stand-work-delayed-as-corpn-takes-time-to-settle-land-issue/article33516236.ece

07 January 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Palaniswami challenges Stalin to a debate on corruption charges||AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday challenged DMK president M.K. Stalin to an open debate on the corruption charges levelled by the latter. Addressing an election campaign ‘ Vetrinadai Podum Tamizhagam ’ (Tamil Nadu marches on successfully) in Anthiyur, Erode, he recalled that Mr. Stalin had submitted a memorandum to Governor Banwarilal Purohit, levelling corruption charges against him and some Ministers. “Where did the corruption take place? I am ready for a debate, at any place, and if he has the courage, he should take part in it, without any notes,” he said. According to him, the DMK government was the only one in the country to be dismissed on corruption charges [1976]. “They [the DMK] committed a rice scam, the Veeranam scam and a pesticide scam,” he said. He said the 2G spectrum scam [accused acquitted] had rocked the entire world, and “the scam kings” were now criticising the AIADMK government. Earlier, he raised doubts if senior DMK leaders, against whom cases were pending, would be able to contest in the Assembly election, as the Madras High Court had called for expediting trial in criminal cases involving elected representatives. At Bhavani, Mr. Palaniswami alleged that Mr. Stalin was holding ‘makkal gram sabhas’ only to blame the government and deceive the people. Recalling similar meetings prior to the last Lok Sabha polls, when Mr. Stalin collected petitions from the people, he wondered to whom he had submitted them, or what steps he had taken to resolve the grievances. At Punjai Puliyampatti, Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK president had “chased away” his elder brother M.K. Alagiri [expelled during former Chief Minister Karunanidhi’s time] to promote his son Udhayanidhi as successor. He wondered how Mr. Stalin could do good to the people when he could not accept his brother. “First let him save his party from splitting,” the Chief Minister said, accusing the DMK leader of trying to capture power through shortcuts. Asking whether the DMK’s 2006 electoral promise of giving two acres of land to the landless had been fulfilled, he alleged that party men were grabbing land. Contending that AIADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa lived for the people, he said the AIADMK government had taken action against anyone who had committed an offence. Whereas in the case of DMK, the leaders themselves had committed mistakes, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palaniswami-challenges-stalin-to-a-debate-on-corruption-charges/article33515721.ece

Tailored policies Campaigning in Bargur, the actor-turned politician appealed to the people on the premise that his party had tailored policies for everyone. MNM has tailored schemes for the youth, women, environment, Mr. Haasan said. “No other party articulated on the environment like MNM,” he said. Earlier, he campaigned in Hosur. Speaking to the electorate, Mr. Haasan said that Hosur should have grown on par with Bengaluru with its manufacturing capacity to produce from pin to plane. However, the town was stifled with bad traffic and poor infrastructure, and the fault lay with the governments of the past. He urged the youth to vote for change and be the tool that makes history. He also regaled the crowd by going multi-lingual, taking turns to speak in English, Kannada and Telugu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-haasan-urges-youth-to-vote-for-change/article33515774.ece
07 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court seeks details of candidates selected under PSTM category||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday sought a response from the State on the total number of candidates selected for viva voce under the Person Studied in Tamil Medium Category (PSTM) in recruitment to the post of Sub-Inspectors. The court was hearing the petition filed by the State seeking to vacate the stay on selection process. The court in December last stayed the entire selection process taking into account the submissions that the reservation under the PSTM category was not implemented properly. Taking up for hearing the petition filed by the State to vacate the stay, a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi sought details from the State. In a counter affidavit, Member Secretary of Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board and Additional Director General of Police J. Sandeep Rai Rathore submitted that vertical reservation (community wise) and horizontal reservation (sports quota, departmental quota) were followed in the selection process. Since PSTM was preferential treatment and not reservation, TNUSRB was implementing PSTM at the final stage which was the provisional select list. The 20% PSTM preference for candidates who studied in Tamil Medium would be given at the last stage. Unlike community reservation and sports quota which were statutory, PSTM was only a directive, he said. During the course of the hearing, Senior Counsel M. Ajmal Khan submitted that while Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) and Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB) were implementing the PSTM category at every stage of the selection process TNUSRB was doing so at the last stage and this would defeat the purpose of the PSTM Act. Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian told the court that the TNUSRB selection process involved three stages unlike the selection process of that of the TNPSC and the TRB. The PSTM category was applied at the last stage as it was a preferential treatment, the AAG reiterated. The case was adjourned till January 11.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-seeks-details-of-candidates-selected-under-pstm-category/article33516347.ece

Krishnasamy on Wednesday said the party would not rest unless and until its demand to bring all sub-sects under the Devendra Kula Vellalar umbrella was implemented by the Central and State governments. Presiding over a demonstration in the city, he said both the Central and State governments were taking their time to make an announcement. “We will not be cowed down by pressures and threats. With the single-point agenda to notify appropriately in the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe List and bring us under the Devendra Kula Vellalar category, we will continue to fight against the Edappadi K. Palaniswami's government,” he added. The PT had waited patiently for so long. The announcement made by the Chief Minister that the State government would recommend to the Centre for inclusion of the seven sub-sects, namely Kudumbar, Pannadi, Kaaladi, Kadaiyar, Devendrakulathar, Pallar and Vadhiriyar, under ‘Devendra Kula Vellalar’ was just a step forward. The government should take it up with the Centre and get it notified with 6% reservation, he reiterated. Puthiya Tamilagam, he said, would contest in 40 constituencies in the ensuing elections and prove its mettle in the Assembly. In an apparent reference to other Dalit groups and leaders who contested in ‘reserved’ constituencies in party symbols, he said that when the Devendrakula community looked for support on the issue, they remained silent and non-committal. The Devendrakula leaders would face the battle single-handedly, Dr. Krishnasamy said and claimed that the inclusion of Devendrakula Vellalar would in no way affect others. The sacrifices of the downtrodden people were not brought out in academic curricula as they should have been. As a result, the youth were unaware of the hardships faced by the SC community and demanded that the government take note of the errors in the syllabus.  Traffic goes for a toss  Vehicular movement was crippled due to the demonstration held on Palanganatham round-about. People returning from their offices were stranded as the traffic was choked. The TNSTC buses were the worst hit as the arterial intersection was encroached by PT cadre. Traffic police should give permission for meetings in a location that would not affect movement of vehicles, motorists said as they were stranded for over an hour. At a time when there was diversion at Periyar bus stand due to smart city work, the traffic jam at Palanganatham, extended up to the bus stand, on the one side, and beyond Alagappan Nagar on GST Road, on the other, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pt-demands-6-quota-for-devendra-kula-vellalars/article33516349.ece

PWD||The Tamil Nadu Public Works Department (PWD) has said the Puducherry Government owes it Rs. 99 lakh as maintenance charges and for release of water from Veedur dam in Villupuram district. The Veedur dam, commissioned in 1959, is now a major source of irrigation for villages in Villupuram district and the neighbouring Union Territory of Puducherry. Th canal system of the reservoir comprises 17.6 km, of which 16.3 km passes through Tamil Nadu and 1.3 km though Puducherry. The dam is located at the confluence point of the Varaha and Thondi Rivers and irrigates about 2,500 acres in Villupuram district and 1,000 acres in Puducherry. A senior official of the PWD requesting anonymity said that the amount was due since 2009 and is payable under the inter-state river sharing rules framed in 1966. “The Tamil Nadu government allots Rs. 30 lakh annually for taking up maintenance of the dam and its canals. As per the rules, the cost of maintenance of the canals and for water release had been fixed in the ratio of 16:5 by mutual agreement,” the official said. Paucity of funds “However, the territorial government has said that paucity of funds was among the reasons for the delay in settling the bills. The Puducherry government had also referred to obstruction in the flow of river water down the line due to natural rock formation,” the official also added.  Though repeated letters have been sent to the U.T. government seeking settlement of the arrears, it has not evoked any response, an official said, adding that the Auditor General had also indicted Puducherry for non-payment of dues for years together. Release of water from the dam to Puducherry was not stopped even once all these years, he said. The PWD has taken up restoration work on the dam at a cost of Rs. 43 crore to prevent encroachments and flooding and to increase the storage capacity. The canal system of the reservoir passes through six villages in the Union Territory and the Department cannot carry out restoration on their side until the Union Territory settles the arrears, an official said.

Speaking to reporters here, he said in Sivaganga Municipal limits, the UGD work was completed. During trial, it was noticed that some wrong connections had been given. In some locations, concrete had blocked pipelines. With the help of a suction-cum-jetting machine and water recycling gadget brought from Chennai Corporation, the blocks were being removed.

The Collector further said a survey on crop damage indicated that horticulture crops had suffered huge damage in some pockets like Ilayankudi. The final data, which was yet to be finalised, showed that chilli and plantain crops grown on 3,900 hectares by 8,891 farmers were destroyed in rains. “There need not be any apprehension among the farmers as the administration would recommend compensation,” he said. Paddy crop in Tirupuvanam too had suffered damage, Mr. Reddy said, adding steps were being taken to remove seemai karuvelam trees. To plant alternative saplings, nurseries were being developed in all the 445 panchayats. The Collector said he had inspected various ongoing works in panchayats.

When a section of farmers from Manamadurai block said the PWD had not released water for irrigation, the Collector said water was released from Periyar and Vaigai dams. However, the average rainfall in the block was below mark and hence water had not reached some portions in tail-end areas. The Collector said media persons had a big responsibility of bringing out reports to the notice of the officials who, in turn, would take them up for implementation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ugd-work-in-full-swing-collector/article33515745.ece

He also informed that the owners of all 223 registered poultry farms have been instructed to closely monitor their birds and inform the Animal Husbandry Department officials in case of any death of chicken in their farms. “On getting information about death, if any, the Animal Husbandry Department veterinarians will rush to the spot to collect the carcass and test it for the suspected virus so as to take the right action immediately,” Dr. Sameeran said.

07 January 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Incessant rain damages crops||Water logging was reported in Ammapettai and Peravurani areas in Thanjavur district. Incessant rain in the recent past has affected the standing crop which is ready for harvest. Waterlogging was reported on hundreds of acres in Puthur Kizhathope near Ammapettai during the last week of December 2020 when the crop was ready for harvest. The crop had flattened on the fields resulting in some sprouting, said R.Senthilkumar, Ammapettai Union secretary, Communist Party of India. Similar problem was faced at Sengamangalam, Ammaiyandi and Mavadukuruchi hamlets near Peravurani. Farmers urged the officials to visit the hamlets and inspect the damaged crop at the earliest to help them avail required compensation for the loss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/incessant-rain-damages-crops/article33515696.ece
07 January 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||Bus services to Kumili from Theni resume||The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation buses have started plying from Cumbum to Kumili from Wednesday. The services had suspended since April 2020 due to COVID-19 lockdown. The buses, which were catering to Kumili and Cumbum Mettu also operated to Kattapanai and Nedungandam in Kerala. Continuous rainfall in the ghat sections had forced the buses to remain off the roads even though the Tamil Nadu government had relaxed the curfew guidelines last year. Even when the e-pass system was introduced, farmers and workers going to Kerala travelled on motorbikes and other mode of transport, including share autos and jeeps. The highways authority had carried out repair works on the ghat section since December 24, 2020 and completed them on January 5 following which Collector M. Pallavi Baldev had ordered the operation of the TNSTC buses from Wednesday, the officials said. Commuters in Cumbum expressed their happiness over the resumption of bus services to neighbouring Kerala. The health officials appealed to the commuters to wear face masks without fail and maintain physical distancing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bus-services-to-kumili-resume/article33515733.ece
07 January 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||‘Vehicles transporting poultry from Kerala being scanned’||Taking stock of the measures taken to contain the avian influenza in the district, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam appealed to poultry owners and workers to be guarded and cooperate with the officials here on Wednesday. The district has 89 registered poultry farms and the owners have been told to monitor the chickens closely and report to the officials in the event of any death. The officials briefed the Deputy CM about the steps being taken at the checkposts on Kerala border. A team of multi-department officials were monitoring the movement of vehicles, especially goods transporting perishable commodities. Adding to the list was the transportation of chicken and other feeds. They said that only after proper screening, the goods from Kerala were being let into Theni. The poultry owners have also been told to sensitize their workers handling the chicken on their premises. A close watch was also being kept on the aquatic birds in coordination with the forest department officials, the officials said. Everyday, a little over 15,000 people travel to Kerala from various parts of Theni district for work in the estates there. On the one hand, there was a need to relax the curfew guidelines, and on the other hand, the officials had higher responsibility to ensure that the disease was contained and did not spread, which alone would help rebuild the economy, Mr. Panneerselvam said. District Collector M. Pallavi Baldev, Superintendent of Police Sai Charan Tejaswi, officials from the Animal Husbandry and Health department attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vehicles-transporting-poultry-from-kerala-being-scanned/article33515734.ece
07 January 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK–BJP alliance is strong to take on DMK’||The AIADMK–BJP electoral alliance is strong and can take on the DMK, the common enemy, in the forthcoming Assembly polls, BJP’s state vice-president K. Annamalai said. Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, Mr. Annamalai, who had come to participate in a function organised by a private coaching centre here, said there was no confusion in the AIADMK – BJP alliance as was being speculated on social media and in a section of the media. Though there were some contradictory remarks among the constituents of the alliance as the parties follow contrasting policies, it did not mean that it was an attempt to create ‘Third Front’, he said. On the possibility of new parties joining their alliance, Mr. Annamalai said it would be decided during the run up to the polls. When asked about the ‘BJP’s list of candidates’ that appeared in a section of the media, the former police officer said it was the handiwork of those who wanted to create confusion within the party. “The BJP, for conducting talks on seat sharing and identification of candidates, will form committees, which are yet to be decided. The central leadership will take a decision on this soon,” he said. On the confusion on naming the Chief Ministerial candidate following repeated remarks by the BJP’s State leaders, Mr. Annamalai said: “There is nothing new to say”. On the arrest of three more persons in the Pollachi sexual assault case, BJP’s state vice-president said the CBI, which was investigating the case, was doing its duty and the real culprits should get the harshest punishment for the crime that rocked the nation. Asked if Home Minister Amit Shah would hold talks with the party’s State leaders on alliance and other poll-related issues during his proposed visit to Chennai on January 14 to participate in a private function, he said he did not have his ‘tour programme’ and hence he could not comment on it. On former Union Minister M. K. Alagiri’s assertion that DMK president and his younger brother M.K. Stalin could never become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Annamalai said the voters of Tamil Nadu were keenly watching what a family member (of Mr. Stalin) was saying and would accept it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmkbjp-alliance-is-strong-to-take-on-dmk/article33515736.ece

07 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Efforts on to ensure peace in villages||A new concept of designating village vigilance police officers has been mooted to strengthen the intelligence collection mechanism and ensure peace and tranquillity in the villages. As per the plan, each revenue village will have a policeman. He will visit the village frequently to monitor anti social elements and their activities, if any. He will establish contacts with important personalities in the village so as to collect inputs on new comers or strangers and strange activities. He will collect all particulars about the village including population, caste groups, religious places, religious functions, social events and others. The head of the respective police station would introduce the designated police man to the village elders. A notice board would be installed in a prominent place with the contact numbers of him as well as important contact numbers of the police to enable the villagers to pass on any information. In turn, he will communicate with his superiors for follow-up actions. “The idea is to keep a close tab on each and every village on all angles of policing. It is a major step to ensure peace, brotherhood and tranquillity in the villages. Communal and caste clashes can be prevented at the brewing stages itself,” said H.M. Jayaram, Inspector General of Police, Central zone, after introducing the designated policeman to Panayakurichi village in Tiruverumbur police station and Irungalur in Samayapuram police station. He said the village vigilance police officers would have an index of 108 types of information. He would act as a primary information collector. He would act as bridge between police and the people. He said that there were 3,136 revenue villages and 10,362 hamlets in 9 districts. In Tiruchi district, there were 457 revenue villages and 1239 hamlets. A total of 2907 police personnel had been designated as village vigilance police officers so far. The concept had already come into force in most of villages. “It will be a game changer in maintaining law and order in villages. Crimes can be controlled to a great extent with the implementation of the concept in letter and spirit,’ says Mr. Jayaram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-on-to-ensure-peace-in-villages/article33515688.ece
07 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Full occupancy at theatres opposed||A section of citizens have opposed the move to allow cinemas to operate with full capacity stating that it would cause rapid spread of the novel coronavirus. The government on January 4 announced that all theatres would be permitted to accommodate 100% of their seat capacity from Pongal holidays. M. Sekaran on behalf of Citizen’s Forum wrote to the Chief Minister requesting that the move be revoked until the lockdown norms were discontinued in the state. It has caused fear amongst the public, who have followed the government guidelines to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Calling theatres non-essential sector, the forum said it would cause a second wave of COVID-19 cases. While the move is being criticized by the medical fraternity, many theatre owners were unsure of the days to come. ‘We are unable to sell even 50 tickets a day. If we get 100% occupancy, we will be elated. However, it is unrealistic to expect crowds amid the pandemic,’ a manager at a representative of Mangalam Cinemas said. The theatre would not anyway allow 100% occupancy, he noted. ‘We will increase the number of shows if the number of bookings increase. Our safety and safety of our customers is a priority,’ he said. He believed that due to increasing awareness of COVID-19, even with increasing the occupancy of the theatre, only up to 70% would be filled, he said. Many single-screen theatres wait for intimation from theatre owners’ association and adherence to COVID-19 rules. At a few other theatres, funds had run dry and workers had quit their job due to delayed or no payment. ‘If we release the film at our theatre, we will have to employ new workers. We are unsure whether we will be able to pay the deposits for the film,’ a manager at a single-screen in Thiruvanaikoil said. However, S. Sridhar, joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners Association, said that the government was helping theatre owners only.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/full-occupancy-at-theatres-opposed/article33515689.ece
07 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Crash barriers erected in Tiruchi||The State Highways Department has started erecting metal crash barriers along the Cauvery banks on Odathurai Road. Odathurai Road, which connects Tiruchi-Chennai By-pass Road and Chinthamani in the city, has emerged an arterial road, after the construction of the road over bridge across the railway level crossing a few years back. A large number of vehicles use the road to exit the city and join the by-pass road towards Chennai. However, as the road runs along the Cauvery and serves as its banks, there were several stretches which were felt unsafe for drivers. In an attempt to ensure road safety, the Highways Department has started erecting the metal crash barriers to prevent motorists from skidding over and crashing into the river. According to sources, the safety work has been taken up at a cost of about Rs. 50 lakhs sanctioned under the Comprehensive Road Infrastructure Development Programme 2020-21. “The crash barriers are being erected for a length of about 600 metres – from Tiruchi-Chennai Bypass to the Oyamari crematorium on the river side. The opposite side does not require such crash barrier,” an official said and pointed out that the road has been recently relaid. A few more works on construction of retaining wall and widening a culvert near the crematorium will be taken up later after the water flow in the river comes down. Welcoming the move, R.Gopalakrishnan a city resident, said the crash barriers were essential to improve road safety during night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crash-barriers-erected-in-tiruchi/article33515693.ece
07 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Sharp increase in milk procurement||The Tiruchi District Milk Producers Union, known as Tiruchi Aavin, has registered a sharp increase in milk procurement in December. The union has procured 5.05 lakh litres of milk on December 30. Three month period from September to November is said to be the peak season for milk procurement mainly due to the moderate temperature and availability of green and dry fodder in the period. Yield goes down in the winter season as the milch animals undergo stress due to chillness. The animals, which are raised in well covered shelters and provided a balanced diet in the winter season, only provide average yield. Yet, the Tiruchi Aavin has registered more than normal procurement. The daily average procurement of milk in December stood at 4,84,000 litres as against 4,53,000 litres during the same period in 2019. “It is a record procurement in the winter season. Except for a few days, the procurement has crossed 5-lakh litre mark,” says C. Karthikeyan, Chairman, Aavin, Tiruchi. He said that it was due to the consistent efforts on creating awareness among the farmers of methods to be followed in ensuring a balanced diet in the winter season. A system had been put in place to check the health of animals once in seven days. The Tiruchi Aavin had 13 veterinarians. They had been visiting the allotted societies once in a week to screen the animals to check their health. M. Vadivel Prabu, General Manager, said that out of 5 lakh litres, 1.15 lakh litre of milk was sold in Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur and 1.75 lakh litre was sent to Chennai through tankers daily. Remaining milk was sent to milk powder units in Thiruvannamalai and Erode. He said there were 1,81,650 registered farmers in 618 societies. They were paid regularly once in 10 days. In order to ensure transparency in payment, the Aavin had an arrangement to credit their due in their bank accounts. A. Munusamy, Assistant General Manager, said that bulk milk coolers had been functioning at 32 locations in Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur districts. More than a lakh litre of milk was processed at bulk milk coolers and sent directly to Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sharp-increase-in-milk-procurement/article33515697.ece
07 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Student develops automatic billing trolley prototype||The prototype of a shopping trolley fitted with a device to calculate the bill as one picks up goods, developed by a school student in Karur, promises to save not just time, but also add more value to the shopkeeper’s stock maintenance. S.S. Vikas, a class 11 student of Sri Sankara Vidyalaya in Karur, has developed the model that uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags and a small scanner fitted to a shopping trolley to help customers calculate the amount they are spending per item. “I started working on this project two years ago, when in Class 9. At that time, my aim was to simply reduce the time shoppers spent waiting to be billed for their purchases. Since last year, with lockdown and social distancing norms, my prototype will actually be a safer way to shop if it is adopted commercially,” Vikas said in a telephone interview. Vikas was helped by his teachers T. Satheesh Kumar and J. Rajasekharan in the design and execution of the project. Originally meant to be powered by electricity, the prototype now includes a battery alternative. In addition to the RFID, the device is being upgraded to be compatible with reading QR codes (a type of matrix barcode) as well. Neither type of coding requires the Internet to be functional. Besides the price, additional information such as weight, dates of manufacture and expiry, may also be added to the RFID tags. “At the end of the day, the shopkeeper can tally his or her earnings with the devices on the trolleys,” added Vikas. “Our school has many programmes for students aimed at innovative problem-solving. We have an Atal Tinkering Lab (a Central government initiative) on campus, which helps develop scientific and technological entrepreneurship skills. The automatic billing trolley was developed with the help of the lab,” said Mr. Satheesh Kumar. Most of the parts were sourced locally, he said. Vikas was presented with a citation of Rs. 10,000 by the Department of Science and Technology’s ‘Inspire Awards - Manak’ in November 2019, to prepare a model of the trolley for exhibition and enrolment in district-level science fairs and competitions. It was recently exhibited at the CODISIA Trade Fair complex in Coimbatore. Currently Vikas is studying Accountancy, and dreams of becoming a car designer one day. Thanking his teachers and school for their support, he said, “I faced many challenges in designing the automatic billing trolley. I hope it will be widely used in shops soon.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/student-develops-automatic-billing-trolley-prototype/article33515701.ece
07 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Dumping of garbage irks residents||Residents of Selva Nagar in the city are irked over indiscriminate dumping of garbage at an empty site in their locality. They say that attempts to remove the garbage by the civic body have failed to yield desired results. Private property in Selva Nagar, Pon Nagar in Karumandapam is filled with water due to the recent rain. The plot is used as a garbage dump yard by most residents in the area, residents in close proximity to the site say. ‘We have to lock up our windows and doors in the evening as mosquitoe breeding in the area is unbearable. Some houses closer to the plot keep their windows permanently shut,’ a resident said. The residents say that while sanitary workers of the civic body clean up the area regularly, the garbage continues to pile up. ‘Door-to-door garbage collection here is regular. The residents are irresponsible and do not hand it over to the workers,’ another resident said. A church is located close to the site and those visiting it for prayers are annoyed, he added. A small shop owner overlooking the site said that she had submitted several representations to the corporation seeking their intervention in the matter. She was involved in several quarrels regarding the matter, she said. ‘I have given up now. I see many residents of a nearby apartment complex throw garbage into the site when they drive past it. When I informed the civic body, they asked me to identify the miscreants. Is that my job? When I request them to stop throwing garbage in the site, they ask me to mind my own business, why should I be the bad person?’ she asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dumping-of-garbage-irks-residents/article33515691.ece

07 January 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||CITU stages road roko in support of farmers||The CITU cadre staged a road roko near the Collectorate on Wednesday in support of the farmers protesting in Delhi against the controversial farm laws. The police subsequently arrested 100 protestors, including 21 women. The protestors, led by R. Mohan, district secretary of CITU, raised slogans against the laws and expressed their solidarity with agriculturists who were agitating for over a month braving the hostile weather conditions prevailing in Delhi. The protestors said agitations being organised across the country in support of the farmers would subside only if the farm laws that “had been enacted in favour of Corporate firms” were repealed completely. They also dismissed the Centre’s proposal for amendments in the Acts. The protestors said the Modi-led Union Government, which was adamantly speaking in favour of the super rich and passing laws in their favour, should withdraw the laws completely instead of tarnishing the protestors as “terrorists and separatists”. The CITU protestors also said the Centre should stop its attempts to amend the Labour Welfare Laws in support of corporate firms. Any dilution in labour laws would decimate the working class completely as the workers would be forced to work without any time limit. While the Union Government should give Rs. 7,500 per family as ‘COVID-19 relief’, the Tamil Nadu Government should give a relief of Rs. 5,000 while giving the ‘Pongal Gifts’ to all unorganised sector labourers. The police arrested the protestors who were released in the evening. In Tenkasi, the police arrested 115 protestors, including 42 women, when they, led by district secretary Vel Murugan, staged a road roko near the Old Bus-Stand. Besides urging the State Government to form separate Labour Welfare Office for Tenkasi district, they wanted registration of beneficiaries, renewal, pension benefits etc. to be expedited by putting in place an online system for the newly formed district. In Thoothukudi, the CITU cadre organised road rokos at Thoothukudi, Tiruchendur and Kovilpatti where the police detained 111 persons. The protestors said the decision to privatize public sector undertakings should be given-up and the number of working days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Programme increased to 200 days from existing 100 days while upwardly revising the wages to Rs. 750 a day. The unorganized sector labourers should be given a monthly pension of Rs. 4,000, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/citu-stages-road-roko-in-support-of-farmers/article33516495.ece

The seeds of traditional paddy varieties such as ‘karunkuruvai’, ‘karuppu kavuni’, ‘sigappu kavuni’ and ‘seeraga samba’ were sown on 5 acres during July-August last year at the RKM farm in Rishiyur. As a section of the field where the traditional paddy varieties were sown was ready for harvest by the end of December, farm managers decided to use the harvesting exercise to create awareness of the market potential of these varieties. RKM Organic Farm, Rishiyur, which had forayed into traditional paddy variety cultivation with the support of the Nel Jayaraman Traditional Paddy Variety Protection Centre, Adhirangam near Thiruthuraipoondi, organised a meeting in memory of late Nammazhvar, organic farming proponent, and the reviver of traditional paddy varieties, Nel Jayaram, on their premises on January 4.

07 January 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Cong. protests against presence of AIADMK men during distribution of Pongal gift hampers||Members of Youth Congress staged a demonstration in front of the Virudhunagar Collectorate on Tuesday protesting against the presence of ruling AIADMK functionaries at cooperative societies during distribution of Pongal gift hampers, announced by the State government. Led by the district unit president, M.K.M. Meenachi Sundaram, the protesters raised slogans against the officials for allowing ruling party functionaries, who were not related to the cooperative societies, to be present at the ration shops. “We are not objecting to the Chairperson and other elected functionaries of the cooperative societies distributing the government welfare assistance, but only to those who are not part of the system,” he said. Against the rules, the ruling party men had erected fled boards with the AIADMK’s ‘Two Leaves’ symbol. “This is cheap politics being played by the ruling party to garner votes from the poor by making use of the government scheme. Let the AIADMK give such gift hampers from its party funds and get publicity for that,” he said. The ruling party not only violated the rules of the Cooperative Society, but also violated the Madras High Court order against erecting flex banners, he charged. The protesters handed over a memorandum to the Joint Registrar Cooperative, Dilipkumar. on the issue. “He (Dilipkumar) claimed that a circular has been issued to the secretaries not to entertain outsiders at the ration shops. If such violations continue, we will lay siege to the ration shops,” Mr. Meenachi Sundaram said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cong-protests-against-presence-of-aiadmk-men-during-distribution-of-pongal-gift-hampers/article33515739.ece
07 January 2021||Virudhunagar/Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Schools begin to get feedback from parents on reopening||Schools in Virudhunagar district on Wednesday began the process of getting feedback on the State Government’s proposal to commence physical classes for students of 10th and 12th after Pongal. “We have planned to complete by tomorrow the task of collecting opinions fromparents on re-opening of classes,” said Virudhunagar Chief Educational Officer, K. Baladhandayuthabani. The teachers would explain to the parents about the standard operating procedure announced by the Government on COVID-19 precautionary measures to be followed in schools. Heads of schools have been asked to collate the feedback and send it to the CEO’s office by Thursday afternoon. “Most parents in rural areas want the children back in the classrooms. This was the feedback we got when a similar exercise was conducted in September,” said the Headmaster of a Government higher secondary school in Virudhunagar. Another headmaster of a school in Madurai district said that parents who go out to work in rural areas feel that schools would provide safety to the girl students. However, headmasters feel that the biggest challenge would be to bring back all the students to the classrooms. “These children have remained out of school for 10 months and it will be difficult to make them sit attentively in the class,” one of them said. The Government should make attendance compulsory for the students as it will help in enforcement of minimum discipline. “Slow learners will always tend to remain out of classrooms. They might also try to discourage other students from attending classes. Besides, many students believe that there might not be final examinations this year too,” the Headmaster said. After making them physically present in the classrooms, the next step would be to mentally prepare them to be attentive during teaching hours. “Students usually tend to be playful for the first 15 days of schools after they come back from the two months summer break. Now, it has been 10 months since they attended physical classes,” he added. Though the officials say that there was ample space to provide physical distancing among students as students of only two classes would be present, one of the HMs suggested that the students should be divided in two batches. “Especially in co-education schools, the girls and boys can have classes in different sessions. Half of the classroom disturbances will be solved with this move. Besides, we can avoid students sitting closer while having lunch,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-begin-to-get-feedback-from-parents-on-reopening/article33515746.ece

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||It will be a hat trick defeat for DMK: Minister||AIADMK leader and Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar on January 5 claimed that the DMK would face a defeat in the Assembly elections for the third consecutive time. He said that the Opposition, led by the DMK, had attempted to mislead people by alleging there was a rift in the AIADMK, “but people would hand down a hat-trick defeat to the DMK”. Distributing Pongal hamper to Sholavandan residents, he told journalists that there were no differences between Chief Minister Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. “On the contrary, DMK president M.K. Stalin’s elder brother M.K. Alagiri had declared that the former could never become Chief Minister.” Out of frustration, the DMK leaders were trying to find fault with the AIADMK, he claimed adding this would not fructify. The Minister recalled Rs. 5,604 crore had been earmarked for the Pongal hampers. Besides, Rs. 484 crore had been allocated for purchasing 1.80 crore dhotis/sarees for free distribution. “The government, through Direct Procurement Centres (DPC) had purchased 32.41 lakh metric tons of paddy from farmers. This was a record in the history of T.N. In the last four years, Rs. 9287 crore had been given to farmers as compensation from insurance companies based on their claims. Similarly, 11.35 lakh women Self-Help-Groups in the State had got loan to the tune of Rs. 42785 crore through banks,” he said. Asked about corruption charges levelled by the DMK against some Ministers, he contended they were baseless. He claimed the charges were being levelled to divert attention from the upcoming hearing of an appeal against the acquittal of the accused, including DMK leaders, in the 2G scam case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-will-be-a-hat-trick-defeat-for-dmk-says-minister/article33515738.ece

Palanivel Thiagarajan on January 5 charged that the government treasury was empty and the ruling AIADMK had borrowed money to distribute the Pongal gift, which included Rs. 2,500 cash, to rice ration card holders. He said the DMK was not opposed to the distribution of gift hamper. “The DMK president had sought disbursement of Rs. 5,000 as financial aid for all those whose lives and livelihoods were crippled due to COVID-19,” he said. He alleged that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and the AIADMK had ignored this and were now claiming credit for distribution of the hampers, misleading the public. Addressing a Makkal Gram Sabha meeting in his Madurai Central constituency, he alleged that the Central and State governments wasted public money in the guise of implementing Smart City projects. He charged that the governments, without consulting residents and tax paying citizens, were attempting to bring in transformation, which would not be of any use to the people. Claiming that only the DMK could end such disconnect and provide relief, he urge the people to vote for the party in the upcoming Assembly elections and make Stalin the Chief Minister. Assuring the people of a change for the better, the MLA said that without holding elections to the Municipal Corporation, the government had hurriedly allocated funds for Smart City projects. “In the absence of Councillors, officials and Ministers were siphoning funds by awarding contracts to their favoured candidats,” he alleged. Recalling his father and former Speaker P.T.R. Palanivelrajan’s contributions, he said the people ought to give an opportunity to the DMK again in the elections for more development in an organised and transparent manner. Sharing his progress card as MLA with residents of S.S. Colony, he said, with the MLA Constituency Development Fund, he had built anganwadis, laid roads, dug borewells and also helped senior citizens with old age pension from the government. When people pointed to the bad roads in Madurai city, Dr. Thiagarajan attributed it to the poor planning of the civic authorities and asked them to wait for “just another 100 days”.

The first dry run on January 2 was held in 16 centres of five districts, including Bengaluru Urban. Apart from some minor software glitches observed during beneficiary verification in the Co-Win portal and issues related to space, the first dry run was successful. For the second dry run, five different types of hospitals will be identified as vaccine session sites in every district – District, Medical College hospital (government and private), Urban PHC, Rural PHC, Taluk hospital, Community Health Centre (CHC), and a private hospital where more than 100 healthcare workers have enrolled as beneficiaries. As many as 25 beneficiaries will be covered at every vaccine session site in the second run too. The Union Health Minister is holding a meeting with Health Ministers of all States on January 7 in this regard. Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare), said that the second dry run would look at the feasibility of all types of session sites. The design of the waiting room, vaccination room and observation room; the entry points; availability of space and time taken to cover the scheduled beneficiaries will be checked. While a total of 6,35,986 healthcare workers have been enrolled on the Co-Win application as on January 6, as many as 9,807 trained vaccinators and 28,427 vaccine sites are ready for the drive. The State has so far received 64 ice-lined refrigerators and 24 lakh syringes. These have been dispatched to the districts. An additional 31 lakh syringes will soon be provided by the Centre. Cold storage The State has around 2,855 cold chain points for storage and distribution of vaccines apart from 10 walk-in coolers and four walk-in freezers. Karnataka is expecting additional three walk-in coolers and two walk-in freezers from the Centre. Besides, the existing spare cold storage facilities under the Animal Husbandry Department and private hospitals, especially hospital chains, are also being assessed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-vaccine-second-dry-run-in-all-districts-tomorrow/article33516196.ece
07 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vaccination sites: Final decision expected today||A final decision on the number of vaccination sites in the city will be taken on Thursday at a high-level meeting with civic and health officials. The 144 primary health centres (PHCs) of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are being converted into vaccination sites. However, with a total of 1.68 lakh health workers, including ASHA and anganwadi workers, identified as beneficiaries in the first phase of vaccinations against COVID-19, more centres are needed. As per the Central government’s guidelines, each vaccination centre can administer the vaccine to not more than a 100 beneficiaries. “Earlier, the government had directed us to identify schools and anganwadis for vaccination sites, with three rooms exclusively to be used for this purpose. However, with schools starting, this may be difficult. The government has also directed us to identify alternate sites,” said Vijayendra, Chief Health Officer (Public Health), BBMP. The civic body claims to have the capacity to store 25 lakh vaccines. In all, over 200 cold storage facilities have been identified from where vaccines will be sent to various sites. There will be a total of 330 deep freezers and ice-lined refrigerators, of which the BBMP has 44 ice-lined refrigerators, each with a capacity to store 50,000 vaccines, sources said. Of 1.68 lakh health workers identified, 1.46 lakh are from 4,300 private hospitals and 22,801 from 292 government hospitals. Around 1,700 vaccinators have been identified. Mr. Vijayendra added that only those who have been identified by the hospital administrations will be vaccinated. In case of any person showing adverse reaction to the vaccine, ambulances will be parked near the vaccination sites and first aid kits will be available. Hospitals have been identified in a 100-metre radius of the vaccination sites, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-sites-final-decision-expected-today/article33516192.ece
07 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Actor Radhika, brother under CCB scanner||Kannada film actor-producer Radhika and her brother Raviraj have come under the scanner of the Central Crime Branch police in connection with a fraud case that came to light last month where a man had cheated people of crores of rupees while claiming to have ties with right wing organisations and the BJP. After the CCB summoned Raviraj and questioned him for an hour about the case last week, Radhika held a press conference on Tuesday. In mid-December, the police had arrested one Yuvraj Swamy who claimed to be a functionary of a powerful right wing organisation and duped people of huge sums of money after promising them seats in Parliament and on government boards as well as key postings. At the time of his arrest, the police had raided his house in Nagarbhavi and seized Rs. 26 lakh in cash as well as cheques addressed to the accused amounting to Rs. 91 crore. During the course of their investigation, CCB officials found that Yuvraj, 52, had 47 bank accounts. “A huge sum of money had been transferred from one of the accounts to another held by Raviraj and Radhika. There was also a telephone conversation between Yuvraj and the actor and her brother,” said a CCB official. The CCB questioned Raviraj to ascertain why the money has been transferred to him and what kind of relationship the duo have with Yuvraj. According to sources, Raviraj reportedly denied any knowledge of the financial transaction and said that he knew Yuvaraj for many years through his father. His family would consult Yuvaraj on astrology and advise on rituals. However, at a press conference on Tuesday, Radhika acknowledged the financial transaction, and said that Yuvraj had transferred Rs. 15 lakh into her account as advance for a film she had agreed to act in. “The accused claims to be an astrologer and vastu expert. When questioned, he claimed to own a production house and wanted to make a film for which he had contacted Radhika and paid her,” said a senior official. The conman is currently in judicial custody at Central Jail Parappana Agrahara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/actor-radhika-brother-under-ccb-scanner/article33516197.ece
07 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Municipal dept. has used just 8% aid under Swachh Bharat Mission||While legislators have been crying foul over non-grant of funds for implementing development works in their constituencies, officials of the Municipal Administration Department have failed to utilise available funds under the Centre’s flagship Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). The department had utilised just 8% of the available funds in the current financial year (2020-21) till December 2020. Though aid of Rs. 567.71 crore was provided to the department, a mere Rs. 47.17 crore was utilised as on December, according to official sources. The Centre’s strict rules and “non-availability of any window for misuse of funds” are the reasons for poor utilisation of funds, official sources said. Overall, under different schemes and plans, the department had spent Rs. 4,086.54 crore of the available Rs. 6,832.58 crore, constituting 60% of the expenditure. Irked by poor expenditure, Minister for Municipal Administration, Horticulture and Sericulture K.C. Narayana Gowda at a recent review meeting took officials to task and asked them to explain reasons for such low expenditure under SBM. With the department incurring less than 10% of the expenditure during the first three quarters of the financial year, Mr. Gowda has asked officials to come out with concrete plans in the next 15 days to utilise funds under the SBM. He warned of stern action against officials for showing laxity in execution of works under the scheme, sources in the government said. The Union government launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on October 2, 2014 to make the country garbage and open defecation-free. Under SBM, urban local bodies (ULBs) have to make proper systems of segregation, collection, transportation, processing, treatment and disposal of solid waste in harmony with the environment and in line with prevalent regulations. In the review meeting, the Minister also told officials that they have failed to implement plastic ban despite it being officially banned a few years ago. The Minister’s stern directions come when the Centre is working out a second phase of SBM.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/municipal-dept-has-used-just-8-aid-under-swachh-bharat-mission/article33515969.ece
07 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State moots common entrance test for engineering admissions||The Department of Higher Education is considering conducting a single entrance test for engineering aspirants seeking admissions in private universities across Karnataka. This comes after the Admission Overseeing Committee had recommended a single entrance test format so that students are spared the hassle of taking multiple entrance examinations. The Higher Education Department has invited representatives of private universities to conduct a meeting on Friday for further discussions. The department is keen that private universities adopt this idea for admissions during the coming 2021-2022 academic year. Currently, students, besides appearing for the Common Entrance Test and Consortium of Medical Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka (COMEDK), have to appear for tests conducted by the Karnataka Religious and Linguistic Minority Professional Colleges Association (KRLMPCA), and Association of Minority Professional Colleges in Karnataka (AMPCK). In addition to this, each private university conducts its own entrance test. The move has been welcomed by engineering seat aspirants. Rakesh A., who plans to take up engineering said: “Sometimes, we are unable to give entrance examinations of all the universities as the schedules clash. Having one test will make it much easier,” he said. An added bonus is that the single test will ease the financial strain of paying for multiple examinations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-moots-common-entrance-test-for-engineering-admissions/article33515820.ece
07 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Legislators get one more tranche of fund||Under pressure from legislators, the Finance Department has approved release of another tranche of Rs. 50 lakh under the Karnataka Legislators Local Area Development (KLLAD) programme. The legislators had vented their ire before Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa over lack of funds for works in their constituencies during the two-day meeting of party MLAs that concluded on Tuesday. The release of Rs. 150 crore for the legislators fund in the third tranche this week will provide Rs. 1.5 crore in total to the legislators under KLLAD programme this financial year. In November, the Finance Department released the second tranche of Rs. 50 lakh and asked action plans to be made for a total budget of Rs. 1 crore. The State government, under financial strain due to COVID-19, had decided to slash the KLLAD fund to Rs. 1 crore in September while releasing the first instalment of Rs. 50 lakh. The annual grant under KLLAD is Rs. 2 crore, which totals to Rs. 600 crore for 225 MLAs and 75 MLCs per annum. Government sources said that as pressure mounted on the Chief Minister to increase annual allocation to the constituencies, the Finance Department under him had been instructed to increase the allocation by Rs. 50 lakh. New action plan The department has also allowed new action plan for 2020-21. In earlier memos, the department, which had tightened purse strings, had directed the district administration to refrain from new projects and focus on completion of works. It, however, has said that Rs. 50 lakh would be released only after the utilisation of funds released to the constituency so far. A senior official said that though the funds under KLLAD had been released, many legislators were yet to submit action plans for this year even as just about 60 legislators have submitted action plan for 2019-20. “We are unable to understand why the fund utilisation has been so low, while legislators demand release of more funds,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/legislators-get-one-more-tranche-of-fund/article33515971.ece

He told reporters in Davangere that Mr. Siddaramaiah would lose his political identity and influence in Congress if he is not in the news. “In fact, I don’t think he is angry against the anti-cow slaughter Ordinance or RSS. But he is attacking them only for his own survival in the Congress,” he said, adding that he was actually upset with Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar. “As he cannot express his anger against his own party president, he is showing it on the BJP,” Mr. Kateel remarked. He maintained that the hold and influence of Mr. Shivakumar was increasing in the Congress.

07 January 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Mysore Paper Mills’ forest lease extended amidst protests||The State government has renewed the lease of 20,000 ha of forest land to Mysore Paper Mills (MPM) at Bhadravati, amidst protests by environmentalists demanding the withdrawal of the forest land from the company, which has remained defunct for the past five years. The government recently issued an order approving the renewal of the lease for further 40 years that is up to 2026. Earlier, the State government had granted a lease of 30,000 ha in August 1980 for a period of 40 years to grow acacia plantations, as the company required raw materials for paper production. Over the years, the department withdrew some patches, leaving 20,005.43 ha with the MPM. The forest land is spread over Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, Chitradurga and Davangere districts. The lease period expired on August 10, 2020. Many take VRS In the meanwhile, the company had suffered a huge loss, forcing the employees to take voluntary retirement, besides the closure of operations in 2015. Now, the State government is interested in reviving the company with the involvement of private investment. It has also floated a tender inviting private people to take over the company’s operations on lease. Even as the proposal for the renewal of the lease was being worked out at the government level, environmentalists of Shivamogga formed a forum – Nammurige Acasia Beda Horata Okkuta – staged protests and submitted memoranda seeking the return of forest land to the Forest Department. They maintained that cultivation of acacia to produce raw material would harm the Western Ghats. Further, they argued there was no need for renewing the lease as the company had become defunct. A delegation of the forum had met senior officers of the department in this regard. However, their efforts failed to stop the renewal.  Now, the forum has decided to intensify their protest. K.P. Sripal, an advocate and one of the forum founders, told The Hindu, “We will picket at the office of Conservator of Forests in Shivamogga on January 7. We have prepared for the legal battle against the renewal of the lease. The previous agreement expired in August 2020. It cannot be renewed in November 2020. It has to be a fresh agreement. On these legal grounds, we will fight the case.” The environmentalists are worried that the vast forest land would go into the hands of private people, as the government has already initiated the process to handover MPM to private investors. “We are doing a campaign on social media against any attempt to hand the forest land over to private people,” he said. Move welcomed However, the workers’ union at MPM has welcomed the government’s move. S. Chandrashekhar, president, MPM Workers’ Union, told The Hindu that the government’s move would help the revival of the company. “The tender process inviting private companies to conduct the operations on lease has begun. Nobody would come forward to run the company, which has remained defunct for over five years, without captive plantations, as they require raw material,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysore-paper-mills-forest-lease-extended-amidst-protests/article33515822.ece
07 January 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||The perfect gift for the New Year||Tarikere Town Municipal Council in Chikkamagaluru district greeted the residents of the town at the dawn of the new year last week by opening the cleaned up Chikkere in the town. The urban local body, with the help of many voluntary organisations, removed weed and cleared the dirt around the tank. The work was part of the TMC staff members’ programme – Pursabhe Chitta Swachchateyatta – which began three months ago. Under this programme, the staff cleaned the residential localities on every first and third Saturday in a month. From Chief Officer to the municipal worker, all staff of the council would work on the day, irrespective of their official responsibilities. “Our work received a good response from the public. Gradually, several organisations joined us and we took up cleaning Chikkere, a herculean task given the weeds, construction waste, and garbage dumped around the tank”, said H. Mahanthesh, Chief Officer of the TMC. The tank, spread over 10 acres of land, was once providing drinking water for residents of the town, whose population stands roughly at 40,000. Over the years the tank was neglected and it became a dumping yard, as the people started to get drinking water from Bhadra reservoir. The work began on December 19 with the support of D.S. Suresh, MLA, council’s administrator A.C. Renuka Prasad and volunteers from many non-governmental organisations including Viveka Jagruta Balaga, Rotary, Kannada Sahitya Parishat’s taluk unit, and Arivu, forum of ex-servicemen. As much as 150 tractor loads of weed and municipal waste were removed from the tank area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/the-perfect-gift-for-the-new-year/article33515955.ece

However, he clarified that members had gathered to take the blessings of the deity after winning the elections. “They all held a meeting at the temple and declared that they would remain in the party for next few years and work for the people under my leadership.

07 January 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Ordinance based on what UPA govt. had suggested: Vinay Shetty||The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance, 2020, is based on suggestion made by the then Congress-led UPA government to remove the blanket ban on slaughter of cattle and allow slaughter of buffaloes. The Ordinance does not target any community’s eating rights, said State Animal Welfare Board member Vinay L. Shetty here on Wednesday. Mr. Shetty told reporters that the Ordinance allows slaughter of he and she buffaloes aged above 13 following certification by competent authority. “This change was brought following suggestion made by the UPA government in 2010 following an ordinance passed the B.S. Yediyurappa government,” he said, and added the changes could not be incorporated then as the government lost power and the subsequent Siddaramaiah government withdrew the ordinance. The suggestion was included in the Karnataka Preservation of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, which was passed in the Legislative Assembly but failed to get assent in the Legislative Council. “The government has taken a bold step to pass the ordinance, which received the Governor’s assent on Tuesday,” Mr. Shetty said and accused the Congress of unnecessarily politicising the issue. Apart from allowing slaughter of buffaloes aged above 13, the Ordinance has put the fine for slaughter of cattle between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 10 lakh and term of imprisonment ranging between three years and seven years. The first case under the ordinance has been booked in Mysuru on Wednesday, he said. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the divisional-level meeting of Congress activists at Bantwal on Wednesday, State Congress president D.K. Shivakumar said the ordinance has been brought by the B.S. Yediyurappa government for political reason. “There was no need for bringing any change to the Act that was in force. It is only for political reasons that the ordinance has been brought to replace the Act.” Mr. Shivakumar said respecting cattle has been the culture of Indians but the BJP was deriving political advantage with an ordinance. Mr. Shivakumar said the government should first ban export of beef. It has to pay incentive between Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 50,000 to each farmer to take care of cattle. “If the government is not willing to pay it, it should pay the price of each cattle to the farmer and take care of it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ordinance-based-on-what-upa-govt-had-suggested-vinay-shetty/article33516373.ece

Patil on Wednesday asked officials to act tough to prevent illegal mining and illegal sand extraction in Udupi district. He was speaking at a meeting of officials of the department in Karkala. Before allowing mining and sand extraction, officials have to carefully study documents concerned. They should not, however, deny permission for minor technical errors. Udupi district was given a target of Rs. 24 crore royalty collection and so far, Rs. 16.29 crore was collected. He asked officials to reach the target by March. Udupi MLA K. Raghupathi Bhat suggested synchronisation of GPS devices of sand extracting boats in CRZ area and sand transporting trucks to prevent illegal sand extraction in the district. Following a demand from legislators in the coastal area for a sand policy for the region given its unique geographical nature, the government was formulating one. Defects in the Maralu Mithra App were being rectified, he said. The Minister directed officials to accord permission to extract sand for local use in 34 second and third grade sites where gram panchayats had given consent letters. Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar urged the Minister to permit inter-district sand transportation between Dakshina Kannada and Udupi district so that Karkala taluk gets sand from Belthangady and Moodbidri taluks of Dakshina Kannada.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/act-tough-against-illegal-mining-sand-extraction/article33516366.ece

07 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||3 held for creating fake property documents||The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) personnel foiled an organised attempt to sell a high-value property with fake documents, in the city. Three persons have been taken into custody and search is on for other kingpins behind the racket. The MUDA suspects an organised racket behind sale of properties based on fake documents and said that such cases are on the rise. It cautioned the public and the financial institutions to ascertain the veracity of the documents with MUDA before committing to any transaction in their own interest. MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev told media persons here on Wednesday that an attempt was made to procure loan for a plot measuring 80 ft x 100 ft. in Yadavgiri. The panel of advocates enlisted by the bank to give their legal opinion based on the documents suspected something was amiss and contacted the Mysuru south sub-registrar’s office. The party seeking loan had also refused to submit original documents which reinforced their suspicion that the documents were not original. It was confirmed that the 30 documents submitted by the potential buyer seeking a loan was fake following which the MUDA and the SBI sought police assistance to get to the root of the racket. The sellers were asked to visit the advocate’s office to collect the documents where the police in plain clothes were waiting for them and took them into custody, said Mr. Rajeev. The documents submitted to the SBI for loan was faked in such a manner that it created an impression of a genuine sale deed with ragged edges, discoloured paper in a bid to mislead the buyer that the documents were genuine and were issued decades ago. On cross-checking the signature of the official concerned it transpired that such a person was not heading the MUDA during that period. Mr. Rajeev said there was an organised racket behind this as there was no dearth of vacant sites and plots allotted decades ago. It was incumbent on the allottees or the existing owners to fence the property and install a board of their ownership so that people are not lured to buy properties leading to disputes over ownership. The MUDA Chairman said such cases were on the rise in recent times and cited an example where a property owner in Jayanagar found to his discomfiture that a plot owned by him had already been sold to another person by creating fake documents and the issue was now before the court. The role of Smitha Devaiah, who is on the MUDA legal panel, in preventing this fraud came in for appreciation. Mr. Rajeev appealed to all banks and financial institutions to get the documents authenticated from MUDA before sanctioning any loan amount. A separate cell to authenticate the documents has already started functioning and banks and the public should make use of the same to prevent fraudulent transactions, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/3-held-for-creating-fake-property-documents/article33515959.ece

07 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||A case for making PR cards issued under UPOR mandatory||The increase in fraudulent transactions related to properties based on fake documents in Mysuru has underlined the imperatives of making it mandatory to secure Property Register (PR) cards under Urban Property Ownership Record (UPOR). The UPOR was introduced in Mysuru as a pilot project in 2010 and entails a comprehensive survey of the properties, digitizing the data and creating records embedded with spatial details based on GIS survey, land mapping, recording the mutation if any besides mentioning ownership details. The UPOR team in Mysuru has surveyed nearly 3,23,000 properties in Mysuru and 42 villages covered by the project so far. The authorities have received nearly 2,19, 000 property documents from the owners and have created final PR cards in case of nearly 50,000 properties. But what is disconcerting is that nearly 46,000 property owners in Mysuru do not have authentic documents and have furnished sale deed on Rs. 5 or Rs. 10 stamp paper none of which is legally tenable. Hence the UPOR has not issued PR cards in case of such properties. In addition, the UPOR project office is yet to receive ownership documents pertaining to 1,05,000 vacant sites and hence the legal validity of ownership claims of such properties is not certain. The objective of launching the UPOR project was to prevent fraudulent sale of properties by creating an authentic property register card as required under section 133 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act. As per the law, the PR cards or Form 13 issued under the UPOR project is to be deemed as the only valid ownership record and the government wanted to make it compulsory. But almost 11 years after its launch there is resistance to it from the elected representatives. When pointed out that making PR cards issued by UPOR mandatory for all transactions could prevent such frauds, MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev was evasive on the issue and said “he would discuss it with authorities’’. Meanwhile, sources in UPOR office have confirmed that a section of the public was aware of the UPOR concept and the office regularly received queries from potential buyers on the legal validity of the property and ownership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-case-for-making-pr-cards-issued-under-upor-mandatory/article33515958.ece

07 January 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Compensation inadequate, poultry farmers complain||Poultry farmers have termed the State government’s compensation plan for owners of dead/culled birds due to the bird flu outbreak “inadequate”. The government on Wednesday decided to provide a compensation of Rs. 200 for a bird older than two months and Rs. 100 for those less than two months. Besides, Rs. 5 will be given to an egg destroyed. Duck farmers, worst affected by the outbreak, say the relief measures announced by the government will not help them tide over the crisis. They say the government had given the same amount as compensation during the previous bird flu outbreaks in the Kuttanad region. “I lost 6,000 ducks to the disease. While 2,200 birds died another 3,800 were culled by authorities. I am going to get compensation for the culled birds only as I cannot prove the number of dead birds, which perished before the avian influenza was officially confirmed. The government had given the same amount after the bird flu outbreak in 2016. It is deplorable that not a single penny has been increased,” says Thomas Kutty, a duck farmer from Karuvatta. The farmers have urged the government to increase the compensation amount as the price of ducklings, feed, and labour cost have shot up in recent years. The farmers unaffected by the outbreak too are facing a difficult situation as the authorities have regulated the trade of meat and egg in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. “Culling operations are carried out in a one-km radius of the infected areas. The farmers outside the bird flu hotspots in the region are in a predicament as they cannot sell meat and egg. The government is silent on compensating them,” says B. Rajasekharan, district president, Duck Farmers Association. He says the government should increase the compensation amount to the farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/compensation-inadequate-poultry-farmers-complain/article33515931.ece

An official said the bamboo-raft safari would give additional income to the tribal community of the Kolumban colony at Cheruthoni. It will be run by the Kolumban eco-development committee in the sanctuary. A trial run of the project was already completed. The Kolumban colony is inhabited by the descenders of Chemban Vellayan Kolumban, the tribal chief who was instrumental in the construction of the Idukki dam. The tribal community members are given the right to engage in fishing in the reservoir. They are experts in rafting and will be given training to conduct the safari for tourists.

Haridas, and Prasanth Shankar, has been awarded a US patent for the discovery of ‘Phormidin’ an inhibitor of the enzyme Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS). This is the first international patent earned by the university. The award offers the promise of developing a new drug for cancer treatment. The patent comes as a culmination of almost 10 years of research that began in 2010 with the support of the Ministry of Earth Sciences. According to Prof. Sabu, FAS inhibitors are expected to be future drugs in cancer treatment. FAS is essential for fat metabolism, and its inhibition leads to the death of the cell. Phormidin has great potential in the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and tuberculosis. The new hope for cancer treatment is that the drugs developed based on FAS inhibitor may have better properties with few side effects, Prof. Sabu pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kannur-university-researchers-get-us-patent/article33515840.ece

Mr. John of the UDF has proposed an environment-friendly development mode for the ‘metro town’. “We have just received a letter from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board [KIIFB] expressing willingness to extend financial support for the new municipal market. The proposal will be placed before the council meeting on Thursday. The Kerala Urban and Rural Development Finance Corporation had already earmarked Rs. 5.5 crore for the estimated Rs. 9-crore project,” he said. The previous Congress-led regime could not initiate the project after it got entangled in courtroom battles and bureaucratic delays. “The new market building will have shops for vegetables and fruits, groceries and stationery. The first floor will be dedicated to vehicle parking. It will also have office space for rent,” he added. The rejuvenation of the Periyar remains a key task before the new council, as the main water source for lakhs of people continues to reel under pollution and indiscriminate human interference. “We realise that the protection of the river is crucial. The council will set up three waste water treatment plants, in addition to the existing plant, to check dumping of untreated effluents and waste water into it,” said Mr. John. The Municipal Chairman said the development of the railway station square would be undertaken on the occasion of the municipal centenary celebrations. “The old private bus stand remains in a dilapidated condition. It will be modernised. We plan to acquire old buildings near it and develop the area in tune with the emerging requirements,” he added.

07 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Properly cooked meat safe to eat, says expert||Animal health experts dealing with the bird flu outbreak have given the go-ahead for consuming properly cooked duck meat and chicken. The H5N8 virus, the pathogen responsible for the disease, is a highly fragile one and gets easily destroyed when exposed to a temperature of around 70 degrees for 30 minutes. Meat is deeply cooked in the traditional cooking practices followed in Kerala, and hence, there is no risk for humans in consuming properly cooked meat, said Rayne Joseph, Deputy Director, Directorate of Animal Husbandry (DAH). Usually, when chicken curry is prepared, it is boiled at a temperature higher than 100 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which water boils. Duck meat is cooked at a higher temperature. When cooked in pressure cookers, cooking takes place at a higher temperature at which the pathogens get totally destroyed, explained Dr. Joseph. Fried meat is also safe for consumption, as the boiling point of oil is higher than that of water. While consuming eggs, one must ensure that they are properly boiled. It is advisable to avoid egg dishes like bulls-eye at this time, she said. Though the virus has the potential to be transmitted from birds to humans, there has not been any confirmed reports of such transmission, she added. Meanwhile, Ernakulam district remained free of any cases of avian flu on Wednesday. No instances of unusual bird death was reported from the district, said A. Gopakumar, Deputy Director, DAH, Ernakulam. The general public can speak to experts at the Ernakulam office of the directorate at 0484-2360648.  ‘Exposure to temperature of 70 degrees for 30 minutes kills virus’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/properly-cooked-meat-safe-expert/article33515836.ece

The chamber convened a joint meeting of producers, exhibitors, and distributors after the government permitted reopening of cinemas with 50% occupancy from Tuesday. The exhibitors had said on Tuesday that they were ready to resume screening from next week after completing the preparatory works. Tax, power charge K. Vijayakumar, president of the chamber, said the trade bodies had urged the government to reduce the entertainment tax on tickets, which had been raised. The exhibitors sought relaxations in the fixed electricity charges incurred while remaining shut owing to the lockdown. The reopening of cinemas would not be possible without getting an assurance from the government on the relief package, he said. The meeting pointed out that screening movies with a 50% occupancy would be a loss for the producers and exhibitors. The restrictions on the number of shows were also not practical. The producers and exhibitors said the big budget movies could not be released till the restrictions were lifted. ‘Master’ release The decision by the chamber is likely to have an impact on the release of the Pongal release of the Tamil movie ‘Master’ on January 13. The representatives of the Film Exhibitors United Organisation of Kerala and Cine Exhibitors Association had said on Tuesday that they were ready to release the film. The producers reiterated that the exhibitors needed to clear the dues on movies released before the pandemic crisis.

07 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||NIA move to secure identity of protected witnesses||After filing the chargesheet in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has moved the NIA special court for protecting the identity of some of the witnesses and their statements in the case. It is by invoking Section 173(6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, that the agency moved the applications. The Section states that “if the police officer is of the opinion that any part of the statement is not relevant to the subject matter of the proceedings or its disclosure to the accused is not essential to the interest of justice, and inexpedient in the public interest,” he can approach the trial court with such an application. While moving such applications, the investigating officer shall append a note requesting the magistrate to exclude that part of the statements from the copies to be provided to the accused. Once the court approves the prayer, those portions of the statements given by the protected witnesses and the details of such witnesses will be kept out of public domain and the access of the accused. Such measures are often taken to protect the life and to ensure the safety of the witnesses who might have made sensational depositions before the investigation agency, sources indicated. The NIA has listed a few witnesses as protected witnesses in the case in which the agency submitted chargesheet against 20 persons, including Swapna Suresh and P.S. Sarith. Interestingly, the name of Sandeep Nair, whom the investigation agencies had earlier described as one of the key players in the gold smuggling cartel, has not been included in the list of accused. Turned approver? Indications are that he may have turned approver and the agency might have used his statements to nail down the other accused. The NIA may also file supplementary chargesheet in the case shortly against those who aided the gold smuggling, sources said. Indications are that the trial in the case will be scheduled after the Kerala High Court passes its order in the appeal filed by the NIA against the special court granting bail to a few accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nia-move-to-secure-identity-of-protected-witnesses/article33515940.ece

The district has 9,354 patients, the highest in the State, and Pathanamthitta, which is second in terms of the number of patients, has 6,766 patients. On Wednesday, 946 persons recovered from the disease. There were 11 health workers among the new patients. Karukutty recorded 37 new cases followed by Kuttampuzha (31), Thripunithura (28), Parakkadavu (27), Kavalangad and Sreemoolanagaram (25 each), Varapuzha (24), and Angamaly (23 cases). There were 158 new admissions to hospitals / first-line treatment centres (FLTCs). A fresh batch of 7,909 samples were sent from the district on Wednesday for testing. Training in administering COVID-19 vaccine was given to the field staff of the Health Department at Angamaly, Keechery, Malippuram, and Varapuzha. More vigil With cases showing an upward trend in the district, 15 sectoral magistrates have been designated to work with the police to arrest the spread of the pandemic. Fifteen officials are in reserve to ensure continuity of work. While three sectoral magistrates will be on duty in Kanayannur taluk, there will be two each in all other taluks. Their mandate, as earlier, is to observe public spaces where people tend to crowd, especially in the wake of relaxations of the COVID-19 protocol. The police should intimate sectoral magistrates about the conduct of public events in advance. The new sectoral magistrates are from the same set of officials who had earlier worked in the capacity. They will now be given online training by the National Informatics Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ernakulam-tops-with-1068-positive-cases/article33516332.ece
07 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Tension erupts between V4 Kochi, DYFI activists||Tension prevailed in front of the Maradu police station on Wednesday morning after minor skirmishes broke out between activists of V4 Kochi, the recently launched apolitical outfit, and the DYFI. It was prevented from boiling over after the police intervened. V4 Kochi had staged a protest march to the station over the arrest of four of their activists, including its campaign controller Nipun Cherian, from their homes late on Tuesday night in connection with the unauthorised opening of the yet-to-be-opened Vyttila flyover earlier in the evening, sparking all-round confusion and traffic block. The police had to intervene and send back the motorists the same way without allowing them to exit through the other end. Shortly thereafter, DYFI activists also staged a march to the station, hailing the State government for the completion of the flyover, leading to tension between the two sides. The march was organised by the Maradu and Nettoor units of the DYFI. “The needless provocation on the part of the DYFI was testimony to the CPI(M)’s discomfort at the growing popularity of V4 Kochi and its leader Nipun Cherian,” said Shakeer Ali, secretary, V4 Kochi. However, the DYFI accused the other side of clandestinely intruding into their ranks with ulterior motives. “One of their workers was caught moving among our activists with a camera hidden in his pocket,” said Kiran Raj K.V., president of the DYFI Thripunithura block committee. Meanwhile, the Maradu police have charged the arrested V4 Kochi activists with non-bailable offences. V4 Kochi decried the manner in which Mr. Cherian was arrested, alleging that he was dragged out of his home like a terror suspect. “Our activists have been arrested for an offence they never committed. We had no role in opening up the flyover on Tuesday evening,” said Mr. Shakeer,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tension-erupts-between-v4-kochi-dyfi-activists/article33516346.ece

They are now demanding that the government step in and procure the fruit at the support level of at least Rs. 15 a kg. For the record, the State government had promised to intervene in the market to ensure a minimum price of Rs. 15 for farmers who had registered with the government. The price of the best grade fruit had fallen to Rs. 10 a kg in the market, while the lower grade fruit was fetching only Rs. 8, said Baby John, a farmer at Muvattupuzha on Wednesday. The situation facing the farmers has been presented to the government, which has promised to act, said Jose Kalappura, president, Pineapple Farmers Association, on Wednesday. He added that the price of the fruit had been low ever since the lockdown came into effect in March 2020. Moreover, the slack demand in north Indian cities is a major reason for the price fall, he said. Loss of Rs. 50 lakh The low prices may affect around 5,000 farmers cultivating in nearly 45,000 acres across the State. Mr. Baby John said the loss due to the fall in prices could be to the tune of around Rs. 50 lakh. The drop in prices of other fruits in the winter season, which has slackened demand in north Indian cities, farmers’ strike in Delhi, and poor business in the tourism sector following the pandemic outbreak are among the reasons cited for the poor demand for pineapple. Production cost Mr. Kalappura said the production cost stood at around Rs. 20 a kg, and that farmers could not break-even without achieving that price level. Pineapple farming has also been seriously hit with the departure of migrant workers who left the State following the COVID-19 breakout.  Farmers seek procurement at least at Rs. 15 a kg Around 5,000 farmers cultivate the crop in 45,000 acres across the State||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pineapple-farmers-seek-a-helping-hand/article33515901.ece
07 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Kudumbashree all set to brand ‘Kuttampuzha Honey’||The honey from Kuttampuzha, a tribal hamlet near Kothamangalam, is all set to assume brand value as Kudumbashree plans to package it as a branded product to enhance its marketability. The Kudumbashree Tribal Development Project has been running an initiative for tribal communities since mid-2019 by helping them make a livelihood through honey. “We have set up nearly 170 bee boxes, enclosed structures used to raise honey bees, in the tribal hamlets of Kuttampuzha with the help of Haritha Keralam Mission under the United Nations Development Programme. There are around 40 beneficiaries of the project and each one has been allocated around five bee boxes each. Nearly 10 kg of honey can be extracted annually from each of the boxes over two seasons in a year,” said Ponni Kannan, district programme manager, Kudumbashree Tribal Development Project. The honey, which is already being packaged and sold locally and through Kudumbashree’s district bazaar at Kolenchery has been evoking a good response. The product met with even greater response during the recent online sale when it had takers even from outside the State and the online demand only seems to surge. “We were planning to convert it into a branded product as Kuttampuzha Honey to enhance its reach when the pandemic-induced lockdown put paid to that. We will be doing it during this financial year with more sophisticated and attractive packaging and labelling using our dedicated marketing team drawn of members from tribal communities,” said Ms. Kannan. Initially, over 100 tribal beneficiaries were identified but their numbers were whittled down further based on the level of their interest. The number of beneficiaries, however, could be enhanced gradually considering that the number of bees in each bee boxes keeps on increasing, warranting a rise in the number of bee boxes proportionately. “As the number of bees surge, they will have to be moved into new bee boxes and the existing beneficiaries can either keep the extra benefit or sell them to their community members who are interested. This way they can have double revenue source,” Ms. Kannan said. Raw honey Besides, Kudumbashree is also marketing raw honey collected straight from the forest. Both the freshly collected honey and that extracted from bee boxes are processed in the traditional ways of tribal communities. The honey is sold in packages of 250 gm and 500 gm though fresh honey collected from the forest is priced higher.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kudumbashree-set-to-brand-kuttampuzha-honey/article33515920.ece
07 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||YouTube channel to stay beyond pandemic||The prolonged closure and uncertainty over the reopening of schools in the wake of the pandemic is what forced the Career Guidance and Adolescence Counselling Cell of the General Education Department to switch to the online platform and launch a YouTube channel to reach out to students, parents, and counsellors last year. That perceived obstacle seems to have turned out to be a blessing in disguise in hindsight, with the cell enhancing its reach like never before, prompting the department to make the stopgap arrangement a permanent feature for its future campaigns.  Wider reach “We were never able to impart training to all of our 3,000-odd counsellors owing to logistical reasons in the past and often had to restrict it to a few hundreds at a time. But this time, we could cover the entire base during a five-day comprehensive training, besides another two-day training on giving exam-related tips to students. We are now planning to organise both online and offline sessions simultaneously in the future,” C.M. Azeem, State coordinator, Career Guidance and Adolescent Counselling Cell, told The Hindu . The cell has 1,650 ‘Souhruda’ coordinators in higher secondary schools, 900 high school counsellors, 1,650 career guides, and 350 career masters in vocational higher secondary schools. Souhruda clubs were set up in schools a decade ago for adolescent counselling and health care.  Disha participation The online reach, both through Zoom and the YouTube channel, also helped the cell maximise participation this time for Disha, the annual higher studies expo, with over 4.50 lakh participants, while the previous biggest participation when it was held offline was over 45,000 the year before. The event familiarises students with various courses and reputed higher education institutes, besides facilitating interactions with experts from diverse disciplines. It was held in November-December and hence proved timely, since it coincided with the invitation of applications by some premium institutes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youtube-channel-to-stay-beyond-pandemic/article33515846.ece
07 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||HC rejects pleas of accused in Manoj murder case||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has upheld a Single Judge's verdict declining to interfere with the sanction given by the Central government for prosecuting the accused CPI(M) activists under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the Kathiroor Manoj murder case The case relates to the murder of 42-year-old Manoj, an RSS worker, at Kathiroor in Kannur district on September 1, 2014, allegedly by a group of CPI(M) workers. Order upheld The Bench led by Chief Justice S. Manikumar upheld the order while dismissing the appeals filed by Vikraman and 24 other accused in the case. They contended that the sanction granted by the Centre for prosecuting the accused under the UAPA was not valid. It was the State government which should have been granted sanction under Section 45(1)(ii) of the UAPA. The petitioners’ contention was that since the alleged incident took place within the limits of the State government, sanction had to be secured from the State government and not from the Centre.  Petitioners’ contention It was contended that it was not the offence under UAPA that matters for granting sanction, but the place of the crime constituting the offence under UAPA which matters for the purpose of granting sanction. It was also contended that the order of the Sessions Court, Thalassery, taking cognizance of the offences was bad as no sanction was secured on the date of taking note of the offences. The single judge had dismissed the pleas of the accused, holding that validity of a sanction had to be looked into by the Sessions Court during the trial of the case. Dismissing the appeal, the Bench said that it did not find any jurisdictional error or legal infirmity in the Single Judge's order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-rejects-pleas-of-accused-in-manoj-murder-case/article33515938.ece
07 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||HC slams police for faulty probe||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday slammed the police for faulty investigation into the death of two sisters in Walayar. The Bench comprising Justice A. Hariprasad and Justice M.R. Anitha, while setting aside the acquittal of the accused in the case, observed that police officers investigating heinous crimes should be scrupulously honest and committed to their duties and responsibilities. “An incompetent and insincere police officer is a disgrace to the whole police force in the State. It is high time for the political and bureaucratic executive to understand that inexcusable flaws in the investigation into serious offences will only bring disrepute to the administrative setup,” the court added. The court criticised the then Sub-Inspector of the Walayar police station, who took over the investigation on January 14, 2017 for his insensitivity. A truthful and dutiful investigator should have had a hunch that there was something extraordinary which drove the girl to end her life. ‘Utterly disgusting’ The court observed that the initial part of investigation in the case was “utterly disgusting”. Despite a reasonably good job done by the Dy.SP, the officer deputed to investigate the cases almost a week after the younger girl’s death could not gather any proper scientific evidence. The material on record clearly indicated that the poor girls were living in an unsafe family environment. The court added that it was high time the State government take up serious steps to educate and sensitise station house officers to deal with such cases. While noting the failure on the part of the trial prosecutor to adduce proper evidence, the court expressed its concern over the lack of effective consultation with district and sessions judges by the government before appointing public prosecutors in the district judiciary. Successive governments “make appointments to the posts of public prosecutor and additional public prosecutor mainly considering their political leanings and affinity towards the ruling dispensation”. The posts of special prosecutor and government pleader were not intended to provide employment to the favourites of the ruling dispensation on extraneous considerations, the court added. The Bench also directed the Director, Kerala Judicial Academy, to periodically arrange special training programmes for the additional sessions judges handling POCSO cases to guide and sensitise them on the legal, social, and psychological aspects in such cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-slams-police-for-faulty-probe/article33515923.ece

As part of its efforts to improve last-mile connectivity and to encourage cycling as a healthy lifestyle activity, KMRL has set up bicycle stands with parking and locking mechanism at its stations. The agency is collaborating with Cochin Smart Mission Ltd. (CSML) to introduce a public bicycle sharing scheme by adding about 1,000 bicycles for Kochi metro commuters. Docking stations With the aim of setting up bicycle docking stations across the city, the agency has sought spaces along the metro corridor such as bus stand, boat jetties, office complexes, institutions, schools and colleges, tourist points, parks, residential colonies and the like. KMRL has requested interested institutions and residents’ associations agreeable to sharing space for setting up cycle docking facility, to mail it at contact@kmrl.co.in or call at 0484-2846700. A tender called by KMRL for operational maintenance of the fleet of cycles will be opened soon after the deadline for submission gets over on January 12. KMRL and CSML will bear the cost of cycles, facilitating infrastructure and docking stations, and while interested institutions may share their spaces, the agency selected will take care of maintenance. Affordable rates Bicycles will be made available to commuters at affordable fares, the agency said on Tuesday. “During the period of COVID lockdown and thereafter, the interest towards cycle riding among the city dwellers has improved and more and more people are using bicycle travel. With the deployment of additional fleet of bicycles, all the 22 metro stations along with its influence area will be covered through the PBS scheme,” Alkesh Kumar Sharma, managing director of KMRL said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kmrl-to-deploy-1000-cycles-for-metro-commuters/article33516335.ece

Culling of birds to prevent the spread of the disease has added to the fears, said a hotelier in Kochi on Wednesday. He added that his normal order for around 15 birds a day had come down to just five. O.P. John, a wholesale chicken seller in Kochi, said the demand for both chicken and ducks had come down considerably after a peak ahead of the New Year celebrations. He added that the supply of birds from both the neighbouring districts and Ernakulam had been affected by reports of bird flu spread. According to him, live chicken is selling at Rs. 92 a kg in the wholesale market, while the retail price is Rs. 117 a kg. He did not foresee a huge impact on chicken sales in view of reports on the disease. At the same time, live ducks, which used to be sold at Rs. 300 per bird, had suffered a setback with little demand since January 3. A seller of live ducks at Kundannoor, who did not want to be identified, said there was demand for 25 to 30 birds a day per wholesale customer, but the demand had come down now to five birds a day. Hoteliers and wholesale customers alone are placing orders for birds, while retail sales have come to a standstill. An official of the Kerala State Poultry Development Corporation said steps had been taken to prevent the spread of bird flu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/duck-sales-slow-down-chicken-prices-fall/article33515907.ece

All the three were employed in a carton manufacturing company at Vapalissery. The three had a fight during the course of their work, and their colleagues intervened and separated them. Later in the evening, the quarrel was reignited during a drinking session that ended up in the murder. The victim’s body was found in a mutilated state after being run over by trains. The police later confronted the suspects with evidence at which the latter reportedly confessed to the crime. Incidentally, the victim had brought the two here for work. “It was to the credit of our officers that they could nab the culprit in a matter of hours,” said K.

Since the virus can easily spread among birds and infect human beings, both Animal Husbandry and Health Departments have been instructed to stay alert. District Collector B. Abdul Nasar has directed the Animal Husbandry Department to hand over the details of all government and private poultry farms operating in the district to health officials. Cases of unnatural and mass death of birds must be reported immediately, he said at the district-level task force meeting. The authorities have also decided to strengthen fever surveillance in Kollam as the symptoms of avian influenza are similar to those of COVID-19. “The infection is transmitted through body fluids while fever, cough, sore throat, and pneumonia are among the symptoms. Wear masks, sanitise It is mandatory to use masks, sanitiser, and handwash to prevent the spread,” said District Medical Officer (DMO) R. Sreelatha. Those who have regular contact with birds and animals should wear rubber gloves and gumboots. If the animals or birds develop any symptoms, the caretakers will also be put under monitoring and fever surveillance. As part of preventive measures, they will be administered oseltamivir tablets for 10 days. The department has ensured the availability of the medicine at all Primary Health Centres and Community Health Centres while an isolation ward has been arranged at the Karunagappally taluk hospital for admitting symptomatic patients. “Though there is no harm in consuming meat and eggs, make sure they are not undercooked. Those who work in poultry or animal farms and persons who handle waste and manure should wear mask and gloves,” said the DMO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/measures-intensified-to-tackle-avian-influenza/article33515912.ece

A meeting of the city committee of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) decided that the remaining one chairperson post would be shared with its main partner, the Communist Party of India. Members of standing committees will be elected on January 11 and the election to the post of chairpersons will be held on January 14. Out of the eight standing committees, the finance committee will have 10 members whereas other committees will have nine members each. The chairperson of the Standing Committee on Finance will be the Deputy Mayor. The CPI(M), which has a brute majority in the 75-member council with 45 seats on its own, had decided not to concede any chairperson post to none of the constituents. This despite minor partners in the coalition seeking a slice of the electoral pie in the council. Collectively, the LDF has 51 seats, including a seat each won by the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Nationalist Congress party (NCP), the LJD, the Congress (S), the Indian National League (INL), and an Independent. The CPI(M) leadership decided to offer a post of chairperson to the CPI considering it to be a major affiliate though the party won only a seat in the council. However, this has angered other partners. CPI leader P.K. Nazar, who captured the Palayam division from the Congress party, will get the post of a chairperson. Previous council In the previous council, the CPI(M) was magnanimous enough to offer the chairperson posts of standing committees on Welfare and Tax and Appeal to Anitha Rajan and Asha Sasankan of the NCP and the CPI. Both of them were defeated this time. Incidentally, the performance of the minor constituents of the Left coalition in the local body polls were also poor. The Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) and the Janata Dal (Secular) had contested five and two seats respectively. This time, the JD(S) failed to make it to the council.

A week after harvesting tapioca from the Kerala Water Authority compound near Sarovaram Bio Park, paddy cultivated in 5 acres at Kannadikkal was harvested on Wednesday. The corporation had started cultivation of tapioca, paddy, ginger, and turmeric, besides yam and other vegetables in 85 acres across the city, of which the crop in 24 acres is ready for harvest now. Farming activities were initiated foreseeing food scarcity during the pandemic times. Vacant plots were identified in almost every ward, and farming was promoted either through the Kudumbashree or other farming groups. As part of the initiative, organic manure produced at Njeliyanparamba was distributed among farmers at just Rs. 2 per kg.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/paddy-harvested-under-subhiksha-keralam/article33515848.ece

According to sources, Beeran Koya, 59, of Karimboyilil Kuttiyilthazham in the district, was found hanging in his cell by the jail staff during a routine examination. Though he was rushed to the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, Beeran Koya could not be saved. Beeran Koya was remanded on Sunday after he was charged by the Pantheerankavu police. As his COVID-19 test had turned negative, Beeran Koya was lodged along with other prisoners. Jail authorities have ruled out any unruly behaviour on Beeran Koya’s part. The Kasaba police have registered a case related to unnatural death. The Department of Prisons too would conduct an inquiry, said sources.

07 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Cong. to have new plans for Malabar||After it was roundly trounced in the recent local body polls, the Congress party has decided to bring back its electoral mojo displayed in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, for the upcoming Assembly elections. An All India Congress Committee-monitored meeting of leaders, including Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran, in Kozhikode on Thursday will chalk out the party’s poll strategy for six districts of north Kerala. Newly appointed AICC secretary in charge of Kerala P.V. Mohan will take part in the meeting. This follows the visit of AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar to the State. No legislator Pre-eminently, the focus will be on Congress profile which has been getting blurred with each passing Assembly elections in Malabar region. In the 2016 polls, the party nominees won just six out of the 60 seats in north Kerala. Pathetically, the Congress party has no legislator in Kasaragod and Kozhikode districts for the last three terms. At the same time, its dominant partner, the Indian Union Muslim League logged 17 and 19 seats in 2016 and 2011 elections respectively, making it a bigger player in coalition politics in Malabar. Nevertheless, in the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress party has been winning hands down the seats in Kozhikode, Vadakara and Wayanad thrice consecutively. In 2019, the entry of the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad constituency triggered a ripple effect in Malabar with party candidates winning Kannur and Kasaragod parliamentary seats too. Lack of effective leadership at the district level, factional feuds, bad choice of candidates, back-stabbing and mud-slinging have been attributed to the party getting hammered in the Assembly polls. Mullappally’s leadership Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, an element of serendipity worked for the Congress party after the appointment of Mr. Ramachandran, a native of Vadakara in Kozhikode, as KPCC president in 2018. As an undisputed choice and close to the AICC leadership, he became the right man in the wrong job just so to balance group, caste and religious equations in the party. Veteran Congress leader C.K. Govindan Nair was the last KPCC president from Malabar region, way back in 1964. Now, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Ramachandran can break the Malabar jinx of the Congress in the coming Assembly elections. After the exit of the LJD and the Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) , the Congress is likely to bargain and contest more seats such as in Perambra and Thiruvambady, and also in the Vadakara Assembly segment in Kozhikode district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/trounced-in-local-body-polls-cong-to-chalk-out-new-strategy-for-malabar/article33515852.ece

Come June and this 37-year-old mother of a teenage boy is planning the greatest adventure of her life. She will set out on her ‘Himalayan’ to the interiors of India, to experience the nook and corner of the country. The journey will take at least a year and a half to complete and will probably result in a world record for the distance covered. “I know it is going to be very tricky for a lone woman to travel in such a manner. But this has been my dream for a long time,” Shyni said. “I had planned this adventure in 2020, but had to postpone for a year due to COVID-19,” she added. Overcoming challenges It was in 2016 that Shyni founded Dauntless Royal Explorers in Thiruvananthapuram, which now has six branches across the State. “The very purpose of the club is to encourage women to travel on their own and to help them overcome the challenges in life,” she said. In 2017, she did the K2K (Kanyakumari to Kashmir) ride covering 12,000 km in 42 days. Later, she bagged the ‘Iron Butt’ title by travelling from Bengaluru to Pune and back in 23 and half hours. The theme of all of Shyni’s travels is to create awareness of violence against women. This time it is ‘Educate and empower women to enlighten.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-ride-to-explore-countrys-nook-and-cranny/article33515922.ece

Kunhalikutty, MP, has accused the CPI(M) of adopting the BJP policy of splitting communities with the intention of making gains out of them. He said here on Wednesday that the United Democratic Front (UDF) was aware of the “divide and rule” strategy being tried out by the CPI(M). “The UDF is strong and intact. We are holding healthy discussions with the Congress high command representatives. We will discuss the CPI(M)’s tactics,” he said. He said the IUML never encouraged communal division. “Synthesis is our policy. The IUML has always displayed tolerance and compromise in politics,” he said, adding that it was IUML leader Sayed Abdurahman Bafaqi Thangal who gave shape to a solid political front in Kerala.

District Medical Officer K. Sakeena said that shigella could be dangerous, especially for children. The contagious disease is spread through water and rotten food. The shigella bacteria shows its symptoms one or two days after entering a human body, she said. Dr. Sakeena said that those having diarrhoeal symptoms should seek medical aid as the shigella bacteria spread uncontrollably in the body in less than a week. Bloody diarrhoea, severe stomach cramping, fever, vomiting and dehydration are some of the symptoms of shigella. Dr. Sakeena said that some children would not show symptoms in spite of shigella infection. But the bacteria come out through their feces and they can spread the disease in others. She said, if not treated, shigella could affect the brain and kidneys and could be life-threatening. She asked people to drink boiled water and eat well-cooked food. Drinking water resources should be chlorinated periodically. She said people should desist from eating stale and old food.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/malappuram-dmo-asks-people-to-maintain-vigil-against-shigella/article33515845.ece

They will be named KBC 4 and PGCP 23, said officials. RARS has also plans to introduce a legume variety named PGCP 63 on an experimental basis. This will be brought out only after tests with the help of farmers. The new legume varieties can be ready for harvesting in less than two months. They can be used after the first or second paddy crop. Long beans Officials said that the new legume varieties in the long beans class can be used for consumption either as raw or as dried.According to researchers, the legume crops can help make the best of the phosphorous applied for paddy crops. The phosphorous given for paddy will be there in the soil, and it can effectively be utilised for the long beans. As manure The leaf and stem of the new legume varieties can be used as manure. Officials said that the fertility of the soil could be maintained effortlessly by trying out the legume crops. According to them, the change that has taken place in the soil structure in the wake of the two massive floods on 2018 and 2019 can be corrected through legume farming. They said horse gram farming too could help paddy farmers in Palakkad. The outer covering of horse gram can be used as animal fodder. Land identified Farmlands at Ongallur and Karakkad areas were identified to launch legume and horse gram farming on an experimental basis. Scientists said that paddy fields in that region retain water content for two months after paddy harvest. Legume farming can be done on those two months. Seeds of red cowpeas and black grams are available for sale at RARS, Pattambi. The agricultural station is also chalking out plans to procure the harvested red cowpea and black gram from farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pattambi-rars-to-bring-out-two-legume-varieties/article33515859.ece

07 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||New schemes for survivors of child abuse||Taking a cue from the success of the Kaval programme, the Women and Child Development Department has launched two new initiatives to provide psycho-social support to survivors of child sexual abuse and children in need of care and protection. Both these programmes are being piloted in Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad districts with the support of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In the case of survivors of child sexual abuse, only a few live in the 17 Nirbhaya Women and Children Homes run by the government. The rest, nearly 96%, return to their families or relatives. Often, it may not be in their best interests even. While these children get support such as legal help, their long-term rehabilitation and holistic care does not get enough attention. The new programme ‘Community-based rehabilitation of survivors of child sexual abuse’ will provide survivors of child sexual abuse support through the community. Assaulted children Focus will be on children who have faced sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, penetrative sexual abuse, and aggravated penetrative sexual abuse as per information from the district crime records bureaus. Once the children are identified, the district child welfare committee (CWCs) will be intimated about the intervention and through the district child protection units DCPUs), the cases will be handed over to the NGOs. Owing to the severity of the crimes against them, these children may experience a gamut of issues. First a psychosocial assessment will be held and individual care plans will be prepared to help overcome their problems, be it lack of familial support; social stigma or isolation; physical, mental, or emotional problems; support to resume studies or opt for vocational training. These efforts will help mainstream the abuse survivors living with their families, and not just those in the government’s homes. Interventions will be made in the case of 150 survivors in Thiruvanananthapuram district and 100 in Palakkad. The second programme ‘Kaval Plus’ is targeted at children in need of care and protection, that is high-risk children. First, children living in unsafe environments, those with alcoholic parents, with mental health issues, dropouts, and so on will be identified with the support of community-level workers such as ASHA and anganwadi workers. In the case of mild and moderate cases, school counsellors will intervene to provide them protection. Severe cases will be presented before the DCPUs and CWCs before an assessment of the children is conducted and individual care plans prepared for intervention by the NGOs in a multidisciplinary manner with the support of an array of stakeholders. Social Justice Director T.V. Anupama told The Hindu Kaval had shown that hand-holding of children in conflict with law could help in their rehabilitation and mainstreaming. The need for a similar effort was felt in the case of survivors of child sexual abuse or children in need of care and protection to ensure their long-term rehabilitation. Scalability Piloting the projects in two districts this financial year would help understand its scalability for expansion to other districts next year.

He was addressing the newly elected people’s representatives in local bodies across the State through videoconferencing on Wednesday. He said each local body needed to look at various avenues, including the agricultural sector, to generate jobs. “The government has formulated a plan to create jobs for five out of 1,000 people in every local body. Close to one lakh job opportunities can be created thus. The local bodies should promote entrepreneurs, who should be seen as job creators, not as enemies,” he said. Mr. Vijayan said the government was now working on the rehabilitation of the non-resident Keralites (NoRKs) who had lost jobs and returned homes. “We should see this as an opportunity. As a start, each local body can convene meetings of such returnees which will enable us to understand their specific issues,” he said.  Minister for Local Self Governments A.C.

A report by the Tahsildar, Neyyatinkara, points out that the disputed property is not ‘purambokke’ and Vasantha had purchased the four cents, which has a title deed issued to one Sukumaran Nair, K. Kamalakshi and K. Vimala, in 2006.  Tahsildar’s report The Tahsildar submitted the report to District Collector Navjot Khosa on Wednesday. The Collector has handed over the report to the government. The report also recommends that the original status of the land be verified. Vasantha's residence is situated on eight cents of land which is registered in the name of her grandson. A dispute had emerged over four cents with the couple, Rajan and Ambili, settling on it with their two sons. Reportedly, Rajan was misled by erroneous information provided in an RTI reply he received regarding the ownership of the land. Presumably, he may have disputed Vasantha's ownership based on the RTI reply from the Taluk Office, Neyyatinkara, which stated that it was the names of three others. Rajan and Ambili had sustained burn injuries when the Munsiff-appointed commission, with the assistance of police, attempted to evict the family from the land. Rajan had threatened to commit suicide after dousing himself and Ambili with petrol. The couple succumbed to their injuries on December 28.

In checks carried out in recent days, a total fine amount of Rs. 19,070 was imposed on various individuals in the Nanthencode health circle alone. The checks against waste dumping had slowed down after the COVID-19 outbreak, as the health officials were deployed for other work including implementation of quarantine rules and running of isolation centres. According to health officials, some of those against whom action was taken used to collect waste from houses claiming that they would hand it over to collection centres and dump it on the road. Fine amounts ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000 were imposed on the waste dumpers, with the fine depending on the amount of waste dumped. On flyovers “We had to spend quite a few days at various locations, where bags of waste used to be dumped regularly, to catch the offenders. The health teams take turns to carry out surveillance round the clock. In the Plamoodu-PMG road, we had to keep vigil for more than ten days to catch a person who used to dump large quantities of waste periodically. It is the repeat offenders who are imposed with heftier fines,” says Health Inspector S.S. Minu. The health wing has found that the flyovers in the city are a preferred location for some to regularly dump waste, as CCTV cameras are absent here and no squads are present. Sacks and plastic covers filled with waste have been noticed regularly towards the middle portion of the flyovers at Pazhavangadi as well as at Chacka, sources said. According to health officials, quite a few of those who were caught claimed to be unaware of the facilities opened by the city Corporation for collecting biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. Collection hubs The civic body runs waste collection hubs as well as material recovery facilities for segregated, non-biodegradable waste and aerobic bins for processing biodegradable waste. It also supplies kitchen bins at nominal rates for processing biodegradable waste in households.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corporation-steps-up-drive-against-waste-dumpers/article33516470.ece
07 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Reprobe a setback for govt.: Chennithala||Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Wednesday said the High Court had excoriated the State police for its botched investigation that resulted in the acquittal of three persons responsible for the sexual exploitation and subsequent suicide of two minor Dalit girls, both sisters, at Walayar in Palakkad in 2017. It had rectified the wrong by ordering a reinvestigation in the case. The High Court had cancelled the acquittal of the three suspects in the crime. The State police had come under withering criticism from across the political spectrum after a special court for the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) set the accused free for want of evidence and prosecution failure. The case acquired a political dimension with the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stating that the local police had developed cold feet because the accused were local functionaries of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]. Mr. Chennithala had pointed out that the lawyer who defended the accused in the case was also a local CPI(M) man who officiated as the chairperson of the District Child Welfare Committee. The Leader of the Opposition said the entire case smacked of conspiracy and conflict of interest. The “wilful indifference” on the part of the police to the impoverished Dalit family’s plight had driven the girls’ parents to the street to seek justice for their wards.

07 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||160 staff of private firm at airport in limbo||The 160 personnel employed in Thiruvananthapuram International Airport by the ground handling agency, Bhadra International India Pvt. Ltd., are in dire straits as they have been terminated following the decision to wind up operations. The firm, one of the two engaged in ground handling operations at the airport, had not settled the pending salaries, allowances, including gratuity and bonus from April 2019, and leave encashment of the staff. The management had also not paid the monthly contribution towards the EPF and ESI. The employees had been working on slashed salaries from March 2020 following the ban imposed in the country on commercial flights due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. With no signs of settling the dues despite a suit filed before the Regional Labour Commissioner, the Confederation of Trivandrum Airport Workers Trade Union, an umbrella organisation of INTUC, CITU and BMS unions, have come out to support the cause of the 160 employees and to get the dues. Dharna staged The union organised a dharna in front of the airport on Tuesday demanding steps to settle the dues of employees who have been left in the lurch. The ground handling agency had defaulted payment of licence fee to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) forcing the AAI to serve notice in March 2020 itself to terminate the agreement. The agency was engaged in the ground handling of only one airline and it wound up operations in October 2020. The office that was functioning in the airport was also closed. The agency had the authority of the AAI to take care of the ground handling of Etihad, Fly Dubai, Oman Air and chartered flights. The agency’s attempts to shift the ground handling equipment like trolleys and step ladder worth crores lying in the airport premises did not succeed following the stiff resistance of employees. The president of CITU-affiliated Thiruvananthapuram International and Domestic Airport Contract Workers Union, R.S. Vijayamohan said they had asked the AAI Director to ensure that the affected employees get priority while the new ground handling agency was appointed. The union has also urged the AAI not to release the ground handling equipment of Bhadra International India Pvt. Ltd. lying in the airport till the dues of the employees are settled. Meanwhile, the AAI is in the final stages of finding ground handling agency in five Group B1 airports, including Thiruvananthapuram. AAI sources said eight had participated in the two cover bidding process. Ray of hope For the 160 employees, the new ground handling agency to be appointed by AAI for Thiruvananthapuram airport is the only ray of hope.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/160-employees-of-private-firm-at-airport-in-limbo/article33515902.ece

Balakrishna has asked cadres to be ready for sacrifices and fight against the forces acting against the interests of farmers in the State. Mr. Balakrishna, who reached Hindupur on a three-day visit on Wednesday, termed the YSRCP rule as ‘rakshasa palana’ (demons regime). He criticised the government for ignoring the enormous loss the groundnut farmers had suffered in the district. “The government did not care to give in-put subsidy, or provide weather-based insurance compensation to the farmers,” he alleged. “It is a fight between the ‘devathas’ (Gods) and the ‘rakshasas’ (demons),” he said, and added, “While the TDP cadres are devathas, the YSRCP leaders, who are ignoring the people who have given them one chance to rule the State, are rakshasas.” Mr. Balakrishna interacted with the farmers at Kirikera, near Hindupur, and later sat in the dharna camp of the CPI to express his solidarity with the agitating farmers in New Delhi. “If the Centre and State governments ignore the demands of the farmers, we need to come onto the street and fight for their rights,” he told the party workers at the dharna site. ‘Mind game’ Referring to the series of attacks on Hindu temples, the TDP legislator said that the YSRCP government was playing a mind game, and that it should be cautious in blaming the TDP for everything. Referring to the killing of party workers in Pulivendula and clashes in Tadipatri, he said, “Our hands are not tied. If they resort to such cheap tactics and harm us, we will not keep silent.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/balayya-compares-ysrcp-rule-to-demons-regime/article33516283.ece

Great knot and Indian skimmer species have been listed in the India's national action plan for conservation of migratory birds and their habitats (2018-23) in the Central Asian Flyway.

Significant finding Speaking to The Hindu , BNHS Assistant Director and Asian Waterbird Census-2020 India coordinator P. Sathiyaselvam said: “A flock of 175 Indian skimmers was sighted on the Kakinada coast during the census. It is the significant finding as it is endangered as per the latest conservation status. A great number of migratory species of great knot was also sighted at a mudflat at Etimoga on the Kakinada coast.” Dr. Sathiyaselvam-led team recorded as many as seven Eurasian oystercatchers (haematopus ostralegus) at Hope Island in the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary where barely two birds were recorded earlier.  Final report  “We believe that Eurasian oystercatcher, a local migrant, has shifted its habitat from Sacremento Island to the Hope Island. However, further study is required to be carried out on the species,” said Dr. Sathiyaselvam. The birdwatchers, who participated in the census, have been asked to submit their findings and data by the end of January to prepare the final report on the census. The public could also submit the details of the sighting of the bird species in the Godavari estuary to K. Mrutyunjaya Rao, State co-ordinator, Asian Waterbird Census-2020.

Subba RaoVIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Temples that were razed during pushkarams to be rebuilt soon||After a gap of more than four years, the temples that were demolished during Krishna Pushkarams 2016 in the city will be reconstructed soon. The State government has chalked out plans to reconstruct the temples at the place where they have been razed as part of Krishna Pushkarams development plans by the previous government. The temples that cannot be constructed at the same place will be reconstructed at an alternative site. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will lay foundation stones for nine temples in the city on Friday. Of these, a couple of temples are likely to be constructed at alternative sites. According to information, it is estimated that Rs. 1.79 crore is required for the reconstruction of the temples. In addition, about Rs. 2 crore donor works would also be taken up. Mr. Jagan is scheduled to lay the foundation stones at a place where Sri Dakshina Mukha Anjaneya Swamy temple was situated. Reconstruction of Saneeswara Alayam and Rahu Ketu temples, that were located on banks of river Krishna, require permission from the Irrigation department. Approximately Rs. 2.7 crore would be spent on these temples. However, plans are being drawn. The government invited tenders for Anjaneya Swamy temple and Sitammavari Paadalu. Boddu Bomma, a historical statue, located on Canal Road near Durga temple, was broken into pieces as part of the pushkaram works. “The Boddu Bbomma is being prepared again,” sources said. Durga temple works The Chief Minister will also lay foundation stone for development works relating to Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam. The temple authorities are planning to construct a potu (temple kitchen) at an estimated cost of Rs. 5.6 crore. Anna prasadam complex at a cost of Rs. 19.7 crore; keshakandhana sala (tonsuring hall/building) at Rs. 23.6 crore; Sivalayam (Malleswara Swamyvarla alayam) extension works worth Rs. 2 crore and Sivalayam Rs. 5.6 crore. About Rs. 6.5 crore would be spent on fencing and other works to protect from landslide/boulder slides on the ghat road. Also, a toll plaza on the lines of Tirumala at a cost of Rs. 5.25 crore is being planned. In all Rs. 77 crore will be spent on development works being planned by the Durga temple. Of this, Rs. 70 crore would be borne by the government, while remaining would be spent by the Devasthanam, sources said. It may be recalled that the previous government embarked on a road widening exercise around the Kanaka Durga temple to ensure enough road space around the ghats leading to river Krishna. In the process, the demolition squad flattened 30 places of worship, which apparently upset the Hindu community. About 30 temples in the city were pulled down. five of them are fairly big temples. Among them, Seethammavari Padalu, Saneeswara Swamy and Dakshina Mukha Anjaneya Swamy temples are prominent temples. The BJP which was the Telugu Desam’s alliance partner in the State, was holding the Endowments portfolio.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/temples-razed-during-pushkarms-to-be-built-soon/article33515560.ece

07 January 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Leads point to a conspiracy, says DGP||The leads obtained so far by the police probing the desecration of Lord Rama’s idol at Ramateertham in Vizianagaram district point to a conspiracy, Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang has said. “We have observed a pattern, or a similarity with other such incidents. The police, in association with the Crime Investigation Department (CID), are investigating the case in all angles,” Mr. Sawang told The Hindu here on Wednesday. ‘Suspects being questioned’ “We are questioning a few suspects in the case. The miscreants have not targeted the main temple at Ramateertham, which has about 16 CCTVs. They have damaged the idol of Lord Sri Rama in a small temple located on the hilltop, where there is no proper surveillance,” Mr. Sawang said. “The temple management, in fact, has procured 16 more CCTVs and other electrical equipment needed for beefing up security at the small temple. But the miscreants have struck before the gadgets are fixed. This is raising many doubts,” he added. “The police are investigating whether the suspects have any connection with other such incidents, whether they spoke with the accused in similar incidents, the role of local residents, whether they have any political background, or whether any organised gang is operating in the State to create a law and order problem,” the DGP said. Security audit The police have done a security audit of 50,000 temples in the last few months and efforts are being made to provide CCTVs at all the temples in the State. “Instructions have been given to review security at all the places of worship from time to time,” Mr. Sawang said. Asked whether there was any political conspiracy, or whether any party was behind the attacks, the DGP said, “The police are verifying the call data of the suspects picked up in the cases.” Warning “Activists of various organisations and political parties can stage a protest in a peaceful manner without causing any inconvenience to the people. The police will not keep quiet if any person tries to create law and order problem, or disturb peace at the temples. The police will not allow any rallies or processions at the places of worship as there are chances of violence,” Mr. Sawang said.

Dharuri Phanith, studying final year B.Tech (CSE) at SVU College of Engineering (SVUCE), secured the first rank in the State with 99.85 percentile points. Son of a farmer at Gangapuram village in Kalakada mandal of Chittoor district, he shot to fame earlier too by bagging the first rank in ICET 2020. “I have been aiming to pursue MBA at IIM Ahmedabad, Bangalore or Calcutta. This achievement is certainly a morale booster,” says Phanith, who nurses an ambition to launch a start-up and create job opportunities for the youth. Thrilled at the recent interaction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with students of IIM Sambalpur (Odisha) through video-conference, he is also keen to turn challenges into opportunities. Along with Mr. Phanith, over fifteen students of Kautilya Institute have secured top scores out of the two lakh-plus candidates in the country who had appeared for the test. T.

07 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Will try to visit Ramateertham today: Somu||The BJP will make one more attempt to visit the Sri Rama temple at Ramateertham in Vizianagaram district on Thursday. Addressing the media here on Wednesday, BJP State president Somu Veerraju demanded that the government grant them permission to visit the temple just as it accorded permission to YSRCP Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy and Leader of the Opposition and TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu. “The government is trying to intimidate us with arrests and by deploying huge police force outside our offices. We do not find any rationality in it as we are only trying to address the grievances of the Hindus, who constitute a majority of the population,” Mr. Veerraju said. Ramatheertham made headlines recently after the desecration of Lord Rama’s idol at a temple there. The BJP leaders had tried to reach the temple on Tuesday, but many of them were arrested en route, or put under preventive arrest. “The party will take out a yatra some time after January 20 to all the temples, including Antarvedi and Pithapuram, vandalised in the State in the last few months,” Mr. Veerraju said. Referring to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s remarks that the State was witnessing a “political guerilla warfare,” Mr. Veerraju said vandalising of temples belonging to the majority population could not be called such. “The Chief Minister is playing vote back politics,” he alleged. Referring to Government Adviser Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy’s comments that the BJP was trying to rake up religious passion as its existence was under threat, he said, “I dare Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy to ask the Chief Minister to broach the issue with the Prime Minister or the Union Home Minister the next time he visits them in New Delhi.” Dig at Minister On Endowments Minister V. Srinivas commenting that the BJP would not get a single vote in the next election, Mr. Veerraju said, “The Minister should not forget that in 2014 he had contested on the BJP ticket and lost by a margin of 3,000 votes.” ‘No tie-up with TDP’ Ruling out any tie-up with the TDP in the future, Mr. Veerraju called Mr. Chandrababu Naidu an opportunist. “Mr. Naidu suddenly appears to have become an ardent devotee of Lord Rama and Hindutva. He was the one who had destroyed over 30 temples during the Krishna Pushkarams,” the BJP leader alleged. Critical of the schemes being launched by Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, he said the State had been receiving a lot of subsidy from the Centre, and this was not being told to the people with the sole interest of hogging the limelight. MLC P.V.N. Madhav and former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju were among others present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/will-try-to-visit-ramateertham-today-somu/article33516416.ece

07 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||GVMC tops citizen feedback in Swachh Survekshan 2021||The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is leading in the Citizen Feedback category for the ongoing Swachh Survekshan Survey-2021. The civic body has topped in the category by a huge margin, overtaking Indore by collecting the most feedback in the 10 lakh-above population category, as on January 5. According to GVMC officials, as of January 5, 6.30 p.m., 15,427 people had given their feedback for Visakhapatnam city, while Indore stood in second place with 4,378 people giving feedback, followed by South Delhi with 4,337. Among the 1-10 lakh population category, Kurnool and Tirupati too are leading with 8,135 and 3,659 people giving feedback respectively. GVMC’s Chief Medical and Officer for Health K.S.L.G. Sastry said that on January 1, the feedback was low, but since January 2, the city has been receiving good feedback. “With the help of ward secretaries and volunteers, we have been conducting awareness on Citizen Feedback. Every morning, the GVMC is taking up programmes in wards over the ongoing survey,” said Mr. Sastry. Citizen Feedback will be held from January 1 to March 31. It constitutes 1,800 marks out of the total 6,000-mark in the survey. Citizens will be asked a couple of questions including cleanliness in community, commercial places and toilets. The feedback also questions how well the citizen is aware of the ongoing survey and previous survey. Apart from the number of people giving feedback, the category also includes the number of active users of the Swachhata app. GVMC has not lived up to expectations in the Citizen Feedback category in the previous survey, when it stood 9th in the country. The civic body aims to improve its performance in Citizen Feedback as well as active users in Swachhata app this year. The final ratings will be updated until the final day. Teams from the Centre are likely to visit the city in March or even before.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gvmc-tops-citizen-feedback-in-swachh-survekshan-2021/article33516529.ece

Demanding continuation of their services, the nurses also sought payment of salaries three months salaries. A tense situation prevailed for some time when security personnel stopped them from meeting the Minister. The nurses relented after the Minister assured them that he would look into their demand. Later, addressing a meeting, the Minister announced that he would take the nurses’ demand to the notice of the Chief Minister. The nurses were recruited on a ‘temporary’ basis in view of an acute demand for nurses in view of the pandemic situation. It may be recalled that 500 young nurses, in the age group of 20 to 23 years, were recruited by the State government for Visakhapatnam district when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak, and sent to serve COVID-19 patients. They were recruited in August on a consolidated pay of Rs. 24,000 and were terminated without notice on November 27, on the plea that COVID-19 cases had fallen drastically. The nurses alleged that they were not paid their salaries properly though they risked their lives to treat COVID patients. Though the nurses were told prior to their recruitment that it was being done on a ‘contract basis’, they were hopeful of their services being regularised as there were vacancies at various PHCs and CHCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nurses-gherao-minister-over-unpaid-salaries/article33516526.ece

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||State gets 12k tmcft of water after 30 years||Thanks to the copious rainfall all over Andhra Pradesh, and catchment areas in neighbouring States of rivers flowing in the State, the cumulative amount of water received by the State touched the 12,000-tmcft mark on Wednesday. The landmark quantum of water received in 2020-21 in Andhra Pradesh in a single water year was after a gap of 30 years. According to officials in the Irrigation Department, the major contribution in the last 24 hours was 13.6 tmcft due to the rain in Chittoor and Nellore districts, and this entire quantum of water received in the rivers and reservoirs was either through flow from the neighbouring States or storage of rainwater on our landmass. Statistics According to the water audit statistics for the current water year (2020-21) from June 1, 2020, till January 6, 8.30 a.m., the rainfall contributed 6,085.71 tmcft., the inflows from other States contributed 5,922.46 tmcft and the total amount of water stored out of this quantum is only 869.05 tmcft in reservoirs - major and medium — groundwater and soil moisture. The officials believe this was a boon for the State as it could take care of rabi crop needs entirely. The total water utilised so far for irrigation and industry, has been just 1,318.74 tmcft, with irrigation accounting for 1,224.03 tmcft ,domestic needs close to 59 tmcft. Evaporation is estimated at 3,397.06 tmcft and outflows from the State 4,831.23 tmcft. The total surface and sub-surface outflow have been calculated at 1,592 tmcft. Quantum of water that got stored as groundwater was 139.46 tmcft, the water stored as soil moisture is estimated at 389.93 tmcft, the amount of water currently available in reservoirs, including geo-tagged Minor Irrigation tanks, is 278.61 tmcft. Meanwhile, farmers served by the K-C Canal under the AIKS banner, took to the streets, demanding the release of full quantum of water for rabi crops as there was sufficient water available in Srisailam Reservoir under the Andhra Pradesh quota.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-gets-12k-tmcft-of-water-after-30-years/article33516419.ece

07 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Residential sales revived in 2020 second half: Knight Frank||Office space transactions in Hyderabad at six million sqft in 2020 were 53% lower compared to the previous year, a decline that could have been sharper but for a rebound, from the pandemic-induced lows, in the October-December (fourth) quarter. Given 2019 stands out as the best in the decade with 12.8 million sqft, the 2020 transactions in comparison to 2018 were less by one million sqft and better than the 5.7 million sq ft and 5.9 million sq ft of 2017 and 2016 respectively, a report real estate consultancy Knight Frank India launched on Wednesday said. The first (January-March) quarter in 2020 saw 2.2 million sqft office transactions reported across Hyderabad, while there were no transactions in the April-June quarter amid the lockdown. A pick up was seen in July-September with 0.5 million sqft, which accelerated to 3.34 million sqft in the fourth quarter. Office transactions recorded 3.8 million sqft in H2 (July-December) 2020, jumped by 640% in Q4, compared to previous quarter, a release on the Hyderabad component of Knight Frank’s India Real Estate: H2 2020 report said. New additions In spite of supply challenges, owing to lockdown and exodus of labour in Q2 and Q3, Hyderabad’s office market recorded the second highest annual supply numbers in 2020. A total of 8.7 million sqft of new office space got added during the year, which is much higher than the decadal, annual average of 4.6 million sqft. West Hyderabad alone accounted for 99% of the second half transactions volume, an indicator of strong occupier preference for the location in the city. Knight Frank India Branch Director-Hyderabad Samson Arthur said “the office market saw a significant revival in Q4 2020. Despite pandemic impact, rentals remained resilient and office demand is now seeing a recalibration of size and design.” With vaccine round the corner, global companies have begun execution of their lease plans, he said. A sharp increase in space absorption by BFSI sector — driven by two large deals that together accounted for 1 million sqft of the total leasing activity in H2 — helped temper a fall in demand from other sectors, including IT. Rents, however, remain almost unchanged. Home sales On residential real estate market in Hyderabad, the Knight Frank report said sales revived in H2, but not enough to stop 2020 annual sales from being the decadal low. A total of 10,042 units were sold during the year, which was a 38% decline compared to 2019. Of the 5,260 units sold in H2, the transactions for 3,651 happened in the last quarter. Festive season promotions, COVID-induced push for newer homes with better layout to accommodate the new requirements of work from home and digital learning arrangements for kids and working parents, low home loan rates, softer residential prices and higher income savings were factors that pushed the demand, the release said. The share of residential units priced below Rs. 50 lakh increased in the second half, pointing to growth of affordable housing segment. Hyderabad’s residential market launches in 2020 stood at 12,826 units, with 8,404 of them in H2. The spurt in launches coupled with relatively muted sales volume resulted in unsold inventory numbers to rise to 7,180 units in H2. West Hyderabad continued to account for the highest share in residential launches, as well as sales, owing to its proximity to the IT business districts, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/office-space-deals-home-sales-pick-up-in-last-quarter-of-2020/article33516293.ece
07 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Green nod to SCCL’s plan to expand Ramagundam mine||At a time when Singareni Collieries is beset with COVID-induced production and business losses this financial year, the company’s plans to overcome the unforeseen downturn in its operations at least in the next fiscal have got a boost with its proposal for the expansion of Ramagundam opencast (OC)-III mine getting the environmental clearance. The green nod recommended by an expert committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) would allow the company to increase the coal production from the mine near Jallaram village of Kamanpur mandal in Peddapalli district to 8.82 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) with peak of 9.52 MTPA from the existing capacity of 6.3 MTPA with peak production possibility of 6.8 MTPA. The fresh nod would allow 20% production enhancement in the mine’s capacity in the initial five years, including coal production from 30 million tonnes (MT) to 38.42 MT and the removal of overburden to 285 million cubic meters (MCM) from 195 MCM. As the excess overburden of 90 MCM could not accommodated completely in the internal dump/back filling area, it is proposed to increase the height of existing internal and external dumps up to 120 meters by dumping the excess overburden in a safe manner. The height increase of dumps is planned in order to avoid additional land acquisition. According to the company officials, the Ramagundam OC-III was commissioned in 1988-89 with a production capacity of 2.75 MTPA and the first expansion was taken up from 2014-15 with enhanced production of 6.80 MTPA. Backfilling of overburden in the internal voids that began in 1994 is being continued. The fresh expansion, second one, proposes to increase the excavation area from the present 1,113.70 ha to 1,229.41 ha within the total project area of 2,070.10 ha. The expert panel, however, has asked the project proponent (SCCL) to ensure compliance of certain aspects with a specific time-line. The non-compliances include incomplete construction of embankment along Jallaram vagu (stream), provision of high-efficiency bag filters in the crusher area, development of three-tier green belt with mix of native plant species of fruit-bearing and aromatic trees and not with exotic ones and establishment of an effluent treatment plant for water discharged from the coal handling plant. The expert panel has also stipulated flood protection measures along Jallaram stream.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/green-nod-to-sccls-plan-to-expand-ramagundam-mine/article33516315.ece

The Commission ruled that after termination of agreement, demanding payment amounts to deficiency in service. The Commission comprising President Jabez Samuel and Member Ch. V. Narasimha Rao were dealing with a complaint filed by K. Prashanth Reddy (51) of Adilabad. The complainant stated that he availed a car loan of Rs. 5.60 lakh in August 2012 and paid the first 60 instalments diligently. On account of his regular payments, a top-up loan of Rs. 2.50 lakh was given for the same car, payable in 36 EMIs. Later, on account of financial difficulties, he was unable to pay the rest. He surrendered the car which the bank then sold online to a third party. This sale consideration was adjusted against the pending loan amount. An NOC was issued to the RTO, Adilabad, about the termination of the agreement, and removal of hypothecation. The complainant took an agricultural loan from the same bank and stated that he was paying EMIs regularly. However, in February 2019, the bank’s employees met the complainant and stated that there is an overdue amount of Rs. 1.50 lakh against the car loan. The complainant asked for a statement which was denied to him. For its part, the bank stated that after being given the car for reselling, it was sold online and loan adjustments were made. Despite this, Rs. 1.55 lakh were due. The bank denied that the loan amount was paid in full, and that the loan account was not closed. It stated that a demand notice of Rs. 1.55 lakh was issued and that since the amount is due, a no-objection certificate could not be issued. After taking the evidence placed on record and arguments into consideration, the Commission stated, “When the Opposite party’s bank issued termination of agreement between them and complainant, again they cannot demand the complainant for payment of any money pertaining to such terminated agreement. The act of the Opposite party i.e. issuance of legal notice to the complainant regarding the payment of terminated agreement comes under deficiency in service and unfair trade practice.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hdfc-asked-to-pay-rs-10000-compensation-to-loanee/article33516298.ece

07 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GHMC crèche turns store room||Several women staffers working at GHMC headquarters have got the short shrift from their employer when the daycare facilities have been withdrawn for their children. Entreaties to reopen the previously existing crèche have fallen on deaf ears, with the authorities using the facility as a storeroom for want of space. As per the Maternity Benefits (Amendment) Act, 2017, employers with 50 or more employees must provide crèche facilities close to the workplace. GHMC had been running daycare facilities decades before the provision has been enacted. Andhra Mahila Sabha was running the facility on the corporation premises before COVID-19 struck. With the pandemic at its peak, keeping infants and children grouped on closed premises was considered a health risk, and the crèche was closed down. However, several months later, even now, the crèche remains closed, and the hall allocated for the same is being used as a storage facility. Ramshackle cribs and play equipment can be seen pushed to a corner in the room which is now filled with dozens of bundles of blankets that had arrived from Tamil Nadu during floods in the city. “The blankets are kept away undistributed at more than a couple of locations in the city. Here, the crèche is used for the purpose as it was vacant,” said an employee on condition of anonymity. Women with infants and young children are facing many difficulties due to the shutdown. “I am forced to leave my son with my in-laws who are unable to handle him due to old age. The crèche had benefited scores of women in the past, and should not be closed now,” says a woman employee. The hall which was used as crèche is also badly in need of renovation, as parts of the false ceiling have crumbled. It also needs new play equipment and furniture. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), which is spending crores of rupees on renovation of the chambers of officials, has not paid much thought to this requirement, complained employees. Representations were made to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Commissioner D. S. Lokesh Kumar requesting him to ensure that the facility is reopened, but to no avail. “About 15 women went and gave a written request to the Commissioner, who promised to vacate the premises within one week. It has been a month since, and the crèche is still not functional,” said the employee. Enquiries with Mr.Lokesh Kumar have not yielded any response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmc-crche-turns-storeroom/article33516306.ece
07 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Will TPCC chief delay damage the party in Nagarjunasagar?||While differences over selection of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief are well-known, Telangana Congress leaders are also divided over whether the decision can be deferred till the Nagarjunasagar bypoll as sought by senior leader K. Jana Reddy. AICC Telangana in-charge Manickam Tagore’s discussion on Wednesday over web platform with TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka and all working presidents though focussed on deferring the PCC chief decision, also had to face questions on the need for delay when the entire State and the cadre were keenly watching. “A new name crops up everyday and our party’s image is being diluted due to the delay. We will respect the party’s decision but it should not be inordinately delayed in party’s interests,” was the suggestion from a senior leader. After such a huge exercise of opinion seeking from all sections within the party it would send a wrong signal if the party defers the decision. Both the ruling TRS and the BJP will target the Congress in the by-poll saying it cannot even decide its chief after such an exercise and it would be difficult for the party to counter that argument, is the opinion of some leaders. The latest discussion assumed significance after the name of MLC T. Jeevan Reddy suddenly cropped up apparently in an effort to pacify all the groups. Mr. Jeevan Reddy though never threw his hat in the ring was called to New Delhi last week to seek his opinion. “He was not interested but was willing to take the reigns if the party demands,” explained a senior party leader in New Delhi. Mr. Jeevan Reddy said that he was for any decision taken by Sonia Gandhi. After Mr. Jeevan Reddy’s name started doing the rounds, Mr. Jana Reddy sent a letter asking the party high command to postpone the PCC chief selection till the bypoll is completed not to displease anyone. It is said that Mr. Jana Reddy doesn’t want Komatireddy Venkata Reddy, who is also in the race for the top post, to stay away from electioneering in protest. The Komatireddy brothers have strong influence in the district and their anger can reflect in the polling. Party sources in New Delhi, however, claimed that AICC president Sonia Gandhi is yet to confirm Mr. Jeevan Reddy’s name. Meanwhile, AICC secretary Ch. Vamshichand Reddy reportedly said that he would support any decision taken by Rahul Gandhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/will-tpcc-chief-delay-damage-the-party-in-nagarjunasagar/article33516325.ece

07 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||NAFED MD defends new farm laws||“Entry to Agricultural Market Produce Committee mandis was restricted discouraging competition. The infrastructure was inadequate. Credit was not available to farmers,” said Sanjeev Chadha, MD of National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd defending the new farm laws. He was speaking at a webinar ‘Demystifying the three new Farm Reform Laws’ organised by Administrative Staff College of India on Wednesday. The Central government had launched a multi-pronged programme to create awareness about the three farm laws in the backdrop of nationwide protests by farmers. Using a PowerPoint presentation, Mr. Chadha explained the new flarm aws and spelt out the role of Nafed in a post-farm reform market in the country. “Horticulture has overtaken cereals in production. MSP is an executive instrument and not law. Once the private players get into the market, the transportation cost for farmers will get lower,” said Mr. Chadha. “The new farm laws helped to create self-sufficiency in the country. They created a product driven market the new laws will create demand-responsive value chain. The new farm laws enacted by the Centre will remove the obstructions created by the old laws,” said S. Sivakumar of ITC Limited. “The older Essential Commodities Act prevented investment in supply chain due to unpredictability of the market. Now that will change,” said Mr. Sivakumar adding that farm laws need not be a zero-sum game.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nafed-md-defends-new-farm-laws/article33516304.ece

07 January 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Centre protecting interests of the corporates: Tammineni||The BJP dispensation at the Centre is bent upon protecting the interests of the big corporate entities as is evident from its “callous indifference” towards the farmers’ relentless agitation demanding the repeal of farm laws on the borders of New Delhi, said the CPI (M) State secretary Tammineni Veerabhadram. Braving the severe cold wave conditions, thousands of farmers are continuing the agitation on the periphery of the national capital with unwavering resolve demanding the roll-back of the three farm laws, he said, alleging that the BJP regime remained adamant. He was addressing a gathering of farmers, agricultural labourers and the party cadres after participating in a human chain at the grain market here on Wednesday. The CPI (M) three town committee organised the human chain expressing solidarity with the farmers protesting against the farm laws near New Delhi. “The BJP regime is hell bent on handing over the farm sector to the big corporate companies to allow them exploit farmers and thrive. The ruling dispensation’s anti-farmer policies are aimed at allowing big corporate firms to monopolise the farm sector,” he charged, alleging that these detrimental policies will weaken the agriculture sector, the backbone of the country’s economy, and deepen the agrarian crisis. Khammam Agriculture Market Committee chairman M Venkataramana, the CPI (M) district secretary N Nageswara Rao, the representatives of the Khammam chamber of commerce and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-backing-corporates/article33516329.ece

She, along with 51 others, has filed a case before the High Court seeking Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) as per Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act – 2013 (LA Act – 2013). Battu Bhoolaxmi’s family used to own about two acres of land, which was transferred in the name of her two sons. The government paid them compensation for the land acquired for the construction of Mallannasagar.

Provided that widows, divorcees and women deserted by families shall be considered separate families.

They have urged the court to issue a writ declaring the action of respondent authorities in not following due procedure as per provisions of Act 30 of 2013 and rules therein for determination of R&R entitlements payable to the petitioners and in denying R&R entitlements to the petitioners/ project displaced persons of Vemulaghat village as illegal, unconstitutional and consequently direct the respondents to notify R&R scheme to the petitioners on a par with the project-displaced persons in the village after following due process under Act 30 of 2013.

07 January 2021||Mumbai,||Congress strongly objects to use of Sambhajinagar in government statement||In what could be seen as a first major face-off between the Congress and the Shiv Sena, Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat on Wednesday censured the director general, Information and Public Relations (IPR) Department, for using Sambhajinagar instead of Aurangabad while issuing a press release. The Sena and the Congress are allies in the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray holds the IPR portfolio. “The MVA government works on a common minimum programme (CMP) and constitutional values are part of it. We will oppose any renaming of city if social harmony is going to be disturbed. The Maharashtra DGIPR should not change the names of the cities at its will. It should be realised that government documents have legal importance,” Mr. Thorat, who is also the State Congress president, said, adding that renaming cities are not included in the CMP. The reaction from the Congress came after the official Twitter handle of the CM posted a photo about Wednesday’s Cabinet decision by the Medical Education Department handled by Congress leader Amit Deshmukh on increasing number of beds in government hospitals in Aurangabad. It mentioned Sambhajinagar while Aurangabad was in brackets. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Thackeray had written to the Union Civil Aviation Minister reminding him of renaming the Aurangabad airport after Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Both Houses of the State legislature have unanimously passed the resolution for it. Renaming of Aurangabad has kicked up a row ahead of the civic polls later this year. The Sena has been demanding it for years while the Opposition BJP has challenged the Sena to rename the city. The NCP, the other partner in the MVA, has chosen not to engage itself in the controversy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-strongly-objects-to-use-of-sambhajinagar-in-government-statement/article33515891.ece
07 January 2021||Mumbai,||Proposal to cut real estate premiums by 50% cleared||The Maharashtra Cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to cut real estate premiums by 50% till December 31, 2021, for all ongoing and new projects. Countering Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s allegation that the move would benefit select developers, the Cabinet said builders will have to pay premiums based on the Ready Reckoner rates of 2019 and 2020, whichever is higher. To ensure transfer of benefits to customers, developers who opt for the 50% cut in premiums will have to pay stamp duty on behalf of homebuyers. The move is based on the report of a State-appointed committee headed by HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh, which recommended slashing premiums to revive the real estate sector hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the previous Cabinet meeting, Congress ministers sought more time to study the proposal, while ministers from the Nationalist Congress Party and the Shiv Sena backed the move. On Wednesday, the Congress accepted the proposal after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray reached out to the party. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar asked if the sops extended to builders will reach customers. “There is no clarity if this move will reduce home prices. We as a party will continue questioning the government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/proposal-to-cut-real-estate-premiums-by-50-cleared/article33515897.ece
07 January 2021||Mumbai,||Eye on BMC polls, Cong. seeks free water for slum dwellers||The Mumbai city unit of Congress on Wednesday demanded free water to slum-dwellers who constitute almost 62% of the total population in the country’s financial capital. The demand, seen to be made with an eye on the 2022 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, resonates with the one made by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) during the Delhi polls. “We demand that every slum-dweller be given free water. The slums are under the clutches of water tanker mafia. Providing free water in the slums would mean freeing the residents from such elements. Water is a basic necessity and making water available to poor population will be of great benefit,” said Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap. Mr. Jagtap said as per his calculations BMC gets up to Rs. 500 crore as revenue from water bills every month. “This scheme, if implemented, would cost Rs. 162 crore per month. The amount is not big if we understand that 62% of the population will benefit,” he said. Asked whether the party supported regularisation of encroachments, Mr. Jagtap said that even the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government had assured of regularising slums up to 2017. “Providing water to regularised slums would not harm anyone. Moreover, it will completely eliminate anti-social elements such as tanker mafias from bastis who charge exorbitant amount from the poor for the sake of few litres of water,” he said. While reiterating that the Congress intends to contest all 227 wards in the BMC, Mr. Jagtap demanded absolute waiver of property tax from houses up to 500 square feet. “This is not our demand, but we are only asking the present government to implement the decision already taken by the previous BJP-led government,” he said, adding that both Houses of the State legislature have unanimously cleared this proposal and government resolutions were issued by the Devendra Fadnavis government twice in 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/eye-on-bmc-polls-cong-seeks-free-water-for-slum-dwellers/article33515890.ece
07 January 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Mumbai records this year’s first cadaver organ donation||The family of a 50-year-old businessman from Mulund on Tuesday donated his kidneys, liver and skin, thus making it Mumbai’s first cadaver organ donation of the year. The donor was declared brain dead at Fortis Hospital in Mulund after he suffered a posterior circulation stroke. His family was counselled by doctors and medical social workers following which the donor’s wife and brother gave their consent to donate his organs. One kidney and the liver were allocated to Fortis Hospital while the other kidney was transported to another city hospital. The skin was sent to the skin bank in Airoli. The liver was harvested by Dr. Swapnil Sharma, consultant, liver transplant and HPB surgery, and was transplanted into an in-house recipient, a 60-year-old male patient from Borivali, by Dr. Gaurav Gupta, consultant and chief surgeon. The 60-year-old receiver, a retired professional, had been waitlisted for a liver since December 2020 after being diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis. The kidney was transplanted into another in-house 67-year-old male recipient from Bhandup, who had been waitlisted since August 2014 after being diagnosed with end-stage renal disease. The kidney was harvested by consultant urologists Dr. Ramesh Mahajan while the transplant was carried out by Dr. Saurabh Patil. “There is a wide gap between the numbers of patients with organ failure waiting for a transplant and organs donated. Most patients unfortunately die while waiting for an organ, and every cadaver organ donation is a mammoth step towards bridging this gap,” Dr. Sharma said. Efforts by the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC), surgical and non-surgical teams of Fortis Hospital, medical social workers, and police officials helped in the successful cadaver organ donation. Dr. Bharat Shah, general secretary of ZTCC, Mumbai zone, said with increasing awareness families of almost 50% cases get convinced for donating organs of their loved ones who are now no more. “Unfortunately, due to the pandemic the transplant was affected. In 2019, Maharashtra had the highest number of transplants in the country. The scare of spreading the virus through transplantation hit most of the hospitals and hence they had stopped counselling the families,” he said.

According to CIDCO officials, due to the pandemic and technical issues, the development work of one to six stations of the 11 stations on line 1 was not being implemented at the expected speed. Hence, the earlier contractor was reportedly terminated. “The CIDCO is developing the Navi Mumbai Metro to make the public transport system in the city more efficient. The trial run of line 1 was conducted successfully on September 1, 2019,” a press release said. The trial was flagged off by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cidco-appoints-maha-metro-for-balance-works/article33515892.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Reinforcements rolling in for tractor rally today, say farmers||On the eve of the tractor rally, protesting farmers at the Singhu border on Wednesday remained determined to stay put till the Centre meets their demand to repeal the three controversial agriculture laws. They added that a large number of people from villages in Punjab and Haryana were on their way to the Delhi border to join the ongoing agitation. Several groups of farmers joined the protest at the Singhu border ahead of the tractor rally, which will see thousands march along the eastern and western expressways around Delhi. Despite the biting cold and incessant rain over the last few days, the farmers at the protest site maintained that all “hurdles” were being dealt with quickly and that all arrangements have been made to help them sustain their fight indefinitely. Kulwinder Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Patiala district, said: “I have been here since Day 1 and despite facing harsh weather conditions, our determination has remained the same. We are not going to move from here unless the laws are repealed. It is completely up to the government on when they want us to move. The day our demands are met we will return to our villages.” Stating that several women were part of a large contingent coming to the Delhi border on Thursday, Mr. Kulwinder said: “From our particular village, there are around 40 people who will reach the border for the tractor rally, several of whom are women. We are also prepared for Republic Day and to move forward into Delhi if the Central government does not accept our demands.” Amreek Singh, another farmer from Patiala who has been camping at the Singhu border for the last eight days, said: “We have not come here to leave before we get what we are fighting for. All arrangements and precautions required to sustain ourselves here are in place. Several more of our family members will be joining us soon.” The farmers who have been protesting for over 40 days now have demanded a repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee of Minimum Support Price. Amritpal Singh, another farmer from Punjab, said: “We are here for a legitimate cause and we will stand our ground. The government will have to concede as we are not willing to return.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/reinforcements-rolling-in-for-tractor-rally-today-say-farmers/article33515887.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mobile night shelters arrive at protest sites||Apart from makeshift elevated beds, waterproof tents and other resources, mobile night shelters have now made their way to Delhi borders where farmers’ have been protesting against three farm laws for over 40 days now. Around 25 buses, have been provided as mobile night shelters by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) at protest sites across the national capital to provide relief to the protesting farmers from the incessant rain. The buses, equipped with beds and blankets, have been stationed at the protest sites since Tuesday night, volunteers from the DSGMC said. Inderpreet Singh, a volunteer from the DSGMC at the Singhu border, said: “Out of the total number of buses, around 10 have been stationed at the Singhu border and the rest at Ghazipur and Tikri borders. Each bus has a capacity to accommodate 10-15 people.” “Whoever approaches us for shelter will be accommodated in these buses. If the requirement increases, more such mobile night shelters will be arranged. Women and children will be provided separate buses, keeping in mind their comfort,” said Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh said that some of the buses have air-conditioning facility as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mobile-night-shelters-arrive-at-protest-sites/article33515889.ece
07 January 2021||New Delhi,||‘How are candidates selected for UPSC mains, interview?’||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Centre and the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to explain how they were selecting candidates for the Civil Services mains exam and subsequent interview without declaring the actual number of vacancies, particularly for the disabled category. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh remarked, “When your vacancies are fluctuating, how many people will you call for the mains and interview? If you have power to call any number of candidates for mains and interviews without declaring the actual vacancies, it is known as arbitrariness.” The court also directed the Centre and the UPSC to explain why there was a difference of eight vacancies for disabled in the notification advertised by it against what is calculated by NGO, Sambhavana, a registered society of the disabled for the disabled. It, however, declined the plea to stay the mains exam, which is scheduled between January 8 and 17. Vacancies for disabled Sambhavana, in its plea, has claimed that the UPSC reserved only 24 vacancies for persons with disabilities out of a total 796 ‘expected approximate vacancies’. The NGO said this was below the 4% mandatory reservation under Section 34 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016. The plea added that 4% of 796 vacancies works out to 32. The petition further said that the UPSC’s notice was “illegal as what is certain and clear for the disabled under the RPwD Act, 2016, is made vague, ambiguous and uncertain by the device of expected approximate vacancies”. “The notice becomes a fraud on the RPwD Act since it gives 4% reservation of 796 expected approximate vacancies. To reserve something of that which does not legally exist is to legally give nothing,” Sambhavana said. Another petitioner in the case, Evara Foundation, in its plea, has contended that the number of seats reserved for visually impaired, deaf and hard of hearing and locomotor disabilities was not in accordance with the RPwD Act. The court will hear the case again on January 29.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/how-are-candidates-selected-for-upsc-mains-interview/article33515882.ece

07 January 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra’s active case tally surges again; 2,570 discharged||The pendulum swing in cases and recoveries continues in Maharashtra with the State reporting 4,382 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday as opposed to just 2,570 patients being discharged. The active cases once more breached the 50,000 mark to reach 50,808. The total case tally has now reached 19,54,553. As many as 66 fatalities saw the death toll climb to 49,825. The cumulative recoveries stand at 18,52,759 while the State’s recovery rate is 94.87%. “Of a total 1,31,34,019 laboratory samples tested thus far, 19,54,553 (with the case positivity rate down to 14.88%) have returned positive with over 73,000 samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said, adding that the case fatality stood at 2.55%. Cases in Pune district and western Maharashtra, however, continue on a downward slide despite a sharp spike in fresh cases in Pune, which in turn was offset by significant recoveries. Pune reported over 650 new cases to take its total case tally to 3,75,920. Eight deaths saw the toll rise to 7,787. As per the district administration figures, the active cases have dipped below the 5,500 mark to touch 5,498 while the district’s recovery rate has gone up to 96.10%. Pune city’s active case tally has come down to 2,700. Mumbai city recorded 795 new cases to take its total infections to 2,96,320 of whom just 7,484 are active.

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Georgia run-offs break records and trends||With control of the Senate as their prize, the high stakes Senate run-offs (re-races) in Georgia have broken several records and trends. In electing African American pastor, Raphael Warnock, the State chose its first black Senator ever and the first Democrat since 2000. If Democrat Jon Ossoff, who leads the second race, defeats incumbent David Perdue, he will be the youngest Senator since Joe Biden in 1973. He also broke Senate fundraising records by raising $106.8 million in two months. Historic win “Whether you voted for me or not — know this: I see you. I hear you. And I will fight for you,” Mr. Warnock said from his home during a televised victory speech, which underscored the historic nature of his win. The pastor had defeated former businesswoman Kelly Loeffler who was appointed by Georgia’s Governor in January last year after her Republican predecessor stepped down for health reasons. Speaking of his mother, Mr. Warnock said: “The 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else’s cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States Senator.” The pastor, who preaches at the Ebenezer Baptist Church where Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. preached, was a likely factor in the high early voting turnout among African Americans in the State. “With new votes joining the tally, we are on a strong path...,” tweeted former candidate for State Governor, Stacy Abrams, who is credited with mobilising votes in Georgia and playing a central role in its Democratic shift. In addition to the significance of Mr. Warnock’s victory for the party, Georgia had voted in November to send Mr. Biden to the White House, the first time a Democrat has won the presidential race in the state since 1992. Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler had portrayed their opponents as “dangerous”, “radical” and “socialist” and had embraced U.S. President Donald Trump, whose refusal to acknowledge his defeat may have turned off some GOP voters from voting in Georgia, harming the Republican candidates’ chances. Mr. Perdue’s team called for “time and transparency” early on Wednesday morning as votes were being counted while Mr. Ossoff’s side expressed confidence that their candidate would win on the back of uncounted ballots. The republican candidates’ message to Georgia voters that Democrats could take control of the Senate was undermined by Mr. Trump’s attempts to overthrow the election result. COVID-19 aid One of the earliest consequences of a Democrat-controlled Senate is likely to be eligible Americans getting $2,000 in coronavirus aid — up from the current $600. The higher number is generally supported by Democrats on Capitol Hill as well U.S. President Donald Trump. But enough Republicans in the Senate — including former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — were against it so it never got a vote as the 116th Congress wound down last week (the 117th Congress convened on Monday). The details of a follow-up COVID relief package passed by Congress would very much be impacted by who controls the Senate. “If you send Jon and the Reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door…,” Mr. Biden had said while campaigning in Georgia on Monday. No free pass The main consequence of a Democrat-controlled Senate is that Mr. Biden will have more leeway in terms of policy making, Cabinet and judicial appointments than he would have otherwise had in a Republican-controlled Senate. In the latter case, Mr. Biden would have likely relied heavily on Executive Orders to push through his policies — as both Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama did when faced with a split Congress. However, Mr. Biden will not have anything close to a free pass just because Democrats control the Senate as most legislation (such as non-budget related legislation) requires a majority of 60 rather than a simple majority of 51 (legislation passed via ‘budget reconciliation’). This can technically be changed but will require ending the filibuster (a tactic used by those opposing legislation to continue debate on it so it does not go to vote) — something the Democrats have considered but is likely to stay for now as not all Democrats support ending it. For bills that cannot be passed using the reconciliation route, Mr. Biden will need bipartisan support or will have to get only some of it done using the reconciliation process. Likely examples of these include legislation relating to Mr. Biden’s $2 trillion climate plan and the infrastructure Bill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/georgia-run-offs-break-records-and-trends/article33515544.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||China denies entry to WHO experts||The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said it was “very disappointed” that China had not allowed a team of international experts to go ahead with a visit to study the origins of COVID-19 that was planned for this week. China’s decision to not permit the trip appeared to come at the last minute and catch the WHO by surprise, with some of the experts already having left home and in transit when told the visit would not take place. ‘Very disappointed’ WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was “very disappointed” the visit could not go forward. “Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team’s arrival in China,” he said in Geneva. “I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials and I have once again made it clear the mission is a priority for the WHO.” The comments marked a rare instance of the WHO head expressing some displeasure with China’s government, which he has consistently praised from the start of the pandemic. He travelled to Beijing in January 28 last year, a week after authorities first revealed publicly that a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan could spread between people following three weeks of delays by local authorities. In a meeting then with President Xi Jinping, the WHO chief “praised the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated”. Beijing on Wednesday defended its decision to delay the visit. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the issue of origin-tracing was “very complicated”. “To ensure the work of the international expert team in China goes smoothly, we have to carry out necessary procedures and make relevant arrangements,” Ms. Hua said, adding that China had in February and July last year invited WHO experts to come to China on the issue of tracing origins. The WHO, however, said in December it had been granted permission for a visit of a team of 12-15 experts this month to study the origins of the outbreak. But how much the investigation will be able to achieve and how much access the team will have, more than one year after the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, has been debated by experts. Chinese authorities have suggested they will exert control over how much access international scientists will have and have also controlled research within China on the origins. In recent weeks, the State media in China has increasingly backed a narrative suggesting the virus came to China from elsewhere. Chinese scientists have been told that any studies into the origins of the coronavirus will have to be vetted by the authorities, while some scientists in China have put forward studies suggesting the virus was circulating in other countries, such as Italy, before it came to China. One pre-print, later withdrawn, suggested the first human transmission took place on the Indian subcontinent. In November, Michael Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said it would be “highly speculative” for the WHO “to say that the disease did not emerge in China”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-denies-entry-to-who-experts/article33515542.ece
07 January 2021||London,||U.K. court denies bail to Assange||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange must remain in custody in Britain, while the U.S. appeals a court decision to block his extradition to face charges there for leaking secret documents, a judge in London ruled on Wednesday. Judge Vanessa Baraitser, who on Monday refused to grant his extradition, told Westminster Magistrates Court that if released there were “substantial grounds” to suspect Mr. Assange would “fail to surrender” for future appeal hearings. “Mr. Assange still has an incentive to abscond from these as yet unresolved proceedings,” she said. ‘Huge disappointment’ “As a matter of fairness the U.S. must be able to challenge my decision. If Assange absconds during this process then they will lose the opportunity to do so.” Lawyer Stella Morris and Mr. Assange’s fiancee called the decision “a huge disappointment” and urged the U.S. Justice Department to drop the charges. A lawyer for the U.S. government earlier urged Judge Baraitser not to release the controversial Australian publisher, and detailed how it planned to challenge her decision to block his extradition on mental health grounds. “We respectfully submit on behalf of the U.S. that there are insurmountable hurdles to Mr. Assange being granted bail,” Clair Dobbin said. She added there were “no conditions that could guarantee his surrender” in future. “The history of his attempts to evade extradition to the United States demonstrate that he is capable of going to any length to avoid that possibility,” Ms. Dobbin said. The court “should be under no doubt about his resources to abscond” and pointed to offers of political asylum, notably from Mexico, she added. Mr. Assange attended court wearing a suit and mask over his mouth, two days after the unexpected decision to deny his removal to the United States on the basis the risk of his suicide there was too great. Edward Fitzgerald, his lawyer, argued he should be freed after spending 15 months in custody awaiting the extradition proceedings. Judge Baraitser’s decision on Monday “certainly changes any motive to abscond,” he added. “The court has given a decision and the decision has been that he should be discharged.” Mr. Assange is wanted in Washington to face 18 charges relating to the 2010 release by WikiLeaks of 5,00,000 secret files detailing aspects of military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. The U.S. claims he helped intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal the 2010 documents before exposing confidential sources around the world. He faces a possible 175-year sentence if convicted but Mr. Assange and his lawyers have long argued the case against him is politically motivated. He has been held at the high-security Belmarsh prison in southeast London. A previous request for bail in March on the grounds he was vulnerable to COVID-19 behind bars was rejected. Mr. Assange sought sanctuary in Ecuador’s Embassy in 2012, after Sweden issued an arrest warrant over sexual assault allegations. He spent seven years at the South American country’s mission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-court-denies-bail-to-assange/article33515552.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Control over ‘data’ behind Alibaba’s tussle with authorities||At the heart of the on-going tussle between Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group and regulators in China is the control over “troves of consumer-credit data” that authorities believe have given the e-commerce giant an unfair advantage over its competitors, according to a report on Wednesday. “How to regulate data monopolies is at the heart of the issue here,” an adviser to the antitrust committee of China’s State Council, or Cabinet, was quoted as saying by The Wall Street Journal . On December 24, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it had launched a probe into Alibaba’s “suspected monopolistic acts”, including “forcing merchants to choose one platform between two competitors”. This followed the last minute suspension, the previous month, of what was expected to be a record-breaking $35 billion initial public offering (IPO) of the Ant Group, which is the group’s financial arm and behind Alipay, China’s biggest digital payments company. China’s State media said last month Mr. Ma was “summoned” for talks ahead of the Ant Group’s IPO, and talks with regulators are on-going. The People’s Bank of China — China’s central bank — said last month it was, along with the banking and insurance regulator and the securities regulator, holding talks with the Ant Group aimed at “implementing financial regulatory requirements, holding onto fair competition and protecting consumers’ legitimate rights”.  The Wall Street Journal report said “central to the crackdown” on the Ant Group was “what regulators view as the unfair competitive advantage the company has over small lenders or even big banks through swaths of personal data harnessed from its payment and lifestyle app Alipay”, adding that “equipped with that information, Ant has originated loans to half a billion people and has gotten about 100 commercial banks to supply the majority of the funding”. Authorities now, the report said, were “seeking to overturn that business model” and “planning to break what they see as the company’s monopoly over data”, including by reportedly considering a plan requiring the group “to feed its data into a nationwide credit-reporting system.” The on-going probe has led to speculation about the future of Mr. Ma, who has cut back on public appearances since the IPO suspension. On Tuesday, the CNBC business news channel in the U.S. reported that the billionaire “was not missing” but “lying low for the time being”. While neither regulators nor State media in China have accused him of personal wrong-doing, he has been asked, Bloomberg reported earlier, to stay in the country while investigations into the group continue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/control-over-data-behind-alibabas-tussle-with-authorities/article33515549.ece
07 January 2021||COLOMBO,||‘Sri Lanka will gain from meeting Tamil concerns’||It is in “Sri Lanka’s own interest” that the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka are fulfilled, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said in Colombo on Wednesday. “That applies equally to commitments made by the Sri Lankan government on meaningful devolution, including the 13th Amendment,” he said, addressing a joint press conference with Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. Mr. Jaishankar earlier called on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and held bilateral discussions with his counterpart, as part of his three-day visit that began on Tuesday. “The progress and prosperity of Sri Lanka will surely be advanced as a consequence [of addressing Tamils’ expectations],” Mr. Jaishankar said, in an apparent reference to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s vision and policy framework titled “Vistas of prosperity and splendour”. Consistent with New Delhi’s messaging on Sri Lanka’s Tamil question since the Rajapaksas came to power, Mr. Jaishankar’s emphasis on Tamil concerns appeared a response to growing calls in Sri Lanka, including from senior Ministers in the ruling Rajapaksa administration and members of the influential Buddhist clergy, for the abolition of the provincial council system and the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. Their campaign, while the government mulls holding elections to its nine provincial councils, effectively threatens the only legislative guarantee of a measure of power devolution, that followed the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987. In his statement Mr. Gunawardena said President Rajapaksa had “firmly stated” his commitment to the well-being, progress and opportunities “to all our citizens — Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim” Support on health Thanking India for extending “tremendous support” to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy made “a very positive impact” on Sri Lanka’s health sector and the economy during this critical period. Meanwhile, a statement from the office of President Rajapaksa said, “India was ready to give priority to Sri Lanka” when it began supplying vaccines to other countries. “I carry back with me Sri Lanka’s interest in accessing vaccines from India,” Mr. Jaishankar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-will-gain-from-meeting-tamil-concerns/article33515603.ece

In picking Judge Garland, Mr. Biden is turning to an experienced judge who held senior positions at the Justice Department, including as a supervisor of the prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Senate Republicans will have to contend with the nomination of someone they spurned in 2016 — refusing even to hold hearings when a Supreme Court vacancy arose. Mr. Biden is expected to announce Judge Garland’s appointment on Thursday, along with other senior leaders of the department, including former Homeland Security Adviser Lisa Monaco as Deputy Attorney General and former Justice Department civil rights chief Vanita Gupta as Associate Attorney General.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/merrick-garland-is-bidens-pick-for-attorney-general/article33516181.ece
07 January 2021||Hong Kong,||Hong Kong acts again to crack down on dissent||China’s crackdown in Hong Kong escalated on Wednesday with police arresting more than 50 opposition figures in their largest operation since a draconian security law was imposed on the financial hub. The sweep is the latest salvo in Beijing’s battle to stamp out dissent in the semi-autonomous city after millions hit the streets in 2019 with huge pro-democracy protests. Police confirmed 53 people — including a U.S. citizen — were arrested for “subversion” in an early morning operation that involved about 1,000 officers. The charges were sparked by an attempt by opposition groups last year to win a majority in the city’s partially-elected legislature. Hong Kong’s security chief John Lee described the arrests as “necessary” and aimed at a group of people who tried to “sink Hong Kong into an abyss” and “overthrow the government”. Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong said those facing prosecution “strategically organised or implemented a plan to paralyse the government”. But the operation sparked a rebuke from Antony Blinken, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for Secretary of State, who said authorities were launching “an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights”. “The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing’s crackdown on democracy,” he added. The EU — which recently agreed a major investment deal with Beijing — called for the “immediate release” of those arrested and said it was eyeing possible further sanctions on China over the crackdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-escalates-hk-crackdown-with-arrests/article33515545.ece

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The importance of social interactions||A year of restricting ourselves to the confines of four walls has made us keenly aware of our past exchanges, not only with our families, but also with the larger society. Of the many victims of the COVID-19 pandemic are social interactions and the millions of friendships that should have formed at schools and workplaces. In a country riven with oppressive prejudices, the past year may have widened the greatest fault line in the Indian society — religion. Hindus and Muslims constitute not only the largest religious communities in India, but they perhaps also form the pair with the most fraught relations in the recent decade. Still, over the years, children and adults have mitigated the barriers created by socialisation through everyday interactions across religious groups. But what happens when everyone spends a year without forming new friendships or circumscribing their interactions to limited online (or offline) meetings? The pandemic’s collateral damage may include tolerance and understanding between the majority and the minority. Many inequities The religious identities of Hindus and Muslims have shaped their social ties, their political loyalties and their interaction with the Indian state. The long history of Hindu-Muslim ties in the subcontinent is marred by grotesque violence fuelled by myths, rumours and prejudice. The prevalence of cow-vigilante violence and ‘anti-conversion’ laws in recent years stands testimony to the worsening of inter-religious ties and deepening of prejudice by the majority community. In fact, tropes used to concoct fear about the Muslim community in the 1920s, such as ‘cow-killers’ and ‘abductors of Hindu women’, have found appeal even in the 21st century. The propagation of such stereotypes and the resulting prejudices allow for, and even normalise, violence against the minority to ‘protect the self’. While it would be an exaggeration to claim that every social encounter between members of the two groups is troubled, all is certainly not well in India. The display of prejudice need not take a violent form at all. The refusal to grant tenancy to members of the Muslim community pushes them to seek houses in a more homogenised area, progressively creating ghettos and further fuelling stereotypes. How do you mitigate a prejudice that is so pervasive and intense? ‘Contact Hypothesis’ In 1954, Gordon Allport publishedThe Nature of Prejudice, which contained, among other analyses of inter-group behaviour, a theory on prejudice. Specifically, it contained a hypothesis on how to reduce prejudice among majority and minority groups, popularly called the ‘Contact Hypothesis’. The idea was simple: contact (with some caveats) reduces prejudice. Subsequently, decades of social psychology research arrived at a far simpler idea: friendship reduces prejudice. Could it really be that simple? Could that work in India? The answer to both questions is the same: yes, to some extent. The empirical evidence largely supports the proposition. Multiple studies have noted that frequent interactions between members of different religious groups vastly reduce negative perceptions and anxiety towards ‘the other’. For instance, a youth study in 2017, conducted by Lokniti-CSDS and Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, found that 83% of Hindus who had a non-Hindu friend were comfortable having a non-Hindu neighbour, compared to 70% of Hindus who did not have a non-Hindu friend. Another paper discovered that even among people who consume media plentifully, interactions with people outside their community weakens prejudice. Education, however, presents an interesting puzzle. A recent study finds that college-educated Hindus are more likely than non-literate Hindus to perceive the Muslim community negatively, irrespective of whether they had a friend from the community or not. Although close interaction may ‘significantly’ reduce prejudices, this reduction is minimal at best. Firstly, the attitudes of suspicion and negativity towards the Muslim minority are deeply entrenched in the Indian society. Secondly, as this newspaper has reported over the last few years, the ghettoisation of Muslims continues to define both urban and rural landscapes. This ensures that most instances of quotidian social interactions — be it an evening tea or meeting at markets — are effectively denied, thereby limiting the building of lasting friendships at workplaces and schools. Thirdly, while Hindu individuals might hold great respect and affection for Muslim friends, they might not hold the same view about the community as a whole since they would consider a Muslim friend to be an ‘exception to the rule’. As a result, whilst interactions do take place and reduce prejudice, they do not cross a threshold already laid down by generations of socialisation and stereotypes. Redefining the ‘us’ Prejudice is a peculiar phenomenon. It is sustained through time, remains unaffected by even positive interpersonal relations, and provides the ammunition for communalism. Ashutosh Varshney asks in his bookEthnic Conflict and Civic Life, “Why do Hindus and Muslims live peacefully in Calicut but not in Aligarh?”. The answer, as he notes, lies in civic engagement and redefining the ‘us’. Ties need to be forged not just between individuals, but also across larger communities such that the relationships breach the confines of religious identities and encompass a multitude of identities. Be it local neighbourhood associations, professional unions or linguistic associations, membership of this civil society creates a new ‘us’. It allows society to maintain open lines of communication, even during a pandemic. During a year in which students and professionals have remained within the confines of their houses, what they have missed out on are unencumbered everyday interactions with their peers. Bonds of camaraderie are built over watercooler chats and rants about bus mates. In the absence of such avenues, it behoves parents, teachers and employers to encourage engagement through social organisations or other forms of safe civic engagement.

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The challenge of distributing opportunities better||Doctors dealing with head injuries ask certain questions to determine if the patient is fully oriented. What year is this? Who is the prime minister of India? And so on. These are questions to which “Don’t know” is definitely an abnormal response. I have often wondered whether “what are your views on reservation?” would be a good or a bad post-concussion diagnostic question. On the one hand, every Indian has an opinion. On the other hand, the most opinionated usually air their views without accessing their brains. A changing divide But things are changing. Until recently, reservation was at once our most divisive and our most unifying public issue. It divided Indians into the implacably opposed camps of the ‘reserved’ and the ‘general’ categories, with the latter dominating every aspect of public life with the partial exception of electoral politics. It also cemented internal solidarities within each camp, helping to hide hierarchical divisions and conflicting interests. As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, the tables are turning: the line separating ‘reserved’ and ‘general’ is becoming blurred, while long-simmering differences within each group can no longer be suppressed. How have these changes impacted reservation as an idea and as practice? The answer to this question has many dimensions. Only those relating to dominant ideologies and the law are considered below. Quota, ideology and merit The ideologies that influence us most deeply shape our view of the world while remaining fully transparent themselves, like the lenses of our spectacles. Reservation — especially caste-based reservation — is a subject saturated in ideology. To eyes schooled in the dominant upper-caste ideology, quotas for “them” loom large and are seen as unambiguously bad and unjustified. Quotas meant for “us” — like the reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), or for the wards of employees or alumni of universities and colleges — are not even visible as quotas, and even when they are, they do not look the same at all. Here is an interesting example. Some years ago, the large public university where I teach formalised and standardised the uneven practices followed in the past by different departments. It created the largest quota we have by setting aside half of all postgraduate seats for the students enrolled in its own undergraduate honours programmes. In other words, 50% of our seats in MA/MSc are reserved for those with BA/BSc honours degrees in the same subject from our own university. This is a straightforward quota, but it is officially called the ‘Merit Stream’. It does not matter whether the name was deliberately chosen to ward-off the stigma of reservation or whether it is a genuine case of ideological blindness. What is interesting about the name is that it unintentionally brings together words such as quota and merit that are thought to be ideological opposites. The seemingly contradictory name reminds us that, in fact, all quotas are merit quotas since they apply merit-based criteria of selection to the pool of eligible candidates. Never mutually exclusive This leads to the unsettling discovery that merit and reservation are not — they have never been — mutually exclusive. Just as every quota today involves fierce competition among the eligible, every claim to merit is also built on structures of exclusionary access, or reservation-like arrangements, that allow merit to be acquired. For example, expensive private schools or coaching institutes are effectively reserved for the rich. In the real world, what is called merit is always a mix of ability, effort, and social capital, with the latter usually playing a big role. This may seem rather obvious, but it is vehemently denied by the ideology of merit which constructs it as an exclusively individual and innate thing. In practice, ‘merit’ has been a code word expressing the upper-caste sense of entitlement. But its magic is weakening as ever-growing numbers of “them” start to score higher marks than many of “us”. Moreover, the problems with depending exclusively on examination marks — the universal, and usually only, measure of merit in our system — are becoming hard to ignore. As competition forces a descent into the absurdity of third and fourth decimal place rankings, a new note of doubt is creeping into the language of upper-caste entitlement. The most recent judgment of the Supreme Court on reservation ( Saurav Yadav vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Others , October 18, 2020) serves as a reminder that it is an increasingly complex intersectional issue because social identities are no longer singular. The judgment also upholds the principle, stated and clarified in the wake of the so-called “Mandal judgment” during the 1990s, that the un-reserved category must be open to all, including those belonging to categories entitled to reservations. Not surprisingly, ideology has lagged behind the law. Upper-caste sentiment has been slow to accept that the un-reserved category cannot be treated as a quota reserved for the upper castes. A side-effect of the “reservation castes” forcing their way into the un-reserved category has been the grudging acknowledgement that rather than recognising excellence, merit criteria actually perform a rationing function in our system. They offer a socially acceptable way to reconcile the large number of meritorious candidates with the small number of places available. True merit cannot be measured by examination marks alone, as the late Arun Jaitley declared in Parliament when piloting the EWS reservation bill. Turning points The year 2021 happens to be the centenary year of the “Communal” Government Order (GO) in Madras Presidency, which introduced reservation based on castes and communities. January 9 will be the second anniversary of the EWS reservation law passed in 2019, which created the first explicit mechanism of reservation for the upper castes (though carefully not named as such). And January 26 will mark the 70th birthday of our Constitution, which created, for the first time in our history, the figure of the caste-less citizen. These three legal events also mark crucial turning points in the intertwined histories of merit-as-ideology and reservation-as-policy. Acknowledging caste as norm The Communal GO was the colonial government’s way of acknowledging the inequalities of caste and finding politically expedient ways of dealing with it. The two unintended consequences of our Constitution were first, the birth of the ideology of casteless-ness, and the positioning of reservation as the explicit exception to this implicit norm. The second was the consequent rise of the rhetoric of merit as caste-politics by other means. EWS reservation seems to bring the republic back full circle, tacitly acknowledging caste as the implicit norm despite continuing with the masquerade of casteless-ness. We are nowhere near a resolution, but at least upper-caste politics is also in the open now. Most important, the ideological weaponising of merit is being exposed for what it is. Hopefully,this will enable us to tackle the shared challenge of finding better ways of distributing opportunities and measuring abilities. Satish Deshpande teaches Sociology at Delhi University.

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Boosting India with maritime domain awareness||The legendary military theorist, Sun Tzu, is once said to have observed that the critical element in battle was foreknowledge, but that it “could not be elicited from spirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor from calculations”. As the great Chinese general saw it, foreknowledge could only be gathered with specialised tools and by men who knew the enemy well. A prior reading of the adversary and the theatre of battle, the master tactician asserted, could decisively shift the balance of fortune in war. Nature of the enemy at sea In the modern maritime arena, war is a more complex proposition than in the days of Sun Tzu, but ‘foreknowledge’ is still critical. Today, the enemy at sea is often unrecognisable — a terrorist, a pirate, a criminal or a sea robber — an invisible presence that lurks behind regular actors such as fishermen and port workers. Law enforcement agencies today need to be a lot more vigilant, highly reliant on high-grade sensors and communication networks that observe and track suspicious movements, sharing information in real time. Practitioners describe this state of enhanced consciousness as maritime domain awareness. Of late, the Indian Navy has been on a drive to improve domain awareness in the Indian Ocean. The Navy is seeking to expand India’s surveillance footprint by setting up radar stations in the Maldives, Myanmar and Bangladesh; Mauritius, the Seychelles and Sri Lanka have already integrated into the wider coastal radar chain network. The Indian Navy’s efforts seem focused primarily on monitoring Chinese activity in the Eastern Indian Ocean, particularly in the seas around the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Since June 2020, when the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army clashed in Galwan in northern Ladakh, Indian maritime planners have been wary of the possibility of a greater Chinese presence in the eastern littorals. In recent months, India’s P-8I aircraft have scoured the near-seas for People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) submarines, and Indian naval ships have patrolled the Andaman Seas and eastern chokepoints to deter any maritime adventurism by Beijing. Neighbourhood synergies But maritime domain awareness is also generating cooperative synergies in the neighbourhood. There are reports that seven Indian Ocean countries — Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Mauritius and the Seychelles — will soon post Liaison Officers at the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region in Gurugram. . France already has an officer at the IFC, and four other Indo-Pacific navies — Australia, Japan, the U.K and the U.S. — have also agreed to position officers at the centre, fast emerging as the most prominent information hub in the Eastern Indian Ocean. New Delhi is also upping its engagement in the Western Indian Ocean by positioning a Liaison Officer at the Regional Maritime Information Fusion Centre (RMIFC) in Madagascar. Established under the auspices of the Indian Ocean Commission that India joined recently as an ‘observer’, the RMIFC is a key centre of maritime information in the Western Indian Ocean. India has also posted an officer at the European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz (EMASOH) in Abu Dhabi to assist in the monitoring of maritime activity in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. The French connection Delhi’s moves in the Western and South Western littorals have been facilitated by France, a key Indian Ocean power and a critical partner for India in the region. Having signed a logistics agreement with New Delhi in 2019, Paris is keen for a stronger partnership in the maritime commons. France has been instrumental in securing ‘observer’ status for India at the Indian Ocean Commission, and is pushing for greater Indian participation in security initiatives in the Western Indian Ocean. From an operational perspective, however, the Indian Navy’s priority remains South Asia, where the naval leadership remains focused on underwater domain awareness in the Eastern Indian Ocean. China watch There is concern among maritime watchers that the PLAN may be poised to develop a generation of quieter submarines that would be hard to detect in the near-seas. Three years after the Chinese staged a breakthrough in submarine propulsion by successful testing shaftless rim-driven pump-jets, analysts fear that the next generation of PLAN nuclear submarines could be stealthier than ever, capable of beating adversary surveillance. The recent discovery of a Chinese unmanned underwater vehicle close to a southern Indonesian island suggests that China may already be mapping the undersea terrain in the approaches to the Indian Ocean Region, with a view to advance submarine operations. Not surprisingly, India has moved to expand its underwater detection capabilities in the Eastern chokepoints. In a bid to enhance surveillance over sensitive sea spaces, the Indian Navy has inducted two Sea Guardian drones on lease from the United States. With nine operational P-8I aircraft, the Navy’s coverage of the Bay of Bengal littoral is already considerable. With nine more aircraft planned to be inducted — three under an ongoing contract from the U.S. and six as part of a deal being negotiated with Washington — the surveillance footprint is set to further grow. Speculation abounds that New Delhi might also partner Japan in installing an array of undersea sensors near the Andaman Islands to help detect Chinese submarines. The real test India’s initiatives in the maritime domain are motivated by more than just strategic considerations. Indian decision makers recognise the need for cooperative tools to fight transnational crime in the littorals. White shipping agreements with 21 countries in the Indian Ocean have enabled a comprehensive picture of maritime traffic, even as efforts are under way to help smaller island states build capacity to combat regional threats. India’s military satellite (GSAT-7A) may soon facilitate a real time sharing of maritime information with partners. These endeavours, naval officers say, are a manifestation of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR), Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s philosophical mantra that advances the idea of India as a ‘security provider’ and ‘preferred partner’ in the Indo-Pacific region. Indian initiatives, however, are yet to bring about an alignment of objectives and strategies of regional littoral states. While cooperative information sharing allows for a joint evaluation of threats, countries do not always share vital information timeously. To bring real change, India must ensure seamless information flow, generating operational synergy with partners, and aim to expand collaborative endeavours in shared spaces. That would be the real test of the maritime domain awareness ‘game-changing’ potential.

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The quagmire that is Brexit||Brexit was a bit of a cliffhanger, but a deal was reached, merely a week before the deadline on December 31, 2020. It put to end years of agonised speculation over whether Brexit would end in a calamitous no-deal. The agreement became yet another superficial grandstanding moment for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as he was photographed with arms triumphantly outstretched, thumbs upturned on either end. He, quite predictably, proclaimed that Brexit had been “done”. The reality, however, will be grimmer and the devil lying in wait in the detail of the document will inevitably catch up with Mr. Johnson. It may spell doom for his career in much the same manner as the Europe question has brought an end to the career of many a Conservative Prime Minister before him. The deal was itself rushed through on December 30 for Parliamentary approval with little opportunity for any meaningful deliberation. It seemed as if everyone just wanted to put Brexit behind them and ‘get on with it’, as the catchphrase that caught on, put it. To the relief of many, a deal was struck, but the widespread sentiment seems to be that a bad deal is at least better than a no-deal. Brexit may turn out to be a prop that hid the genuine problems of the country: deindustrialisation and the loss of manufacturing, a lopsided economy skewed far too heavily towards services and the financial sector, low productivity, and a country whose public services had been stripped almost to the bone by a decade of almost Scrooge-like Conservative government-enforced austerity measures. It was only the overwhelming presence of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced the British government to loosen the purse strings of the exchequer. The question that now looms is what will happen to the U.K. and the EU. Both entities can never be the same again. The U.K. wants to be an independent island state with the full panoply of its sovereignty intact. Soon, the most ardent of Brexiteers are bound to realise the pyrrhic nature of this Brexit victory. What will Britain do with all the sovereignty supposedly retrieved from the EU? The sovereignty reclaimed will probably be like a currency whose value rapidly depreciates, or a worthless piece of ornamentation that no one knows what to do with. Through the law of unintended consequences, Brexit might just result in huge changes for both the U.K. and the EU. Ultimately, the English nationalism at the heart of the Brexit project may be responsible for the break-up of Britain. One parliamentarian from the Scottish National Party (SNP) has described the recently concluded deal as a ‘steaming mug of excrement’. The position of Northern Ireland has become that much more precarious and untenable in the union. As for the EU, this is also a bloc riddled with many problems. The role of the liberal-Left This is where the liberal-Left in the U.K., grieving almost disconsolately for the loss of Europe, could play a significant role. The tendency to stare too long at the Brexit door that has been shut in the face of the European Union prevents the liberal-Left from looking at other doors and windows that might have opened. What has really made the EU project meaningful and worthwhile for many in the liberal-Left is its ability to underline the dangers of renascent nationalism across various member states of the EU. To that extent, it is a worthwhile and noble project. The more fundamental flaw at the heart of the EU is the particular kind of economic neoliberalism that underpins it, ‘German ordoliberalism’ as it is known. It is this idea that may need to be redressed. Otherwise, it might become the undoing of the Europe project itself. On a spectrum of soft and hard versions of Brexit, the deal that was effected by Boris Johnson was very much on the side of a hard one. Such a hard version of Brexit, favoured by the extreme Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, has always wanted to create a deregulated, low-tax economy. This could bring the U.K. into greater conflict with the more regulation-friendly EU, which is likely to view the U.K. as a competitor, leading to an increase in tariff barriers. For a future free of conflict, both sides should perhaps rid themselves of the particular versions of neoliberalism that have beset them and brought them to this point of bitterness. For the U.K., it is a Thatcherite, low-regulation, and low-tax neoliberalism with its associated hatred of Europe; for the EU, it is the German ordoliberalism that creates economic rules-based orthodoxy, that may in its rigidity undermine the worthy nature of the EU project itself.

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||When art comes to the audience||The International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), hailed by many as the best film festival in the country, recently announced that the festival will be held across four locations in Kerala between February-March this year as a precautionary measure against COVID-19 to avoid crowding and eliminate travel for those willing to attend it. The festival, which is held in Thiruvananthapuram every year, will now also travel to Kochi, Thalassery and Palakkad. While this may be a special measure considering the state of the pandemic in the country and around the world, this model perhaps merits some serious consideration for the future. It is a known fact that film festivals centred around cities have a certain logistical convenience. During such an event, film lovers from different parts of the State and country travel to the location to participate in the proceedings and catch up with the latest works in the world of cinema. Film festivals, however, are not just screening avenues, but also spaces for dialogue and deliberation on the nature and craft of filmmaking. A film festival is thus much more than an event — it induces a culture of learning and thoughtful debate around the art of films. One could argue that the world of film festivals is a parallel institution and a breeding ground for generations of potential filmmakers. The educational role of such festivals cannot be overlooked or denied. Cinema, after all, is an outcome of sociopolitical and artistic sensibilities. Local meets global Film festivals usually offer a combination of foreign films with a generous dose of indigenous and homegrown filmmaking practices that are scheduled during the event. This lends a specific context to the festival, which exposes its viewers to films from various parts of the world, as well as some of the most exciting new works in the country. This rendezvous is paramount for festival programming and curation. The Kochi-Muziris Biennale also does a marvellous job of showcasing some of Kerala’s talent in the visual arts alongside artistes from all over the world. The creation of such a cultural cauldron is achieved not at the cost of erosion of local voices and talent. The decision to hold the film festival across four locations in Kerala, a step towards decentralisation, is a welcome move. This will help reach a wider demography — a population that may be interested in films but may not have the means to travel to the centre to participate in the festival. Instead of the audience going to the centre, the centre, thus, chooses to reach the audience. This further strengthens peoples’ right to access cinema — to watch films made beyond their State and language, which are anyway released in local theatres for economic reasons. Cinema literacy The step also assumes significance in a film-literate State like Kerala, where a popular legend is that South Korean director Kim Ki-duk was once mobbed upon his arrival in the State; the recent outpouring of grief after his death also demonstrates that Malayalis thought of the director as one of their own. Only films can induce cinema literacy, and for such literacy to be broad-based, film festivals are crucial. During the ongoing pandemic, several film festivals went online and we saw movies from the confines of our homes. However, that was a small number considering infrastructural challenges. Physical film festivals, thus, do not have any alternative in terms of outreach. While I am not suggesting that taking cinema to various locations will herald major changes in viewership, it could perhaps work as an introduction to a different aesthetic altogether. Hence, the inclusion of local content is of great importance in a festival’s programming. In recent times, the emergence of various locally-funded, smaller film festivals in non-metropolitan pockets of the country further indicates the need and desire to watch films beyond the usual commercial releases. In this spirit, the experience of a film festival should be regularly extended to all and not confined to cities alone.

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Building by accord||With the Supreme Court’s 2-1 judgment clearing the Central Vista project for New Delhi, the Narendra Modi government can now indelibly reshape the national capital’s visual landscape. Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari found no infirmity in the approvals granted by the Central Vista Committee, Delhi Urban Art Commission, the Heritage Conservation Committee and other bodies, paving the way for a new Parliament building and other edifices of government to come up. Justice Sanjiv Khanna, while agreeing with the majority opinion on the call for bid, award and the decision of the Urban Commission, dissented on the key issue of public participation in the entire exercise, which vitiated the endorsement of land use change. Governments should naturally be free to plan policies and programmes on behalf of the people, with no prior restraint, but subject to judicial review to ensure accountability. Judged against this principle, the Centre is simply exercising its privilege to plan a new set of buildings to house its establishment and the federal legislature. While the final cost estimate is unclear, planned expenditures are in excess of Rs. 13,450 crore for, among other things, a new Central Secretariat, Vice-President’s enclave and Prime Minister’s residence, besides Rs. 971 crore for the new Parliament. With a national consensus, such a colossal plan might be a crowning achievement for the 75th year of Independence in 2022. What is germane to the question, however, is its appropriateness in a year of unprecedented disruption due to COVID-19. This is when an elected government must give its undivided attention to schemes for the common weal and not be tempted into extravagant indulgence. As Justice Khanna has pointed out, public consultation in a democracy requires citizens to be able to assess the project’s rationale, armed with information on the official reasoning, and with sufficient time at their disposal. The essence of their view should inform the final decision. Opportunities for public consultation, already incorporated into modern laws and also in the Delhi Development Act, in no way fetter the executive. It would be appropriate, therefore, for the Centre to attempt consensus-building on Central Vista, without showing undue anxiety and haste in taking up all planned structures together. The pandemic’s course points to uncertainty on restoration of economic health, and ameliorating the damage to large sectors of the economy, especially in services. In the run-up to 2022, the government will be tested on its ability to ensure good health for all citizens, revive normative education and provide stronger welfare. Prioritising Central Vista can prove to be a distraction from the task.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/building-by-accord/article33515525.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The pursuit of Assange||The decision by a British district judge to block the extradition of Julian Assange to the U.S. on the grounds of his mental health is a temporary setback to America’s efforts to try the WikiLeaks founder under its law on spying charges. In her ruling, judge Vanessa Baraitser said “the mental condition of Mr. Assange is such that it would be oppressive to extradite him to the U.S.” While it is a small victory for his lawyers and supporters, their fight to prevent his extradition and secure his freedom is far from over. Judge Baraitser has blocked his extradition only on medical grounds because she thought his possible detention in isolation in the U.S. would likely result in a suicide attempt. She rejected the defence lawyers’ arguments that Mr. Assange’s prosecution was politically motivated and violated his rights to free expression. She also observed that his conduct “took him outside the role of investigative journalism”, agreeing with the U.S. authorities’ assertion on WikiLeaks. Mr. Assange, who is wanted in the U.S. on multiple charges of breaking espionage laws and conspiring to hack a military computer, has repeatedly defended his organisation’s operations, terming them public interest journalism. U.S. prosecutors allege that he helped former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning crack an encrypted password and download classified information, the leaking of which endangered American intelligence sources. The Justice Department also claims that he had conspired with hackers to obtain classified information. It is ironic that the U.S., which takes pride in its freedoms and commitment to protecting human rights, is relentlessly pursuing a man who exposed some of the worst rights violations by the American military. Until WikiLeaks released the classified documents that Ms. Manning downloaded, the world believed that the July 2007 killings of a dozen Iraqis, including two Reuters staffers, happened in a firefight with a U.S. aircrew. But video footage by WikiLeaks showed the aircrew laughing after they killed 12 innocent people. WikiLeaks files also exposed the killings of hundreds of Afghan civilians by U.S. forces. These were incidents the U.S. had swept under the carpet, and WikiLeaks had undoubtedly done public service, allowing the questioning of the conduct of war by the world’s supreme military power. Instead of accepting its military’s mistakes, the U.S. went after the messenger. In the U.S., sensitive or leaked information published by the news media is protected under the First Amendment, a reason why the Obama administration decided against prosecuting WikiLeaks. But the Trump administration reversed tack. The new Biden-led government must rethink its predecessor’s approach. It is unfortunate that a fresh bail application filed by Mr. Assange’s lawyers was rejected by a British judge on Wednesday. The British legal system should take a benign view of his condition and cause.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-pursuit-of-assange/article33515526.ece

This was indicated by a team of nine Opposition leaders to pressmen after its meeting with the Chief Election Commissioner, Mr. S.P. Sen Verma, this morning. The parties represented in the team were Congress (O), the Swatantra, the Jan Sangh, the B.K.D., and the Samyuktha Socialist Party. The Opposition leaders had presented a memorandum alleging blatant abuse of Government machinery by the ruling party (Congress-R) and suggesting that the Election Commission should go ahead with the proposed electoral reforms proposed a year ago to make the law more stringent in regard to corruption. One instance mentioned by the Opposition leaders to Mr. Sen Verma was that the use of all vehicles could be stopped on the polling day, barring those relating to emergency transport. The Opposition leaders in their memorandum said the press conference held by the Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi on December, 29, 1970 was an instance of misuse of Government machinery for party ends by the Ruling Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/complaint-to-poll-chief/article33515534.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Services PMI signals expansion slowing, businesses halt hiring||India’s services sector activity expanded at a slower pace in December as growth in sales eased to a three-month low and staff hiring came to a halt amid weak business optimism, a monthly survey showed on Wednesday. IHS Markit’s seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index fell to 52.3 in December, from 53.7 in November. Momentum slips “Although the news that the service sector remained in expansion mode during December is welcome, the fact that growth lost momentum yet again shouldn’t be disregarded,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. Companies indicated that growth was supported by new work orders, though curbed by competitive pressures and the COVID-19 pandemic, IHS Markit noted. Global COVID-19 restrictions, particularly travel bans, reportedly restricted international demand for Indian services at the end of 2020. New export business decreased sharply, but at the slowest pace since March. “A spike in COVID-19 cases was reported as a key factor restricting growth of new work intakes among service providers, which in turn curbed the rise in output and led to increased business uncertainty about the outlook,” Ms. Lima noted. “Given the damaging impact of the pandemic on the service economy, some companies are facing financial difficulties, which is preventing staff hiring.

07 January 2021||New Delhi,||Maintain status quo on accounts of Anil Ambani firms, HC tells SBI||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the State Bank of India (SBI) to maintain status quo with regard to the accounts of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communication, Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel, which have been declared fraudulent. Justice Prateek Jalan, however, allowed the SBI to take further steps in the nature of investigation or proceedings against the erstwhile directors and the three companies, independent of the order declaring the accounts as fraudulent. The high court was hearing a plea by the erstwhile directors of the three companies challenging a 2016 circular of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on declaration of their accounts as fraudulent by banks. ‘No prior notice needed’ The plea stated that the RBI circular allowed the banks to declare an account as fraudulent without giving any prior notice or communication to the account holder. The petition also stated that there were similar cases filed by other companies challenging the circular pending before the high court. The counsel for Reliance argued that the high court had granted protection to the other companies in those cases. Taking note of the submission, the high court directed the SBI to maintain status quo with regard to the accounts of the three companies till next date of hearing on January 13, when it will be heard along with other similar cases. The court also asked the RBI to submit its response to the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/maintain-status-quo-on-accounts-of-anil-ambani-firms-hc-tells-sbi/article33515518.ece

07 January 2021||SYDNEY,||Rohit-rich India looks to build on MCG high||Having touched nadir and zenith in a span of 10 days, India will look to start afresh against Australia with star batsman Rohit Sharma’s presence adding a new dimension to what promises to be an enthralling third Test starting at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday. If Ajinkya Rahane’s side can go 2-1 up and help the visitors retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, it will be one of the finest hours in the history of Indian cricket.  Rahane, who led the way both with the bat and as captain at Melbourne, will play with more confidence while facing the Australian attack of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon. Winning battles In the bowling department, R. Ashwin has won crucial battles against Australia’s key players, including Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne. Jasprit Bumrah will lead the pace attack, bringing out his bagful of tricks. Pacer Navdeep Saini will make his debut, replacing Umesh Yadav who flew back after an injury.  Seldom has an Australian batting unit, that boasts of a player of Smith’s calibre, looked so circumspect. Warner being pushed The pressure is understandable as Australia is literally pushing a 70% fit David Warner out there in the middle to combat fire with fire even as his statements make it clear that he is not at all comfortable with the idea. “He is energetic, professional, who could make an instant impact and fills guys with confidence,” Paine’s words on the eve of the match reflecting the desperation in the Aussie ranks.  The teams:   India: Ajinkya Rahane (Capt.), Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, R. Ashwin, Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, and Navdeep Saini.   Australia (likely): Tim Paine (Capt. & wk), David Warner, Will Pucovski, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Matthew Wade, Cameron Green, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, and Josh Hazlewood.   Umpires: Bruce Oxenford and Rod Tucker; Third umpire: Paul Reiffel; Fourth umpire: Claire Polosak.   Match referee: David Boon.   Match starts at 5 a.m. IST.   Live on Sony Ten 1, Sony Ten 3 and Sony Six (SD & HD).   Being in quarantine definitely has its own challenges, but as a team we are focusing on the game. We know that life outside in Sydney is completely normal but players are in quarantine, which is a challenge Ajinkya Rahane||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohit-rich-india-will-look-to-ride-momentum/article33515613.ece
07 January 2021||CHRISTCHURCH,||Jamieson bowls NZ to series sweep||Towering paceman Kyle Jamieson completed an 11-wicket match haul on Wednesday as New Zealand thrashed Pakistan in the second Test to become the world’s top-ranked team. Jamieson was near unplayable in Pakistan’s second innings, finishing with six for 48 to go with his five for 69 in the first innings, as the tourists were all out for 186 during day four’s final session to give the Kiwis win by an innings and 176 runs. In his sixth Test after making his debut against India 10 months ago, the 26-year-old Jamieson has taken 36 wickets at a stunning 13.27 and with four five-wicket hauls to his credit. The win, which saw it sweep the series 2-0, also confirmed New Zealand had overtaken Australia as the world’s No. 1 Test side. After Pakistan resumed the day at eight for one, Trent Boult captured the first wicket when he had nightwatchman Mohammad Abbas in the fifth over and after that the day was mainly about Jamieson, who recorded his best match performance. Potent middle session After Abbas departed, Abid Ali and Azhar Ali looked to be laying the ground work for a solid third-wicket stand and moved the score to 46 when the 2.3 metre (6ft 8in) Jamieson had substitute Will Young taking an one-handed, diving catch to remove Abid. Jamieson had Haris Sohail and Azhar Ali caught behind, and bowled Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan. Boult completed the four-wicket session when he dismissed Fawad Alam for 16 and Pakistan was 134 for seven at tea. Jamieson, Boult and Kane Williamson shared the final three wickets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jamieson-bowls-nz-to-series-sweep/article33515664.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Chess federation turns to BCCI for inspiration||With the election of office-bearers of All India Chess Federation (AICF) ending an 11-month impasse, AICF president Sanjay Kapoor and secretary Bharat Singh Chauhan are looking for a fresh start. Kapoor is the youngest AICF president at 45, heads the Uttar Pradesh Chess Sports Association and is Chairman of the Kanpur Cricket Association. For Chauhan, this is a third term as AICF secretary. “Having witnessed how the BCCI functions, I would like to bring in some of those approaches to chess administration,” Kapoor told The Hindu . “My first priority is to ensure that each affiliate gets its share from the revenue generated by the AICF. Modern set-up “Each affiliate will be supported in acquiring a modern administrative set-up. Given the frugal ways adopted by chess administrators in the past, I think the revenue model in Indian chess needs a change through strategic partnerships,” he added. A non-profit organisation, AICF currently has over Rs. 10 crore in the bank. The chief source of revenue is AICF’s share of players’ entry-fee in various events, non-refundable deposits from host associations and government grants. Big money league While the processes for reactivating the “frozen” AICF bank account in Chennai and regaining Sports Ministry’s annual affiliation for the AICF are high on the agenda, Chauhan stated that a “cash-rich” Indian Chess League will be planned this year. “We will soon announce the name of the person responsible for making the league a reality," he said. According to Chauhan, free coaching camps conducted each month by Grandmasters and an annual North-east Open with a substantial prize-money are on the anvil. He also hinted at revising the prize money of select domestic events. Asked about the status of court cases involving the AICF, Chauhan said, “Now that the new office-bearers are in place, as a priority, I urge P.R. Venketrama Raja (outgoing AICF president) to withdraw all cases and play an important role in building the future of Indian chess.”  My first priority is to ensure that each affiliate gets its share from the revenue generated by AICF — Sanjay Kapoor||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chess-federation-turns-to-bcci-for-inspiration/article33515660.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Aussies should learn from Indian batsmen: McGrath||Australia will go into the third Test against India in Sydney with plenty of questions over its batting. Fast bowling great Glenn McGrath believes batting with intent will be the key to revving up Australia’s confidence. “It is just the mindset. It is about going out there and showing intent to score. If you are hanging around, being defensive, you will get out sooner or later, especially against quality bowlers like (Jasprit) Bumrah and R. Ashwin,” McGrath said. “You’ve to look to put the bad ball away when it comes, try and rotate the strike. Australia tried to take a lot of singles during the second innings in Melbourne, which was a positive. But as soon as a few wickets fell, they went back into their shells. “The way Shubman Gill started, he looked to play his shots... Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja did the same – all three players were looking to score runs. They weren’t batting for survival. The way Ajinkya Rahane batted in Melbourne was sensational. So, they need to take a leaf out of those Indian batsmen.” McGrath said India will be buoyed by the presence of Rohit Sharma, who will play his first Test in more than a year. “Rohit Sharma is a class player. To have someone of that skill and experience coming into the team should be a big lift for India,” McGrath said. “He will be keen to make an instant impact. I always thought that a player of his experience should do better in Tests than what his stats suggest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohits-presence-will-further-lift-india-says-mcgrath/article33515614.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Excited to have the Hitman back: Rahane||Rohit Sharma is set to make his first appearance in white flannels in almost 15 months and he has found a vocal supporter in India captain Ajinkya Rahane. On the eve of the third Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Rahane confirmed Rohit will be slotted at the top of the order. “We all are really excited to have him (Rohit) back. His experience at the highest level matters a lot. He is batting really well in the nets,” Rahane said on Wednesday.  “He has had seven net sessions. He came to Melbourne, and started his practice straightaway after the Test got over. He has been batting really well. The last couple of series he has batted as an opener, so you will definitely see Rohit at the top (of the order).” Rohit has missed India’s last four Tests — two each in New Zealand and Australia — due to fitness issues. The limited-over team’s vice-captain was elevated as Rahane’s deputy, after having recovered from a calf injury he sustained during the Indian Premier League. While Rohit’s form with the bat may be a bit of a concern, his presence on the field will be a boost for Rahane, the captain. Rahane’s stunning captaincy in the absence of Virat Kohli has been instrumental in India levelling the series. Proud moment “As a captain, I am really enjoying this role and definitely it is a proud moment for me to lead my country, it is an honour, and to lead this exciting bunch of guys, I feel really good and proud, so really looking forward to tomorrow’s Test match and as a captain there are responsibilities and challenges but I am really enjoying it,” Rahane said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/excited-to-have-rohit-back-rahane/article33515618.ece
07 January 2021||LOS ANGELES,||James-Davis combine to the fore||LeBron James and Anthony Davis picked up the pace when the Los Angeles Lakers needed them most, coming up big in the waning minutes of a 94-92 NBA victory over the Grizzlies in Memphis on Tuesday. James and Davis scored 26 points each as the reigning champion escaped with a victory that kept it unbeaten in four road games this season and improved the record to 6-2 overall. James, who added 11 rebounds and seven assists, scored 21 of his points in the second half to make sure Los Angeles came out on the right side of the ledger on a night when both teams struggled shooting. The Lakers trailed 79-77 with 5:18 remaining. Davis drained a three-pointer to put Los Angeles ahead, as he and James took over. A steal by Davis led to a James jumper, and a block by Davis kept the momentum rolling as they combined for 15 straight Lakers points. In Brooklyn, Kyrie Irving carried the load for the Nets in the absence of Kevin Durant, scoring 29 points on 12-of-19 shooting in a 130-96 romp over the Utah Jazz. His performance, which also included six rebounds, five assists and three steals, was just what the Nets needed with Spencer Dinwiddie sidelined by a knee ligament injury and Durant ruled out this week. Mills paces Spurs The San Antonio Spurs snapped a four-game losing streak with a 116-113 victory over the Clippers in Los Angeles. Australian Patty Mills drained a career-high eight three-pointers as he led the Spurs with 27 points off the bench. The Nuggets, fuelled by Nikola Jokic’s 35 points, won a back-and-forth battle with the Minnesota Timberwolves 123-116 in Denver.  The results:   Portland 108 lost to Chicago 111, Brooklyn 130 bt Utah 96.   LA Clippers 113 lost to San Antonio 116, Denver 123 bt Minnesota 116, Memphis 92 lost to LA Lakers 94.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/james-davis-combine-to-the-fore/article33515657.ece

Specialising in psychology in college in Mumbai, Nupur went to Sheffield Hallam University in the UK to acquire a second Masters Degree in Sports and Exercise Psychology. The 28-year-old Nupur operates mostly on court, “watching and analysing matches, playing the sport with athletes as well as including many physical activities to positively influence the mind.” Coach Todd Clark said: “Nupur is open to new ideas. “Together, our aim has always been to adapt the traditional off court activities to physical on-court activities which can directly enhance the players performance.” Nupur would continue to “integrate the physical and psychological aspects” with Clark in the new venture Accelerate Tennis in Gurugram.  Nupur suggests that even the best of athletes have a sports psychologist in their team. “We conduct many activities to enhance an athlete’s on-court performance. Analysing matches and being a part of the training sessions is essential for a sports psychologist,” said Nupur. Mind training Observing that more athletes were “giving mind the importance it deserves”, Nupur said “tennis is like playing chess with a racquet”. “Training one’s mind to think about how to play the next point and concentrating on relaxing the body is important.”  The bottomline is that being mentally strong “requires extensive work” and does not happen overnight. Nupur is willing to guide the athletes to reach that stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/enhancing-the-performance-of-players/article33515673.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A book on India’s tours Down Under||With India and Australia all set for the third Test at Sydney from Thursday, it was apt that a book titled ‘India’s 71-Year Test: The Journey to Triumph in Australia’ and one which reflects on India’s previous 12 tours Down Under, was launched on Wednesday. The book, a Bradman Museum initiative, is authored by senior cricket scribe R. Kaushik, and it chronicles a rivalry that has given a fillip to Test cricket. Introducing the tome from the Sydney Cricket Ground, India’s coach and former all-rounder Ravi Shastri said that the next two Tests of the current series will be fiercely competitive. In his foreword to the book, Shastri wrote: “Australians hate losing, and it’s a thought process entertained not just by the 11 on the field, but the whole nation, the fans and the media. When a team tours Australia, there is a combined assault like no other.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-book-on-indias-tours-down-under/article33515608.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Ready to play fourth Test even in Mumbai: Paine||Amid uncertainty whether the fourth Test would be held in Brisbane after reports emerged of Indian players not wanting to go through a hard quarantine that Queensland rules currently mandate, Australia skipper Tim Paine chose to make a mention of the “power” of India in world cricket. “I wouldn’t say frustration. I would say a bit of uncertainty when you hear things like that - coming particularly from India who we know hold a lot of power in world cricket - it is likely that it could happen,” said Paine, speaking on the eve of the third Test that starts in Sydney on Thursday. “We are not too fussed. We are not going into where the Test is being played. As far as we are aware it is at the Gabba. But as I said at the team meeting the other day, we couldn't care less if you rang us up and said it is in Mumbai tomorrow. We will get on a plane and go and play. That’s the way we’re looking at.” About the Sydney Test, Paine urged his batsmen to be more proactive and expressive in their strokeplay to counter the Indian bowlers. “We have spoken about the mindset. We have got some decent plans,” Paine said. “It is just a matter of going out and having the courage to execute them. “I think at times, we have just let them (Indian bowlers) dictate to us a little bit, let them build pressure and, then you know with the pressure, you lose wickets.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ready-to-play-fourth-test-even-in-mumbai-paine/article33515616.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Mystic awareness||The hymns of devout saints such as the Nayanmars or the Azhwars and of acharyas such as Adi Sankara form an integral part of devotional literature and find an easy way into the common man’s spiritual experience. Many have derived great solace and mental strength by chanting them and by ruminating on their import, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. Appayya Dikshitar has many soul stirring hymns on many deities to his credit. It is held that the hymn Atmarpana Stuti, also known as Unmatta Panchasati, is a composition that he wrote when he had already become well versed in all sastras and his entire self was steeped in deep devotion. He wanted to test his own pious commitment and felt that this would surface in an unalloyed manner if he subjected himself to reach an intoxicated state by drinking the juice of the Unmatta flower. He then asked his disciples to record whatever he spoke. This hymn written in that state reveals the intensity of his devotion. In many places, it reaches a mystical state of direct awareness of God. In the very first verse, he accepts that he has ventured to extol Him, who is beyond human thought and word. Yet, if he is able to try this feat, it is owing to His grace alone. The Lord is not to be reached by all, but is of easy access to the truly devout. The echo of the queries in the Upanishads regarding this wonderful creation, the creator and the Brahman is unmistakable. Who, of infinite prowess, is responsible for this consciousness, chetana, in beings? How have the five elements been combined in perfect proportions to attain their present forms in this universe? For, He alone is the cause of this entire universe and is also the sole protector and in whom everything recedes during Pralaya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mystic-awareness/article33515605.ece
07 January 2021||BENGALURU,||BFC, Cuadrat part ways||Bengaluru FC (BFC) and head coach Carles Cuadrat have decided to part ways through mutual consent, the club announced on Wednesday. The writing was on the wall for the Catalan after Tuesday’s 3-1 loss to Mumbai City FC, the club’s third successive defeat this season. The reverse came on the back of BFC’s wretched form this campaign, where it has won just three out of nine matches and played staid, uninspiring football. Under Cuadrat, BFC won its maiden ISL title in 2018-19 and reached the playoff stage in 2019-20. But the style of play had deviated significantly from the possession-heavy approach fellow Spaniard Albert Roca had introduced after taking over in mid-2016 from Englishman Ashley Westwood. In fact, Cuadrat was Roca’s assistant when the club reached the AFC Cup final in 2016 and finished runner-up in its inaugural ISL sojourn in 2017-18. “After deep deliberation, we feel the club needs to head in a new direction — one where the ethos and philosophy of Bengaluru FC begins reflecting again,” Parth Jindal, Director, BFC, said in a statement. “While we enjoyed success with Carles in the past, we felt there was a departure from the philosophy that we hold true, which prompted us to arrive at this decision.” Mutual appreciation “I want to express gratitude for everything that Carles has done. In the five years he has spent with us, he has been through all the ups and downs we’ve experienced at BFC.” Speaking on the decision, Cuadrat said, “I will always have fond memories of the club. I would like to thank the owners, the management, players, staff and the fans. I wish the club all the luck through the season and beyond.” The club stated that while the search for a replacement was already on, B-team coach Naushad Moosa will take interim charge, starting with Saturday’s match.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bfc-cuadrat-part-ways/article33515658.ece

07 January 2021||VASCO,||East Bengal shares honours with FC Goa||A 10-man East Bengal put up a fine show of grit and grace to share the honours with FC Goa 1-1 in an Indian Super League match at the Tilak Maidan Stadium on Wednesday. Nigerian Bright Enobakhare brought up a top-class goal to take East Bengal ahead before Devendra Murgaonkar got the equaliser for Goa. Both the goals came late in the second half. Dominant side Goa remained the dominant side in the opening half but East Bengal managed to hold off the local side with good show of defensive organisation. East Bengal goalkeeper Debjit Majumder got into the act strightaway when he had to go full stretch to save a header from Australian defender James Donachie. Debjit continued to remain the busiest man in the East Bengal line-up as it tried to fend off Goa’s attacking designs. East Bengal created opportunities on and got very close to scoring in the 29th minute when its captain Daniel Fox sent a header off a Raju Gaikwad long-throw wide off an open goal. The best moment for East Bengal came in the 79th minute when Enobakhare scored a breath-taking goal. Maradona moment The Nigerian striker brought alive a Maradona moment with his silken dribbling skills as he floored four Goa defenders and the goalkeeper, Mohammad Nawaz, to bring about the stunning finish. Enobakhare’s sublime effort would definitely count as one of the best individual efforts in the tournament’s history. East Bengal’s joy was shortlived as substitute Devendra Murgaonkar nodded home the equaliser in the 81st minute.  Th e result: East Bengal 1 (Bright Enobakhare 79) drew with FC Goa 1 (Devendra Murgaonkar 81) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/east-bengal-shares-honours-with-fc-goa/article33515947.ece

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Music for the masses||A beginner’s class in Carnatic music usually features the basic swaras , Sa-Ri-Ga-Ma-Pa.... In Saketharaman’s virtual class, however, that is not the case. You might be singing simple bhajans , or learning a Thiruppavai verse,  along with the story associated with it. “We narrate the context in which a composition was penned, and its meaning. There is a reason why a song has to be emoted a certain way, and the minute we know that emotion, it is easier to grasp its essence.” Since June last year, Saketh and team have been trying to teach this to 135 students from Classes II to VI of his alma mater, PS Senior Secondary School. Titled Kala Shiksha, this initiative seeks to sow the seeds of classical music in a contemporary, fun manner. “To get children hooked onto Carnatic music, you need to take a different approach to teaching. This music season, we asked our students to listen to at least a couple of virtual concerts and come back with their understanding. For this generation, a dialogue between the student and teacher is crucial.” The 38-year-old Chennai-based vocalist has been striving to make this art form more accessible to all. “It needs to be packaged in a contemporary way. My guru, Lalgudi Jayaraman sir, would say that the surest way to denigration is to not change ourselves citing tradition. I believe that today’s innovation will become tradition tomorrow,” says the recipient of the Sangita Nataka Akademi award and Best Vocalist award from The Music Academy. If school students are his target audience for Kala Siksha, the world at large is his target with Crossover with Saketh, a web-series intended to enhance the listening experience of Carnatic music. In the series, which now has more than 10 episodes, Saketh explains musical terminology such as virutham , thanam and thillana citing examples from popular film music too. “We sometimes alienate people by using jargon. Padam , for instance, is nothing but a reference to love songs. A lot of what we listen to is Carnatic music; it’s just that we just do not realise it,” says Saketharaman, who has drawn the examples of D Imman’s ‘Vaane Vaane’ ( Viswasam ) to explain kalpana swaram , AR Rahman’s ‘Kalloori Saalai’ ( Kadhal Desam ) to explain virutham and Ilaiyaraaja’s ‘Om Sivo Ham’ ( Naan Kadavul ) to veer into thanam . Saketharaman believes that such attempts will help casual listeners cross over to Carnatic music. “There are so many intricacies in film music, but we simply enjoy the melody and rhythm. Do we pay attention to things such as chord progression or guitar notes? Similarly, Carnatic music can also be enjoyed without thinking about its technicalities.”  A lot of what we listen to is Carnatic music; it’s just that we just do not realise it   A lot of what we listen to is Carnatic music; it’s just that we just do not realise it||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/music-for-the-masses/article33516151.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Now you see me. Now you don’t||When the forest gates opened at Maharashtra’s Tadoba Andhari National Park in October in 2020, after a gap of seven months, Hyderabad-based K Venkateswarlu was one of the first visitors to step inside. Passionate about wildlife photography, Venkateswarlu has been visiting forests for 13 years. But this time, given the pandemic, his experience of wildlife tourism was expectedly different. “The process of checking into resorts was longer and there were many rules in place. For instance, guests above the age of 55 and children below 10 years were not allowed. At Tadoba, in the initial days, the rooms were not given on a twin-sharing basis even if you had travelled together. And there were far less number of vehicles being allowed into the forest,” says Venkateswarlu. His experiences with the forest safaris were different too. Of the eight safaris he did, he got a glimpse of the tigers of Tadoba thrice. “This is unlike my previous experiences when I had a great sighting of tigers. We couldn’t see much of other wildlife like deer, sambar, wild dogs too,” he says. He had a similar experience in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh, one of the prime tiger territories of India, when he visited in October. “While the tiger sightings were relatively less during the initial safaris, after the forests reopened, the tourist Gypsys were allowed to move out of their designated routes to enter other areas if a tiger was sighted there. It was a move to encourage wildlife tourism, an industry severely crippled due to the pandemic,” says Venkateswarlu, who is gearing up for his next two trips to Bandhavgarh in January. When the Government of Karnataka decided to reopen its national parks and sanctuaries in the first week of June, wildlife photographer Harsha Narasimhamurthy breathed a sigh of relief. “In my career of five years as a professional wildlife photographer, I hadn’t stayed away from the forests for so long. It was unfortunate that the forests were closed in summers as, in Karnataka, it is the season of big cat sightings when they frequent the waterholes,” he says. Harsha and his fellow photographer were the only two tourists at the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka’s Chikmagalur district. “The first safari was a unique experience as the animal behaviour had changed due to prolonged human absence. Even animals like spotted deer and elephants which usually do not care about safari jeeps, were startled to see them and moved to take cover. It took them almost four-five days to get used to the jeeps again,” says Harsha. The pandemic impact According to a 2018 study by the World Travel & Tourism Council, the total economic contribution of wildlife tourism to global GDP was about $343.6 billion and supporting 21.8 million jobs. With wildlife tourism coming to a grinding halt this year, it had put both the wildlife and the communities that depend on it at risk. The opening up of the forests was seen as a beacon of hope for the Gypsy drivers and tour guides. “In Bandhavgarh, we mostly see long-stay foreign tourists and wildlife photographers coming in all through the year. They are a major source of income for us. But now the tourist profile has changed. We are mostly getting families from the neighbouring State of Chhattisgarh and very few photographers who have started booking safaris recently,” says Banty Yadav, a driver in Bandhavgarh. In Bandhavgarh alone, there are 220 Gypsy drivers and over 70 tour guides dependent on wildlife tourism. According to Yadav, who has been dependent on the wildlife tourism industry for over a decade now, the safari bookings are way below the pre-pandemic days. “Weekends are packed now. But through the weekdays, the safari bookings are half the numbers of what it used to be last December,” he says. “Apart from the lack of foreign tourists, the constantly changing guidelines by the State and Central government have been impacting travel trends,” says Ravinder Jain, owner of Ranthambore Regency and Sawai Vilas near Ranthambore National Park. “We have 130 rooms in both our properties and throughout the year we have an average of 70% occupancy. Usually, 90% of our guests are foreign tourists. Now, we are relying solely on local travellers. We opened the resorts in October as winters are the best time to visit the national park. Things looked good when we reopened as we had bookings from Jaipur, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune. But the guidelines issued by the Maharashtra Government in the last week of November that requires tourists coming from Rajasthan to undergo an RT-PCR test, has led to cancellations. Before the guidelines, we had almost 10 to 15 bookings per day, but now it is barely three or four guests,” says Jain. It is not just the upkeep of the hotels but also sanitisation that is adding to the expenses. “We sanitise vehicles on arrival and then the luggage is also sprayed with sanitisers. There is an added expense of over Rs. 60,000 per month. The check-in process is completely contactless and the keys are handed to the guests in sealed packets. We sanitise the rooms before and after the guest leaves, and also in-between stays,” Jain adds. In Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, however, the situation is better. “Tiger sightings have been good in November and in the first week of December,” says Sheikh Alim, a driver who has been in the industry for the past three decades. “Tiger Diana and her four cubs are being regularly sighted,” he adds. Like in other national parks, the forest resorts follow safety protocols of sanitising visitor vehicles and temperature checks of guests on entry as well as sanitisation of forest Gypsys before every morning and evening safari. The travel companies, specialising in wildlife tourism, that had been impacted by COVID-19, are now slowing limping back to business. Bengaluru-based travel and photography company, Toehold which conducts guided tours in India, Africa, Antarctica and Norway is now relying solely on domestic wildlife tours for survival. “A major portion of revenues comes from international tours. But this year, due to the pandemic and travel restrictions, the demand for local national parks and sanctuaries has increased. For instance, until last year, we conducted 10 to 12 tours in a year at Kabini, but this year since June we have been hosting almost three to four tours every month in Kabini. This is largely because it is closer to Bengaluru and most of the tourists prefer to drive down rather than take a flight. Also, the forest’s lone black panther’s pictures that went viral during the lockdown has added to Kabini’s popularity,” says Jayantha Sharma, founder of the company. Looking ahead As most of the national parks in Karnataka are fully open during the monsoons unlike the ones in North and Central India, Toehold saw a surge in demand for tours to Kabini Tiger Reserve, Bandipur National Park and Bhadra Tiger Reserve. “We are gearing up to host tours in Ranthambore National Park and Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in the coming two months,” adds Sharma. With wildlife tours picking up pace, tour operators, resort owners and Gypsy owners are hopeful that 2021 will make up for the loss of business the previous year. “More and more people are shunning crowded places and escaping into forests. This is a good opportunity for the wildlife tourism sector,” says Yadav.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont/article33516179.ece

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Cinema is a magical experience’||The year 2021 has begun on a sweet note for stand-up comic Alexander Babu, for, he is debuting in Tamil cinema with Maara , releasing this Friday on Amazon Prime Video. “Growing up, watching the likes of Vivek, Vadivelu and Crazy Mohan, I always wanted to become an actor. It is finally coming true,” he says, over a phone call. Many aspirants seek to make a mark in Tamil cinema to attain fame and stardom, but Alex, as he is popularly known, has already dabbled in cinema. From getting positive feedback for his hit show, Alex in Wonderland, on digital platforms to clocking over a million subscribers on his YouTube channel a few months ago, 2020 has been the year for Alex. The new year will see him playing an important role in Madhavan-starrerMaara, directed by Dhilip Kumar. “It was amazing,” he recalls, “I have read about the art form that is cinema, but to actually see that coming alive in front of your eyes was a magical experience.” Despite all his experience on stage as an actor and stand-up comic, the first shot in front of the camera was still a big challenge. “I had to share screen space with Maddy for an important scene. We had multiple rehearsals and readings, but I was still nervous when it was being filmed. The most important thing for me was to let go of a lot of things, and deliver as per the requirements of the scene,” says Alex, who also made his web-series debut in 2020 with Time Enna Boss . 2020 would have been different for Alex, if not for the pandemic. In the beginning of the year, he had three goals: do a tour with a new play directed by Vinodhini; a tour with old content, and write new content. In the end, he could only achieve his third goal. “There is pressure that comes with not having revenue, but I felt that my material will work better with live audiences. I have content for three shows,” he states. He will explore topics like science, history, literature and folk music in his upcoming shows. “My earlier show, Alex in Wonderland , revolved around an easy format because the audiences knew most of the personalities I spoke about. In future, I want to narrate stories about not-so-popular topics, and see if I can pull a joke out of it.” Alex is looking forward to opening this experimental stand-up with live Tamil audiences, whom he refers to as ‘chellam’.. “I call them that because I view the audience as my children. Before I get into a show, I keep telling myself that my content, in a way, is something that I want to tell my own children.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cinema-is-a-magical-experience/article33516146.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||When words fail||Sharada Ramanathan says she wanted to capture the residual effect of the pandemic: aloneness and its various kinds, be it psychological, romantic or social-economic. Her quest to document the times we live in resulted in a five-minute short, Adivaanam , which was uploaded on YouTube last month. “We all ride different boats but forget the fact that we are riding the same storm,” says Sharada over phone, “There was a multi-layered aloneness that was created during the pandemic.” Starring Aishwarya Rajessh and Ashwin Kakumanu as two individuals tiding through lockdown, Adivaanam is about the benefits the privileged classes enjoy without being considerate of the labour class: farmers, construction and sanitation workers. The film, says Sharada, was a reaction to what the country was, and probably still is, grappling with, in face of a pandemic. In a lighter vein, she calls the virus “the most secular disease for cutting across all classes”. Says Sharada, “Even before mentioning the cast, we have given credits to farmers and sanitation workers. I feel bad that I don’t have their names and it is very important to not treat them as anonymous. We did our little. And yes, the short film was a reaction to environment, people, inequality and the fact that everybody becomes the victim.” In the absence of dialogues, the short film lets the visuals speak for themselves and is juxtaposed with a poem by Swati VAR, a lyricist who has worked with Sharada in her first film, Sringaram . “What prose can’t say, poems can. What words can’t say, visuals can,” she laughs, “I thought: ‘why don’t we try a poem?’ and that’s how we conceptualised it. It might sound simple but trust me, there was thought behind it.” The short was shot by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran, edited by Sreekar Prasad and has music by Santhosh Narayanan. The filming took place in Chennai in August last year amidst the pandemic. “All of them were very busy throughout. Sreekar was editing two films; Santhosh had composed for three films and Ravi was flying between Mumbai and Chennai. I wanted the best and they came on board for the concept,” she adds. The biggest compliment Sharada has received so far for her film was a text from veteran writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar, “He sent me a message saying it is ‘exquisite’,” says Sharada, adding that she has a web series coming out for a digital platform and a feature film announcement sometime in February-March. Adivaanam is available in Thaniththirai’s YouTube channel||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-words-fail/article33516139.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The clean route to health||For much of 2020, the world has been battling an invisible enemy called COVID-19. And while the pandemic has forced us to recalibrate our lives like never before, it has also reinforced some home truths, such as ‘prevention is better than cure’. “It’s easy to wash your hand if you see some dirt on it. But as you can’t see the COVID-19 virus, people can become complacent about something like hand hygiene, which is the first step to prevent the spread of infectious diseases,” says Rachna Dave, founder of the Chennai-based biotech start-up MicroGo. Working on preventive technology since 2016, Dave, who did her doctoral studies in Microbiology at New York University, quit her job as a scientist at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Kalpakkam, to co-found MicroGo with Deepa Avinash and Deepthi Subbaraya. The company, which operates out of the Golden Jubilee Biotech Park (inside SIPCOT), focusses on delivering solutions for water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) issues. “Our public is still not very aware about hygiene. So we need other reasons to mandate that our people practise hygiene and yet don’t find it an economic burden,” says Dave. MicroGo has seen its initial focus shifting from anti-infection and anti-microbial solutions to maintaining hygiene. During lockdown, its product GoAssure, billed as India’s first smart automated hand hygiene station that ensures WHO compliance with a 20-second routine, has been in demand throughout the country. Currently, MicroGo’s products are being used in hotels, airports, hospitals and educational institutions in India. The start-up also reaches out to remote villages and rural communities through hygiene awareness drives. “The whole idea of sanitation is that it should be available to all, irrespective of social standing,” Dave adds. In contrast to approximately 4.5 litres of water used in a regular hand wash routine, GoAssure does the same job with just 0.02 litres. Its touch-free mechanism takes users through the steps of hand washing as mandated by the WHO, with a built-in dispenser for a hand rub formulation (recommended by WHO) and water, and also alerts them with LED lighting when they may have not completed procedures correctly. Among its other products are GoPure, that disinfects raw or waste water using its patented Tubelet technology to dispense chlorine dioxide gas, GoClean, a surface disinfectant and GoFresh for cleaning fruits and vegetables. Dave cites the instance of a three-month pilot project at a luxury hotel in Chennai using GoAssure, which has helped with both compliance and generated savings. “The hotel saved money, but also maintained the hand hygiene compliance at 92%, besides indirectly saving 16,000 litres of water.” MicroGo’s devices are run with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which allows the start-up to customise protocol to suit the client’s requirements. So in a school setting, for instance, the GoAssure hand wash station can record the time and number of students who have used it, and also pinpoint those who have not followed the procedure correctly. “This allows the school authorities to monitor compliance and also work on minimising infections in the classrooms,” says Dave. MicroGo’s products are available only in India currently, and its work is supported, among others, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Department of Science and Technology and Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC).

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Meditation on rice flour||Nao Yamashita’s house, located in the city of Nara, Japan, is a stand out — unlike traditional Japanese houses in a quaint suburban neighbourhood, her’s boasts an impressive marghazi set of kolams at the entrance. “During the winter season, birds and insects are famished. I have seen them peck my kolams clean. That’s the time I became more conscious of my understanding of bhuta yajna (feeding animals, birds and insects),” explains Yamashita, over a Zoom call. A graduate of Fine Arts from Musashino Art University, Tokyo, when Yamashita joined a Vedanta study camp in 2017 in Japan, the first question she asked was: “Do you know any place where I can learn to draw kolam ?” “I’ve always loved patterns and had a curiosity towards Indian culture. The first photograph of the kolam I saw left a lasting impression and I was keen to learn to draw it,” she says. Her Vedanta course led her to Arsha Vidya Gurukulam in Anaikatti, Coimbatore, where she met her first kolam teacher, Revathi. “In Japan, there is nothing similar to the kolam culture. About 400 years ago, they used to create large 3D sand art in Kagawa Japan, which was called Zenigata Sand Art.” Nao’s love for kolams , led her to organising kolam workshops in 2018. Yamashita recollects the time she had to rent a yoga studio in Osaka, to host the first session. “In Japan it’s difficult to get permission to draw in open grounds even on personal roads, so we had to opt for a closed space,” she says, adding that the first workshop saw over eight participants, following which, she did 13 more workshops. “In these workshops I also teach some shlokas . And before lunch we chant a shloka from theGita, followed by an Indian lunch,” she adds. Due to the pandemic, her workshops have moved online and the proceeds go to charity. “All the contributions are used to support kodomo shokudo (children’s cafeteria) that offer free or low priced meals to children from the economically-backward classes in Japan”. Through her workshops, Yamashita hopes to teach the significance of kolams . “I find Japanese introverted by nature, so my workshops include a ‘ kolam brainstorming session’. The first thing participants are asked to do, is to move their hands freely and draw whatever comes to mind, regardless of the quality or perfection. It helps break the ice.” At the start of 2020, prior to lockdown, Yamashita visited Auroville and Chennai and met many seasoned kolam experts. Her interaction with Chennai-based Gayathri Shankarnarayan, a home-maker, widened her perspective of kolams . “For me kolams are not only a form of self expression, but a form of prayer. It’s very meditative, and helps me connect with mother Nature.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/meditation-on-rice-flour/article33516174.ece
07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||One with the soil||This edition of Sahodaran’s (a Chennai-based organisation working for the rights of sexual minorities) annual fundraiser calendar is a stark contrast from those of previous years. The fashion-oriented calendar is muted, sans bright colours and grand ornaments. What it carries instead is a message loud and clear: that of preserving the earth. “The pandemic gave me time to reflect,” says Sahodaran founder and fashion designer Sunil Menon who has been bringing out this calendar since 2010. “It’s a homage to something we take for granted. We have abused it so much over centuries,” he adds. Models pose on different types of terrain — red soil, granite quarry, sandy beach — to showcase the wide variety that humankind is blessed with. “I looked at it from a practical angle. Given the situation, we could not travel or have a big team. We shot in Kerala in and around my house, and in Kovalam on ECR,” says Sunil over the phone from Irinjalakuda, Kerala. Sunil admits he did not plan to come out with a calendar this year, because of the lockdown and the pandemic. But in the beginning of December, calls from loyal fans of the annual calendar propelled him to get back on track. Then, Kapil Ganesh, who started this initiative with Sunil a decade ago and was the photographer till 2017, called from Dubai, asking about the progress of this year’s calendar. “I told him, it’s so difficult to even step out of the house, how can I get a calendar ready? But he said it showcases Sahodaran’s work and has been an annual fixture and there should not be a break,” says Sunil, adding that he promptly started ideating with his current photographer Kabilan AP and finished the project in two days. The initial plan was to have just six shots. But eventually, a flood of requests poured in from upcoming male models, and now the calendar has 12 photographs featuring eight of them, along with Mekha Rajan, a well-known face from television commercials and Namitha, who won Miss Transgender India last year. Over the years, this project has been known to give opportunities to male models from humble backgrounds: Welders, auto drivers, shop assistants... “I like to work with the underdog,” says Sunil. “There’s so much joy in being part of that.”  To book a calendar, call 044 23740486.

07 January 2021||January 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Now you see me, N0w you don’t||When the forest gates opened at Maharashtra’s Tadoba Andhari National Park in October in 2020, after a gap of seven months, Hyderabad-based K. Venkateswarlu was one of the first visitors to step inside. Passionate about wildlife photography, Venkateswarlu has been visiting forests for 13 years. But this time, given the pandemic, his experience of wildlife tourism was expectedly different. “The process of checking into resorts was longer and there were many rules in place. For instance, guests above the age of 55 and children below 10 years were not allowed. At Tadoba, in the initial days, the rooms were not given on a twin-sharing basis even if you had travelled together. And there were far less number of vehicles being allowed into the forest,” says Venkateswarlu. His experiences with the forest safaris were different too. Of the eight safaris he did, he got a glimpse of the tigers of Tadoba thrice. “This is unlike my previous experiences when I had a great sighting of tigers. We couldn’t see much of other wildlife like deer, sambar, wild dogs too,” he says. He had a similar experience in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh, one of the prime tiger territories of India, when he visited in October. “While the tiger sightings were relatively less during the initial safaris, after the forests reopened, the tourist Gypsys were allowed to move out of their designated routes to enter other areas if a tiger was sighted there. It was a move to encourage wildlife tourism, an industry severely crippled due to the pandemic,” says Venkateswarlu, who is gearing up for his next two trips to Bandhavgarh in January. When the Karnataka government decided to reopen its national parks and sanctuaries in the first week of June, wildlife photographer Harsha Narasimhamurthy breathed a sigh of relief. “In my career of five years as a professional wildlife photographer, I hadn’t stayed away from the forests for so long. It was unfortunate that the forests were closed in summers as, in Karnataka, it is the season of big cat sightings when they frequent the waterholes,” he says. Harsha and his fellow photographer were the only two tourists at Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka’s Chikmagalur district. “The first safari was a unique experience as the animal behaviour had changed due to prolonged human absence. Even animals like spotted deer and elephants which usually do not care about safari jeeps, were startled to see them and moved to take cover. It took them almost four-five days to get used to the jeeps again,” says Harsha. The pandemic impact According to a 2018 study by the World Travel & Tourism Council, the total economic contribution of wildlife tourism to global GDP was about $343.6 billion and supporting 21.8 million jobs. With wildlife tourism coming to a grinding halt this year, it had put both the wildlife and the communities that depend on it at risk. The opening up of the forests was seen as a beacon of hope for the Gypsy drivers and tour guides. “In Bandhavgarh, we mostly see long-stay foreign tourists and wildlife photographers coming in all through the year. They are a major source of income for us. But now the tourist profile has changed. We are mostly getting families from the neighbouring State of Chhattisgarh and very few photographers who have started booking safaris recently,” says Banty Yadav, a driver in Bandhavgarh. In Bandhavgarh alone, there are 220 Gypsy drivers and over 70 tour guides dependent on wildlife tourism. According to Yadav, who has been dependent on the wildlife tourism industry for over a decade now, the safari bookings are way below the pre-pandemic days. “Weekends are packed now. But through the weekdays, the safari bookings are half the numbers of what it used to be last December,” he says. “Apart from the lack of foreign tourists, the constantly changing guidelines by the Central and State governments have been impacting travel trends,” says Ravinder Jain, owner of Ranthambore Regency and Sawai Vilas near Ranthambore National Park. “We have 130 rooms in both our properties and throughout the year we have an average of 70% occupancy. Usually, 90% of our guests are foreign tourists. Now, we are relying solely on local travellers. We opened the resorts in October as winters are the best time to visit the national park. Things looked good when we reopened as we had bookings from Jaipur, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune. But the guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government in the last week of November that requires tourists coming from Rajasthan to undergo an RT-PCR test, has led to cancellations. Before the guidelines, we had almost 10 to 15 bookings per day, but now it is barely three or four guests,” says Jain. It is not just the upkeep of the hotels but also sanitisation that is adding to the expenses. “We sanitise vehicles on arrival and then the luggage is also sprayed with sanitisers. There is an added expense of over Rs. 60,000 per month. The check-in process is completely contactless and the keys are handed to the guests in sealed packets. We sanitise the rooms before and after the guest leaves, and also in-between stays,” Jain adds. In Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, however, the situation is better. “Tiger sightings have been good in November and in the first week of December,” says Sheikh Alim, a driver who has been in the industry for the past three decades. “Tiger Diana and her four cubs are being regularly sighted,” he adds. Like in other national parks, the forest resorts follow safety protocols of sanitising visitor vehicles and temperature checks of guests on entry as well as sanitisation of forest Gypsys before every morning and evening safari. The travel companies, specialising in wildlife tourism, that had been impacted by COVID-19, are now slowing limping back to business. Bengaluru-based travel and photography company, Toehold, which conducts guided tours in India, Africa, Antarctica, and Norway is now relying solely on domestic wildlife tours for survival. “A major portion of revenues comes from international tours. But this year, due to the pandemic and travel restrictions, the demand for local national parks and sanctuaries has increased. For instance, until last year, we conducted 10 to 12 tours in a year at Kabini, but this year since June we have been hosting almost three to four tours every month in Kabini. This is largely because it is closer to Bengaluru and most of the tourists prefer to drive down rather than take a flight. Also, the forest’s lone black panther’s pictures that went viral during the lockdown has added to Kabini’s popularity,” says Jayantha Sharma, founder of the company. Looking ahead As most of the national parks in Karnataka are fully open during the monsoons unlike the ones in north and central India, Toehold saw a surge in demand for tours to Kabini Tiger Reserve, Bandipur National Park, and Bhadra Tiger Reserve. “We are gearing up to host tours in Ranthambore National Park and Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in the coming two months,” adds Sharma. With wildlife tours picking up pace, tour operators, resort owners and Gypsy owners are hopeful that 2021 will make up for the loss of business the previous year. “More and more people are shunning crowded places and escaping into forests. This is a good opportunity for the wildlife tourism sector,” says Yadav.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont/article33515870.ece

However, he said it would be tough to give an exact date as it was difficult to calculate how soon the vaccine will be available for the public as frontline workers will be the first to get vaccinated. “Brainstorming is on for how early schools can be reopened in Delhi, especially for Board classes as the dates for Board exams have been announced. Senior students will have to finish their practical component before their examinations, which will require them to attend school,” Mr. Sisodia said. The Minister announced that the Delhi government is organising an international conference on school education between January 11 and 17 to discuss changes in the education sector in the post-COVID-19 world. Brainstorming session Titled ‘Delhi Education Conference 2021’, the Minister said 22 education experts from India and six other countries will attempt to give direction to schools on how to proceed after the year-long disruption the education sector has undergone. “We need to plan about our schools in the post-COVID era just as we are planning about the COVID-19 vaccination. The pandemic has created an unprecedented situation for children. Therefore, schooling and learning in post-COVID era cannot be business as usual,” Mr. Sisodia said while announcing the conference. The government said that during the conference an independent study conducted by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on the process and achievements of Delhi’s education reform over the last five years will be released.

07 January 2021||New Delhi,||Ready to consider application of 3 students, JNU tells High Court||Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has informed the Delhi High Court that it was willing to consider “sympathetically” the application of three students, whose admission in a postgraduate course was rejected as their graduation results were delayed by Delhi University (DU) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. JNU’s counsel Monika Arora said admissions are still going on for several courses and hence, the varsity will be considering the admission application of the three candidates if seats are still available in the relevant courses, and they qualify on merit for the admission. JNU’s submission came before Justice Prateek Jalan, who was hearing a plea by three students who had graduated from DU. All three candidates applied for admission to M.A. courses in their respective subjects in JNU. They took the JNU entrance examination and claimed to have achieved a result higher than that required for admission in the first list published by JNU. However, JNU did not grant them admission due to delay in their undergraduate examinations and publication of results by DU due to the ongoing pandemic. Contends clause Advocate Kawalpreet Kaur, appearing for the students, contended that JNU, in its prospectus, had added a clause that the candidate whose result has been declared, would be given preference over those whose result has not been declared. Advocate Kaur termed the clause as discriminatory as it would result in other students being rendered ineligible for no fault of theirs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ready-to-consider-application-of-three-students-jnu-tells-hc/article33516254.ece
07 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Karat seeks parity for riots victims who are minor||CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat — in a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kerjiwal — has pointed out that the families of minor victims of the north-east Delhi riots have been getting lesser compensation that those families that lost adult members. The Delhi government has been providing compensation of Rs. 10 lakh each to the families who lost an adult member and Rs. 5 lakh each to the kin of the minors who died in the Delhi violence. The CPI(M) leader said that it was a flawed argument that the family of an adult victim gets more compensation as an earning member deprives the family of an income and thus, more compensation is required. “This understanding, devoid of compassion, is flawed. Even within this framework, unfortunately, the usual definition used of an “earning member” is not sensitive to the reality in poor self-employed families where children even while attending school, take on adult responsibilities,” Ms. Karat said. She asked the Delhi government to take into consideration the huge emotional loss suffered by the parents. “As you know the first death anniversary of their children will fall next month, at the end of February. It will be an important message of justice from your government that both the families receive the remaining Rs. 5 lakh on such an occasion,” she wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/karat-seeks-parity-for-riots-victims-who-are-minor/article33516256.ece

AAP Punjab co-incharge Raghav Chadha and Kisan Wing president MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said Chief Minister Amarinder Singh should resign immediately in the backdrop of a statement by Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu admitting that all the three laws were applicable in the State. At a press conference, the AAP leaders accused the Congress party of betraying the farmers by enforcing the Centre’s anti-farmers laws and lying to them about it. Capt. Amarinder hit back saying Mr. Ashu’s statement had been mischievously twisted. “Punjab was the first State to have opposed the laws and, in fact, passed amendment Bills to negate their dangerous impact on agriculture,” he said, accusing the Aam Aadmi Party of spreading misinformation.  ‘Withdraw farm laws’ Asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw the controversial laws and talk to the farmers, Capt. Amarinder said, “The farmers have made their stand very clear — that the laws should be repealed.
