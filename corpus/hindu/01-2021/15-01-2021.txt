This signals that the seasons are changing, with winter giving way to warmer days. This is when Makara Sankaranti is celebrated. An occasion to look forward to longer days and a bountiful harvest, it is also an opportunity to be grateful for the countless gifts of nature. The festival goes by many names in regions around the country. Hop on and take a tour, as we visit some of these places. Hold on tight; for, no matter where you go, you will definitely have a blast. PUNJAB Behold the bonfire Stop at Ludhiana to light a huge bonfire and break into bhangra. Sounds fun, doesn’t it? Join the people of Punjab in celebrating the festival of Lohri with gusto. The warmth of the fire seems to signal the end of winter and the arrival of spring. Observed a night before Makara Sankaranti, it is traditionally associated with the harvest season of rabi crops in the region and an occasion to offer respects to the Sun. Don’t forget to treat yourself to the special food items associated with this festival — gur rewri , peanuts and popcorn — in addition to other delicacies. ASSAM Feast and fun  Get to Guwahati right in time for Magh Bihu, which marks the end of the harvest season. The essence of this celebration is eating with the community. On the eve of Bihu, known as Uruka , watch as youngsters build makeshift huts called bhelagar in the fields. Join in the revelry as the people prepare and eat plenty of food, while spiritedly singing and dancing around a bonfire known as the meji . Rise early the next morning and watch the meji burn down while people throw rice cakes and betel nuts into the fire. You can’t help but feel joyous! TAMIL NADU Pongal-o-pongal! Make your way to Chennai for an unforgettable experience. The people of Tamil Nadu celebrate the festival of Pongal over four days. The festivities begin with Bhogi on day one when people clean their houses and get rid of all things unwanted. Get into the thick of the action on day two, when rice and milk are boiled in pots and offered to the sun god with gratitude. On day three, make friends with farmers as they decorate their cows for Maatu Pongal, and pitch in to help women and girls when they offer a feast for crows to eat. As the curtains fall on the festival with Kaanum Pongal , a day for family reunions and outings, you will find yourself already longing for next year’s Pongal! GUJARAT Colours in the sky Make a beeline for Gujarat — Ahmedabad or Surat, Vadodara or Jamnagar — no matter where you find yourself, the enthusiasm is the same. The kite festival of Uttarayan can be loads of fun. Join in the fun, as screams of “ kai po che ” fill the air, or just prop yourself down and gaze at the thousands of vibrant kites in the sky. What’s more, the delicious treats add to the festive atmosphere. No matter how you celebrate the harvest festival, one thing is certain: generous amounts of gratitude, hope and cheer is what the world needs right now. This season promises just that.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/harvest-express/article33576963.ece

15 January 2021||January 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Pongal-o- Pongal!||“Careful, don’t drop it!” paati yelled when the two children carried the vengala paanai to the courtyard. “I don’t want dents in it!” “Paati, you better add some extra ghee. This is hard work!” Muthu said. “Yes, this weighs a tonne. Add some fried cashews, will you?” Kumar said, his mouth watering. “What next, you’ll teach me how to cook?” paati laughed, tying a turmeric plant around the mouth of the pot and placing it gently over the wood stove. “Now go with your sister and fetch the sugarcane. Let me light this fire!” Muthu and Kumar ran to the threshold. “Nandhini akka , let’s bring the sugarcane. Paati is making sakkara pongal .” “Why don’t you two finish this?” she told them, connecting the last of the dots. Magically, flowers appeared in every corner of the kolam . “First, paati made us carry that bronze pot. Now you’re asking us to draw patterns on the floor!” Muthu cribbed. “It’s no ordinary pot,” Nandhini wagged her finger at her brother. “It belonged to her grandmother. It’s one hundred years old!” Muthu looked impressed. “Wow! That’s even older than thatha’s easy chair and pocket watch… do you know Kumar and I will inherit them?” he beamed at his sister. “Keep your chair, paati is giving me the vengala paanai !” Nandhini beamed back. “Stop it, you two,” Kumar said. “Paati didn’t send us here to fight! I’ll colour the kolam . Can you get me pink, green and yellow powders, akka?” Almost ready “Keep them over there,” paati instructed, when the three children came back with the tall sugarcane. “Go find the sickle, I’ll cut some cane for you to chew later.” “Ok, but when will the sakkara pongal be ready?” Muthu and Kumar asked anxiously. “Our tummies are rumbling!” “We need to pray first. Go to the backyard and cut four plantain leaves. Bring that bunch of bananas from the kitchen. Nandhini, can you go to the provision shop and buy some camphor and incense?” In ten minutes, Nandhini came running back, with incense, camphor and hard-boiled sweets. “Eat that mittai later. Go call thatha now,” paati yelled, stirring the pongal . Smoke rose and curled up lazily. She adjusted the firewood; the flame grew smaller and glowed red. “That smells delicious, you’re as good a cook as my mother,” thatha said sniffing the air. Paati scowled. “Careful, thatha,” the kids giggled, “you know how touchy paati is!” “Pongal-O-Pongal!” paati cried. As everybody repeated the cry, the pongal hissed and rose like a white hat, flowing gently down one side. When paati stirred it vigorously, it settled back in. Paati lit the camphor and the three kids stood in a line, closed their eyes and pressed their palms together. Full tummy “I feel like a football, I’ve eaten so much!” Kumar rubbed his belly. “You know, paati, you should start a YouTube channel. You’ll be a sensation!” Paati and Nandhini laughed. “You boys are so naïve! Didn’t you know paati has one already? Thousands of people subscribe to it!” Nandhini said proudly. “Oh! But who makes and posts the videos ?” Muthu asked, puzzled. “Thatha shoots the videos and I post it. It’s not very hard, Nandhini taught us in the summer!” paati hugged her granddaughter. “She’s my inspiration!”  “It’s no ordinary pot,” Nandhini wagged her finger at her brother. “It belonged to her grandmother...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/pongal-o-pongal/article33576910.ece
15 January 2021||January 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Ring in the new||Hello and greetings from the other side of 2020. I wasn’t so enthusiastic about this whole New Year thing. I mean, after all, is it really a new year? Or is 2021 just 2020 pretending to be a new year? Let’s see, online school continues, we’re all still wearing masks and we’re still stuck at home most of the time — especially if your parents are worry warts like mine are. UGH! Surprise Anyway, I was in the middle of my whine-and-whinge routine when the parents took me and the PB out for a ‘surprise adventure’. I was thinking Baskin Robbins’ ‘all you can eat Splish Splash’ festival. Instead, they took us way out of the city to the middle of nowhere. For a second, I was worried that they were going to abandon us there and tell us to find our way back to civilisation, Bear Grylls style. But, instead of dropping us off on the side of the road with a jar of peanut butter and a Swiss army knife, we pulled up inside this old rickety gate. We were at a farm! Apparently, the parents thought the two of us needed to exit the world of Fortnite and reconnect with the real world. So, as a surprise, they took us to a local farm where we could pick our own vegetables to take home and cook in time for Pongal, which is a harvest festival we celebrate. You might call it Bihu or Baisakhi or Sankaranti, depending on where you live. I won’t lie. I may have rolled my eyes big time at the start of the day — I wasn’t really into the whole idea. But we had this cool Farmer Uncle who showed us around and helped us figure out which veggies were ripe to pick and which weren’t. We even got to cut down an entire bunch of bananas straight from the tree! While my enthusiasm for the adventure surprise grew, so did my exhaustion. It was not easy bending down low or reaching up high to harvest the ingredients for our Pongal lunch. Farmer Uncle pointed out that this was just one small part of farming. There’s also sowing the seeds and taking care, as they sprout and grow, and making sure they don’t get eaten by bugs. It made me really grateful for the millions of farmers who do this all day, all week, all month, all year round, just so that we can eat. No Sundays off either! I guess, when you order your spinach online with a tap and a swipe, you figure growing it is just as easy. Well, it’s not! I was pooped by the end of our two-hour harvest and was grateful for the buttermilk and sweet hot pongal Uncle shared with us. So, I guess the New Year did start off with something new for me. A new experience. A new appreciation for the people who put food on our plate. Remember to think of our farmers while you scarf down that awesome Pongal your parents made today! I know I will.  When you order your spinach online with a tap and a swipe, you figure growing it is just as easy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/ring-in-the-new/article33576951.ece
15 January 2021||January 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Summer’s End Strange happenings||The story so far: On the last day of their vacation, it rained all day. They were stuck indoors and settling in for a long, boring day when a series of mysterious events shake them.  By noon, it was dark and gloomy. The rain had given way to mist. They could barely see outside the window. The cold permeated into the house. “We’ll ask Albert to light a fire in the fireplace,” said Moti uncle. A fire seemed a cheerful thought. They went in to the dining room for lunch and found a frazzled Albert still in the process of setting the table. “I seem to be messing up the table settings! I’ll get the food…” he said distractedly, stepping out of the room. As he brought in a hot bowl of chicken curry, suddenly, it went flying out of his hands. Moti uncle, Keya and Dhruv moved away in a hurry and Mishti hid behind them. Albert was aghast. All he could do was apologise profusely. “Never in my 40 years of service have I done something like that. I don’t know what got into me…” “You sit here,” said Moti uncle. “We’ll get the lunch on the table.” Albert sat down, tut-tutting and shaking his head. When the table was set, Moti uncle coaxed a distraught and distracted Albert to sit with them and have his lunch. Halfway through the meal, Albert said said, “You know I distinctly felt my hand being jostled. I didn’t trip…” Dinner that evening was quiet and subdued. As they got ready for bed, Moti uncle said, “Oh! I forgot to remind Albert that we are leaving in the morning. Let me just pop down and tell him. You kids, be packed before getting to bed.” Eerie time Keya and Dhruv went to their rooms and began packing. The rain was making an infernal din on the tiled roof. “I’ll be glad to be off tomorrow. The rain kills the holiday spirit,” thought Keya. There was a loud bang, almost like an explosion. Keya and Dhruv charged downstairs. Mishti followed them. There was no sign of Moti uncle. Mishti whimpered and stood close to them with his tail tucked between his legs. In the kitchen, they found pots and pans on the floor. Suddenly, the tap opened and water gushed out. Dhruv ran to turn it off but slipped and fell headlong. As Keya went to help him, the power went off. The quiet of darkness was broken by the sound of water gushing out of the tap, and the pounding rain. Then they heard it … a chuckle. The tap was closed and the lights came on. Dhruv stood up. Though he had not hurt himself in the fall, he was shaken. Mishti shivered and tilted her head looking at a point above her. With a low keening, she ran out.  To be continued   I distinctly felt my hand being jostled. I didn’t trip...||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/summers-end-strange-happenings/article33576928.ece

15 January 2021||January 15 2021 00:00 IST,||Let the world know how curious you are||Why is a ping-pong ball called so?  According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term ping pong arose from the sound the ball makes when it hits the paddle. Ping pong began as a lawn sport in Victorian England. In 1901, British manufacturing firm J. Jaques and Son Ltd. trademarked the name and later sold it to the American company Parker Brothers. So people couldn’t use the name ping pong and began to call it table tennis. The game, however, continues to be popular across the world.      Why doessound echo in empty rooms?  In offices and homes, the rooms are filled with items like furniture, curtains, and carpets that absorb sound. This reduces the possibility of an echo. In an empty room, there is nothing to stop sound from bouncing off the walls and ceiling. This continues until the sound loses all its energy. That is why we hear echoes in an empty room.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article33576923.ece
