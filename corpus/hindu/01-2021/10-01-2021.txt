10 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Curbs result in drop in chicken prices||The outbreak of bird flu in many States and subsequent decisions to ban the import of chicken has resulted in a glut of poultry in the local market here. According to the Karnataka Poultry Farmers and Breeders’ Association, every week 15 lakh birds were being supplied to neighbouring States. With restrictions now in place, this has almost come to a standstill. The rise in supply of chicken and eggs has resulted in a drop in prices. K.S. Ashok Kumar, former president of the association, said that while the production price was around Rs. 80 a kg, the market rate was just around Rs. 60 a kg. “However, consumption patterns remain mostly unchanged for now,” said association president Sushanth Rai. Both Mr. Kumar and Mr. Rai said that though some were wary of consuming poultry in the wake of the bird flu outbreak, the fact that consumption patterns had remained the same reflected better awareness among people. “Eggs and chicken cooked at high temperatures are completely safe for consumption,” they said. The true impact of bird flu and other factors, including strike by poultry farmers who are demanding revision of growing charges, will be ascertained only after the weekend. “This is because the consumption of poultry products is maximum during the weekends,” said Mr. Rai.  Industry experts said that poultry farmers and commercial breeders had been giving due importance to bio-security measures, including farm isolation, controlled entry, multi-layer fencing etc. Mr. Kumar said that these measures had ensured the safety of the birds in the farms that eventually reached the consumers’ tables. “The poultry industry was just limping back to normalcy when the bird flu outbreak was reported,” Mr. Rai pointed out. Months following the outbreak of COVID-19 in the State and unfounded fear and rumours that the virus spread through meat had impacted the poultry sector. The supply had reduced by nearly 40% in April and May. The poultry industry could not take another hit, said industry experts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/curbs-result-in-drop-in-chicken-prices/article33540946.ece

The hotelier, who owns the Heaven Resorts in Gulmarg, north Kashmir’s ski capital, is in fact overjoyed. For the first time in 15 months, Mr. Burza is happy to re-employ staff whom he had to lay off in the wake of the August 5, 2019 move to end J&K’s special status. As did some 1,500 other hotels in the Kashmir Valley. “We had to stop hiring services such as security, laundry and transport. We retained a bare minimum staff and negotiated their salaries. We all understood it was going to be a long haul. However, it seems the good days are back. Gulmarg witnessed a very, very good season in the past two months. My hotel, like others, was booked for December and January,” he said. 65,000 lost jobs The current fillip toThe COVID-19 pandemic has also proved a blessing as it has forced hoteliers to hire more staff. “We won’t mind hiring more people as long as tourists keep a tryst with Kashmir,” Mr. Burza added. tourism is the first silver lining for the moribund hospitality industry in Kashmir, first battered by the post-August 5 shutdown and then by the pandemic-induced lockdown. According to the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries, 65,000 people lost jobs, with the industry suffering a loss of Rs. 2,615 crore. The latest footfall figures from the Tourism Department show that the popular destination, though mired in bouts of unrest, has retained its hold over visitors from the country and abroad. “Out of the 34,025 tourists who visited Kashmir this year, 3,808 were foreign tourists. December recorded the highest number of 13,237 tourists, which is 39% of the total footfall in the entire year,” said Ahsan Chisti, Deputy Director of the publicity wing of the J&K Tourism Department. The trajectory of the tourism graph is showing a rising trend. From just 186 tourists arriving in the whole of July and 284 in August, 6,327 visited in November. In a surge, the Valley saw around 2,100 tourists arriving just on December 23 and 24, ahead of the New Year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/white-winter-raises-hope-for-jk-tourism/article33540931.ece

The Centre, in its affidavit, stated that the review petition was completely “misconceived and is nothing but another attempt at seeking publicity”. It added that no new grounds have been raised in the review petition. ‘Available on website’ “Audit statement of receipt and payment accounts of PM CARES Fund for the financial year 2019-20 is available on the website of the trust. As such, the petitioner cannot be said to have any grievances about disclosure of income and expenditure of the funds,” the affidavit said.

The high court on Saturday heard arguments of all parties and reserved its order on the review plea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-cares-fund-centre-seeks-dismissal-of-review-petition/article33541439.ece

State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar, in a statement on Saturday, said, “As per Para 3(A) of the Model Code of Conduct for the local body elections, when ordinary elections are notified to the rural local bodies in the entire State, the MCC is applicable only to the rural areas.” He further clarified that there was no objection to organise programmes in the urban areas to extend benefits to the beneficiaries hailing from the urban areas alone. “Programmes shall not be organised in the urban areas to extend benefits to the beneficiaries belonging to the rural areas. This will amount to violation of the MCC as such acts influence voter preferences,” Mr. Ramesh Kumar said. The commission had announced on Friday the schedule for the conduct of the gram panchayat elections in the State. As per the schedule, notification will be issued for the first phase of the elections on January 23. The elections will come to an end with the polling for the fourth phase on February 17.

10 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Petition in HC against panchayat polls in Feb.||The State government on Saturday challenged the State Election Commission’s decision to conduct elections to gram panchayats (GPs) on February 5, 9, 13 and 17 by filing a house motion petition in the High Court. The matter will be heard by a single-judge Vacation Bench of Justice M. Ganga Rao on January 11. In the petition filed by Principal Secretary (Panchayat Raj) Gopal Krishna Dwivedi, the government reiterated its stand that the situation was not conducive for the polls owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and the preparations made for the vaccination drive. The SEC issued the election schedule just a few hours after a consultation was held by the State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar with the State officials concerned on Friday. The written submissions made by the government regarding its preoccupation with the containment of COVID and the constraints in sparing employees for the conduct of elections at a time when they were needed to undertake the massive vaccination drive, for which dry runs had already been organised, ought to be taken, it was stated. It may be noted that the government had been at loggerheads with the SEC ever since the latter suspended the elections to GPs, MPTCs and ZPTCs in March 2019 citing the threat posed by COVID. The dispute reached the Supreme Court and the government even passed a resolution in the winter session of Legislative Assembly against holding the elections in February. Mr. Ramesh Kumar resumed the election process by holding an all-party meeting around October 2019 amid strong objections from the government. Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das met Mr. Ramesh Kumar on Friday and requested him to let the vaccination programme and COVID management go unhindered. A few hours later, the four-phase election schedule was announced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-files-petition-in-hc-against-holding-panchayat-polls-in-february/article33540855.ece

10 January 2021||CHENNAI,||PMK meet on reservation tomorrow||The PMK on Saturday modified its demand from ‘separate 20% reservation for Vanniyars’ to ‘internal reservations for Vanniyars’ within the MBC quota in jobs and education. The party leadership issued an ultimatum to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to accept the demand and take steps before the beginning of the Assembly session this year failing which the party would take a ‘political decision’. At the end of its governing council meeting held virtually, the PMK issued a statement claiming that senior Ministers would be visiting PMK founder Ramadoss’ residence to discuss the issue on Monday. “We started the protests to correct injustice against Vanniyars and demand separate 20% reservations. Though the reservation for MBCs was won by the Vanniyar Sangam, we believe that other castes in the MBCs should also be given representation in MBCs. Therefore, we have decided to modify our demand and seek ‘internal quota’ which will give substantial representation for the Vanniyars within MBC quota,” the statement said. Critical of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi’s role in 1989, the party’s council unanimously passed a resolution urging the AIADMK government to immediately agree to the demand of internal reservation.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The siege of a historical power centre||The grand U.S. Capitol building in Washington, home to the Senate and House of Representatives, has hardly been immune to attacks historically, but on January 6, many across the country and the world watched with disbelief as the beating heart of the world’s oldest democracy was subjected to a siege by a violent mob. Earlier that day, outgoing President Donald Trump appeared to incite hundreds of his supporters, gathered on the National Mall close to the Capitol, into taking imminent action by marching on the Capitol. The result was as dramatic as it was an ominous sign of the extent of hate permeating American society today — the mob attacked Capitol police, smashed windows, vandalised and stole public assets within the building, and ransacked and posed for selfies in lawmakers’ offices, including that of House Speaker Democrat Nancy Pelosi. It appeared to be a dire warning and uncontrolled venting of rage that came with the election results — the loss of Mr. Trump by margin of nearly 7 million despite his garnering around 74 million votes — following which the Republicans also lost control of the Senate after a runoff election in Georgia on January 5 led to two seats of the upper chamber flipping to Democrats. The violence triggered by these events, and also the evident desire of the mob to disrupt Congressional proceedings to formally certify the win of President-elect Joe Biden — an act for which lawmakers boldly reconvened and voted on the same day — only demonstrates the importance of the Senate and House as parallel repositories of legislative power to counterbalance the executive power of the White House. It is undoubtedly for this reason that the Capitol building, as the locus of legislative power, has faced multiple security threats and assaults over many years since it was built. It all began in with the “Residence Act” passed by Congress in 1790, when erstwhile President George Washington zeroed in on modern-day District of Columbia out of land ceded by the State of Maryland. After three commissioners surveyed the site, as they also oversaw the design and construction of the national capital and its many awe-inspiring government buildings, French engineer Pierre Charles L’Enfant was hired to flesh out the detailed blueprint. It was L’Enfant who proposed situating the Capitol building at the elevated east end of the National Mall, a location he then described as “a pedestal waiting for a monument.” Ironically, a year later L’Enfant was dismissed before any construction even began, for refusing to produce design drawings for the building on the grounds that he had memorised them, and also for not submitting to the commissioners’ authority with regard to the planning. The planners quickly improvised, however, and a competition with an award of $500 was announced for whoever could produce “the most approved plan” for the Capitol building by mid-July. While 17 plans submitted failed to make the mark, it was a proposal by Dr. William Thornton, a Scottish-trained physician in Tortola, British West Indies, that won approval. Thornton’s plan was for the building to comprise three sections, including a central section topped by a low dome, and flanked on the north and south by two rectangular wings, one for each chamber of Congress. While the cornerstone of the building was laid by President Washington in 1793, construction using sandstone transported from Virginia by boat took a long time, so much so that despite the subsequent involvement of renowned architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe, rooms on the third floor of the extant structure remained incomplete in late 1800 when the U.S. Congress, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, and courts of the District of Columbia occupied the Capitol building. The building faced its first major attack, a fire set off by British troops in August 1814, during the 1812 War. The incident, in the words of Mr. Latrobe, left the Capitol, “a most magnificent ruin.” The troops were said to have “ignited a giant bonfire of furniture” in the Hall of the House of Representatives that was so intense it destroyed a life-size marble statue of Liberty. Even as work on various extensions continued through the early 1800s under the guidance of Boston architect Charles Bullfinch and later Philadelphia architect Thomas Walter, the project cost soared to over $2.4 million by 1827. A history of attacks The first major incident of violence at the Capitol came on January 30, 1835, when Richard Lawrence, a British immigrant, attempted to assassinate President Andrew Jackson while he was leaving the building from a Congressional funeral. The attempt failed when the powder from his pistol did not ignite and he was taken down by bystanders. Next, a setback to the Capitol construction came in the form of a gas explosion and fire in the north wing on November 6, 1898, underscoring in the architects’ minds the urgent need for fireproofing, a task completed by 1902. Less than two decades later, in 1915, a German-born Harvard University professor set off a dynamite explosion near the Senate Reception Room — miraculously there were no injuries. While the assailant reportedly wrote that he had done it as “an exclamation point in my appeal for peace,” he was detained. He later committed suicide while in custody. In 1954, when the Capitol building had considerably less security than it does now — and no metal detectors — four armed Puerto Rican nationalists entered the House gallery, and opened fire indiscriminately as they waved a Puerto Rican flag, apparently for in protest for independence for the commonwealth. Five House members were injured, and the attackers served long prison terms that were ultimately commuted by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. On March 1, 1971, a violent anti-war extremist outfit, Weather Underground, set off a bomb inside a bathroom on the Senate side of the Capitol. While there were no injuries, hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage was incurred. International flavour Capitol attacks took on an international flavour a little more than a decade later, in 1983, when a leftist group calling itself the Armed Resistance Unit set off a bomb hidden under a bench outside the Senate chamber, apparently to protest the U.S. military’s actions in Grenada and Lebanon. There were again zero casualties but seven persons were charged for the attack. Following this incident, the House and Senate chambers took the precautionary step of adding metal detectors and heightened security, both of which were breached by the pro-Trump mob on January 6. Given the bitter polarisation of the U.S. electorate at this time, it may be wise for the administrators of the Capitol building to fortify its defences further.

10 January 2021||Kozhikode,||Demand to reopen preschools||It has been more than 10 months since day-care centres and preschools across the State were closed down due to COVID-19. It has led to financial crisis and job losses in the sector and those who run such centres are going through tough times. “There is no point in holding online classes for preschool kids as they can’t sit attentively during sessions. Besides, it defeats the very purpose of preschools that are intended to help children mingle with others,” said Kavitha Rajesh who runs a preschool franchise in Ernakulam. Some preschools are holding online classes for kids, but attendance is very low. “Parents do not mind them not attending classes for a year or two, as they are in very low classes. Their purpose of sending kids to preschools was to keep them engaged during the day,” said Shabeeba Sharaf, another preschool franchise owner from Kozhikode. However, preschools are getting regular enquiries from parents regarding their reopening. “If the government takes a decision allowing day-care units and preschools to function following the COVID protocol and within limitations, we will be happy to oblige,” said Divya Vinod, another franchisee owner from Ernakulam. As for preschool managements, most of them are struggling to survive the situation. Huge dets With huge debts on their shoulders and with expenses such as franchise fee and building rents mounting, they were forced to lay off some of their staff. “Even if we start functioning with half the usual strength, it would help the sector survive,” Ms. Kavitha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/demand-to-reopen-preschools/article33541318.ece
10 January 2021||ALAPPUZHA,||Experts want strict vigil on bird flu in Kerala||A Central team of experts on Saturday visited Alappuzha in Kerala and took stock of the situation following the bird flu outbreak. The team also reviewed the Health Department’s COVID-19 preventive measures in the district. The team comprising Minhaj Alam, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Food Processing Industries, and S.K. Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control, held discussions with the Alappuzha District Collector A. Alexander and other district administration officials at the Collectorate here. Three other experts from the Centre — Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s public health expert Ruchi Jain; National Institute of Virology, Pune scientist Shailesh Pawar; and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Delhi physician Dr. Anith Jindal, who visited the district on Thursday to study the bird flu (H5N8) outbreak and COVID-19 situation, also joined the discussions. The Central team directed the district authorities to maintain strict vigil for three months in the bird flu affected areas. Later, they together visited bird flu-hit areas of Karuvatta and Thakazhi, and collected details from duck farmers. In Thakazhi, avian influenza has been reported from the same area where the disease was reported in 2016. The team directed Forest Department officials to collect samples from migratory birds and send them for testing. 49,000 birds culled District authorities informed experts that in a bid to check the spread of the outbreak, a total of 49,958 birds, mostly ducks, were culled in the district. Moreover, 32,550 eggs and 5,070 kg of feed were destroyed. District Collector Alexander said culling and sanitisation of the infected areas had been completed. Bird flu was detected from five places in Kuttanad at Nedumudi; Thakazhi, Pallippad and Karuvatta in Alappuzha district; and Neendoor in Kottayam district. Earlier, authorities collected samples from eight places, following the mass death of ducks in December, and sent it to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, for analysis. Five samples tested positive for bird flu. Following this, authorities decided to cull birds, including domestic birds, within a 1-km radius of the infected areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-want-strict-vigil-on-bird-flu-in-kerala/article33540859.ece
10 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Centre delaying a solution by leaving it to SC: farmer groups||Farmer outfits from Punjab, including the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), on Saturday said the Centre’s hint of getting the farm laws issue resolved by the Supreme Court was a ploy to prolong the issue in a bid to derail the ongoing agitation. The BKU (Ugrahan), one of the largest outfits in Punjab, and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, the one outfit which is still continuing with a ‘rail roko’ agitation in Amritsar, have asserted that the Centre’s suggestion during the meeting with farmers on January 8 that it would be best to leave the issue surrounding farm laws to the Supreme Court, clearly indicated that it wanted to delay finding a solution. “The suggestion to leave the issue to the Supreme Court indicates that the government wants to delay finding a solution to ongoing dispute. Their intention is only to prolong the issue and not fulfil our demands. The government wants to suppress people’s movement. We have already dismissed the government’s suggestion,” Shingara Singh Mann, State secretary BKU (Ugrahan) told The Hindu . “The government’s intention is very clear. They want to dislodge the ongoing farmers movement by involving the courts,” he said.  Mr. Mann said the BKU(U) along with other outfits would stand firm for the complete repeal of the farm laws, besides government procurement of all crops and in all the States at Minimum Support Price as a legal right. Sarvan Singh Pandher, general secretary of the Punjab unit of Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee, said all the unions, which participated in the meeting, had rejected the government’s indication of leaving the matter to the Supreme Court. “The government wants to take the matter in the court to prolong the way out. They don’t want to resolve the issue,” he said. Mr. Pandher said farmer outfits were all set to intensify their agitation and had appealed to farmers and farm labourers across the country to step up their efforts to make the proposed ‘tractor parade’ on January 26 in New Delhi a success. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) general secretary Harinder Singh said the Centre had enacted the laws and it could repeal them easily. “There is no need of going to the Supreme court. The government should listen to farmers demand and immediately repeal the laws,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-delaying-a-solution-by-leaving-it-to-sc-farmer-groups/article33540877.ece
10 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Indian vaccines ready to save humanity’||Amid the global pursuit of coronavirus vaccines, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said India was ready to save humanity by providing to the rest of the world two Indian-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, cleared for emergency use. “India used to import PPE kits, masks, ventilators and testing kits from outside but today our nation is self-reliant. Today, India is ready to save humanity with two ‘Made in India’ coronavirus vaccines,” Mr. Modi told the Indian diaspora, inaugurating the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas over videoconference, in which Suriname President Chandrikapersad Santokhi was chief guest. Mr. Modi lauded Indian-origin citizens around the world, who he said were at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. He also said that Indian-origin leaders were trusted in their countries for social and political leadership. In his speech, he also praised India’s “vibrant and strong democracy”, and its role as a leading pharmaceutical and vaccine producer. “Being the pharmacy of the world, India has supplied important medicines to all those in need in the world in the past and is also doing so now. The world is not only waiting for Indian vaccines but also watching how India runs the world biggest vaccination programme,” Mr. Modi said, referring to India’s plans to roll out a vaccination programme that the government says will begin by mid-January and inoculate 300 million people by July 2021. The Drugs Controller General of India on January 3 approved two vaccines — Covishield, the vaccine developed by U.K.’s AstraZeneca and Oxford University, being manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin, manufactured by Bharat Biotech. However, the government has not yet announced any purchase contract with either of the two, nor is it clear how soon the production capacity for both internal consumption and export orders will be reached. Last week, the SII said it had stockpiled 50 million doses, while Bharat Biotech said it had readied 10 million doses. Global interest Mr. Modi’s statement comes even as various countries have expressed their interest in procuring vaccines from Indian companies. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar announced that Sri Lanka would be given priority for the vaccines after a meeting with Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had asked India for supplies. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said in a New Year’s address to her nation that the contract for Indian vaccines had been signed, and her government was ready to import them once India issued the necessary clearances for their export. Next week, Nepal Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali is expected to discuss procurement of the Indian vaccines and possibly sign a contract for them. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has written a letter to Mr. Modi, asking India to expedite the export of two million vaccine doses that had been ordered from SII . “There is understandably interest in many countries to access vaccines from India,” said External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Friday. “India sees international cooperation in this field, particularly with neighbours, as its duty. In our neighbourhood, we have already provided medicines and other essentials and training assistance for experts. As we roll out vaccines, the Prime Minister’s announcement needs to be noted,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-vaccines-ready-to-save-humanity/article33540884.ece
10 January 2021||New Delhi,||British MPs flag farmers’ protest||More than a hundred members of the British Parliament have signed a letter to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking him to raise the concerns of protesting farmers outside Delhi, and the “brute force” employed against them, in his discussion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The letter, dated January 5, notes that many constituents, especially those with links to Punjab or India, “were horrified to see footage of water cannon, tear gas and brute force being used against hundreds of thousands of peacefully protesting farmers”. The Indian diaspora and others, have also joined in global protests in support of the farmers. Mr. Johnson has cancelled his plans to visit India as the chief guest for Republic Day because of the COVID-19 crisis in his country. However, the British MPs said that the two Prime Ministers had plans to meet soon. “Given the urgency of this matter, could you please confirm that you will definitely convey to the Indian Prime Minister the heart-felt anxieties of our constituents, our hopes for a speedy resolution, and also for the democratic human right of citizens to peacefully protest?” said the letter to Mr. Johnson. They also asked Mr. Johnson to clarify his own understanding of the issue, given that he seemed to confuse it with an India-Pakistan matter when an MP raised it in Parliament last month. Last month, a similar letter was written to British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who was in Delhi in December. He said he raised the issue with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, but not with Mr. Modi. At that time, India termed the remarks on farmer protests by foreign leaders and politicians as “ill-informed” and “unwarranted” as the matter pertained to the internal affairs of a democratic country. The signatories to the letter included members of multiple parties, including those with roots in the sub-continent and others whose constituencies include large Indian-origin populations. Apart from MPs, a handful of peers from the House of Lords also signed the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/british-mps-flag-farmers-protest/article33540869.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||‘A vaccine is a vaccine ... regulators never approve a back-up’||Virologist and Director, Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University, Shahid Jameel   said different concerns exist regarding both approved vaccines in India, adding that it was premature to assume they would be useful against the ‘U.K. strain’.  We have seen two Indian vaccines approved. Covishield by the Serum Insitute of India has submitted — but not published — any data on its Indian trial. Bharat Biotech has published safety and immunogenicity data (pre-print) for Covaxin but has not generated the all-important efficacy data. Do you think the regulator has made a judicious call in approving both? As more details trickle out, it appears that the fear of a second wave, propelled by more contagious viruses of the B.1.1.7 lineage (popularly called U.K. variant), weighed heavily on the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) and the regulatory committees. Since what was presented by the companies to them is not available in the public domain, it is hard to second-guess. But it is clear that the process, initially laid out by the DCGI, was compromised. Vaccines are a product of science, and there is a methodology and process to science. It is based not on beliefs but on data and evidence, which is found to be lacking in this case. The relative confidence in Covishield rests on efficacy studies in the U.K. and Brazil. However there were multiple problems pointed in these trials. Some vials of vaccine had less than intended dosage leading to varying efficacy estimates. The U.S. FDA too hasn't cleared the vaccine in their country. Are these matters of concern? Yes, these should be matters of concern. You cannot combine Oxford/AstraZeneca efficacy data from Brazil and U.K. together — 62% and 90% as a weighted average of 70.4% — just to cross the threshold. The doses were different. The concern is indeed highlighted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not clearing this vaccine as yet. In India if two full doses of Covishield are to be used, the efficacy would be 62% not 70.4%. The reasons cited by the Indian government for approving vaccines, in spite of incomplete evidence, is the threat by “mutant strains” and having “a back-up”. Is there evidence that an inactivated whole virus might perform better than sub-unit recombinant ones? What does the history of virology suggest? Firstly, there is no “back-up” vaccine. A vaccine is a vaccine. Regulators never approve something as a back-up. Every product must be safe and efficacious for everyone to take. And that data is still lacking for Covaxin. While it is a theoretical possibility, there is thus far no experimental evidence that Covaxin will neutralise the newly emerging mutants any better. As opposed to Covishield that makes only the spike (S) protein, Covaxin contains all viral particle proteins, including the nucleocapsid (NC) protein. Antibodies are mainly generated against the S and NC proteins, and neutralising antibodies only against the ‘S’. The Covaxin Phase 2 data shows a rising antibody titre against both S and NC proteins after the first and second dose. The point to understand is that only the S protein is displayed on the virus surface and therefore, only anti-S antibodies will neutralise the virus; the anti-N antibodies would have no role. Where the NC protein would help is to generate better cytotoxic T cell responses that would efficiently eliminate virus-infected cells. Being a killed vaccine, Covaxin is unlikely to raise good cytotoxic T cell immunity; live/replicating viral vaccines do that much better. While cell-mediated immunity data is shown for Covaxin, it is not clear how much is being contributed by the NC protein. Thus, while it is a theoretical possibility, the jury is still out on whether the NC protein is providing added benefit to Covaxin over other vaccines based only on the S protein. Bharat Biotech has expressed difficulties in recruiting people for trials. Does such apprehension exist globally or are there unique challenges in India? Indian companies, Bharat Biotech included, are very good vaccine companies. These challenges are not on account of perceived quality. I feel this is because Phase 3 trials in India came at a time when the outbreak had declined significantly. Had the Covaxin Phase 3 trial started in August or September instead of November, there would have been no recruitment problems. It is both a matter of perception (reducing danger) as well as exclusion criteria. The latter require volunteers who have no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (antibody negative) and who also don’t share living quarters with someone who tested positive for the virus. Increasing exposure of the population makes the trial increasingly difficult. Could you explain the relative merits of a DNA vaccine, RNA vaccine vs the tried and tested inactivated virus-platforms? Are the latter vestigial technology like typewriters? Are the new kinds of vaccines inherently easier to make or more effective? I would not call inactivated viral vaccines as vestigial. Most effective vaccines in use today belong to that category. The inherent difficulty with this platform is that it requires viruses to be grown to high titres. That is often difficult and sometimes not possible. Take for example the hepatitis E virus on which I worked for three decades. It grows very poorly in culture and thus no inactivated vaccine has been possible. Nucleic acid vaccines are a new platform and would be used for the first time with COVID vaccines. So far the results for mRNA vaccines look good and DNA vaccines are yet to be tested. But the long-term safety for both is yet to be established. These would be platforms for the future simply because it is much easier to manufacture RNA and DNA than proteins. Viral protein antigens are best made by the body to ensure proper conformation and structure, which is often not possible in vitro. DNA, RNA and viral vectors (for instance, adenoviruses) use the cell’s machinery to make viral protein antigens. In the pre-pandemic world, efficacy data from a phase-3 trial was non-negotiable for a vaccine. Exceptions were made in the case of Ebola in Africa where a vaccine was rolled out because of high mortality. Does the state of the pandemic now in India justify an emergency roll-out of an unproven vaccine? Yes, Ebola vaccines were used without Phase 3 testing to vaccinate about 60,000 people in West Africa. But that cannot be cited as a precedence. The 2014-16 Ebola outbreak had 28,600 cases and 11,325 deaths, giving about a 40% fatality rate. The global fatality rate for COVID-19 is 2.15%; for India it is 1.44%. There is a big difference in the two situations. Further, India is on a continuous declining curve since mid-September. From a peak of about 95,000 per day (seven-day average), we are now down to about 18,000 cases per day. What was the tearing hurry? Do you think the nature of vaccine and drug trials has now irrevocably changed forever? Yes absolutely. This is a real positive outcome of COVID —it has revealed to us the power of science.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The party of Kims||Nine years since being anointed as the Supreme Leader of the authoritarian Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Kim Jong-un has presided over the second party Congress of the ruling Workers Party of Korea (WPK) in his tenure. This was just the seventh Party Congress since the Workers Party took power in North Korea in 1948 and eighth overall. None were held between 1980 and 2016, a reflection of the nature of governance in this single party-ruled state, where the party exists merely as an extended entity of the personality cult that dominates government in the country. But even then, two party Congresses being held since Mr. Kim Jong-un came to power signifies a shift from the previous iteration of the Kim dynasty. Nominally, an “independent socialist State”, North Korea is an authoritarian dictatorship led by the Kim dynasty with Kim Jong-un being the third ruler of the country, succeeding his father Kim Jong-il, who himself came to power after the death of his father and the country’s founding leader Kim Il-sung. Political dynasties running in the same family are not the preserve of dictatorships or monarchies alone, but North Korea is unique among self-proclaimed socialist countries in institutionalising it. The hegemony of the WPK is enshrined in its Constitution and Mr. Kim Jong-un as the Chairman of the WPK and the chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK is recognised as the “Supreme Leader” of the country. Its governing “Ten principles for the establishment of a monolothic ideological system”, a set of rules that have superseded the Constitution in the government’s day-to-day functioning and which are supposed to be memorised by every citizen, include a Clause that the “party” and the “revolution” must be eternally carried forward by the “Baekdu bloodline” (shorthand for the Kim dynasty). Guiding principle The nominal ideology that governs the party and its rule in the country remains Juche (self-reliance) and Songun (military-first). Juche draws from the legacy of Kim Il-sung’s rule during which North Korea was a key member of the Socialist bloc and worked towards building its economy without tying into the world’s capitalist markets  and since then morphed into North Korea’s pursuit of strategic autonomy by developing nuclear weapons to counter its key adversary, the U.S. Songun was a guiding principle enshrined during Kim Jong-il’s rule, when the regime emphasised military supremacy, partly to gain the support of the armed forces to prevent the possibility of a depoliticised military’s defection, and partly to secure the legitimacy of Kim Jong-il, who lacked any military experience.  Juche remains only on paper, as North Korea is a highly dependent nation on Chinese imports and aid, but there have been functional differences in the implementation of Songun since the demise of Kim Jong-il. The differences can also explain the conduction of the two Workers Party Congresses in the former’s tenure after the last such Congress before 2016 was held in 1980. The Kim Jong-un regime has given greater emphasis to policymaking process — convening meetings of the various leadership levels of the WPK. Even if these meetings are largely ceremonial and a means to convey policy decisions from the top leadership to the rank and file, the very fact that they are being more regularly convened suggests a functional difference from the previous regime. Songun is also never mentioned in Kim Jong-un’s speeches, signifying a definite shift from the key ideology of the Kim Jong-il regime, with importance accruing more to the party organisation as opposed to the military. The WPK retains its role as an organisation that allows for the regime to conduct mass scale surveillance of its citizenry and to reward those who are favourable to it and therefore provides it the edge in retaining its authoritarian rule. Little is understood about the country’s economy except for what is gleaned from recent defectors and satellite imagery. Recent scholarly work on North Korea using remote-sensed night luminosity data estimated high levels of poverty (of around 60%). In the Congress’ sessions so far, the regime seems to be harping on a self-critique of its economic efforts, in a way to reassure the regime’s adherents of a renewed focus on livelihoods even as it continued to emphasise its nuclear brinkmanship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-party-of-kims/article33540895.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The terror mastermind||Just six days after his arrest on January 2, Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the known Lashkar-e-Taiba mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror strikes, was sentenced to a five-year jail term on terror financing charges on January 8. The speed with which the wheels of justice turned in Pakistan in the case of Lahkhvi’s terror financing case are in sharp contrast to the years he remained charged in the Mumbai attack case, in which he was eventually bailed out. It’s evident that where Indian pressure and American prodding didn’t work in ensuring Lakhvi’s conviction in the Mumbai terror strikes, in which 166 persons were killed, Islamabad’s fears about punitive action from the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, seem to have done the trick. Islamabad has been facing the heat from the financial watchdog for some time on the issue of terror financing and has called upon Pakistan to make sure it complies fully with its action plan prior to a key FATF meeting in February. Saeed’s conviction Lakhvi’s sentence is also in line with that of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed’s conviction in four terror-financing cases in November and February 2020. In October 2020, FATF decided that Pakistan would remain on its grey list, pending full compliance with its action plan. In a statement, FATF said Pakistan needed to work in four areas to address “strategic deficiencies” as far as terror financing was concerned. Among other things, Pakistan needed to demonstrate effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all “[UN-mandated] 1267 and 1373 designated terrorists”. So, here we have the context behind all the “action” from the Pakistani establishment relating to Lakhvi and Saeed, who prospered and thrived in the warm embrace of the Pakistani establishment for decades. They are now being treated as a public liability and, hence, the arrests and rather speedy convictions. Also, key for the Pakistan Army/ intelligence establishment is that their convictions are not in relation to an India-related terrorist case. Bending before India, or being seen to be bending before India, is not good policy for any Pakistani establishment. The fallout of an India-terror related conviction would be a hot potato to handle, given that many key figures in the Pakistani establishment said at the time of the Mumbai terror strikes that these had been conducted by India itself. In Lakhvi’s case, the prosecution seems to have had its way with the Lahore anti-terrorism court judge. “The court was informed that Lakhvi was a founding member of the banned LeT, which was proscribed in the country in 2002 due to its involvement in terrorism, while the United Nation Security Council (UNSC) has also imposed financial restrictions on him,” The Express Tribune reported on Friday. The court held that a “dispensary” was under Lashkar’s charge and being used for “terrorist purposes”. In all, the Dawn newspaper reported that the Pakistani Punjab’s counter-terrorist department had registered 41 FIRs against Jamaat-ud-Dawa (the parent wing of the Lashkar) leaders, of which trial courts had “decided” as many as 27 cases. Strategic decision It’s clear that a strategic decision has been taken to shut down the JuD-Lashkar combine by the Pakistani establishment. However, even during his time as an “under trial” detainee in Adiala jail, Rawalpindi, Lakhvi could receive guests and use the Internet, access a mobile phone and watch television. He is even believed to have fathered a child while in jail. So, the jury will have to wait and watch what kind of “jail treatment” awaits Lakhvi this time. The secrecy with which the Pakistani deep State operates makes it difficult to assess what exactly is happening. A recent arrest warrant for Masood Azhar, leader of the Jaish-e-Muhammad, confirms after years the presence of the wanted terrorist in Pakistan. Remember that Azhar was one of the terrorists exchanged by India in return for the passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight to Kandahar in December 1999. Given their being creatures of the Pakistani establishment, and the enduring interest in using non-State actors to foment trouble in Jammu and Kashmir, it’s quite likely that new outfits may have already received the blessings of the deep State. For now, Lakhvi and Saeed are in jail. Azhar’s fate will be keenly watched in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-terror-mastermind/article33540897.ece
10 January 2021||New Delhi,||17 hours in air, women crew flying into history||An all-woman cockpit crew will fly into aviation history on Saturday when it operates the inaugural San Francisco-Bengaluru flight, going over the North Pole and taking the Atlantic route to reach the Karnataka capital at another part of the world. “This will be the longest commercial flight in the world to be operated by Air India or any other airline in India... The total flight time on this route will be of more than 17 hours depending on the wind speed on that particular day,” Air India said in a statement. The direct distance between the two cities is 13,993 km, with a time zone change of around 13.5 hours, an Air India official said. ‘Woman power’ “Air India’s woman power flies high around the world,” Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri said on Twitter. “All women cockpit crew consisting of Capt Zoya Aggarwal, Capt Papagari Thanmai, Capt Akansha Sonaware & Capt Shivani Manhas will operate the historic inaugural flight between Bengaluru & San Francisco,” he said. Flight AI 176 will depart from San Francisco in the U.S. at 8.30 p.m. (local time) on Saturday, and land at the Kempegowda International Airport at 3.45 a.m. (local time) on Monday. “Captain Zoya Aggarwal is an accomplished pilot with a flying experience of more than 8000 hrs and command experience in a B-777 aircraft of more than 10 years and more than 2500 flying hours,” the national carrier said. The flight will operate with a Boeing 777-200LR aircraft VT ALG with a seating capacity of 238 passenger seats — eight first class, 35 business class and 195 economy class — and four cockpit and 12 cabin crew, Air India said. The first direct flight between the two tech hubs is almost fully booked — 225 of the 238 seats — despite the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns over air travel. Long-pending demand The flight, which has long been in the pipeline, will be the first direct non-stop flight between the west coast of the U.S. and southern India. Given the significant population of south Indians in San Francisco, home to the Silicon Valley, a direct flight has been a long-pending demand. The flight will take off to San Francisco from Bengaluru on Mondays and Thursdays, and leave San Francisco for Bengaluru on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

10 January 2021||New Delhi,||Modi should resign if govt. can’t break impasse: Cong.||Stepping up its attack on the Narendra Modi government over the three farm laws, the Congress on Saturday said the Prime Minister should resign if he can’t repeal the laws and has to depend on the Supreme Court to break the deadlock with farmers. Addressing a press conference to announce a series of protest events on January 15, Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala said the top court should also “introspect” on why farmers don’t want to approach the court while the government wants everything — the Rafale deal, the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens, the farm laws — cleared by it. Mr. Surjewala, however, qualified that his comment on “introspection for the court” was made as an “ordinary citizen”. To coincide with the next round of talks between the farmers’ unions and the Centre on January 15, the Congress will be observing Kisan Adhir Diwas [Farmer’s Rights Day] in which Congress workers across the country will hold protest marches, stage sit-ins and petition Governors to annul the farm laws. Course of action The course of action was decided at a virtual meeting — presided by general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal — of Congress members in charge of States and general secretaries, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Separately, the party’s youth wing, the Indian Youth Congress, launched ‘Ek Muthi Mitti Shaheedo ke Naam’ programme that seeks to collect a fistful of soil from the homes of the farmers who lost their lives during the agitation. Mr. Surjewala told reporters, “This is the first government in the past 73 years history of the country that is grossly abdicating its responsibility and telling the farmers to approach the Supreme Court.”  Responding to a question that the farmers were not keen on approaching the courts, Mr. Surjewala said, “The Supreme Court needs to look within why the country’s annadataas [food-givers] don’t find it acceptable to go to the court. And why it is that this government repeatedly — be it CAA or NRC or habeas corpus or these laws whose solution need to be found in Parliament — wants a solution from the court.”  The Supreme Court needs to look within why the country’s annadataas don’t find it acceptable to go to the court  Randeep Singh Surjewala Congress spokesperson||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-should-resign-if-govt-cant-break-impasse-cong/article33540873.ece
10 January 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Madhavsinh Solanki passes away||Veteran Congress leader Madhavsinh Solanki, 93, who served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat four times and also as a Union Minister, passed away in Gandhinagar on Saturday morning. Mr. Solanki, soft-spoken and mild-mannered, was a Congress stalwart in Gujarat. The party last won the Assembly election in the State under his leadership in 1985, winning 149 of the 182 seats, which remains a record. He served as a Union Minister in the Rajiv Gandhi and the P.V. Narsimha Rao governments at the Centre. He was External Affairs Minister from June 1991 to March 1992, but had to resign following a controversy over his meeting with the then Foreign Minister of Switzerland in Davos. He had reportedly delivered a letter to his Swiss counterpart to scuttle the investigation into alleged kickbacks in the Bofors deal. In 1985, he had to resign as Chief Minister following the anti-reservation riots in the State. A staunch loyalist of the Nehru-Gandhi family, starting with Indira Gandhi, Mr. Solanki dominated Gujarat politics for decades and was regarded as the most powerful politician and mass leader in the State. Social alliance His ‘KHAM’ (Kshatriya, Harijan, Adivasi and Muslim) experiment proved to be a powerful social alliance in electoral politics, which won the Congress landslide victories for two decades. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter: “Shri Madhavsinh Solanki Ji was a formidable leader, playing a key role in Gujarat politics for decades. He will be remembered for his rich service to society. Saddened by his demise. Spoke to his son, Bharat Solanki Ji, and expressed condolences. Om Shanti.” “Beyond politics, Shri Madhavsinh Solanki Ji enjoyed reading and was passionate about culture. Whenever I would meet him or speak to him, we would discuss books and he would tell me about a new book he recently read. I will always cherish the interactions we had,” Mr. Modi added. Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former party president Rahul Gandhi condoled the death. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani declared a State mourning for a day, and a Cabinet meeting passed a resolution condoling the death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/madhavsinh-solanki-passes-away/article33540880.ece

Lessons in one of the most famous combat styles in the world will now be taught to the new generation at the facility which will come up at Kerala Tourism’s Vellar Crafts Village en route to Kovalam. The 3,500 sq ft academy in the village is scheduled to be completed in two months. Classes will be conducted here by gurus led by Padmashri Meenakshiamma. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will release the syllabus of Kalaripayattu Academy on January 16 during the inauguration of the renovated Crafts Village. 100 students initially The academy will have an intake of 100 students initially. The martial art educates a person on the importance of a lifestyle that is beneficial to one’s mind and body. The training will be in two batches, from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Children and adults will be trained. There are also plans to link the academy with the Dance Training College that is also part of the Crafts Village. Classes will be organised in such a way that training in Kalaripayattu will help those learning dance. In the past, Kalaris (combat arena or battlefield) formed an integral part of people’s lives. With times, Kalaris’ influence too changed. Today, Kalaripayattu is staged during festivals and special occasions as a showpiece. People are more interested in Kalari treatment and Marmachikitsa. The academy is intended to impart training in the true spirit of the ancient martial art that is based on sound scientific principles. Ballads Kalaripayattu is mentioned in the Vadakkan Pattu ballads about the Chekavars from Malabar. It is acknowledged and respected across the world and is used by Kerala Tourism for increasing footfall.

10 January 2021||Kolkata,||Nadda kicks off farmers’ outreach in West Bengal||Starting a major farmers’ outreach programme in West Bengal, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president J. P. Nadda on Saturday defended the farm laws brought in by the Centre saying that they were aimed to provide “freedom to farmers”. Speaking at a public rally at Katwa in Purba Bardhaman, Mr. Nadda said that during the outreach programme, titled “Krishak Samman Abhiyyan”, BJP workers would visit farmers’ houses, ask for a handful of foodgrains, and take a pledge to protect their interests. Mr. Nadda visited five households at Katwa as part of the programme . “The programme will continue till January 24 and BJP workers will visit 40,000 villages in the State. After this, BJP workers will observe ‘ krishak bhoj ’ (lunch with farmers) till January 31 and tell them what injustice is being done to farmers in West Bengal,” Mr. Nadda said. The BJP president had lunch at the house of a farmer, Mathura Mondal, at Katwa, with other State BJP leaders. Later, Mr. Nadda visited a party office in Burdwan town and participated in a roadshow. Mr. Nadda’s visit to Bardhaman Purba, an agrarian belt, is an attempt by the party to reach out to farmers in West Bengal.  Trinamool leader and State Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya reacted to the visit saying, “For those who have come here in West Bengal today, look at what is happening in Delhi. It takes only 40 to 50 minutes in Delhi to speak to the protesting farmers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nadda-kicks-off-farmers-outreach-in-west-bengal/article33540872.ece

In a statement, the company noted that “with regard to reports of a death in Phase III trials, we would like to state that a volunteer passed away on December 21, 2020 and the death was reported to the People’s College of Medical Sciences & Research Centre by the son of the deceased. The volunteer, at the time of enrolment, had fulfilled all the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be accepted as a participant in the Phase 3 trial and was reported to be healthy in all the site follow up calls post seven days of his dosing and no adverse events were observed or reported.” Post-mortem report “As per the post-mortem report issued by the Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, that the site received from the Bhopal police, the probable cause of death was due to cardio-respiratory failure as a result of suspected poisoning and the case is under police investigation as well,” the statement said. “We cannot confirm if the volunteer received the study vaccine or a placebo as the study is blinded.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/death-of-volunteer-not-due-to-vaccine/article33540886.ece
10 January 2021||NEW,||Bolsonaro seeks fast vaccine supply||Under considerable pressure to begin a vaccine roll-out, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting the Indian government to “expedite” the export of two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, ‘Covidshield’, being manufactured at the Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune, which are expected to be delivered next week. “To [ensure] the immediate implementation of the Brazilian National Programme of Immunisation, I would highly appreciate your good offices in expediting the shipment of two million doses of the vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India to Brazil urgently, but as long as it does not impact the Indian vaccination programme,” Mr. Bolsonaro wrote to Mr. Modi on Friday, according to a translated version of the letter accessed by The Hindu . Government officials said a reply had not yet been sent to Mr. Bolsonaro. When contacted, SII representatives declined to comment on the Brazilian request. With more than 8 million cases of COVID-19, Brazil is second only to the U.S. (22.4 million cases) and India (10.4 million cases), but in terms of number of deaths due to the virus, Brazil with more than 200,000 fatalities, is second only to the U.S. (378,000-plus deaths), and much higher that than India’s 150,000-plus deaths.  Sources said the request was also sparked by some alarm over SII CEO Adar Poonawalla’s suggestion in an interview on January 3 that the Indian government had curtailed exports of the vaccines until domestic needs had been fulfilled.  New Delhi subsequently clarified that it does not plan to restrict the supply of coronavirus vaccines to other countries, and a joint press statement was issued by SII and Bharat Biotech confirming it on January 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bolsonaro-seeks-fast-vaccine-supply/article33540890.ece

Jag Anand off the Chinese coast for the past 10 months are likely to return to India by January 14, Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted on Saturday. However, there is yet no breakthrough for 35 other Indian seamen stranded aboard Italian ship m.v. Anastasia , Greek vessel m.v. Skopelos and Hong Kong-owned m.v. Declan Duff for over six months. Declan Duff is barely 3.5 nautical miles from Jag Anand at the Jingtang port. “Ship MV Jag Anand , having 23 Indian crew, stuck in China, is set to sail toward Chiba, Japan, to carry out crew change, will reach India on 14th January,” Mr. Mandaviya tweeted. He added that once the crew members reach Chiba, they will undergo COVID-19 related protocols and then fly to India. However, as of Saturday evening, the ship was yet to leave the port because of a technical issue with the anchor though it was cleared by the Vessel Traffic Service. The Indian bulk cargo vessel, carrying coal from Australia, has been stuck near the Jingtang port in Hebei province of China since June 13 as it was not allowed to dock by port authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sailors-stuck-in-chinese-port-to-return-by-jan-14-mandaviya/article33540865.ece
10 January 2021||KOTTAYAM,||Jose K. Mani resigns from Rajya Sabha||Signalling his return to State politics, Kerala Congress (M) chairman Jose K. Mani has resigned from the Rajya Sabha. An official statement issued by the party said Mr. Mani had submitted his resignation letter to Vice President Venkaiah Naidu in New Delhi. “Though I had made up my mind to step down as Rajya Sabha member much earlier, legal battles over the party’s recognition and its symbol posed some technical delays. Now, with the Central Election Commission and the Kerala High Court ruling in favour of us, I have tendered my resignation to the Vice President of India,” Mr.Mani said, conveying his regards to all those who supported him as a Member of Parliament. Mr. Mani had announced his decision to resign from the upper House as early as October last year while declaring the party’s decision to join the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Legal battle with Joseph Mr. Mani, however, delayed the move in view of a legal battle with the KC(M) rival faction led by P.J. Joseph over the party’s ‘two leaves’ symbol. The delay in his resignation despite a public announcement had drawn sharp criticism from the United Democratic Front (UDF). But with the Central Election Commission and the Kerala High Court ruling in his favour, Mr.Mani finally decided to step down to facilitate his entry into State politics. Party sources said Mr.Mani would be contesting to the Assembly either from Pala or Kaduthuruthy as an LDF candidate. They also hinted that the Rajya Sabha seat vacated by Mr.Mani would again be allotted to the KC(M) by the LDF during the next election. Seat allotment The UDF had allotted the Rajya Sabha seat to Mr.Mani two years ago as a condition for the return of KC(M) to the coalition. The move, however, triggered strong protests within the Congress, with former State president V.M. Sudheeran terming the move a “Himalayan blunder”. The bickering among leaders had even forced the party to issue a gag order to prevent leaders from different factions to air their views publicly. The Congress had decided to sacrifice the seat against the interest expressed by former Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien for a fourth successive term.

The court held that an intermediary like snapdeal.com nor its directors could not be held responsible and/or liable for prosecution for sale of any item for not complying with the requirements under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 on its platform. “An intermediary as defined under Section 2(w) of the Information Technology Act or its directors/officers would not be liable for any action or inaction on part of a vendor/seller making use of the facilities provided by the intermediary in terms of a website or a market place,” the High Court held relying on the apex court’s verdict. Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the order while allowing the petitions filed by the company and its chief executives challenging the cognisance of offence taken against them by a court in Mysuru in June 2020. The Drugs Inspector (Intelligence), Mysuru, had complained that snapdeal.com allowed sale of Suhagra-100 tablets (sildenafil citrate tablets 100 mg) during 2014 by a manufacturer based in Haryana, and the tablet was delivered to a person in Karnataka in November 2014 through snapdeal.com. It was complained that the sale of tablet was a violation of Section 18(1)(c) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Apart from holding that the intermediary is not liable for prosecution for lapses by vendors/sellers, the court found no justification for delay of six years for lodging a complaint by the drugs authorities. The court also found that Snapdeal had done due diligence of vendor as per the law and had initiated action on the vendor of the drug as per law acting on initiation by the drugs authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/proceedings-against-snapdeal-quashed/article33540843.ece

10 January 2021||KOCHI,||NGT to evaluate sand-mining scenario||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has decided to appoint an eight-member committee to check whether riverbed sand-mining in Kerala is being done in compliance with the sand-mining policy of the Union government and various environmental laws. The Southern Bench of the tribunal recommended the formation of the committee after taking suo motu notice of media reports quoting a study that recommended that nearly 30.3 lakh cubic metres out of the 81.45 lakh cubic metres accumulated sand in the Bharathapuzha river can be mined. The Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta said that the court lacked clarity on the procedure adopted by the District Collectors while granting permission for mining the excess sand. It is also not known as to whether the district survey reports are prepared in a scientific manner as per the guidelines, it said. The expert committee to be led by a senior officer of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has been entrusted with the task of finding out whether any monitoring is done to ascertain the quantity of sand to be mined, besides seeing whether the departments concerned have approved the mining plan. The committee is also directed to provide a status report on sand mining in riverbeds passing through the forests and eco-sensitive zones. It will probe whether permission is being granted in those buffer areas. The committee is also permitted to co-opt the District Collectors whenever inspection is carried out as part of the field study to find out whether they are following a uniform method as per rules. The committee has to submit its report before the tribunal by March 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ngt-to-evaluate-sand-mining-scenario/article33541315.ece

The soldier is being dealt with as per laid down procedures and circumstances under which he had crossed the LAC are being investigated,” a statement said. State media in Beijing confirmed that China had lost a soldier and “called for an immediate return”. “Due to darkness and complicated geography, a Chinese soldier went missing on the China-India border early Friday morning. China informed India as soon as the incident occurred, and sought help from the Indian side. After two hours of searching, the soldier was found,” the official People’s Liberation Army Daily quoted frontier force officials as saying, reported the Global Times . “India should return the soldier immediately, to help de-escalating of the border tension, and uphold regional stability,” a statement said. The Indian Army added that troops from either side are deployed along the LAC since a stand-off erupted in May last year due to “unprecedented mobilisation and forward concentration by Chinese troops”. In a similar incident last October, a Chinese soldier, identified as Corporal Wang Ya Long, was apprehended in the Demchok area and was later handed over to the PLA. The Defence Ministry recently said the Army had completed “advance winter stocking” and winter preparations and troops were “well entrenched to counter any misadventure by Chinese forces”.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||White winter raises hope for J&K tourism||The current fillip to tourism is the first silver lining for the moribund hospitality industry in Kashmir, first battered by the post-August 5 shutdown and then dented further by the pandemic-induced lockdown. According to the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries, around 65,000 people lost jobs in the sector post August 5, with the industry suffering a loss of Rs. 2,615 crore. The latest footfall figures from the J&K Tourism Department show that the popular destination, though mired in bouts of unrest, has retained it hold over visitors from the country and abroad. “Out of the 34,025 tourists who visited Kashmir this year, 3,808 were foreign tourists. December recorded the highest number of 13,237 tourists, which is 39% of the total footfall in the entire year,” said Ahsan Chisti, Deputy Director of the publicity wing of the Tourism Department. The trajectory of the tourism graph is showing a rising trend. From just 186 tourists arriving in the whole of July and 284 in August, 6,327 visited in November. In a surge, the Valley saw around 2,100 tourists arriving just on December 23 and 24, ahead of the New Year. “We are witnessing a healthy footfall of 700 to 1000 tourists arriving in Kashmir per day for the past many days,” Mr. Chisti said. It’s for the first time since 2013 that Gulmarg, which has a bed capacity of 1200-plus, is sold out for two months. The first sun rise of 2021 seems to have brought a ray of hope for tourism. Besides hoteliers, sledge drawers, horse owners, ski trainers and all-terrain vehicle owners, all have all seen good demand. “The tourist trend is also showing that spenders and not just budget tourists are arriving in Gulmarg. We saw mostly three star and four star hotels getting booked first. People who felt trapped due to COVID pandemic, are finding Gulmarg a safe destination to visit,” Mukhtar Shah, president of the Gulmarg Hoteliers Club, said. Gulmarg Gondola, the country’s highest cable car, closed for around six months for failing to do any business, reopened in October last year, and has started ferrying 600 to 800 tourists every day up to an altitude of 3,950 metres. “We have set up special snow-clearance vehicles to rescue tourists who often get stuck due to snowfall, while travelling towards Gulmarg. Despite the recent heavy snowfall, we ensured that electricity supply remains uninterrupted so that no tourist faces any inconvenience,” Inam ul Haq, Chief Executive Officer, Gulmarg, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dip-in-mercury-raises-hope-for-jk-tourism/article33540861.ece

Imran Ansari, a senior Peoples Conference (PC) leader, wrote to his chief Sajad Lone, who is the spokesperson of the alliance, on Saturday and expressed his reservation over the continuation of the amalgam. ‘Deceitful behaviour’ “I am in no way against the stated objectives of the PAGD. But it is difficult to convince the people about the sincerity of intentions when they are themselves witness to deceitful behaviour during the elections. People ask me that if the PAGD leaders cannot be trusted not to cheat each other during the DDC elections, how can they trust with the bigger objectives,” Mr. Ansari’s letter read. Mr. Ansari accused the National Conference, whose president Farooq Abdullah heads the Gupkar alliance, of fielding proxy candidates during the recent District Development Council polls, despite a joint list of candidates drawn by all the constituents of the amalgam. Two senior leaders of the NC and the Peoples Democratic Party have also questioned the alliance. NC’s Basharat Bukhari asked the top leaders of the PAGD “to share their road map with the people”. PDP leader Fayaz Ahmad Mir also accused the NC of fielding proxy candidates and said the leadership has failed to “act against violators”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/proxy-candidates-issue-rocks-gupkar-alliance/article33540867.ece

Mr. Dhankhar responded to questions on the role of a Governor, and said the responsibility of conducting elections lies with a constitutional body like the Election Commission of India. “Every citizen of the State has a role. As Governor, West Bengal my oath of office says I have to preserve protect, and defend Indian constitution and Article 159, I have to serve people of West Bengal to the best of my capacity,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dhankhar-meets-shah-calls-for-peaceful-polls/article33540870.ece

10 January 2021||NALGONDA,||Rise in highway traffic ahead of Sankranti||With conclusion of the auspicious days in Margashira month, ahead of Sankranti, and people rushing for last-hour marriages and functions, highway traffic saw a spike on NH-65 (Hyderabad-Vijayawada) on Friday and Saturday. According to estimates by toll plaza managers, the vehicle numbers crossed the daily average. On Saturday, it was estimated that by 11 p.m., the clocked figure would be 35,000 vehicles at the Pantangi toll plaza at Choutuppal. Officials also suggest that about 80% of the traffic passing through this toll plaza, the second busiest in the State after Raikal plaza in Mahabubnagar district, has got used to FASTag or electronic toll collection. The radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags take some two seconds to be read, while a cash transaction for each vehicle would take at least 10 seconds. And hence, the operators say, the maximum queue does not exceed 200 metres, the ‘cash only’ lane included, compared to the kilometres-long queue two years ago. Real test However, the test of time and traffic on this highway will be in a couple of days, as natives of Andhra Pradesh would be heading back for the harvest festival, when the traffic volume doubles. And, the actual number of vehicles that have been FASTag-stickered would be known. But whether the vehicle is FASTag-stickered or not, the difference between FASTag lane and ‘Cash only’ lane would be erased and all lanes will be converted to ‘cash also’, slightly increasing the delay in all the six lanes towards Vijayawada. Maximum vehicles at Pantangi, as recorded by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), on January 11 last year, a Saturday, was 50, 275, of which 50.42% or 25, 349 were FASTag collections. Officials say the percentage would rise, as vehicles owners have been aware of two compulsory FASTag implementation dates in the past – December 1 last year and January 1 this year – and the FASTag sales considerably rose. Toll plaza managers are however preparing for the once-a-year traffic by bringing more hand-held readers, roping in more staff, and particularly, converting all lanes to cash also, if need arises. About 65,000 vehicles would pass through Pantangi toll plaza on Monday and Tuesday for Sankranti, and a repeat on the return trips, over the weekend after the festival.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rise-in-highway-traffic-ahead-of-sankranti/article33541241.ece

10 January 2021||Kalaburagi,||Toy making cluster to come up in Koppal||Koppal, known for traditional Kinnal toys carved in wood, is now going to house India’s first integrated manufacturing cluster of toys. However, the Koppal Toy Cluster, for which ground-breaking ceremony was performed on Saturday by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, bears little resemblance to the traditional craft that boasts of a Geographical Indication (GI) tag. It will largely manufacture plastic toys aimed at outdoing Chinese toys which till recently dominated the Indian market. Meanwhile, the traditional Kinnal toymakers have suffered due to years of drought, floods and later COVID-19 pandemic. Job creation The proposed Koppal Toy Cluster, an initiative of Aequs Infra, is expected to attract Rs. 5,000 crore investment and generate over one lakh direct and indirect jobs in the next five years. Spread over 400 acres, the cluster is designed to house around 100 toy-making units and offer everything required for the toy manufacturing industry – plastic, steel, electronics and skilled labour. It envisages supporting the entire toy chain from raw material suppliers through manufacturers to the vendors. It is seen as a major development project that would boost the economy in the backward region. With the new industrial policy in force, the local unemployed youth and entrepreneurs are expected to be put on top priority in offering lands, infrastructure, finance and other government aid and incentives. As an estimation, Karnataka is the third biggest State in toy manufacturing. Grown at 18% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) between 2010 and 2017, the State’s toy market is expected to cross 310 million dollars by 2023. Mr. Yediyurappa, speaking to mediapersons at Ginigera airstrip in the district, said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be invited to inaugurate it once the project is ready for operation. HDK tweets Meanwhile, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, in a series of tweets, sought to remind Mr. Yediyurappa that the idea of the cluster, under “compete with China” initiative, was first presented in his budget and Rs. 500 crore had been set aside for it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/toy-making-cluster-to-come-up-in-koppal/article33540841.ece
10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police reach out to children||The Adyar District Police have launched a novel initiative to reach out to children who do not have access to smartphones or who hesitate to approach the police in the event of any distress or abuse. The police have started distributing self-addressed postcards so that the children can write and send them to the top police officer — Deputy Commissioner of Police in the area — about any abuse or harassment they face. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Adyar) V. Vikraman personally handed over the postcards to about 100-odd children. The postcards carry the address of the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Adyar, so that it would be easier for children to post the card. Mr. Vikraman said: “We introduced it for the children who are not able to communicate their grievance either through smartphone or any other phone. Still many children are not able to access those communication devices. Children cannot go straight to the police station and lodge a complaint. The Commissioner of Police has integrated All Women Police Stations (AWPs) with local law and order police stations. Now, we are using law and order police for spreading awareness and distributing self-addressed postcards. We are ensuring that the postcards reach all children who are in vulnerable areas. If a child faces any abuse or harassment, he or she can simply write and post it in a post box. It reaches us. We will take immediate action.” A similar initiative was launched in Tirunelveli and Villupuram districts when Mr. Vikraman was Superintendent of Police there. It received good response from the children in those districts and police were able to reach out to the children who were in need of any police assistance, he said. Kanya Babu, a child right activist, said, “The initiative is a good awareness programme which will be helpful for children who are disadvantaged on most occasions. If something wrong is done to children, usually only parents and their relatives have to approach and lodge complaints. Most of the time, the parents hush up sexual abuse fearing embarrassment as the abuser might be inside the family. Only a small number of aggrieved persons come to report the abuse or harassment.” M. Sudha, Inspector of Police, All Women Police, Adyar, said: “Self-addressed postcards are being distributed to children in Kanathur, Uranikuppam and Odaikuppam and other places wherever it is required. We hope to cover more children once school reopens.” “This initiative is only to tell them that this mode also exists. This is a step of taking service close to the public and a segment which was not covered before. We can protect childhood. The postcard can be used by children as a weapon if something wrong is done to them. They can write about it and post it to us,” said Mr.Vikraman. The police have planned to tie-up with the postal department and place more post-boxes in thickly populated areas such as Kannagi Nagar.  If a child faces any abuse or harassment, he or she can simply write and post it in a post box. It reaches us.  V.

10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Water Museum coming up at Kilpauk||Kilpauk water works, the city’s first water treatment plant, will soon house a water museum on its sprawling premises. With several working models, installations and interactive games in place, the museum is being developed to create awareness on the city’s water supply infrastructure and importance of water conservation. Final touches are being given to the museum being set up in the heritage structure, which recently turned 106. Nearly 100 panels tracing the evolution of the water supply to the latest addition of desalination and tertiary treatment plants are on display. Visitors can get a glimpse of the rare photographs of significant milestones in Chennai’s water distribution system. Two interactive kiosks placed in the corners will provide detailed information about water treatment and supply network, including various water, sewage treatment facilities, reservoirs, means of harnessing rainwater and the city’s lithology. One of the highlights is the virtual reality experience wherein the visitors can choose from a range of content and go on a virtual walk around the scenic reservoirs or let themselves be transported to the desalination plant. For children Another attraction for children would be the “nature house” where a forest scenario has been recreated with effects of rain, lightning and thunder. Besides the model of the ambitious project — 100 million litres a day capacity Nemmeli desalination plant — the museum also has exhibits of reverse osmosis membranes used in the facility. Large touch screen panels at the museum would play 3D animated videos and also serve as digital white boards during workshops, officials said. An official of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board said “We also have live models, including that of Kilpauk Water Works, to showcase how water is treated and distributed in the facility. Exhibits and short videos on drought management are on display. We are developing gamification to engage young visitors on water-related themes.” The facility has working models of rooftop rainwater harvesting system and recharge wells and rainy filters that are linked to underground sump. “This would give an idea about simple RWH methods. We have some of the century old pipes and valves on display,” the official said. A 1,200 mm riveted mild steel pipe and valves used since British period have been put up for display. “We expect the installation of ‘Picottah’ used to raise water from Seven Wells waterworks to convey water to St. George Fort to be another attraction,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-museum-coming-up-at-kilpauk/article33541045.ece
10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK puts up a show of unity at key meeting||Senior leaders of the ruling AIADMK on Saturday called for unity, loyalty and single-minded action on the part of workers of the party to ensure its success in the Assembly poll. Addressing members and special invitees of the general council at a marriage hall near here, the leaders called upon them to highlight negative features concerning the party’s principal rival, DMK in public fora and strive for victory in the election. They also said that if the DMK got defeated this time, it would not be able to bounce back. Booth-level work Chief Minister and the co-coordinator Edappadi K.Palaniswami emphasised the need to pay attention to booth-level work and said that if the party could enlist 300 votes per booth, this would get translated into 90,000 votes in an Assembly constituency. Referring to the narrow margin of 12,000 votes with which the NDA retained power in Bihar, Mr. Palaniswami said this had showed how crucial it was to get every single vote. As voters of Tamil Nadu were known for conscience, it would not be easy to secure votes of the people. The co-coordinator said he expected the Election Commission to hold the election in April or May. He thanked the coordinator and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam for having proposed his name for the CM post. Mr. Panneerselvam lashed out at the DMK and termed it as “worse than the novel coronavirus”. Driving home the point that the AIADMK had always promoted workers from the ranks to high positions, he said that the party did not have “persons who would create groups.” Favourable climate Praising the Mr. Palaniswami government for “being able to maintain the goodwill” of the people, he said that no other incumbent regime than that of Mr. Palaniswami had experienced such a favourable climate, facing an election. “The main reason is that we have been adhering strictly to the path shown by Puratchi Thalaivar [M G Ramachandran] and Amma [Jayalalithaa].” Alluding to the expected release of former interim general secretary of the party V.K. Sasikala, from a Bengaluru prison later this month, K. P. Munusamy, deputy coordinator, said this would not cause any change to the party. However, he cautioned his party members not to be swayed by the confusion that certain sections might create. He added that the real battle in the coming election was going to be between the AIADMK and the DMK. “National parties do not matter here. They are all bystanders only, watching the political game in the State with amusement,” Mr.Munusamy added. Later in the day, all the senior functionaries, including Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam, held discussions on completing the formation of booth-level committees. Among those who spoke were P. Thangamani, Electricity Minister; R. Vaithilingam, another deputy coordinator; E. Madhusudanan, chairman of the presidium of the party and D. Jayakumar, Fisheries Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-puts-up-a-show-of-unity-at-key-meeting/article33541073.ece

Palaniswami condemned the demolition of Mullivaikkal memorial at Jaffna University on Friday night. In a couple of tweets posted on his Twitter account on Saturday, Mr. Palaniswami expressed shock at the demolition of the memorial. “It is extremely shocking that the structure raised in memory of the students of the university and the citizens who were brutally killed in Mullivaikkal in the final stages of the war, has been demolished in the middle of the night,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami said he strongly condemned this act of the Sri Lankan government and the Vice-Chancellor of the University who was hand in-glove with them. Condemning the incident, DMK president M.K. Stalin said, “Many ancient and traditional buildings and structures of Tamils have already been destroyed. The demolition of the Mullivaikkal memorial is the continuation of the trend in Sri Lanka.”  Appeal to PM He said the incident had taken place soon after the visit of External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to Sri Lanka. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi should strongly condemn the incident,” he said.  In a statement MDMK general secretary Vaiko announced that his partymen and supporters of Sri Lankan Tamil cause would picket the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission office in Chennai on January 11. “The Sri Lankan government that killed thousands of Tamils wants to eradicate any symbol that will remind people of its atrocities. That is why the Army personnel entered the campus in the night and demolished the memorial,” he alleged. ‘Dictatorial action’ In a series of tweets, the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) general secretary T.T.V Dhinakaran said the destruction of symbols would not erase the memories of people about the ethnic conflict. The rulers in Sri Lanka should realise that instead of conceptualising plans for the uplift of Tamils, indulging in this type of “dictatorial action” would create undesirable consequences.

10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Only 6% willing to go to theatres, finds survey||Only 6% of citizens were willing to go to theatres and multiplexes in 60 days, a country-wide survey has found. In a survey conducted by LocalCircles, a community social media platform, 93% citizens, while responding to a question on whether they would like their State to permit theatres/multiplexes to operate at full capacity, were against theatres and multiplexes operating at full capacity and wanted physical distancing norms to be maintained. Only 6% voted “yes” to the question that received 8,244 responses, according to a press release. In this recent survey conducted to check the hesitancy level to go to a theatre, citizens were also asked if the current timing was right for the State governments to allow theatres to operate at a full capacity instead of 50% seating capacity. Prior to this, LocalCircles had collected citizens’ responses to understand their hesitancy or reluctance to go to a movie theatre or multiplex and published the results in July, August and October accordingly. Only 6% of citizens in July and August had expressed their willingness to go to theatres and this was followed by an increase of 1% in the October survey. The recent survey asked respondents, “Will you be going to watch a movie in a theatre or multiplex in the next 60 days?” to which a majority, 72%, said they will not go, 16% said they do not watch movies in the theatre, while 6 % have not decided. Only 2% said they will go to a theatre only if there were new releases in the next 60 days, 3% regardless of new or old movie and 1% will go multiple times. The result indicated that only 6% citizens were willing to go to a theatre despite State governments allowing theatres to increase the seating capacity, the release said. Though theatres resumed in October last year, only 20%-45% of seats were reportedly occupied in Tamil Nadu. This too depended on the type of movies released across cities and districts’ cinema halls. The survey received over 16,000 responses from citizens located in 219 districts of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-6-willing-to-go-to-theatres-finds-survey/article33541090.ece
10 January 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Online fitness training is not just an add-on||The current form of online fitness coaching is not just an add-on to the training module but a business model in itself, said Shwetambari Shetty, fitness expert at cure.fit. Ms. Shetty, along with Sarvesh Shashi, founder of SARVA, and Ashish Bhushan, director, Business Development, Procam International, was part of The Hindu ’s sixth episode of ‘Conversations’, speaking about the future of personal fitness in the verticals of training, yoga and running. ‘Conversations’, organised as part of The Hindu Group’s ongoing campaign, ‘Tamil Nadu Smiling’, are aimed at bringing together the people of the State, its traders, retail organisations and government authorities to find ways of emerging from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the fitness industry, the digital transformation is here to stay. “At cure.fit, 5,00,000 sessions are done daily, with over 1,00,000 subscribers for online workouts alone,” Ms. Shetty said. “One of the mindsets pre-pandemic had been that health and wellness going digital would be a contradiction. That has changed,” said Mr. Bhushan. The strength of the digital fitness programmes, however, would be reflected in how useful they remained even after fitness centres opened to full capacity. Using them as a stop-gap solution would make them redundant, he said. Additionally, Mr. Sashi pointed out, this was a good time for young fitness start-ups to take part in the digital revolution because post-pandemic, attention to fitness was becoming an important part of lifestyles. The capital required to start up and the risks involved would be minimum, helped by the digital medium’s inherent ability to course-correct dynamically. With a hybrid of digital workouts and in-person training becoming the norm, Ms. Shetty foresaw a steady rise in the at-home equipment business. “Resistance bands, yoga mats, dumbbells, kettlebells — all these are equipment that we see are doing good business. It may be slow initially, given that these are mostly bought by intermediate or advanced students, but it’s definitely here to stay,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/online-fitness-training-is-not-just-an-add-on/article33541206.ece
10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. steps up vigil after bird flu outbreak||The Department of Animal Husbandry (DAH) in Tamil Nadu, in coordination with other departments, has stepped up vigil to prevent the spread of avian influenza from Kerala to Tamil Nadu. Following the outbreak of the flu in Kerala, the six districts that share borders with it — Tiruppur, Coimbatore, The Nilgris, Theni, Tenkasi and Kanniyakumari — have been put on high alert.  26 checkposts set up A release by the DAH said that 26 temporary inter-State border checkposts have been set up to prevent entry of chicken, ducks, turkeys, quail, eggs, poultry feed, and poultry manure from Kerala. A total of 1,061 rapid response teams have been formed. Poultry farms were strictly being monitored to prevent sale of poultry originating from Kerala. The National Egg Coordination Committee and the Tamli Nadu Poultry Farmers’ Association have been roped in to ensure no procurement from Kerala and strict adherence to bio-security measures in poultry farms. Any large-scale mortality of poultry in any farms must be brought to the immediate notice of the nearest veterinary institution, the release said. ‘Report deaths’ The Environment and Forests department has also been asked to report any outbreak or deaths among migratory birds. Appealing to the public to not panic as the possibility of bird flu spreading to humans was low, the statement said that consumption of well-cooked and hygienic poultry meat and eggs was safe. A 24/7 control room has been set up at the Veterinary Polyclinic in Coimbatore that can be reached at 0422-2397614 / 9445032504.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-steps-up-vigil-after-bird-flu-outbreak/article33541095.ece
10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Heritage garden emerges from British-era workshop||Close to the Metro station in Washermenpet is a historical treasure not many know — the Government Agriculture Engineering Workshop started by the British in 1919. Buildings and machinery in this spacious area were left to ruin after the workshop stopped production. After Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami made a suo motu statement announcing its restoration last year, the Horticulture Department has transformed it into a Heritage Garden to provide space for recreational and physical activities for the people and children of north Chennai. The cost of the project cost is estimated to be Rs. 5 crore. “The entire area was covered with bushes and became a refuge for anti-social elements. So we decided to create a park that will benefit the people of north Chennai,” said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Principal Secretary of the Agriculture Department. The 3.8-acre heritage garden has entrance from both the Washermenpet railway station and Ramadoss Nagar, where encroachments have reduced the road to the garden into a bottleneck. But officials pointed out that the completion of multi-storied Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board flats would lead to removal of encroachments and better accessibility. “The garden will have a 1.5-km walking track, two indoor museums with garden showcasing the machines used for agriculture tools, an indoor children’s playground, a theatre with a capacity of 104 seats and an open gym,” said N. Subbaiyan, director, Horticulture and Plantation Crops. Work is moving at a hectic pace. Two workshop buildings, other structures and machines imported from England for making agriculture tools have been taken up for restoration. Masons and carpenters are using the old teak beams and columns and iron girders which are still in good condition. A garden is gradually emerging from the area after planting trees, ornamental plants and creation of a waterbody and walking tracks. The department has built a huge compound wall to prevent illegal entry into the park. Beautiful paintings adorn the wall. The 32 feet deep well inside the area has been revived. “Instead of pulling down the old structures, we are restoring them because of their heritage value. Films educating people and children on culture, heritage and environment will be screened in the theatre,” Mr. Subbaiyan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/heritage-garden-emerges-from-british-era-workshop/article33541037.ece

One of them underwent a complex transorbital neuro-vascular procedure recently. V. Anand Kumar, hospital’s nodal officer, said patients from Andaman and Nicobar Islands had started to come in December. Four of them were treated at the hospital while two others were treated and referred to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. “The six patients from Andaman and Nicobar Islands required treatment in the specialities of interventional radiology, neurosurgery, oncology and neurology. We had a patient from Jharkhand and a patient from Kerala. All of them were covered under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY),” he said. “The coordinator of PMJAY in Andaman approached us. First, they send us the case reports of the patients and this is forwarded to the respective heads of department. Once we approve, the patient is shifted to the hospital. As the hospital is a non-COVID-19 facility, they considered it safe for their treatment.” Recently, a 50-year-old farmer from Andaman underwent percutaneous transorbital embolisation of a carotico cavernous fistula (CCF). A cerebral angiogram revealed dural CCF to be draining anteriorly into ophthalmic veins, and hence, the routine transfemoral approach was not chosen, according to doctors. The issue could have been caused by trivial trauma or could be age-related, he said. “If left untreated, this could lead to vision loss, bleeding in the brain and death.” R. Vimala, director of the hospital, interacted with the patient.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-multi-speciality-hospital-gets-patients-from-andaman/article33541082.ece
10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Bird flu scare brings chicken sales in city down by 20%||There has been a 20% dip in the sale of chicken in the city and elsewhere owing to the bird flu scare. Though birds in Tamil Nadu have not been affected and the government has been taking steps to prevent the spread of the disease from neighbouring Kerala, consumers are wary of buying chicken. K. Gowrishankar, a resident of Madipakkam, said he had skipped buying chicken this week and opted instead for mutton. “It is a costlier option, but the family had strongly objected to the idea of buying chicken. I accepted their suggestion since I was afraid of bringing something upon ourselves,” he said. A chicken and egg vendor said the prices had come down in the last few days. “Chicken prices in the retail market have come down from Rs. 240 a kg to Rs. 200 a kg. Egg prices, too, have reduced from Rs. 5.50 a piece to Rs. 5. Chicken arrivals have increased since a few States have banned chickens from the south,” he said. Chennai Mutton Traders Association president B. Shabeer Ahmed said wholesale prices, too, had come down from Rs. 120 a kg to Rs. 91 a kg. “Sales volume has come down owing to festival days, not just the bird flu,” he said. R. Lakshmanan, of the Broiler Coordination Committee, said there was no need to be scared of the flu since birds in the State were not affected. “Sales are 80% of the weekend volume,” he said.

10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools hand in views of parents||Schools have submitted to the School Education Department the views of parents on reopening for Classes 10 and 12 after Pongal. The State government will announce a decision shortly. “Around 75% of the parents who participated in the consultations we organised [in schools] were in favour of schools reopening for Classes 10 and 12. The rest had concerns about safety, and we spoke to them about the measures that the school would put in place,” said the principal of a corporation school in the city. A draft Standard Operating Procedure was released before these meetings, laying down the norms to be implemented if schools were reopened for Classes 10 and 12. The Tamil Nadu Teachers Association said in a statement that as specified in the Standard Operating Procedure, the government should arrange for provision of masks, sanitisers as well as vitamin tablets to students if the schools were to reopen. “Government school students, especially in rural areas, have mostly been disconnected from their teachers, and the only way they have been able to follow lessons is through television broadcasts. In-person classes are definitely needed for students of Classes 10 and 12 before they sit for the board exams this year,” said Patric Raymond of the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation. He said that while parents were open to schools reopening for these students, the government should ensure that all schools followed the guidelines. “With the CBSE having announced that the exams will begin on May 4, parents are more in favour of schools reopening than they were before,” said B. Purushothaman, correspondent, Everwin Group of Schools. For the State board schools in Tamil Nadu, there is no clarity on how their syllabus will be reduced for the academic year or on their exam schedule. “If schools reopen for Classes 10 and 12, we hope there will be some clarity on these issues,” said a government school teacher. The schools have submitted the feedback to the District Educational Officers and the Chief Educational Officers.

10 January 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Non-medical teachers anxious over national panel decision||Non-medical teachers and scientists have appealed to the National Medical Commission (NMC) not to reduce their representation in medical colleges. The NMC has, in its guidelines, proposed to reduce the percentage of teaching microbiologists, pharmacologists and biochemists in medical colleges. Sridhar Rao, president of the M.Sc Medical Teachers’ Association, said that since 1960, MBBS students were taught physiology, biochemistry and anatomy as part of their course work in the first three years by non-medical science graduates. However, the NMC had decided to reduce by half their representation in medical colleges. Cut to 15% “Earlier 50% of the teaching posts in these subjects were reserved for non-medical science graduates, but in biochemistry this has now been reduced to 15%. It is worse for microbiology and pharmacology as no non-medical graduates will be appointed to teach the subjects,” he said. The guidelines would apply from the academic year 2021-22 for all medical colleges including those that apply for seat enhancement. It would affect the new appointments in medical colleges as well, Mr. Rao said. According to him, the new guideline could render nearly 6,000 medical scientists in the country jobless in the coming years. Those who retain their jobs will have no opportunity for promotion or salary hikes, he said. Former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Madras S.P. Thyagarajan, who is a microbiologist and currently Dean of Research at Sri Ramachandara Institute for Higher Education and Research, agrees with the association’s demand. Research capabilities In the 1960s when medical students shunned non-clinical subjects such as anatomy, microbiology, and physiology, the Medical Council of India stepped in and introduced Medical M.Sc courses to create teachers. The colleges used these specialists’ expertise, many of them with Ph.Ds, to conduct experiments “and they were helpful in building research capabilities,” he explained. But with more doctors with non-clinical medical degrees becoming teachers, the non-medical graduate teachers are now losing out. “Research and lab-oriented research can be done in a big and much better way by these non-medical graduates,” Prof. Thyagarajan said. With more medical colleges coming up in rural areas there is need to retain the non-medical graduates as doctors were unwilling to go to rural areas, he added. “There is a need for these graduates and it may not be advisable to reduce or remove the non-medical graduates. My opinion is that the 30% is a good combination where both medically qualified and non-medical people can build newer techniques, new research and students can be trained in the latest technologies. This should be continued for the benefit of the graduates,” he said.  Lab-oriented research can be done in a big way by non-medical graduates Prof. Thyagarajan,Former V-C, University of Madras||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/non-medical-teachers-anxious-over-national-panel-decision/article33541063.ece

The Conventional Crime Unit of the Central Crime Branch on Monday arrested B. Nagendra Rao, 54, of Pulianthope, and A. Gnanasekar, 43, of Tondiarpet. Again on Friday, S. Ramani alias Venkatachalam, 58 of Mandaveli, and Devan alias Devaraj, 63, of Pattabiram were arrested by the special unit. The police conducted custodial interrogation of the accused. During interrogation, the prime accused Ramani admitted that he had cheated many people by sending fake appointment orders after receiving money from them, the sources said. “The modus operandi of the accused was that they would approach job aspirants and introduce themselves as highly influential. The offered jobs under Group II services of the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) after collecting money, they pretended to be arranging jobs and due to pressure, they would issue fake appointment orders to the aspirants by post. With fake orders, some of them went to join duty in government offices,” said a source. The case was taken up for investigation after TNPSC secretary B.

10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||900 residents of IMH set to receive ID cards||About 900 residents of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) are getting disability identity cards. The work on registering the patients with the State government and getting them the Centre’s Unique Disability ID (UDID) have taken off. IMH, along with the District Differently Abled Welfare Office, has launched steps to issue disability certificates and register them for the Government of India UDID cards. “For the first time, we have initiated the process to get ID for every individual at IMH. There are many patients who come in as wandering mentally ill, with no relations and on reception orders. Many with intellectual disabilities do not know their names and addresses. So, once we get them disability IDs, we can get them Aadhaar cards as the next step. This will help them get benefits under government schemes once they improve and get discharged,” said P. Poorna Chandrika, director of IMH. As part of this initiative, a medical camp to assess the disability and percentage of disability was organised on IMH campus. Residents of ward number eight were covered in the camp on the first day. For now, IMH would be the guardian or nominated representative in the address for the ID card, she added. “We are covering patients engaged in housekeeping and security services with Krystal, the outsourced agency, to handle their bank accounts,” she added. In future, if any patient remembers his or her identity, it can be changed accordingly. Already, this registration for disability ID card was being done regularly for patients who come to IMH outpatient department with attenders. Officials said this would give the patients the identity of persons with disabilities and they would be entitled to government schemes based on the disability certificate. The degree of disability — mild, moderate and severe — would be assessed. “All these persons are residents of IMH. We have a specific format for the disability certificate and we are filling in the details from each patient’s file,” an official said. A doctor would assess if a person has mental illness or intellectual disability with mental illness at the camp. The type of disability and percentage of disability would be assessed and the doctor would attest the certificate. As the next step, they would be registered. Officials said for Aadhaar enrolment, iris and fingerprints are captured but there were exemptions for persons with disabilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/900-residents-of-imh-set-to-receive-centres-unique-disability-id-cards/article33541050.ece
10 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Pranab Mukherjee saw Tamil politics influencing India-Sri Lanka relations||Former President Pranab Mukherjee, who served as External Affairs Minister, regarded Tamil politics in the country as a factor of great influence on the India-Sri Lanka relationship. In the final volume of his autobiography ‘ The Presidential Years 2012-2017 ’, Mukherjee had stated that the bilateral ties had been “greatly influenced by Tamil politics in India, particularly with the emergence of a strong Dravidian party [DMK in 1967] since the mid-60s.”  Tamil Eelam According to him, the Tamil Eelam concept was raised by “the Tamil population residing on both sides of the Palk Strait.” The population demanded “that the northern part of Sri Lanka and the southern part of India, having a common cultural and ethnic identity, be brought under the so-called Tamil Eelam.” However, the concept, as defined in the May 1976 Vaddukoddai resolution of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), referred only to a separate state in Sri Lanka, consisting of people of the Northern and Eastern provinces. The resolution also stated that “full and equal rights of citizenship” of Tamil Eelam would be ensured to “all Tamil speaking people living in any part of Ceylon [Sri Lanka] and to Tamils of Eelam origin living in any part of the world who may opt” for the citizenship. Mukherjee observed that the LTTE had the “tacit support” of Tamil Nadu government. After the DMK and AIADMK became principal parties, “the coastal areas of the state [sic] became a safe haven for Tamil terrorists.” The Indian government too had supported them “tacitly by overlooking the involvement of Tamil politicians in Sri Lanka’s internal matter.”  Prabhakaran extradition He recalled that as External Affairs Minister (1995-96), he raised LTTE chief V.Prabhakaran’s extradition [for facing trial in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi] with then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga during the bilateral talks in New Delhi in 1995. “We received the cryptic response by the Sri Lankan side that perhaps, Prabhakaran would not be captured alive, but would be killed before he surrenders,” he said. He brought about a “change in our policy,” by which “India would like to support the anti-terror measures initiated by the Sri Lankan government”. Though the book did not refer to his role in the final phase of the civil war that came to an end in May 2009, the author referred to his meetings with then President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2010 and thereafter. Once, his meeting with Mr. Rajapaksa in Colombo began at midnight and ended in the early hours of the next day. During this, he discussed the anti-terror operations along with steps to “implement the 13th Amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution [envisaging autonomy to provincial councils], initiated by Rajiv Gandhi, to arrive at a political settlement between the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese.” On his return to India, Mukherjee stopped at Chennai and briefed then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi of the outcome of the meeting.

A violator has to face the consequences if any law is violated, it said, hearing a case against the construction of a fish landing centre of the Fisheries Department at Singithurai in Thoothukudi. The report of a joint committee, which was submitted to the NGT, pointed to the violations in the construction of the fish landing centre in the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) area without the necessary clearance under the CRZ Notification, 2011, and also in the laying of a concrete road, which was prohibited in the location. The Thoothukudi Collector submitted that the construction of the fish landing centre was not a prohibited activity, and the site was under CRZ-II. “ The question is whether prior CRZ clearance has been obtained under the CRZ Notification, 2011, for the construction of the fish landing centre, and the committee’s report will go to show that it was constructed without the necessary clearance under the CRZ Notification, 2011,” the Bench said. It directed the State Coastal Zone Management Authority to submit an action-taken report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-is-not-above-the-law-says-ngt/article33541067.ece

10 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||City getting ready for flyover works||The city is getting ready for flyovers at Ukkadam and on Trichy Road, Mettupalayam Road, and Avinashi Road. Works are also on to start widening of Sathyamangalam Road. With efforts on to complete the works at the earliest, the existing roads on these stretches are seeing a few changes. The State Highways Department is laying concrete on the paved shoulders from Lakshmi Mills junction to Nava India on either side of Avinashi Road. This is to have more space for vehicles when the flyover works start, said an official of the Department. In Peelamedu, the existing footpath may have to be removed to provide additional space for vehicles. There will be just single lane space on either side of the road when pillar works start. Hence, it was decided to create additional space on the road side as a temporary measure. Construction work will start near Uppilipalayam after getting the consent of the District Collector, the official said. Ukkadam flyover Regarding the Ukkadam flyover, an official said that the flyover extension work will start after Pongal. The work agreement will be signed shortly. Most of the decks have been constructed for the flyover till Karumbukadai and the remaining will be completed soon, the official said. Sathyamangalam Road The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to take up widening of Sathyamangalam Road till Karnataka border. The Detailed Project Report is under preparation and it is likely to be completed by the end of this year, said an official. The plan is to widen the two-lane road into a four-lane one. D. Prabhu, an activist, said the stretch has more than 1,000 trees that are very old. Those that can be replanted should be done so in other locations. If the trees are to be cut, the NHAI should ensure that saplings are planted according to the norms. "This is one of the oldest roads and has several trees. Hence, saplings should be planted for every tree cut for the road project," he said. The statue of freedom fighter Thyagi N.G. Ramasamy, located at Sungam junction, was removed on Saturday to facilitate construction of flyover on Tiruchi Road. An official said the location to place the statue will be decided by the District Road Safety Committee when the flyover is constructed. The statue is currently in the custody of The Coimbatore District Textile Workers Union, affiliated to HMS. There will be no traffic diversion when the flyover is constructed at Sungam and Ramanathapuram junctions. Vehicles will be able to use the existing road. When the flyover is constructed at Ramanathapuram junction there will be a roundabout in the existing road for easier movement of vehicles. More than 70% of the flyover works are over and it will be open for vehicle movement in a few months, the official said. ‘No damage to flyover’ A department official clarified that a video circulated on social media, showing a damaged portion of the flyover that poses threat to motorists, was not that of Gandhipuram flyover. The colours of the paint used and the shape of the flyover are not that of Gandhipuram. There is no damage to the Gandhipuram flyover, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-getting-ready-for-flyover-works/article33541109.ece

10 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||New fruit fly named after Siruvani||A new species of fruit fly discovered in Coimbatore district is named after Siruvani, an ecological hotspot in the Western Ghats. The fruit fly Euphranta siruvani , of the family Tephritidae, was identified by researchers in a non-forest area near Siruvani. The discovery has recently been published in Zootaxa , a peer-reviewed journal. According to the authors, 104 known species of the genus Euphranta are distributed across the world, of which 14 are found in India. The discovery of Euphranta siruvani is the new addition to the list. This fruit fly is differentiated from the other species of Euphranta by the presence of a ‘V’ shaped black band on the wing and prominent subapical band connected to the apical black patch, says the paper authored by K.J. David and K. Sachin of the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources, Bengaluru; D.L. Hancock from the United Kingdom, Sudhir Singh of the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, and H. Sankararaman of Annamalai University. “It lays eggs in fruits, and the larvae feed on the pulp. We are yet to have more insights into the biology of the species,” said Mr. Sankararaman. Apart from the fruit fly, Prof. S. Manickavasagam, also of Annamalai University, along with Mr. Sankararaman, discovered a new fairyfly species in the Siruvani area. This discovery has recently been published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa . The fairyfly feeds on eggs laid by plant feeders like hoppers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-fruit-fly-named-after-siruvani/article33541085.ece
10 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Siruvani hills identified as butterfly super-hotspot||A six-year study conducted by The Nature and Butterfly Society (TNBS) has identified Siruvani hills in Coimbatore district as a butterfly super-hotspot. Members of TNBS documented 240 (74%) out of 325 butterfly species found in T.N. from Siruvani hills between March 2015 and December 2020. As per a methodology formulated by TNBS, a place can be defined as a hotspot if 25% (75 species and above) of the State checklist species (325) are found in a single area. The report submitted by TNBS to District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh has recommended the Department to declare Siruvani hills as a butterfly hotspot. According to Mr. Venkatesh, the findings of the study highlights the rich biodiversity of the region. “Butterfly presence indicates a healthy ecosystem and can act as a measure of the overall eco-system. Documenting 240 species from a small area confirms the super richness of the butterfly availability in Siruvani hills,” said A. Pavendhan from TNBS. The 240 butterflies are from six families — Swallowtails (17), Whites and Yellows (28), Brush-footed Butterflies (72), Blues (69), Metalmarks (1) and Skippers (53). Noted species recorded from the hills, which falls within the limits of Boluvampatti forest range of Coimbatore Forest Division, are Malabar Banded Peacock and Malabar Rose from the higher elevations and Nilgiri Grass Yellow from the mid-elevation. The Brush-footed butterflies families are the most dominant here and rare sightings include Nilgiri Tiger, Malabar Tree Nymph, Tawny Rajah and Tamil Catseye, says the report. Many-tailed Oakblue, a tiny butterfly with flashing blue inner wings is an iconic representation of Siruvani hills which is a mix of dry deciduous forest, moist deciduous forest and tropical evergreen forest lower to higher altitudes. As per the report, rare butterflies from the Blues family such as Abnormal Silverline, Shiva Sunbeam, Large 4-lineblue, Dark Ceylon 6-lineblue, Kanara Oakblue, Common Onyx and Malabar Flash are seen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/siruvani-hills-identified-as-butterfly-super-hotspot/article33541093.ece
10 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Drinking water project will help save water’||The volume of water that was going waste and unaccounted for in the 60 wards of old city will come down once the Coimbatore Corporation commissioned the 24x7 drinking water distribution improvement project, said P. Gopalakrishnan, Team Leader of the company that monitors the project implementation, at a talk organised on Saturday as a part of the 13th edition of Coimbatore Vizha. In the run up to implementing the project, which was around five years ago, a study showed that the city received 200 million litres a day or around 150 litres a person a day. This was more than the 135 litres a person a day norm that the Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation had recommended. The study also showed that there were several pockets in the city where people received water once in a week or 10 days that too only for a few hours a day. In short, there was a noticeable difference between the water that the Corporation drew and distributed to the city’s 13 -15 lakh population even though the infrastructure was designed for more than the quantity of water that the Corporation supplied, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said and attributed the problems to intermittent water supply. When the Corporation or any other local body for that matter supplied water once in a few days and that too for a few hours, the quantity of water wasted was more as people tend to dispose of old water for new water, delayed leak detection and rectification system among others. Besides, the intermittent water supply was more at the convenience of the local body than the public, the beneficiaries. It was to rectify all those that the Corporation implemented in the 24x7 drinking water distribution improvement project and chose Suez Projects Pvt. Ltd. because the company fit the criteria of working on water supply and maintenance project with at least 50,000 house connections. Once the Corporation commissioned the project, there would be noticeable improvement in water supply as people would get water 24 hours a day, reduction in unaccounted for water and wastage. The reduction in volume of unaccounted water would also help the Corporation improve on its revenue through water charges, he said. As for the Corporation’s contract with Suez Projects Pvt. Ltd., he said it was one of a kind project where the company would stay invested in the project for 21 long years – the maintenance period. It was during the 21 years that the company would recover its investment – 20% of the capital expenditure. Therefore, the city would not face the problems that a few other cities had faced where the project collapses after the implementing agency exits. Clarifying that it would only be the Corporation that granted water connection and fixed water charges, he added that the project contract was available online for anybody to have their doubts quelled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drinking-water-project-will-help-save-water/article33541104.ece

Meanwhile, 20 school students received devices including smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers under the ‘Gift a Device’ initiative on Saturday. The distribution event was held at the Cosmopolitan Club after the flagging off of the bike road show, the organisers said. The initiative aims at collecting used devices and distributing them to underprivileged children to help them continue their online classes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/road-show-held-as-part-of-coimbatore-vizha/article33541110.ece

10 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Garment exporters seek higher prices||Garment exporters in Tiruppur have appealed to their buyers to increase the prices for the products, especially those made of organic cotton. In a letter to the brands, president of Tiruppur Exporters' Association Raja Shanmugham said the brands had supported the suppliers to come out of the impact of COVID-19. But, the exporters still faced several challenges such as high yarn price and increase in rates for accessories and job working charges. Freight costs have shot up 15 % to 20 %. Further, there is a steep hike in prices of organic cotton yarn in recent months to the extent of 30 %. “This has totally impacted the organic garment exporting units and these units are no way in a position to absorb the price hike. It is apparently clear that they could not continue to export organic garments with the same price to niche markets,” he said. Mr. Shanmugham appealed to the brands to understand the issues faced by the garment suppliers and urged them to increase the prices for the products they procured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/garment-exporters-seek-higher-prices/article33541100.ece

In a petition sent to the Chief Minister, the members said that as many as 1,045 water bodies were included under the scheme to receive water. But, 25 water bodies in Sipcot areas, Perundurai Town Panchayat and villages in panchayats of Ingur, Varapalayam, Kambiliyampatti, Vaipadi, Paniyampalli, Mugasi Pedariyur, Ottaparai and Vadamugam Vellode were left out. Residents and farmers in the areas have been demanding inclusion of the 25 water bodies under the scheme to solve the drinking water needs and to help recharge borewells and wells. The petition alleged that effluent discharge from the industries on Sipcot premises had contaminated the groundwater in these villages. The petition said that after repeated representations to the district administration, officials from the Public Works Department inspected these water bodies and have submitted a report to the government. The government should consider the demand of the people and take steps to include the water bodies under the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/include-more-water-bodies-under-groundwater-recharge-project/article33541215.ece

Nagar on Chennimalai Road was witnessing frequent traffic congestion, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Erode South District unit has urged the State government to widen the underpass. In a petition submitted to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami during his visit to Erode on Thursday, the Party’s district general secretary K. Gunasekaran said that the underpass was constructed 52 years ago and was located on the road that leads to Vellode and Chennimalai. Since educational institutions, and commercial establishments have come up in large numbers, the stretch remained busy whole day. The road also connected the Erode Outer Ring Road. Since the underpass is narrow, only a four-wheeler can pass through it from one direction at a given point of time resulting in vehicles piling up on both sides. The underpass turns chaotic during peak hours. The petition urged the government to widen the underpass at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/call-to-widen-railway-underpass-at-kk-nagar/article33541214.ece

10 January 2021||Kanniyakumari,TAMIL NADU||61 shops destroyed in fire||At least 61 shops along Beach Road situated behind Sri Bhagavathi Amman Temple, were destroyed here on Saturday. According to fire and rescue service officials, they received a call at around 3.45 a.m. following which fire tenders from as many as five different locations rushed to the spot. About 50 firefighters and water tankers were pressed in the service. After battling for almost four hours, the fire was put out by the fire fighters. Preliminary inquiries revealed that a spark from a shop behind Gandhi Mandapam had led to the fire. Whether it was an electricity leak or due to some other reason, was being investigated. A few LPG refills in an eatery outlet went up in flames. The shopkeepers, who rushed to the spot on hearing the news were in a state of shock. Though some of them attempted to save their goods, most of it had gutted. The shops included temporary and permanent structures. Only about 45 days ago, the shops were opened after a 10 month lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from toys and cosmetics, they also sold fancy goods. Many had borrowed money from financiers and procured goods for Pongal sale. Collector M. Arvind visited the spot and enquired with the shopkeepers and ordered officials to examine the modalities. He assured the people that the district administration would help them as per the law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/61-shops-gutted-in-kanniyakumari/article33541184.ece
10 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Bull tamers throng registration centres at three venues in Madurai||Bull tamers thronged the Panchayat Union Primary Schools at Avaniapuram, Alanganallur and Palamedu on Saturday to register themselves for the jallikattu events scheduled during the Pongal festival. Jallikattu will be held at Avaniapuram on January 14, Palamedu on January 15 and Alanganallur on January 16, by ensuring compliance with COVID-19 safety norms. The bull tamers started queuing up at the registration centres from the early hours of Saturday. A revenue official said that circles were drawn inside the schools to ensure compliance of personal distancing norms. Bull tamers aged between 18 and 40 were allowed for registration. They had to undergo basic medical check-up and were registered only if they were declared medically fit by the health officials. Out of the total 431 applications received at Avaniapuram, 430 were deemed to be medically fit. At Palamedu, 699 applications were received, but only 651 were medically fit. Out of the 683 applications received at Alanganallur, 655 were declared fit. There has been a fall in the number of applications received this year as compared to the previous years, said the revenue official. “The district administration conducted registration for all the three venues on the same day to avoid crowding of bull tamers. This could be a reason for a fall in the number of applications,” he added. As per the Government Order, RT-PCR tests would be conducted for those participating in Avaniapuram on January 10 and 11; Palamedu on January 11 and 12; and Alanganallur on January 12 and 13. “However, testing negative for RT-PCR tests alone would not guarantee the players to enter the arena. The players will be subjected to another medical check-up before the event. They will be screened to ensure that they are not under the influence of alcohol,” he said. Speaking to The Hindu, Collector T. Anbalagan said that as per the G.O., a maximum of 300 players could participate at a time in jallikattu. “But we will permit only 75 players in a single batch while following COVID-19 safety precautions,” he said. The bull tamers have to wear face masks while they are playing in the arena, he added. P. Ranjith, a bull tamer, said that it would be suffocating for bull tamers to wear face masks while playing. “There is still a lack of clarity regarding the rules to be followed during the event. The officials must clarify the doubts of bull owners and players,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bull-tamers-throng-registration-centres-at-three-venues-in-madurai/article33541412.ece
10 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Airport runway extension with underpass on the cards||Airports Authority of India (AAI) has given in-principle approval for extension of runway of Madurai airport with an underpass for road traffic on Ring Road, said its Executive Director (Engineering – Southern Region) Sanjeev Jindal. After inspecting on-going civil works at Madurai airport, Mr. Jindal said the proposal to have an underpass, which was earlier rejected by the AAI, was under consideration again. “We have a similar underpass in Delhi and it has been considered for Mysuru airport also,” he said. Probably, it was rejected earlier for Madurai airport due to high construction cost. “In the present situation, it seems economical and convenient, though few approvals needed to be got from Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Environment,” he said. “Probably, then it was thought that there was no need to spend huge money. Now, we feel Madurai airport has got good potential and the investment could be earned back,” he said. While the underpass would be constructed by the State government and other works would be taken up by the AAI. Extension of the runway for 1.2 km would help in handling wide-bodied aircraft, he added. The cost is likely to be around Rs. 800 crore. Mr. Jindal said a new Air Traffic Control Tower-cum-Technical block would come up at a cost of Rs. 100 crore. The work was likely to be taken up soon and would be completed in one year. “The present ATC tower was designed for fewer movements of aircraft. The new tower will be able to handle more aircraft. The controllers can have three dimensional view from the tower and it will have all advanced air navigational equipment. It will improve safety and capacity of the airport,” he added. The AAI is also planning to increase the capacity of the terminal building. It will increase the present peak hour capacity from 700 passengers to 2,600 passengers. The work would be taken up by September at a cost of Rs. 300 crore. The terminal building area would be increased three-fold. “As per the masterplan, we will have three terminal buildings,” Mr. Jindal said. The Airport has recently increased the aircraft parking facility to seven with two helipads. Madurai airport was generating 750 KVA solar power whereas its usage was only 1,000 KVA. “We propose to increase the solar power plant capacity to 3.5 MW,” he said. General Manager (Electrical) Prem Prasad and General Manager (Civil) A. S. Mahesha and Airport Director S. Senthil Valavan were present.  Busy days ahead  1.2 km extension of runway, costing Rs. 800 crore, will help handle wide-bodied aircraft  New Air Traffic Control Tower-cum-Technical block will come up at a cost of Rs. 100 crore Solar power plant capacity to be increased from 750 KVA 3.5 MW||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/airport-runway-extension-with-underpass-on-the-cards/article33541202.ece
10 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Pay costs to Government Observation Home: HC||While ordering the authorities to release vehicles seized in connection with illegal transport of rice and sand, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the petitioners or owners, who had undertaken to pay non-refundable costs, to pay the money to the Government Observation Home in Madurai, for the welfare of the inmates. Passing the orders in separate petitions, Justice G.R. Swaminathan directed that the money that ranged from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000 be paid in favour of the Superintendent of the Government Observation Home, who can spend it for the institution or for the welfare of the inmates or towards rehabilitation of former inmates. The court directed the Superintendent to submit a report to the Registrar (Administration) of the High Court Bench indicating the exact deployment of the funds, along with bills and other relevant documents. The Chairman of the Juvenile Justice Board in Madurai should oversee the process till the end use, the judge observed. Taking note of the fact that the vehicles in custody were not produced before the jurisdictional court concerned, the court observed that it had time and again held that keeping the vehicles in custody of the authorities was not going to serve any purpose. It will contribute to the loss of value. Though criminal cases were registered, the vehicles in question were yet to be produced before the jurisdictional court and the cases were still under investigation. The court directed the petitioners or owners not to alienate or encumber the vehicles, till the proceedings were completed. The petitioners have to produce the vehicles in question before the authorities concerned as and when called for inquiry and should cooperate in the inquiry, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pay-costs-to-government-observation-home-hc/article33541414.ece
10 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Include Tamil in recruitment exam of Postal Department’||Su. Venkatesan, Madurai MP, has flayed the Centre for not including Tamil in the medium of examination for recruitment in the Department of Posts. In a letter addressed to Union Minister for Communication Ravi Shankar Prasad, he said the move contravened the earlier declaration of the Central government that examinations for recruitment in the Department of Posts would be conducted in regional languages, including Tamil. Regional languages have been omitted in the recruitment notification, though it was announced on July 16, 2019 on the floor of Parliament. “This announcement was made following stiff opposition from MPs against the earlier decision of conducting tests only in English and Hindi for the recruitment of postmen. Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad had intervened on this issue and assured that such examinations will be conducted in regional languages,” Mr. Venkatesan said. Consequently, the notification issued earlier was annulled for the issuance of a fresh one. The same stance was confirmed by the Union government before the Madras High Court when the case came up for hearing on July 30, 2019. ‘Only Hindi, English’ But the Department of Posts has issued a notification for the examination scheduled on February 14 and the choices of the medium is confined to Hindi and English. This would affect candidates from Tamil Nadu. Such a notification was unfair and against the declaration made by the Minister in the Parliament and assurance given in the High Court of Madras, he said. The MP urged the Minister to issue a fresh notification or corrigendum at the earliest with inclusion of Tamil as a medium of examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/include-tamil-in-recruitment-exam-of-postal-department/article33541410.ece
10 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Hospital performs complicated surgery on infant||Doctors at Preethi Hospital successfully performed a single stage surgery for a two-month-old infant who had two different congenital anomalies in liver and intestines. Hospital Chairman R. Sivakumar, Managing Director Hema Sivakumar and the team of doctors that performed the surgery, addressed the mediapersons on Saturday. P. Praveen, paediatric surgeon who led the team that performed the surgery, said that the infant was born in Dindigul and since birth had symptoms of jaundice like yellow-coloured eyes and dark-coloured urine. When the infant continued to have these symptoms even after two weeks after birth, the parents consulted a paediatrician in Dindigul, and then the patient was referred to Preethi Hospital. An examination showed that the tract which was supposed to drain the bile from the liver into the intestines was not formed inside the infant. “As a result, the bile accumulated inside the liver which drained into the blood, causing jaundice,” said Dr. Praveen. When the doctors started the surgery, it was found that the small and large intestines were misplaced - an anomaly known as malrotation. “Hence, a single stage surgery was performed to rectify both the anomalies. After the surgery, the infant started excreting in a healthy manner. As the infant’s condition improved, she was discharged on Saturday,” he said. The occurrence of these two malformations was rare among infants. The surgery was performed by paediatricians Dhanya and Paramaguru and intensivists Balaji and Suresh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hospital-performs-complicated-surgery-on-infant/article33541415.ece

A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi sought to know the action taken so far, pursuant to the court’s direction to remove encroachments and restore the habitat. The case was adjourned by two weeks. The contempt petition was filed by S. Pandi from Theni district who had filed the original public interest litigation petition in 2017. He had sought a direction to the authorities concerned to restore the wildlife habitat in Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary and remove encroachments. In 2018, the court had directed the authorities concerned to take appropriate action to remove all encroachments by following due process and the entire exercise had to be completed in eight weeks. However, the authorities failed to remove the encroachments, he complained. He said contempt proceedings must be initiated against the officials for failing to comply with the order of the court. During the course of the hearing, the State informed the court that the encroachers were identified and notices served on them. The State sought additional time to file a detailed response in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-details-of-steps-taken-to-remove-encroachments/article33541191.ece
10 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Parents are in favour of reopening schools: CEO||There is an overwhelming response from parents across schools in Madurai district in favour of reopening schools for Classes 10 and 12 after the Pongal holidays, said Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan. Based on the State government’s instructions, schools in the district held consultation meetings with parents and members of Parent-Teacher Associations to discuss the feasibility of reopening schools for Classes 10 and 12 after the end of Pongal holidays. Mr. Swaminathan said that out of 539 high and higher secondary schools in the district, most of the schools have said that the parents support the reopening of the schools. The government had also released a detailed Standard Operating Procedure covering safety precautions to be followed on campus and in hostels for the students if schools are to reopen for Classes 10 and 12. R. Murugeswari, Headmistress of Kasthuribai Gandhi Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School, said that most parents were in favour of reopening schools for Classes 10 and 12 as it will help the students to prepare better for the board examinations scheduled for this year. “In this academic year, online classes were held for students, which is no replacement for the physical classes. Only if students attend the schools, will they be able to clarify their doubts and understand the subjects better,” she added. Although the government has said that board examinations would be conducted this year, lack of clarity on reduction in syllabus poses a major problem, said M. Arumugam, president of Federation of Private School Associations. The financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown has forced many students, especially boys, to take up odd jobs to support their families, said A.K. Suresh, Principal of Government Higher Secondary School, Pothumbu. “In some cases, parents arrange marriage for the girl children. So, reopening of schools is important to ensure that students focus on their academics,” he added. On shifts Mr. Arumugam said that some parents asked the school managements to conduct physical classes for Classes 10 and 12 on a shift basis to ensure that COVID-19 safety precautions were followed. “But conducting classes in separate shifts would not be financially viable for the schools,” he said.

10 January 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Honour killings are on the rise in State: NGO||Nine honour killings, in eight incidents, had been reported in the State during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were five murders and four suicides, said A. Kathir, executive director of Evidence, Madurai-based non-governmental organisation. Speaking to reporters here on Friday, he said the government had done nothing tangible to discourage these offences and stood as a mute spectator, in contravention of broad guidelines laid out by the Supreme Court in March 2018. A fact-finding team visited a village in Karur district where Hariharan, 23, was brutally murdered by a 12-member gang on January 6. The boy from a barber community and the girl from an intermediate caste were in love for three years. Family members of the girl had summoned the boy and his father and threatened them with dire consequences. The girl had subsequently called Hariharan’s mother and told her that she would marry her son. While the police arrested only five accused till Thursday, the remaining suspects figuring in the complaint must be arrested, Mr. Kathir said. The State government should give Rs. 25 lakh as compensation to Hariharan’s family. The police should be directed to oppose bail applications and the government should strengthen security for inter-caste or inter community couples who lived in constant threat. The Centre should frame stringent laws against offenders and implement them across the country, which alone would prevent the rise in honour killings, Mr. Kathir said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/honour-killings-on-the-rise-ngo/article33541408.ece

The association demanded waiver of all crop loans sanctioned by cooperative societies and nationalised banks without any condition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/demand-for-repeal-of-farm-laws/article33541174.ece
10 January 2021||NAMAKKAL,TAMIL NADU||‘Prevent misinformation on bird flu’||The regional unit of the National Egg Coordinating Committee and Broilers Coordinating Committee has requested the Centre to take necessary measures to prevent misinformation on avian flu since it has affected the price of eggs and broiler chickens here. P. Selvaraj, regional chairman of NECC, requested the Central and State governments to prevent misinformation as it had led to panic among the public, and a fall in prices and consumption. Mr. Selvaraj said in a release that though avian flu had been reported 25 times since 2006 in India, no spread to humans had been reported. Misconceptions led to the prices of eggs and broiler chickens dropping below the production cost. In the past one week, the price had dropped by Re.1 and its severely affecting farmers here, he said. Mr. Selvaraj said that all farms in Namakkal were taking necessary precautionary measures and no case had been reported till date. The supply to Kerala, one of the major markets for Namakkal poultry sector, had dropped by 15% due to the recent outbreak in Kerala, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prevent-misinformation-on-bird-flu/article33541118.ece
10 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Agitation against Lt. Governor enters 2nd day in Puducherry||As the agitation demanding the recall of the Lt. Governor entered the second day on Saturday, VCK leader and Member of Parliament Thol Thirumavalavan and Secretary of CPI R. Mutharasan visited the protest venue to express their solidarity. Addressing the gathering, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the conduct of Ms. Bedi had proved his party right in demanding abolition of the post of Governors and Lt. Governors. When the people have bestowed the right for legislation to the elected representatives, there was no necessity to have such posts. Ms. Bedi was part of the India Against Corruption movement which staged an agitation against graft when the UPA was in power. The movement claimed to have no political affiliations but soon after the agitation, Ms. Bedi joined the BJP and contested the elections in New Delhi. Since her appointment as Lt. Governor, Ms. Bedi was trying to fulfil the BJP’s agenda, he said. CPI secretary R. Mutharasan said the agitation should not be considered as a movement to protect the rights of people in the Union Territory alone, but to defend democracy and Constitution. The attempt to destroy democracy should be thwarted at any cost, he said. Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Minister K. Lakshminarayanan said since Ms. Bedi was appointed as the Lt. Governor, her only aim was to create obstacles to the programmes of the government. She had never shown any respect to the elected government and the Legislative Assembly, he charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/agitation-against-lt-governor-enters-2nd-day-in-puducherry/article33541065.ece
10 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Congress values its partnership with DMK, says AICC secretary||Reacting to the absence of DMK from the day-and-night agitation called by the Secular Democratic Alliance (SDA) demanding the recall of Lt Governor Kiran Bedi, AICC secretary Sanjay Dutt said the Congress party always valued the alliance with the DMK and the top leadership of both the parties had an excellent bond. “Maybe the local leadership of DMK has some very minor issues. These are pinpricks and will be sorted out in the long run.. The Chief Minister is already talking to resolve the issues,” he told The Hindu . Further elaborating, the AICC leader said DMK President M.K. Stalin had an excellent bond with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. “Our fight is with communal forces. Mr. Stalin is aware of the friendship between the principal Opposition party AINRC and BJP. I am confident of sorting out those minor issues,” he said. On the agitation, the Congress leader said the party and members of the SDA were left with no other option other than hitting the streets against the Lt. Governor because her unconstitutional ways of functioning had taken away the rights of people. “The basic premise in the Constitutional scheme of things was that when there is an Assembly, the will of the people matters. The elected representatives express the will of people,” he said. “When you thwart the decisions of the Assembly and Cabinet, you are hitting at the roots of democracy. One could understand if the Lt. Governor has differences on some decisions. Here all the major decisions of the cabinet are either rejected, referred to the Centre or delayed which raises apprehensions,” the AICC leader said. Mr. Dutt said it was ironic that neighbouring Tamil Nadu could distribute rice to ration cardholders but not in the Union Territory due to the objection of Lt. Governor. “People will start questioning the necessity of having an Assembly and elections. So, these things give an impression that the BJP was using the Lt. Governor for a long-term agenda. Maybe they wanted to merge Puducherry with Tamil Nadu or make the territory without an Assembly. There is a precedence to it. The State of Jammu and Kashmir was split and downgraded as Union Territories with and without an Assembly. Under the BJP, it could happen to Puducherry as well,” he said.  “Maybe the local leadership of DMK has some very minor issues. These are pinpricks and will be sorted out in the long run.. The Chief Minister is already talking to resolve the issues||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-values-its-partnership-with-dmk-aicc-secretary/article33541066.ece

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Saminathan said whenever the situation demanded for the ruling establishment they resorted to such agitations. He questioned the right of Congress to launch an agitation without delivering on its electoral promises. The four-day agitation by the Congress had caused much inconvenience to the public, he added.

Elected in December 2019, he has uploaded the comprehensive accounts of the panchayat on the Facebook page. The panchayat comprises Sevinipatti, Chandranpatti, Kallankuthu and Pottapatti villages. Mr. Sevar Kodiyon had returned to his native from Singapore where he was working after completing his engineering degree in computer science. As he was interested in agriculture, he came back to his native place. Back home, he pursued farming with passion and using technology, he turned his land profitable. According to the villagers, he would help the needy whenever they approached him. Many youngsters have taken his suggestions on pursuing academic courses which would be useful in getting more opportunities in employment. When elections were held, Mr. Sevar Kodiyon won hands down and set the agenda to deliver the requirements to the people in the panchayat. An official said that he would insist on transparency in administration and wanted them to practice by involving the people whenever public money was spent. Be it laying roads or providing infrastructure such as anganwadi centre, he involved the people. With his first year in office ending last month, Mr. Sevar Kodiyon has released the progress card and the one year’s accounts for public view. This has come in for appreciation in the social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/this-panchayat-president-sets-trend-in-transparency/article33541418.ece

Nadda will be inaugurating the ‘Namma Ooru Pongal’ celebrations in Tiruvallur district on January 14, said State president L. Murugan here on Saturday. He was participating in the Pongal celebrations in Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga, in which senior leaders H. Raja and others addressed. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Murugan said, “the idea of ‘Namma Ooru Pongal’ came about so that we could be part of the festival with people across Tamil Nadu. Thanking the deity of harvest has been the practice and tradition of the Tamils. The BJP wholeheartedly extends its support to the welfare of the farmers.” The BJP’s poll manifesto would be a people’s manifesto. “A team headed by Mr. Raja would tour the State and prepare a comprehensive document”, he said. Tamil Nadu, he claimed, was the highest beneficiary in getting Central assistance in welfare projects for the farmers and other sectors since the BJP came to power. Every household in the Below Poverty Line category had received the benefits directly from the Centre in their bank accounts. The DMK, he said, was bent upon creating confusion among the people. When they (UPA) were in power, with their ally Congress, the then Central government had mentioned the need for amending the agriculture laws. “Now, conveniently they had forgotten it and were attacking the Union government. Is it fair?”, he asked and wanted the people to think about it carefully.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nadda-to-inaugurate-pongal-celebrations-in-tiruvallur-district-on-january-14/article33541200.ece

10 January 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||Residents welcome initiative of ‘village vigilance police officers’||The concept of Village Vigilance Police Officers (VVPOs) has started gaining momentum in hamlets, said Inspector General of Police (south zone) S. Murugan here on Friday. The IGP, who visited Thimmarasanayakanoor and Koduvilaarpatti villages, interacted with the public about the initiative and said that it was a step closer to the people. He introduced the VVPO Vivekanandam (a police constable, who would be responsible for the hamlet) at the meeting. In a brief interaction, Mr Murugan said that the initiative would be useful to senior citizens as they would not have to travel long to reach the police stations for any issues regarding their hamlets. The VVPO would have a WhatsApp group in which he may add teachers, village panchayat members and among others. From the police perspective, he said that the VVPO’s presence would help prevent crime, which may otherwise snowball into a major incident. Incidents of eve-teasing complaints or a drunken brawl can all be handled locally if the local people share information with the VVPO. Welcoming the VVPO, the villagers offered shawls and garlanded him in the presence of the senior officers. In Koduvilaarpatti, the women thanked the police for establishing the concept, since the police station was a little far away. Moreover, the presence of a man in khaki may discourage the offenders from indulging in crimes, they added. Superintendent of Police Sai Charan Tejaswi said that the VVPO was a kind of mini-police station for the villagers. Apart from sharing information with the VVPO, the residents can also be in touch with the officers at the station or sub-division levels. The idea was to share an issue early and solve it amicably as soon as possible. There were 146 mother villages identified in the district, which would have a VVPO from the nearest station. Thus, the officers appealed to the people to make use of the opportunity, which had been conceptualised towards prevention of crime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-welcome-initiative-of-village-vigilance-police-officers/article33541193.ece
10 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Increase in steel price hits construction industry hard||The rise in prices of steel has hit the construction industry hard. Expenditure on steel constitutes about 15% of any construction project. In projects such as construction of bridges, it goes up to 20% to 25%. Stability in prices of steels is an important factor in signing government or private projects. But, the way in which steel prices are moving upward in recent months has come a rude shock to the builders and contractors. Though the prices are going up constantly in recent years, the period from June to December has seen sharp increase. The retail price of a tonne of steel (medium ranged brands) was quoted as Rs. 64,000 in Tiruchi in the first week of January. It was Rs. 42,000 in June. The price has gone up by Rs. 22,000 within 6 months and almost doubled in a year. The rate of steels marketed by top rated steel companies was hovering around Rs. 69,000 a tonne in retail markets in Tiruchi. It was around Rs. 49,000 in June. A builder in Tiruchi, who bought 50 tonne of steel at Rs. 52,000 a tonne on December 30, had to pay Rs. 64,000 a tonne on January 5, a rise of Rs. 12,000 within a week. “It is unprecedented. It has dealt a severe blow to the builders and contractors irrespective of the volume of projects,” I. Shajahan, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India, Tiruchi. Ravichandran, a leading flat promoter in Tiruchi, said that the builders were bewildered on completing the agreed projects. Except a few well-established builders and contractors, others were in perilous situation as they could not complete the projects with the agreed rates. “We consider the sharp increase in prices as a double blow to the construction industry, which is still struggling to come to terms due to the impact of COVID-19. Dealers predict that the prices of steel are likely to go up further in the weeks to come,” Mr. Ravichandran said. Mr. Shajahan said that there had been no clarity on the reasons that led to the price rise. It had been taken to the notices of the Central and State governments. They should take steps to stabilise the price immediately, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/steel-price-rise-hits-construction-industry-hard/article33541178.ece

A decision to this effect was conveyed to a group of cattle rearers by senior officers led by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) on Friday. A meeting with cattle rearers was held at the behest of the City Police Commissioner J.Loganathan to discuss measures to check accidents and obstructions caused by stray cattle. In a statement issued later in the day, the police said the cattle owners were briefed on measures to be taken to check accidents. They were requested to ensure that all their cattle heads were kept inside confines of their residential premises and not let them out on the streets. They would be held responsible and booked if their cattle heads caused accidents leading to loss of lives or limbs for road users. While asking them to cooperate, the police told them that if they failed to adhere to the directive, the cattle would be impounded and legal action would be initiated against them. The initiative has been welcomed by residents, many of whom have been complaining about stray cattle menace. “It is a welcome move to hold such a meeting and come out with such decisions. All these years, the issue has been highlighted by residents and the media only to get knee jerk reaction from the corporation. It is commendable that the police have acted in the interest of road safety,” K.C.Neelamegam, a city resident and State Advisor of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam, said. Even a few days ago, he said, a professor of a city college sustained injuries after a bovine strayed on to the road unexpectedly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stray-cattle-owners-to-be-held-responsible-for-accidents/article33541172.ece

These are not men, but bulls, with menacingly sharp horns and great hump, getting ready to take part in the traditional ‘Eruthu Vidum Vizha’ (a bull race) in Vellore. At least 250 to 300 bulls are gathered on a village street for the race that is touted as a century-old tradition. Each bull has to run 100 metres, and the one that covers the distance in the least time will be declared the winner. However, the event this year is expected to be held in compliance with the COVID-19 standard operating procedures. Unlike in the past, when it was held for five months, the race will get over by February-end because the Assembly election is fast approaching. “The Collector has asked us to barricade the streets to prevent injuries to the spectators. Over 1,000 bulls will take part in the race across Vellore, Tirupathur and Ranipet districts. Each will be accompanied by 10 persons, and all of them will have to get a COVID-19 test done and a certificate from the tahsildar,” said N. Padmanabhan, treasurer, Eruthu Vidum Veera Vilaiyaatu Paadhukaapu Sangam, Vellore. He said the Collector had also asked the organisers to complete the race before February. “Last year too, we were through with it by February-end owing to the pandemic; this time, it will be due to the election,” he added. Owners are getting their bulls ready. “In south Tamil Nadu, jallikattu is famous and in the northern parts, it is the bull race. The race is conducted across the district from January to May usually,” says Jayaprakash of Sholavaram. He owns seven bulls. The bulls undergo training from December. The bull owners have received permission to conduct the race in 250 streets across Vellore, Ranipet and Tirupattur districts. “This year will be different for us as we have to somehow ensure physical distancing,” adds Mr. Padmanabhan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vellore-gears-up-for-annual-bull-race/article33541069.ece

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Enterprise limited: An MSME memoir||If things were bad for Tamil Nadu’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) before March 2020, the last 11 months were a nightmare. Things were going downhill after demonetisation, but a fresh crisis brewed with the lockdown imposed to curb the COVID-19 pandemic with its attendant challenges — labour shortage, financial crisis, poor order books and, more recently, the rising raw material prices. “Just as we thought things were starting to look up, the spike in raw material prices pushed the business two steps backward,” says an entrepreneur, summing up the mood of the industry. Take the case of Rajkumar, who runs a pumpset manufacturing unit with 12 workers in Coimbatore. Unforeseen challenges during the last three months have dampened his hopes of an uptick. In October 2020, his unit worked from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., turning out over 3,000 pumps a month. But now he is able to make only 1,200 pieces and not able to assign duties to workers throughout the day. “The lockdown came into effect during the end of the financial year 2019-2020. Hence, we did not have much of raw materials when we shut down the units. When we restarted operations, the orders started moving up and we bought raw materials according to our need. But now the prices of raw materials have started increasing and the actual manufacturing cost has gone up nearly 18% in the last four months,” Mr. Rajkumar said. Now, the brand to whom Mr. Rajkumar is supplying is demanding consignments at old rates and it wants to wait until the price stabilises. “There is uncertainty about the availability of raw materials, the prices are revised frequently. Hence, it is difficult to quote prices,” he said, adding that the MSMEs were slowing down production. “I have new products that I want to develop, but cannot do so now because of the investments that are needed,” says Mr. Rajkumar. While many units have cut down on capacity-utilisation, the others are continuing with normal business, but the payment cycles are fluctuating and getting delayed. K.V. Karthik, president of the Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association, said, “The market will absorb only a part of the price hike. Hence, even if an MSME unit sees a profit this fiscal, it will be very low. Not all manufacturers have cut down on capacity-utilisation yet.” In November-December 2019, there were hardly any orders. Now, big companies are giving out orders and are even asking for samples. The main problem is the input costs, adds C. Sivakumar, president of the Coimbatore and Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association. While government spending has increased in the last two months, most orders are still being quoted at the old rates. “MSMEs that are supplying to some of the public sector units suffer nearly a 30% loss,” said S. Surulivel of Railway Suppliers Association. Power cuts R.G. Chakrapani, secretary of the Thirumazhisai Industrial Estate, said raw material prices had increased by 20%-70%, eating into the entire margin of the units. He said frequent power cuts had affected production and delayed the schedule. Even as the Indian economy has started showing signs of revival, the 30%–35% increase in the prices — coupled with scarce supply of raw materials, steel products in particular — has dampened the mood and severely affected the recovery of many units, said M. Balachandran, president, Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association. Mr. Balachandran said allowing import of steel products at subsidised rates for MSMEs might help. The government should stop iron ore and steel exports till the indigenous supply stabilised and it should advise domestic steel majors to offer materials directly at steel yards operated by the SIDCO, he said. K.E. Raghunathan, convener of the Consortium of Indian Associations, said the prices of steel, aluminium, rubber and plastic had gone up 35%-45% in the last three months. He said, “The Central government seems helpless. Cartels of large-scale manufacturers are evident. Unscrupulous traders are demanding higher prices and 100% advance payment from micro and small enterprises.” Weak finances The pandemic has not only impacted the business of the thousands of MSMEs across Tamil Nadu but has also taken its toll on their finances. Many said they were rebuffed when they approached banks for help. K.V. Kanakambaram, president of the Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association, said approaching banks for money was still a tedious task for small companies. J. James, president of the Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, pointed out that micro or small units that had only current accounts with banks and did not have a loan account were unable to benefit from government schemes. “Funds flow has not streamlined after the lockdown. Even street vendors are getting financial support from the government but not the micro units,” he said. When the MSMEs resumed operations, the government did come to their aid with the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), and the market has revived after one-and-a-half years of slowdown. Workers who went home during the lockdown are beginning to return. But, owing to the lack of adequate trains, the units are being forced to spend huge sums on the return of workers. If the market trend continues and the government extends a supporting hand, the MSMEs are likely to start investing in machinery next financial year, said R. Ramamurthy, former president of the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (CODISSIA). Most of the money released under the scheme has been used to meet the high raw material prices. Hence, the amount should be increased, more trains operated and the price set by the public sector units and government departments for their orders revised, he said. CODISSIA president M.V. Ramesh Babu said the effort to form a consortium to purchase raw materials in bulk from the government organisations such as SAIL would take time. What the MSMEs wanted now was immediate measures to control prices. Range of concerns MSMEs in Chennai expressed concerns over other problems that they have been struggling with. For instance, the consent fee charged by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) for issue of approval is based on the value of the Gross Fixed Assets of the industries. They take into account the value of land and buildings, in addition to the value of the plant and machinery, to arrive at the Gross Fixed Asset. “For MSMEs that started their units on rented premises much earlier and apply now for the TNPCB’s consent, the fee percentage on the annual rental value of the building multiplied 20 times, adding up to a daunting sum payable for the permission,” Mr. Balachandran of the Ambattur Industrial Estate said. The Kerala government considered this anomaly and reduced the period to three years of rental value. “We have been requesting the TNPCB for a similar relief,” he said. Double taxation has been another concern for MSMEs. Currently, the Chennai Corporation requires MSME manufacturing units to get a trade licence. In any case, these units must obtain a factory licence from the Department of Industrial Safety and Health. The Karnataka government has done away with the trade licence for manufacturing units. “We have been requesting the withdrawal of the requirement to obtain a trade licence for MSME units engaged in manufacturing and registered themselves with the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health,” Mr. Balachandran said. ‘Govt. aware of issues’ Mangat Ram Sharma, Secretary, Tamil Nadu Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Department, said, “We are aware of the concerns of the MSME units across the State and we have been taking proactive measures. Even after the units opened after the lockdown was lifted, the government is monitoring their situation on a daily basis and near normalcy has returned,” he said. On the issue of rising raw material costs, he said the general managers of the District Industrial Centres had been instructed to help MSMEs form a consortium for bulk raw material procurement to cut down the costs. Such a consortium at Hosur, ‘Hosemech’, has reportedly been able to save on raw material costs by 5%-10%. To deal with the raw material issues in Coimbatore, the general manager, DIC, Coimbatore, was instructed to coordinate with SAIL, VIZAG Steel, SIDCO and all associations in the district. Two meetings were conducted on November 5 and December 17, 2020. “Reopening of the SAIL yard was discussed. Further, the associations have decided to form a consortium to source raw materials in bulk,” Mr. Sharma said.  “To help MSMEs get loans hassle-free under this scheme, the government has ordered exemption from the payment of stamp duty for registration of agreement relating to deposit of title deeds executed for securing loans availed from banks and financial institutions up to March 31, 2021,” Mr. Sharma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/enterprise-limited-an-msme-memoir/article33541034.ece

10 January 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Sounds of radio to come alive in Hindalga cell blocks||Inmates of the Hindalga prison in Belagavi will soon be able to listen to film songs and other entertainment programmes in their cell blocks within a few weeks. Jail authorities are introducing frequency modulation (FM) radio facilities to all the blocks that house a total of around 880 men and 20 women prisoners. A radio rebroadcast room will be built on the prison premises. It will broadcast songs and entertainment programmes during fixed hours. Speakers will be fixed inside cell blocks. All this will be completed in a few weeks, said P. Krishna Kumar, Chief Superintendent of the prison. This is being done under `Roopantara’, a rehabilitation and reformation programme for convicts. This includes psychological counselling, skill training, meditation sessions, and a general improvement in the living condition of inmates. A similar radio reception centre is successfully running in the Bengaluru central jail. “These steps are in line with the re-imagining of jails as centres of correctional administration. The modern theory of reformation of convicts recommends that the prisoner should be encouraged to introspect and change his behaviour. The basic provision of reformation theory is that any inmate should get humane treatment inside correctional centres. He should learn a skill that will help him live a life of dignity after his release. We are adopting a multi-pronged approach to this,” Mr. Kumar said. Bengaluru firm Mindtree, a technology consulting company, will provide electronic equipment to install radio facilities in the jail as part of its corporate social responsibility efforts. “We have worked with Mindtree in the past. They helped us set up a back office processing unit in the Bengaluru central jail. They also set up the radio reception centre there,” Mr. Kumar, who has served in Bengaluru in the past, said. Mr. Kumar pointed out that the vocational skill development programme has helped hundreds of Hindalga inmates to become carpenters, bakery cooks and assistants, and tailors. “Our inmates have stitched over 2.5 lakh cloth masks during the COVID-19 lockdown. They are paid wages for such work. Once they are released, they can easily earn money and live independent lives,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sounds-of-radio-to-come-alive-in-hindalga-cell-blocks/article33541227.ece

10 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Yuvraj Swamy accused of cheating retired HC judge of Rs. 8.8 crore||Yuvraj Swamy, who allegedly claimed to have ties with central political leaders and a powerful right-wing organisation, also reportedly conned a retired Karnataka High Court judge of Rs. 8.8 crore by promising to get her appointed as Governor. Yuvraj has been accused of duping many people in such a manner and taking money with assurances that he would get them plum postings and seats on government boards. The retired judge, B.S. Indrakala, a resident of Wilson Garden, deposed before the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police in December, accusing a retired Superintendent of Police (SP) of mediating their meeting and introducing her to Yuvraj. The retired judge approached the Wilson Garden police and filed a cheating case on December 21. The case was subsequently transferred to the CCB. In her deposition before the CCB, Ms. Indrakala alleged that her friend Papaiah, the retired SP, brought Yuvraj to her house in 2018. “In her statement, she said the SP introduced him as a person who was powerful in the BJP and the RSS with ties to the high command,” said a senior CCB official. Yuvraj claimed that he was well-versed in astrology and predicted that she had a bright future. He reportedly mentioned that the government was looking for a woman with the right background for a posting, and offered to recommend her name. According to Ms. Indrakala, Papaiah urged her to seize the opportunity. “She said when she confirmed that she wanted to try for the post, Yuvrajadvised her to pay some money to contribute to the party fund,” the CCB official added. To do this, she told the police, she sold a site she owned and took a loan to transfer Rs. 95 lakh to Yuvraj’s account. She also later paid huge sums of money — Rs. 3.77 crore and Rs. 4.5 crore on different occasions. The posting, however, failed to materialise. Despite repeated attempts she failed to get a response. On December 16, the police arrested Yuvraj in another case based on a complaint filed by a businessman from Bengaluru, whom he had allegedly promised a post in the Transport Department for Rs. 1 crore. During a search of his house in Nagarbhavi, the police seized Rs. 26 lakh in cash and cheques addressed to the accused amounting to Rs. 91 crore. Further investigations revealed that he had financial transactions with actor and producer Radhika and her brother Raviraj who were summoned by the CCB for questioning. With politicians As the scam came to light, photographs of the accused with a few BJP leaders and Ministers started doing the rounds on social media. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said onSaturday that he would not comment on the case as it was under investigation. “Concerned authorities will take appropriate action at the appropriate time. Posing for a photograph with someone does not amount to a crime,” he said. The police are also probing Papaiah’s role.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yuvraj-swamy-accused-of-cheating-retired-hc-judge-of-rs-88-crore/article33540965.ece
10 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State has stemmed the spread of the new strain so far: Experts||Although there was a fear that some of the missing U.K. returnees (over 120 who are yet to be traced) may be carriers of the new strain of COVID-19 and the risk of the infection spreading was high, Karnataka has so far not witnessed any significant surge or cluster formations. The Centre had stopped all flights from the U.K. on December 22 and those who landed in the State since November 25 are being traced and tested. However, even after 18 days of the last flight only 11 U.K. returnees including two of their primary contacts have tested positive for the new strain so far.  Developed immunity COVID-19 experts said the fact that no cluster formations have been reported so far indicates that the State has managed to tide over the new strain spread and is unlikely to witness a surge beyond what it has already witnessed, they said. This is mainly because nearly half the population in the State has already been exposed to COVID-19 by now and has developed immunity. Also, with the new variant circulating in the U.K. since September 2020, there is a possibility that it could have already been imported into the country and KarnatakaBut, going by the considerable decline in the number of cases in the State since October, experts say the new strain - despite being highly infectious - is unable to find dense pockets of susceptible (uninfected) people here. Giridhar R. Babu, member, State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), told The Hindu on Saturday that it could be because the threshold for population immunity has been reached in most urban areas. “It seems mostly that the new strain is unable to find dense pockets of susceptible (uninfected) people. Otherwise clusters should have occurred by now,” he said. “Also, people continuing to follow protocols has helped,” he said.  Quick isolation V. Ravi, nodal officer for genetic confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka and TAC member, said the State has managed to tide over a possible new strain surge as it was quick to isolate and treat infected U.K. returnees. “The early isolation has prevented the virus from spreading in the community. Also, probably there is substantial immunity in the population now. A second serosurvey will reveal if there is herd immunity,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, also said it is very clear that the mutant strain has not been able to find a chunk of uninfected people as nearly 50% have developed immunity. However, with flights resuming from Sunday it is too early to say that there is no fast spread of new strain in Karnataka. “But, as of now it appears to be under control,” he said. All three experts said that the State should not go slow on contact tracing and people should continue following the standard guidelines of ‘SMS’ - social distancing, masking and sanitisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-has-stemmed-the-spread-of-the-new-strain-so-far-experts/article33540971.ece

10 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||First direct flight from San Francisco to city takes off||The first ever direct flight between the two tech hubs – San Francisco and Bengaluru – seems to have been a hit in the city. The maiden trip the Air India flight will make from the city to San Francisco on Monday, is almost fully booked – 225 seats sold out of 238 – despite the pandemic and concerns over air travel. Flight AI176 departed from San Francisco at 8.30 p.m. (local time) on Saturday and is expected to land at the Kempegowda International Airport at 3.45 a.m. (local time) on Monday. Long-pending demand The flight, that had long been in the pipeline, will be the first direct non-stop flight between the West Coast of the United States of America and South India. Given the significant population of south Indians in San Francisco, home to Silicon Valley, a direct flight has been a long pending demand. This will be a biweekly flight taking off to San Francisco from Bengaluru on Mondays and Thursdays, while leaving San Francisco to the city on Tuesdays and Saturdays, every week. “The direct distance between Bengaluru and San Francisco is approximately 13,993 km and the cities are diametrically at opposite ends of the world with a time zone change of approximately 13.5 hours. The total flight time on this route will be more than 17 hours depending on the wind speed on that particular day,” a statement from Air India said. All-woman crew The flight will operate with Boeing 777-200LR aircraft VT ALG with a seating capacity of 238 seats including eight first class, 35 business class, 195 economy class seats. It will be operated by an all-woman cockpit crew led by Capt. Zoya Aggarwal, who has over 8,000 hours of flying experience. Other pilots include Capt. Papagari Thanmai, Capt. Akansha Sonaware, and Capt. Shivani Manhas. This will also be the first time an all-women crew will fly over the North Pole, adding another first to the flight. Given that Bengaluru and San Francisco are diametrically at opposite ends of the world, it will be an around-the-world flight which passes through the North Pole. “This will result in savings on flying time, fuel consumption and curbing carbon footprint. Passengers will benefit from the reduced flight duration and with less fuel consumption, the environment will have less carbon impact – making the service an economically viable option for passengers and Air India alike,” a statement from Air India said. At present, Air India operates non-stop flights from Delhi to New York, Newark, Washington DC, San Francisco, and Chicago and from Mumbai to Newark and New York. Air India also plans to start its first ever non-stop service between Hyderabad and Chicago from 15 January, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/first-direct-flight-from-san-francisco-to-city-takes-off/article33541025.ece
10 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Noise from tampered silencers causes palpitations among elderly: Residents||Police Commissioner Kamal Pant on Saturday warned that strict action would be taken against motorists and two-wheeler riders who tampered with their silencers. This comes after a barrage of complaints from residents who aired their grievances at the Sanchara Samparka Divasa held at 44 traffic police stations across the city. One of the grievances was the rising levels of noise pollution with motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, removing their silencers so that they can conduct races or perform stunts.Mr. Pant, who attended the interaction at Basaveshwaranagar, spoke to residents who complained about how it disturbs the peace and quiet in residential areas, causing fear psychosis among senior citizens and children. “Owing to this high decibel shrill noises, the aged and ailing residents get palpitations. Despite many attempts to stop the menace, it continues unabated,” said Geetha Mishra, a resident of Basaveshwaranagar. Mr. Pant directed the officials to initiate strict measures to contain the menace. However, the problem is not restricted to Basaveshwaranagar. “The only time I got some peace was during the lockdown and when the road was closed because the BBMP was undertaking some work,” said Maria Anne, who lives on Davis Road in Fraser Town. “The frequent incidents are giving me sleepless nights, and I have considered moving away from the main road owing to this menace,” she added. Senior police officials acknowledged that despite many crackdowns in the past, the problem continues. “The traffic police have carried special drives against vehicles with tampered silencers earlier, and even booked mechanics under various provisions,” said Soumyalatha S.K., DCP, Traffic (West division). The traffic police will be instructed to resume the drive and book offenders under Section 107 (security for keeping the peace and for good behaviour) of Cr.PC and get a bond of Rs. 1 lakh executed from the owner of the vehicle. Geotagging Apart from the problem of tampered silencers, residents also asked the police to get tough on those encroaching pavements and raised the issue of bad roads that lead to traffic snarls. “We will soon have special drives to tackle the issue and ensure the violations will not be repeated. We are also working to identify civil-related issues such as potholes, bad roads, and clogged drains, which will be geotagged and brought to the attention of the Chief Secretary. It will be taken up in the next fortnightly meeting with other stakeholders,” said Ms. Soumyalatha. B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner,Traffic, said, “Small residential lanes in these areas are turning into business points, which means parking problem, more traffic, and footpath encroachment. We have taken up all complaints and are chalking out plans to get amicable solution.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/noise-from-tampered-silencers-causes-palpitations-among-elderly-residents/article33540963.ece
10 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State will soon launch blindness control programme: Minister||The State will soon launch a programme for control of blindness in association with major eye hospitals in Karnataka, said Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Saturday. Speaking at a symposium on “National programme for control of blindness in the area of avoidable and preventable blindness” organised by Narayana Nethralaya in the city, the Minister said the State will also set up a committee to chalk out a policy for ophthalmological care. “The committee will be headed by K. Bhujang Shetty, chairman of Narayana Nethralaya, and recommendations will be incorporated in the State’s healthcare policy,” he said. Eye donations hit Dr. Shetty said eye donations had literally come to a halt during the first four months of the pandemic. “Although donations are picking up now, we have not managed to reach even 40% of collections during the pre-COVID-19 era. We used to collect 150 to 200 eyes every month then. Now, the collections hardly cross 40 a month,” he said. Appealing to people to come forward for eye donations, the doctor said: “We are launching a hospital-based corneal retrieval programme so that families can be counselled about donation and eyes can be retrieved at the earliest.” Eyesight lost He said many people had lost their sight during the pandemic because eye hospitals could not carry out the therapeutic graft due to lack of donations. “Many people who developed ulcers in the normal eye lost their eyesight because there were not enough eyes to do the grafting. Therapeutic grafting is important to save the sight,” Dr. Shetty added.  K. Bhujang Shetty said eye donations had literally come to a halt during the first four months of the pandemic||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-will-soon-launch-blindness-control-programme-minister/article33541021.ece

Yediyurappa and several other senior leaders of the party in the State will share stage with Mr. Shah at the rally which will see the participation of “nearly one lakh people”, BJP said. Preceding rallies The rally will be preceded by BJP “Jan Sevak” rallies in all districts of the State during January 11-13, where “gau pooje” will be conducted and recently elected gram panchayat representatives supported by the party will be felicitated. “This will be an important step towards capturing power in both taluk and zilla panchayats,” the BJP said in a statement.

In Basavakalyan The party shortlisted names of Vijay Singh, MLC and son of former Chief Minister the late N. Dharam Singh, and Mallamma, wife of deceased MLA Narayan Rao, for the Basavakalyan Legislative Assembly constituency. Rao too succumbed to COVID-19. In Maski, Congress is expected to field Basanagouda Turvihal, who switched over to Congress from the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the 2018 Assembly polls, Mr. Turvihal, who contested on BJP ticket, lost to the then Congress candidate Prathapgouda Patil by a slender margin. Mr. Patil later joined the BJP and this has necessitated bypoll. KPCC president D.K.

10 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Tejasvi Surya opposes Twitter ban on Trump||BJP’s national youth wing president L.S. Tejasvi Surya, MP from Bengaluru South, came down heavily on Twitter for suspending the account of Donald Trump, President, U.S., over alleged incitement to violence on the platform, on Saturday. He said this must be a “wake up call for all who don’t yet understand the threat to our democracies by unregulated big tech companies.” Arguing against moderation of content violative of community standards, which he termed “censorship by big tech companies”, Mr. Surya batted for suitable changes in Indian laws to prevent any “meddling of content” by social media platforms, which he said violated Constitutional guarantees to citizens. “If they can do this to POTUS [President of the USA], they can do this to anyone,” he said in a tweet. “Freedom of Expression is sacrosanct. It cannot be curtailed whimsically by private big tech companies without accountability,” he added. His tweets drew sharply polarised reactions from the Twitterati. While many argued that hate speech, fake news and incitement to violence could not be termed “freedom of expression”, right-wing Twitter handles cried foul that their views were being censored on social media platforms and some urged Mr. Surya to introduce a private member’s bill in the Parliament to regulate social media platforms. Mr. Surya batting for Mr. Trump and against any “censorship” on social media platforms comes close on the heels of another social media giant Facebook finding itself in a spot over alleged bias towards the ruling party in its content moderation. Mr. Surya said he had earlier written to the government to review the IT Intermediary Guidelines “on account of being violative of Freedom of Expression guaranteed under the Constitution”. Social media platforms are defined as intermediaries under the Indian Law. “Intermediaries aren’t like media platforms. They’re exempt from liability via Sec 79 of IT Act, which bars them from meddling with content. However, the Intermediary Guidelines are in contrast to the Act, by giving them power to censor free speech without State oversight and beyond constitutional limits,” he said. “Dissent is fundamental to democracy and the government welcomes it. But only constitutional authorities can decide on its reasonability,” he said. “Citizens decide what their opinions are & are free to express themselves. Facebook and Twitter serve as platforms of expression and shouldn’t curtail people's will,” he tweeted.  If they can do this to POTUS, they can do this to anyone. Freedom of Expression is sacrosanct. It cannot be curtailed whimsically by private big tech companies without accountability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tejasvi-surya-opposes-twitter-ban-on-trump/article33541007.ece

10 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Minister inspects arrangements for screening U.K. returnees||After a temporary ban on travel from the U.K., flight operations have resumed since Saturday and Kempegowda International Airport Ltd. (KIAL) is all set to receive the first set of passengers on Sunday morning. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who visited KIAL and reviewed the arrangements for screening of the returning passengers, said the airport authorities had informed him that all flights are coming in full capacity with 300-350 passengers in each flight. Speaking to reporters at the airport, the Minister said that all U.K. returnees have to compulsorily undergo RT-PCR tests on arrival even if they have a negative report. “They will be subjected to RT-PCR tests free of cost at the airport itself and will be sent out of the airport only after the result. Those found negative will be sent home and those positive will be kept in institutional quarantine or treated at government hospitals,” he said. Returnees from other countries (other than U.K.) will have to get a negative report atleast 72 hours before boarding the flight from that country. Otherwise, they will be subjected to the test at airport. The Minister said the airport authorities had made arrangements for the passengers to stay at the airport till the RT-PCR reports are out. Asked if the government will allow passengers to get the express test done - wherein the reports will arrive in 15-20 minutes, he said: “There is a proposal in this regard by a pharma company, but we are yet to take a call on that.” “The Centre’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) will have to followed strictly. The airport authorities have been cooperating with us,” he said. Meanwhile, Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey issued a circular on Saturday directing all officials concerned to follow the SOPs and guidelines for preventing the spread of the U.K. variant in Karnataka.

Mohan, but took it away in the same order on his petition in which he had challenged criminal proceedings initiated against him for allegedly making false declaration about assets in the nomination papers of Parliamentary elections held in 2014 and 2019. The High Court quashed the order, passed on November 8, 2019 by the special court set up for exclusively dealing with criminal cases against MPs and MLAs, referring to a private complaint on false declaration to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Bengaluru South) for investigation. The special court could not have ordered investigation as all the offences alleged against Mr. Mohan were non-cognisable in nature, the High Court said. Take cognisance However, the High Court held that “the allegations made in the complaint along with supportive documents prima facie disclose the ingredients of offences under sections 171G, 191, 193, 199 and 200 IPC and this material was sufficient [for the special court] to proceed against the petitioner for the above offences.” Justice John Micheal Cunha observed in the order that “...there is a clear case of concealment and suppression of material facts attracting the ingredients of the offences alleged against the petitioner.” In such circumstances, the proper course available for special court was to straight away take cognisance of the alleged offences and proceed against the accused-petitioner as per the law, the High Court said while directing the special court to take cognisance of offences against Mr. Mohan under Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and proceed further. It was alleged in the complaint that Mr. Mohan had not disclosed immovable properties measuring 42 acres 14 guntas situated at Lakshmipura village, Kasaba hobli, Devanahalli taluk, Bengaluru Rural district worth more than Rs. 33.6 crore. However, Mr. Mohan had claimed that this property belonged to P.C.

10 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Enrol students or take TC, schools tell parents||Managements of some of the more prominent schools in the city, who are uncertain about admissions for the 2021–22 academic year, have asked parents to fill consent forms stating that their children will continue in the same school for the next year. Those who want to pull their children out of school have been told to apply for a transfer certificate (TC) this month itself. These measures, which have many families up in arms, come in the wake of an uncertain academic year, with an increasing number of parents pulling their children out of expensive schools owing to financial constraints. One well-known chain of schools has reportedly informed parents that if they wish to discontinue classes, but do not want to apply for a transfer certificate by the end of the month, they will have to pay the first term fees for the 2021–22 academic year. This move has angered the parents who feel that it is “too early” to decide if their children should remain in the same school for the next academic year. “We are in the middle of a pandemic and it is difficult to make any decision or move at this point in time. It is unfair for schools to insist that we apply for a transfer certificate so early,” said a parent who received a circular earlier this week. ‘Nothing wrong’ D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools, said there was “nothing wrong” in schools insisting on taking the transfer certificate so early in the year. “School managements need a headcount of enrolled students to chalk out their per-child expenditure for the next academic year. We can also accommodate other students depending on those who discontinue and leave a school,” he said. This is not the first time parents and schools have clashed owing to changes the pandemic has wrought. Over the last few weeks, there have been several protests over schools not allowing students who had not paid fees to attend online classes. While families have requested leniency owing to job loss or salary cuts, school managements said that they need the inflow of money to pay their staff and run the schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/enrol-students-for-next-year-or-take-tc-schools-tell-parents/article33540967.ece

10 January 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Farmers take out tractor jatha supporting agitation in Delhi||Scores of farmers took out a tractor jatha in Dharwad on Saturday, mourning the death of 60 farmers during the agitation in New Delhi and also expressing solidarity with the farmers seeking a repeal of farm laws. The protest, held under the aegis of ‘Raita Hitarakshana Parivar’, was led by the former Union Minister and farmer leader Babagouda Patil, KPCC media analyst Pandurang Neeralakeri, and others. Members of various farmers’ organisations took part driving their tractors. Supporting them, members of various political parties took part in the agitation. Starting from Kadapa Maidan, the jatha covered Subhash Road, Anjuman Circle and Azad Road, and Vivekanand Circle before returning to the originating point, where a public meeting was held. Throughout the jatha, the protesters raised slogans seeking repeal of the new farm laws by the Union government and withdrawal of amendments to the APMC Act and land reforms Act in the State. Addressing the protesters, Mr. Patil lambasted the Union government for being adamant and apathetic towards the hardships of farmers, who had been protesting in the chilly weather and rain in the national capital for over one-and-a-half months. “This is not the kind of behaviour expected from those who say nation first. The nation will survive only if farmers survive and this should be realised by those in power,” he said. Mr. Patil demanded immediate repeal of the three farm laws promulgated by the Union government which, he said, were anti-farmer and pro-corporate. He said that the Centre should immediately take steps to ensure minimum support price guarantee to the farm produce and should fulfil all the demands put forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-take-out-tractor-jatha-supporting-agitation-in-delhi/article33541226.ece
10 January 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||CM lays foundation stone for toy cluster in Koppal||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa offered bhoomi puja and laid the foundation stone for a toy cluster, which was claimed to be India’s first and largest toy manufacturing hub, near Bhanapur in Koppal district on Saturday. He also announced that the project was expected to be completed in a year and he would invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi for its inauguration. “Koppal is known for traditional Kinnal crafts. I feel proud to establish a toy cluster in this place. The cluster is expected to generate a large number of direct and indirect jobs in the area. It would provide ample employment opportunities to women in the region,” he said. The Chief Minister also announced a host of development projects for Koppal district, which included the establishment of a university and a mini-Vidhana Soudha at Kukanur. “Karnataka is one of the leading States in the country in attracting investments. An industry-friendly environment has been created in the State. The simplification of industry-related regulations and liberalisation of land purchase legislations have helped us to do it. Now, we are planning to move from Bengaluru-centric development to distribution of industries in rural areas across the State so that we can stop large-scale migration from rural areas to megacities,” Mr. Yediyurappa said. Minister for Large and Medium Scale Industries Jagdish Shettar said the Koppal toy cluster would house tens of toy-making companies to generate 25,000 direct jobs and over 1 lakh indirect jobs. ‘To be exported’ “Toys could be sold in all countries. Once the toy cluster is ready in Koppal, many companies would come and invest here. The toys manufactured here would be exported. As per our new industrial policy, local people would get priority while offering jobs in the cluster. After the new industrial policy came into force, the Bengaluru-centric industrialisation has stopped to pave the way for the expansion of industries in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. North Karnataka is a major beneficiary in this regard,” Mr. Shettar said Sanganna Karadi, Lok Sabha member from Koppal, appealed to the Chief Minister to sanction an airport for Koppal and also to provide funds to the district court complex. Former Minister R.V. Deshpande said that he had sanctioned the toy cluster for Koppal when he was Industry Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-lays-foundation-stone-for-toy-cluster-in-koppal/article33541224.ece
10 January 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Govt. has not paid incentive for red gram’||Red gram growers in the region have to sell their crop at the minimum support price of Rs. 6,000 per quintal fixed by the Centre, as the State government has refrained from paying incentives for red gram this year, Priyank Kharge, MLA, has said and accused the State government of neglecting the farmers of Kalyana Karnataka. During the previous kharif season, the Centre has announced an MSP of Rs. 5,800 per quintal for red gram and the State government had fixed an incentive of Rs. 300 on each quintal. This year, the farmers are forced to sell their crop at Rs. 6,000 (MSP) as the State government had failed to fix any incentive, he said. The farmers benefited from the incentives continuously during the Congress-led government in State. In 2016-17, the red gram growers got an incentive of Rs. 450 per quintal in 2016-17; it was Rs. 550 per quintal during 2017-18, and farmers received an incentive of Rs. 425 per quintal during 2018-19. In 2019-20, the State government procured 13.01 lakh quintals of red gram worth Rs. 793.86 crore from 1,27,468 farmers. Of the total Rs. 793.86 crore, Mr. Kharge alleged that the State government has cleared dues of Rs. 590.09 crore to 1,03, 408 farmers. He expressed doubt whether the remaining 24,060 farmers got their amount for the red gram procured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-has-not-paid-incentive-for-red-gram/article33541225.ece
10 January 2021||Karnataka Bureau,KARNATAKA||CM set for one more trip to Delhi today||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who on Saturday said that “Cabinet expansion was in the hands of the party high command”, will make yet another trip to Delhi on Sunday morning, in an attempt to lobby with the central leadership for a green signal to the much delayed exercise. While the Travel Plan (TP) issued by the Chief Minister’s office only said “to meet Union Ministers”, no specific appointments have been fixed with any Ministers or the central leadership yet, sources close to Mr. Yediyurappa said. However, he is expected to meet BJP national president J.P. Nadda and will try to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah to discuss Cabinet expansion, sources said.  The Chief Minister’s earlier trips to the national capital since September 2020 have failed to get the high command to clear the Cabinet expansion/reshuffle exercise, reportedly frustrating him. BJP national general secretary and in-charge of party affairs in the State Arun Singh recently asked mediapersons what was the hurry to carry out Cabinet expansion, even as he claimed the exercise was the prerogative of the Chief Minister and he will take a call. However, Mr. Yediyurappa speaking to mediapersons in Koppal on Saturday said: “Cabinet expansion will happen only when the party high command permits us. There is no confusion on the issue.” He would leave Bengaluru at 8.20 a.m. and his return journey date has been kept open, according to the release. Rs. 50,000 crore deficit Meanwhile, Mr. Yediyurappa lamented his government’s inability to “carry out development works as he had dreamt and the people expected of him.” He said that successive drought and floods in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had not only forced the government to change priorities, but also squeezed the State’s finances. “We are expecting a deficit of around Rs. 50,000 crore in this year’s budget also. People know all this and I request them to cooperate. We hope there will be a recovery in the coming year,” he said on Saturday.  Cabinet expansion will happen only when the party high command permits us. There is no confusion on the issue.B.S.

10 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘BJP activists won’t raise anti-national slogans’||Accusing the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) of making baseless allegation, the State Bharatiya Janata Party vice-president and Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP, Shobha Karandlaje, said here on Saturday that there was no question of any BJP activist raising slogans against India. She was responding to an allegation by the SDPI that the Belthangady police have failed to act on their complaint accusing a BJP activist of raising ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogan during the victory celebrations outside the counting centre for gram panchayat elections in Ujire on December 30. “None of our activists will raise Pakistan zindabad slogan. Just to hide their anti-national activity, the SDPI is making this allegation,” she told presspersons. By allegedly raising anti-national slogans following victory of their candidates in some gram panchayats, the SDPI is showing how it was working in favour of the neighbouring enemy nation. “Days are not far when the SDPI will be banned for anti-national activities. The BJP will press upon the government to take necessary action,” she said. Three SDPI activists were arrested by the Belthangady police in a case of sedition booked following a video on social media showing some persons, who held SDPI flags, raising “Pakistan Zindabad” outside the counting centre in Ujire on December 30. The police said an arrest was made after preliminary examination of the video in circulation. The SDPI filed a complaint on another video allegedly showing a BJP activist raising anti-national slogans on the same day. This video and videos showing SDPI activists have been sent for forensic examination, the police said. Ms. Karandlaje invited people for the three-day Brahmakalashotsava of Kemmale Nagabrahma temple in Yenmuru village of Kadaba taluk from January 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sdpi-charges-are-baseless-says-shobha/article33540974.ece

10 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 mortality declined in Dec.||The decline in COVID-19 mortality and positivity rate continued in Mysuru during December even though the active case load did not witness a corresponding reduction during the period. While the number of persons succumbing to COVID-19 came down from 41 during November to 16 during December and the positivity rate dipped from 2.11 during November to 1.13 during December, the active cases in Mysuru went up from 370 to 442. However, active cases were found to be very dynamic as their numbers fell to 318 on January 6. Also, witnessing a substantial decline was the number of persons testing positive during December. A total of 1,699 people tested positive during December against 2,996 during November even though the number of tests conducted by the authorities in Mysuru went up from 1.41 lakh in November to almost 1.5 lakh during December. Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Health Officer D.G. Nagaraju told The Hindu that a good percentage of the population in Mysuru may have developed immunity. He cited the findings of the sero surveys conducted across the State about three months ago to claim that a section of the population may have developed antibodies to fight the virus now. Also, he said the hospitals and medical establishments in Mysuru including the designated COVID-19 hospital, COVID-19 Care Centres as well as private hospitals were no longer enduring the the pressure they faced when cases peaked between August and October. Experts, however, have warned that there was a possibility of a sudden surge of COVID-19 in the coming weeks by referring to the “second wave“ sweeping many European countries. Hence, people have been cautioned to continue wearing a mask and maintain social distance to keep the virus at bay. Testing Chidambara, an official of the Health and Family Welfare Department in Mysuru, who is monitoring COVID-19 testing and training, said there has been no let-up in the testing in the district despite the declining numbers. The number of tests had, in fact, increased during the last week of December in view of the large number of teachers and students who had come forward for the tests ahead of the start of schools. There was increased focus on surveillance, screening and testing in Mysuru as the district had become a hotspot for COVID-19 during August and September when the rate of positivity ranged between 20.9 and 22.85 per cent, which was among the highest in Karnataka. The present positivity rate of 1.13 per cent had come as a major relief to the people of Mysuru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-mortality-declined-in-dec/article33541445.ece
10 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mid-winter fowl census in Mysuru region today||Scores of birders will embark on the mid-winter water fowl census covering nearly 150 waterbodies spread across Mysuru-Mandya-Chamarajanagar belt on Sunday. This is the longest running voluntary effort entailing bird census in vogue since the 1990s in Karnataka and has helped create a robust database of bird population and number of species present that comes to roost in the landscape. Migratory birds It has also helped identify important waterbodies in the region that play host to the migratory birds from distant nations and States that keep their annual tryst with these places every winter. “For this year’s census, we have identified 25 routes along which each team will identify different species of birds and estimate their numbers. Each team is likely to cover 5 to 6 waterbodies in their specific route and we expect to cover atleast 130 to 150 lakes,” said A. Shivaprakash, who is coordinating the activities and one among those who have been part of the bird estimation initiative that began in the 1990s. Apart from estimating the count, the exercise will also serve to ascertain the number of bird species that come to roost. Mr. Shivaprakash explained that the bird count exercise has undergone some changes since the last few years and is a one-day affair unlike in the past when the exercise would stretch for weeks. “One-day exercise helps create a more reliable count as it eliminates duplication of bird count,” he added. Based on the earlier records, the volunteers have identified potential areas which are more productive in terms of bird congregation across Mysuru-Mandya-Chamarajanagar belt. In the 2020 exercise, 16 teams consisting of 45 birders covered 114 locations in these three districts and could identify the presence of 202 bird species, while the total number was pegged at 25,107 birds. Mr. Shivaprakash said Bar-headed Goose, Cattle Egret,and Little cormorant were among the species that had a sizeable population, while maximum number of birds were recorded at Kabini, Kikkeri, and Lingambudhi lake. The maximum number of species were recorded at KRS (99) followed by Rayanakere (78) and Kalae (65). A significant find last year was recording the presence of White-rumped Shama for the first time by the volunteers, he added. Malabar Lark, Eurasian Wryneck, Thick-billed Warbler, Red Spurfowl, Common Quail, Yellow-throated Bulbul, Indian Scops-owl, and Yellow-throated Sparrow were other interesting finds last year the details of which have been uploaded on www.mysorenature.org||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mid-winter-fowl-census-in-mysuru-region-today/article33541023.ece

This year, inputs are being sought from a cross-section of the society. In this regard, R. Balasubramaniam, Founder and Chairman, GRAAM, Mysuru was recently invited by the Ministry seeking inputs on the challenges facing the social sector and NGOs. Mr. Balasubramaniam, in his discussion with the Finance Minister, strongly advocated stimulation of rural economies, speaking widely for the social and civil society sector in general. Prominently featured in the discussion was the recent amendment to the Companies Act 2013, and in particular the Corporate Social Responsibility Policy Amendment Rules 2020. He gave inputs on regulatory effectiveness and taxation related to the social sector, including increasing the cap on admin expenditure under FCRA or considering a revision of the definition of admin expenditure, a release from GRAAM said here. Societies Act Among other suggestions, he proposed a revisit to the Societies Registration Act of 1860 for making it more relevant, updated and facilitating the contemporary NGO ecosystem. Mr. Balasubramaniam’s discussion also followed up on last year’s announcement of setting up a Social Stock Exchange in India, with a picture of a clear transition pathway for the existing NGOs and civil society organisations to evolve into social enterprises, the release added.

10 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||GTD proving to be a tough nut to crack for JD(S)||With his proclaimed political neutrality and non-cooperation with the party, former Minister G.T. Deve Gowda is proving to be a tough nut to crack for the JD(S) in the Mysuru region at a time when the party is looking to revive its political fortunes. Mr. Gowda, who has been spurning the party leadership's overtures ever since the JD(S)-Congress coalition government collapsed in 2019, incurred the wrath of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy earlier this week. At a party forum in Bengaluru, Mr. Kumaraswamy took serious offence not only to Mr. Gowda’s refusal to attend the meeting organised to revamp the party, but also for stating that JD(S) was a party that has been changing its position to align with BJP and Congress from time to time depending on the political circumstances. Mr .Kumaraswamy, who appeared to have lost patience with the JD(S) MLA from Chamundeshwari, said there was a demand to remove people indulging in anti-party activities and threatened to start the process of purging the party from Mysuru though he did not identify Mr. Gowda by name. Mr. Kumaraswamy's warning of expulsion was repeated by former Minister S.R. Mahesh with whom Mr. Gowda has been at loggerheads. Mr. Gowda’s recalcitrant attitude in one of its key strongholds in Mysuru district is turning out to be a major headache for the JD (S), which is seeking to instil discipline in the rank and file as part of its efforts to strengthen the party ahead of 2023 Assembly polls. Mr. Gowda was the only senior JD(S) leader from the region who had stayed behind when the rest deserted the party with former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in 2006. Also, he carries the distinction of defeating Mr. Siddaramaiah in Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency in the 2018 polls. Responding to Mr. Kumaraswamy’s warning, Mr. Gowda acknowledged that the warning was directed at him, but claimed he had done no wrong to justify any action against him. He reasoned that he was only trying to project the strengths of the JD(S). Mr. Gowda attributed his remarks to a poser from the media on the speculation over merger of JD(S) with BJP and claimed that he had only said that the support of the JD(S) was necessary to whichever party that forms the government in the State. He said he had cited the party’s alliance with Congress in 2004, with BJP in 2006 and with Congress in 2018 only to highlight its political strengths. “So, I had said that the party high command will take a decision depending on the time and situation. So, what is my fault? It is not anti-party activity. Why target me?”, Mr. Gowda said adding that he was proud about his association with the JD(S) and said he respected former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, Mr. Kumaraswamy and former Minister H.D. Revanna. Meanwhile, the threat to expel Mr. Gowda appeared to have died down sooner than later with Mr. Mahesh, a day later, denying that the party was planning to remove him from the party. Also, he said the party will fight the next Assembly elections in Mysuru district under the leadership of Mr. Gowda and the party will be fielding not only Mr. Gowda, but also his son Harish Gowda in the elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gtd-proving-to-be-a-tough-nut-to-crack-for-jds/article33541449.ece
10 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘State clear in its vision to implement NEP’||Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Saturday said the National Education Policy Implementation Task Force has proposed a roadmap for the implementation of the policy in a phased manner. Careful planning, joint monitoring and collaborative implementation of NEP in a prioritized and holistic manner is in the offing, he added. Speaking after inaugurating the national seminar on ‘Implementation of NEP – 2020 in Karnataka: Opportunities and Road Ahead’ organised by the Karnataka Rajya Mahavidyalaya Shikshak Sangh (KRMSS) virtually at University of Mysore (UoM) here, he said the State government was proactive on the NEP and Karnataka was the first State to initiate policy implementation. “We have the clarity that the implementation of the spirit and intent of the policy are most critical to accomplish the stated vision.” The Dy.CM said the policy envisions an education system rooted in Indian ethos that contributes directly to transforming India sustainably into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society by providing high quality education to all and thereby making India a global knowledge superpower. Education further envisions to instill a deep-rooted pride in being Indian, not only in thought but also in spirit, intellect and deeds, as well as to develop knowledge skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, he explained. He argued that higher education would undergo a deep structural change, thanks to NEP. The existing watertight compartment will give way to multi and inter-disciplinary learning. A student will get complete liberty to choose what they like to learn. There will be no walls between physics, philosophy, and political science. Students will choose subjects according to their interest, passion and ability, he said. The Dy.CM opined that emphasis was not on acquiring subject knowledge but empowering each student to excel in the chosen field. The underlining aim of the higher education is to develop good, thoughtful, well-rounded and creative individuals. There will be exposure to 21st century capabilities across a range of disciplines, including sciences, social sciences, arts, humanities, languages as well as professional, technical and vocational subjects, he stated. Seminars and discussions are key to create awareness among stakeholders to make the faculty understand their role in the implementation of the policy and to encourage universities and colleges to take responsibility, he suggested. The universities have taken the meaningful initiative to motivate the faculty and institutions to be involved in the process of effective implementation of NEP 2020 in Karnataka. Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami of Suttur Mutt and M.K. Sridhar, member, UGC, and Draft Committee, NEP-2020, participated virtually. G. Hemantha Kumar, VC, UoM, presided over the function. S. Vidyashankar, VC, KSOU, R. Shivappa, Registrar, UoM, and KSOU Registrar Lingaraj Gandhi, MLC Arun Shahpur, Raghu Akamanchi, president, KRMSS, and Shivananda Sindankera, General Secretary, ABRSM, New Delhi, were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-clear-in-its-vision-to-implement-nep/article33541233.ece

He was speaking at the 10th convocation of the University of Agriculture Sciences, Raichur, on Saturday. Dr. Agarwal said that the agriculture sector may face certain challenges in the production of food, both in terms of quantity and quality, by the end of century owing to the effects of global warming. “The global temperature is expected to increase up to 4 degrees Celsius in the coming years. If temperature increases, the natural disasters will possibly happen and that will impact agriculture products drastically,” he said. “As per estimates from the ICAR, the demand for foodgrains will increase to 345 million tonnes in 2030, and hence in the next 20 years, production needs to be increased at the rate of 5.5 million tonnes annually. This may be a very difficult task for the agriculture scientists,” he said. Urging scientists to take significant policies to preserve the land strength, Dr. Agarwal said that India has been facing a severe problem of land degradation.  K.N. Kattimani, Vice-Chancellor, said that to help students, UAS intends to set up postgraduate courses at Agriculture College in Bhimaranayagudi, Shahpur in Yadgir district, Forest University at Chincholi in Kalaburagi district, and agriculture colleges in Aurad in Bidar district and Ballari. As many as 122 students received graduation certificates, 72 postgraduate certificates, and 14 got their doctorates. Rekha and Sahana Police Patil won six gold medals each and Sunidhi Dingre won four gold medals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/concern-over-global-warming-impact/article33541231.ece

The spot prices of Robusta coffee and raw cherry on Saturday in the Wayanad market was Rs. 62 to Rs. 64 a kg as against Rs. 71 to Rs. 72 a kg a month ago. Whereas the price of Robusta coffee beans (cleaned coffee) declined from Rs. 125 a kg to Rs. 115 a kg. The price of a kilogram of coffee beans in the market now is almost equal to the price in 1995, but the daily wage of a worker has gone up from Rs. 35 to Rs. 400 a day, says Victor Day, vice president, Wayanad Coffee Growers Association (WCGA). Coffee production has improved this year, but dearth of workers, especially women, is a matter of concern in the district after the the COVID-19 outbreak, Mr. Victor Day said. The inflow of labourers from Gundlupet and Coorg of Karnataka during the coffee harvesting season also decreased considerably this year owing to the pandemic, he added. The input cost in the coffee industry is on the rise, whereas the price of coffee is going down, he said. According to WCGA president Prasanth Rajesh, the erratic rain in the midst of harvesting added to the worries of farmers. Spikes had been formed after the rain, resulting in coffee blooming in different stages. It would not only delay coffee picking this season but also hamper regular picking next year, he said. “A back-up shower is needed in two weeks to support setting flowers after pollination, but such a situation will worsen the drying process of harvested coffee fruits,” said Jagadeesh, a coffee grower at Panamaram. Low prices Many farmers are facing difficulties in selling their produce that got drenched in the rain. Traders are either rejecting the produce or offering a very low price owing to its inferior quality, he added. Rampant berry drop owing to the erratic rain in the past fortnight is another concern of growers. “Nearly 15% to 20% of ripened beans on my plantation had fallen due to the rain,” said Manoj Joseph, a farmer at Meenangadi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/erratic-rain-deepens-coffee-farmers-woes/article33541298.ece
10 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Handloom sector beset by problem of plenty||The handloom industry in Ernakulam district, mostly centred around Chendamangalam in Paravur taluk, is in dire straits, as a large stock waits to be sold. Besides, the distribution of free uniforms to students has been disrupted thanks to the COVID-19 outbreak. The free uniform distribution programme was the mainstay of the handloom industry, which was seriously hit by the floods in 2018 and 2019 and the pandemic, said T.S. Baby, president, Paravoor Handloom Cooperative 3428. It is a matter of serious concern that uniforms could not be distributed, as schools had remained closed since March 2020. An official of the Industries Department said the handloom sector had been in serious financial crisis since the 2018 floods. However, it could be revived through measures including those supported by voluntary agencies. Ajithkumar Gothuruth of Handloom Cooperative H131 at Paravur said the government had been supportive of the societies, but the weavers lost both Onam and Christmas / Ramzan sales owing to the COVID-19 breakout. Onam season accounts for around 40% of sales during the year, and the loss due to the pandemic has had a huge impact on weavers’ income, he added. Industry sources said around 70 lakh metres of uniform fabric was produced for distribution in the State, but the pandemic disrupted the plans. Along with uniform fabric, the industry has stock worth around Rs. 10 crore, said Mr. Baby, who has worked closely with handloom cooperatives in Paravur. Handloom societies too suffered widespread damage during the 2018 floods. Mr. Baby said yarn worth around Rs. 35 lakh was lost in the floods, and that no support was forthcoming for the societies despite repeated appeals by weavers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/handloom-sector-beset-by-problem-of-plenty/article33541329.ece

Tenders were re-floated after one of the two consortiums that had submitted technical and financial bids failed to qualify, as per the evaluation done by the committee constituted by the government. The committee found that the consortium did not meet the minimum eligibility requirements as prescribed in the request for proposal issued by KSIDC. In such a scenario, a re-tender has to be initiated and fresh bids have to be invited, according to an order issued by the Finance Department. The bid evaluation committee can approve the technical bid of the qualifying firm even if the other failed to clear the test in the re-floated tender proceedings.  Last date The terms and conditions in the re-floated tenders remain the same. The last date for submitting bids is January 23. Technical evaluation and presentation by bidders will be held on January 28. The price bid is likely to be opened on January 29. KSIDC plans to issue the letter of intent within eight weeks of opening the financial proposal. The plant will be set up based on Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Transfer (DBFOT) mode for the Ernakulam cluster of local bodies. The cluster includes the Kochi Corporation and the municipalities of Thrikkakara, Thripunithura, Kalamassery, Eloor, Maradu, Aluva, Perumbavoor, Angamaly, North Paravur, Muvattupuzha, Kothamangalam, Piravom, and Koothattukulam. The firm to be chosen for the execution of the project in 20 acres at Brahmapuram will have powers to mortgage the leasehold rights over the said area for raising funds for the initiative. The government had already asked the Secretary, Kochi Corporation, to hand over land to KSIDC on lease basis. KSIDC will sub-lease the land to the firm for 27 years, with permission to mortgage the leasehold rights for raising funds only for the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksidc-refloats-tender-for-wte-plant-at-brahmapuram-yard/article33541338.ece
10 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Time for Kochi to emulate London in managing private buses, says expert||With Kochi having India’s first full-fledged Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA), it is in a position to emulate London and other progressive cities in ushering in an equitable and sustainable bus transport system, said O.P. Agarwal, who played a key role in preparing the tool kit and framing the National Urban Transport Policy. He is also a member of the Kochi Metropolitan Transport Authority (KMTA), which was inaugurated in November 2020. “It is good that private bus operators in Kochi have arrayed under six companies. They must further be brought under a single umbrella body for optimal results. A government agency, as in London, must ideally monitor their operations, including by deciding their routes and trip timings. This agency at the helm can collect the fare, which can then be distributed equitably, based on the number of kilometres that a bus operates every day,” he said. Having decided the routes and timings, the agency floats tenders. The lowest bidder, who adheres to specifications like the kind of bus that he owns, previous experience, and reliability is awarded the bid. As a regulatory body, the government agency monitors the operation of each bus. For example, running late for over five per cent of the trips or skipping more than two out of 100 trips will invite penalty. Other performance parameters too have been fixed. This is among the reasons public transport agencies worldwide look up to bus operations in London and similarly placed cities, Mr. Agarwal said. He contrasted this with the system in vogue in India, where bus operators can chose any route and seek permit. Naturally, they chose lucrative routes, thus avoiding residential areas and other locales, prompting people to rely on private vehicles. “In London, a bus operator is assured of revenue depending on the number of kilometres he operates, irrespective of whether his bus operates in crowded routes or in those areas where patronage is low. This is something like cross subsidy, where a portion of high profits earned from one route is given to buses which operate in low-patronage routes. This will ensure adequate number of public transport buses on different routes. The government can rely on an IT-based system to keep tabs of whether buses halt at all stops and adhere to other guidelines, he added. A similar idea that had been mooted in Kochi a few years ago and was welcomed by many operators, failed to take off due to lack of follow-up action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/time-for-kochi-to-emulate-london-in-managing-private-buses-says-expert/article33541327.ece
10 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Waste management a key challenge for new Angamaly municipal council||Tackling the ineffective waste management system will be a key challenge before the newly-elected council in Angamaly municipality. “Our top priority is to resolve the situation and clear deadlocks in implementing a process in tune with the norms prescribed,” said municipal chairman Reji Mathew. The first step will begin from the Angamaly municipal market, which has failed to adhere to the various rules related to the scientific management of waste. “The market is one of the main sources of waste generation and it has not been resolved over the years. The council plans to set up a slaughterhouse and install a biodegradable plant in the first phase,” said Mr. Mathew. The Angamaly municipality was slapped with a penalty of Rs. 2.92 crore by the State Pollution Control Board in November for its failure to comply with the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The board had found that the civic body had not installed systems to treat waste properly. The chairman agreed that the present arrangement of transporting biodegradable and slaughterhouse waste to the Kochi Corporation’s Brahmapuram yard was not feasible. “We have to treat the waste at the source by setting up biodegradable and waste water treatment plants. The discharge of untreated waste water will affect the status of paddy fields and the Manjalithodu. It may also lead to a health crisis,” he said. On the need to improve the financial situation and step up internal revenue generation, the chairman referred to the renovation of the old municipality office as an immediate option to generate income. “The previous council had wasted time by voting for the demolition of the 35-year-old building. It ran into legal hurdles. Our idea is to renovate it without delay and give the facilities available there for rent,” he said. The agricultural sector has been deprived of uninterrupted supply of water and the issue will be another of the new council’s priorities. Mr. Mathew said irrigation projects, which had been pending for long, would be completed in a phased manner. “These irrigation projects would address the issue of water scarcity in many areas,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/waste-management-a-key-challenge-for-new-angamaly-municipal-council/article33541334.ece
10 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Kochi witnesses traffic chaos||The Vyttila-Palarivattom-Edappally stretch on the NH Bypass and roads leading to it witnessed unprecedented traffic snarls, soon after a pair of six-lane flyovers were opened to traffic on Saturday afternoon. While commuters caught unawares by serpentine snarls turned restive, traffic police personnel were seen running around, trying to unwind the hold-ups. “The fact that it was Saturday, when employees and others leave Kochi for their home towns, made matters worse. Personnel manning junctions on the Edappally-Kundannoor NH Bypass and roads leading to it are having a harrowing time managing traffic flow. There was unusual number of vehicles converging at Edappally as well, mainly from the Vyttila side,” said a traffic police officer. It had a ripple effect in other parts of the city as well, including on the Edappally-Kalamassery NH and Civil Line Road. Corridors around Vyttila that witnessed severe traffic gridlocks included SA Road, Vyttila-Thripunithura road, and Vyttila-Palarivattom and Palarivattom-Vyttila stretches. Vehicles proceeding along the NH Bypass had a tough time entering side roads, mainly at Vyttila. Many of then have narrow bellmouths, which considerably slow down vehicle movement. For instance, the maddening snarls on SA Road could have been avoided if vehicles on the Elamkulam-Vyttila stretch were able to take a free-left turn at Vyttila. Buses and other vehicles which wait in a long queue, awaiting the green signal to proceed towards Thripunithura and the Vyttila Mobility Hub, choked the narrow bellmouth at the curve. Similarly, the PWD-owned Vyttila-Kunnara Park stretch — used by vehicles proceeding to Thripunithura, Kottayam and Muvattupuzha — remains two-lane, even as Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) widened the Kunnara Park-Pettah stretch beneath the metro corridor to four-lane, police sources said. The PWD or the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) must also widen the curve from the Palarivattom side towards Kaniampuzha Road, if need be, by removing a few shops that obstruct vehicles which turn towards the road, they added. “Saturday’s chaos could have been prevented if the PWD had paid heed to suggestions by novices like me and even by Metroman E. Sreedharan to build an innovative flyover at Vyttila, the biggest junction in Kerala,” said Shamier Abdulla, a social activist who went up to the High Court of Kerala in 2017 with the demand. “Instead, the PWD opted for a conventional flyover linking just the northern and southern sides of the junction. This and avoidance of land acquisition on the flyover’s eastern side considerably narrowed down the slip road that ought to accommodate vehicles from Palarivattom waiting to turn towards SA Road and take left turn towards the Mobility Hub and Thripunithura. Such issues must be rectified as soon as possible, if need be, by acquiring requisite land,” he added. Alternative bypass Officials of the PWD (NH Wing) which built the Vyttila flyover attributed Saturday’s chaos to unscientific timings fed into the signal system. This will be altered in the coming days, and Keltron has been informed of it. “Traffic movement will hopefully be streamlined in a day or two. The problematic expansion joints over the Vyttila railway bridge that is maintained by the NHAI is considerably slowing down vehicles,” said a senior official. Ultimately, a considerable chunk of traffic — especially goods carriers — must be taken away from the NH Bypass by fast-tracking the Kundannoor-Angamaly NH Bypass mooted by the NHAI, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-sees-unprecedented-traffic-chaos-as-flyovers-open/article33541294.ece

Inter-caste married couples of whom one belongs to the Scheduled Caste and whose combined annual income is less than Rs. 1 lakh are entitled to assistance of Rs. 75,000 for setting up means of self-employment. The department has so far fully utilised the Rs. 60 lakh allotted to the district for the 2020-21 financial year, with all except two of the 79 applicants receiving the aid. The remaining two are likely to be cleared this month as soon as the beneficiaries submit the requisite documents. Allocation The funds allocated under the scheme, supported by the Central and State governments equally, vary from year to year. For instance, Ernakulam district disbursed Rs. 1.14 crore to 157 beneficiaries in 2019-20 after the low of Rs. 43.75 lakh to 69 beneficiaries the year before. This was preceded by a high of Rs. 1.56 crore to 254 beneficiaries in 2017-18 and Rs. 70 lakh to 140 beneficiaries in 2016-17. “We are among the districts that fully utilise the funds and yet we have pendency of nearly 100 applications dating back to May 2019. On an average, we receive two to three applications in a month. We have sought additional allocation, which may be forthcoming if there were unused allocations somewhere else,” said Sunil M.S., district officer, Scheduled Caste Development Department. Till March 2016, the assistance was pegged at Rs. 50,000 whereafter it was hiked. Couples looking to avail the benefit should apply within three years of marriage. They should apply with the caste certificates of both husband and wife, income certificates, project report of the proposed self-employment initiative, and co-living certificate issued either by a gazetted officer or by the local MLA or MP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/more-funds-sought-to-help-inter-caste-married-couples/article33541330.ece

The firm or consortium chosen to execute the project has to ensure that the landfill should not be more than 10% of the waste received at the site. It should collect, segregate, and transport solid waste from collection bins in the identified cluster at a radius of 25 to 35 kilometres from the site. There should be bin-based secondary collection to ensure maximum coverage of waste collection from the city. The participating local bodies in the cluster will be responsible for undertaking door-to-door collection, street cleaning, and delivery to the bins provided by the company at the designated collection points. The location of bins and collection points will be decided depending on area and population and with mutual consultation between the civic bodies and the firm/consortium. The private partner has to transport solid waste to the processing facility with minimal handling and limited inter-vehicle transfers using the best practices in vehicle planning, scheduling, and handling. It will have to preferably segregate waste at source by creating awareness among customers and providing different collection containers for biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. However, waste segregation is essential before processing waste in any manner. The firm will have to segregate non-usable and non-biodegradable waste, including plastic, metal, glass, and electronic items and recycle / reprocess them through its own units or sell them to re-processors / recyclers. Waste materials like rubber, tyres, upholstery, and bags can be sold to cement factories as energy sources. Resource recovery has to be carried out at the cost and risk of the firm / consortium. It should also ensure that no part of construction and demolition waste is used in the plant. The private partner has to process leachate in accordance with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB ) standards. It should develop sanitary landfill of designed capacity and set up a leachate treatment facility at the site, if required. A greenhouse concept having plants, lawns, and gardens has to be developed surrounding the plant while trying to set up a model spot for educating the public on environmental protection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wte-plant-to-have-5-mw-production-capacity/article33541332.ece

Heaps of waste were seen dumped close to the Manjummel bund last week. SLMC chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai had visited the site along with senior board officials. The civic body was served a notice asking it to explain why action should not be taken against it for the illegal dumping of waste. It was pointed out that the waste posed a threat to the nearby waterbody. The municipality authorities have started removing waste from the area. “Two days after this incident, we have now come across another case of illegal waste dumping near the waste collection yard of the civic body in North Kalamassery. The waste is being dumped near the area where lorries are parked. With no CCTV facilities available, the violators are having a free run. We will serve notice again on the municipality, citing the violation of clauses under the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016,” said the board officials. The Kalamassery municipality continues to remain under the scrutiny of the SLMC and the board following repeated violations of the SWM Rules and Water Act. The local body was served a penalty of Rs. 2.77 crore as environment compensation for not complying with the provisions of the SWM Rules, 2016. The unscientific handling of waste at the yard in North Kalamassery had also caught the attention of the enforcement agencies. As per estimates by the board, waste generation per person daily under the municipality was fixed at 0.3 kg, while the total waste generated was 21.23 tonnes a day. Only one-fifth of waste generated was disposed as per rules.

We also had to take a break for local body elections. It was decided to carry on with the survey after a 19-member technical committee, including experts and department heads, assessed its progress,” said officials.

As part of the survey all buildings and other topographic and infrastructural details including landmarks, waterbodies, bridges, wetlands, fallow lands, traffic junctions and parking areas will be mapped and stored using technologies like drone and Differential Global Positioning System. ‘First Corporation’ According to officials, GIS mapping of the Corporation has been conceived in a way to expedite overall development and ensure that various projects and welfare schemes are reaching the right beneficiaries. “Kollam is the first Corporation implementing such a project. On completion we are expecting some major changes in project implementation, town planning, disaster management, and waste treatment.”  The Corporation had outsourced the works to ULTS, a subsidiary of the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), and in November 2020 it was alleged that ULTS has been conducting unauthorised surveys and uploading data in their private server. It was claimed that the questionnaire included around 200 questions and most were health-related. The Corporation then stopped the survey and ordered a probe.

10 January 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Factionalism to the fore in NCP||The rumblings within the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) over its proposed association with the United Democratic Front (UDF) became all the more evident with the rival factions convening separately in Kottayam on Saturday. Earlier in the day, CPI(M) District secretary V.N. Vasavan on Friday inaugurated an event commemorating the former Youth Congress (S) leader C.H. Haridas, organised by the faction objecting to the party’s exit from the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Kanakkari Aravindakshan, NCP State Executive member, presided over the event. Varkala B.Ravikumar, NCP National Working Committee member, carried out a presentation on the need for the left and secular parties to formulate a political collective. The event was regarded as an apparent response to the official faction led by Mani C. Kappan, MLA, which recently organised a similar programme to remember the late NCP leader Thomas Chandy. Later in the afternoon, the rival faction organised a meeting at the NCP District Committee office in Kottayam. Party State president T.P. Peethambaran presided over the meeting. Speaking after the meeting, the NCP State president openly expressed his displeasure over a demand by the Kerala Congress (M) to hand over the Pala assembly seat. “The demand to give up the seat for a party that had lost the election is indeed strange,”’ he said. “We may consider this only if the remaining constituents of the LDF decide to hand over their seats proportionately,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/factionalism-to-the-fore-in-ncp/article33541390.ece
10 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||General Hospital opening up for non-COVID treatment||The Government General Hospital, Kozhikode, one of the two designated government hospitals for COVID-19 treatment in the district, is planning to resume its general outpatient (OP) section this week. Some work is being undertaken at the hospital building at present. As soon as it is completed, the OP section will be relocated. According to sources, it will be followed by the opening up of the inpatient section as well in the coming days. Earlier, seven wards there, including an intensive care unit, were being used only for COVID treatment. Two of them may now be used for non-COVID patients. The OP section had to be shifted to the adjacent Government School of Nursing after the institution was designated as a COVID hospital. Now, with classes beginning at the nursing school, they had to be shifted back. Services of the gynaecology and paediatrics departments had earlier been shifted to the Government Hospital for Women and Children at Kottaparamba. They were shifted back some time ago. The number of COVID patients at the hospital had dropped in the recent months. From about 150 patients, it has now come down to around 120. As of Wednesday, only 108 people are undergoing treatment there. A section of patients is learnt to have sought a separate system to manage non-COVID treatment at the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/general-hospital-opening-up-for-non-covid-treatment/article33541306.ece
10 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Seat-sharing: CPI(M) mulls options||After its electoral success in the local body polls, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will exercise a minimal aggressive approach in seat-sharing among its alliance partners for the Assembly polls due in four months. However, its hands-off coalition management seems to have aggravated the situation with infighting raging among its junior partners. The State unit of the Janata Dal (Secular), a constituent of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), split into factions with dissenters going for a nascent outfit. It was followed by the fractious disorder in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) State unit. Despite the minor parties having no big stake in the political arena and the winnability factor of their nominees remaining low, the CPI(M) does not want to gamble on rattling its partners. Already the entry of the Jose K. Mani faction and the induction of the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) are giving a tough posture to the CPI(M) in the seat-sharing talks. The CPI (M) leadership is awaiting an announcement on the official position of the NCP when its national president Sharad Pawar will be visiting the State in the coming days . The development comes even as a faction in the NCP met United Democratic Front leaders on the possible outcomes of the seat- sharing arrangement. Last time, the NCP had contested four and won three seats. Minister A.K. Saseendran is determined to recontest the polls on the LDF platform. So also another legislator Mani C. Kappan, who won the bypoll from Pala. While the tussle among the warring factions of the NCP is coming to a head, the CPI(M) is preoccupied to field Mr. Saseendran from the Kannur segment rather than offering him another chance to stand from the Elathur segment in Kozhikode district. Then, Minister Kadannappally Ramachandran of the Congress (S), the residual faction of the Indian Congress (Socialist), who represents the Kannur segment, will exit the electoral fray. In the previous elections, the LDF won 91 seats, up from 68 in the 2011 polls. The Kerala Congress (M) and the Janata Dal (United) — now transmuted as LJD — had contested 15 and 7 seats respectively when they were in the UDF camp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/seat-sharing-cpim-mulls-options/article33541388.ece
10 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Green auditing begins in Kozhikode||Green auditing to determine adherence to the green protocol in government offices has commenced in the district under the aegis of the Haritha Keralam Mission. As a first step, online training sessions were organised for teams from various local bodies on green auditing and the criteria for grading an office. Enforcing ban on disposable materials made of either thermocol, plastic or paper, reducing waste generation by using utensils that can be washed and reused, keeping utensils in offices for regular use, making arrangements for segregation and processing of solid waste, timely disposal of e-waste and unused furniture, implementing scientific waste management methods, ensuring clean toilets and displaying information on the green protocol in offices are among the pointers for grading an office. Organic vegetable garden, flower garden, and keeping offices attractive will add to the grading. The first round of training for district, block and grama panchayat-level teams was held on Thursday. The session was opened by District Panchayat President Kanathil Jameela, who is also the district chairperson of the Haritha Keralam Mission. The second round of training for municipalities and the corporation was opened by Mayor Beena Philip. Green Audit teams comprise representatives from the Health Department, panchayats, Urban Affairs Department, Haritha Keralam Mission, Suchitwa Mission, Kudumbashree, and Clean Kerala Company and people’s representatives, volunteers, and representatives of the empanelled green service agencies. The teams will inspect government offices in all block panchayats and grama panchayats. At least 10 offices within the jurisdiction of each grama panchayat will be scrutinised in the process and certified. At least 20 offices in municipalities and 100 in the corporation will be inspected. Offices getting more than 90 marks in 100 will get A grade, while those above 80 will get B grade and those above 70, C grade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/green-auditing-begins-in-kozhikode/article33541289.ece
10 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Dumping of septic waste in rural areas continues unabated||The acute threat of Shigella bacterial infection and various other waterborne diseases in the district have not been a deterrent to those dumping septic tank waste collected from various urban households into rivers in rural areas. The agencies thriving in the business are now mostly targeting village areas where there are fewer number of houses and, hence, lesser surveillance. With the police stepping up vigil and night patrolling, their activities within the city corporation limits have been reduced to a large extent. “Now, the isolated village areas in Nanmanda panchayat are the most vulnerable spots. Giant tanker lorries are being used to unload huge quantities of septage collected from various hospitals and flats. A few days ago, one such big tanker was unloaded at the Kallukandi drinking water project,” said Vijeesh Tharayi, a resident. He said the villagers were yet to take up the issue seriously. Near rivers The low-lying and isolated areas near Poonoor, Iruvazhinji, Cherupuzha, Mambuzha, Korapuzha and Kuttiyadi rivers are also being used by illegal agencies to dump septic waste. No registration Most vehicles used for the business do not have registration number or legal documents. Even if they are caught red-handed, the driver and other workers abandon the vehicle and escape. A Health Department official said it was turning out to be part-time work for youths from neighbouring districts. “To avoid tracing the identity and other whereabouts, such operators follow a mutli-level booking system where a number of agents share the profit. As of now, they charge about Rs. 8,000 for clearing a small tank of septage,” he added. Health Department officials said there were people who depended on various rivers for bathing. Even super-chlorination would not help purify contaminated water in larger areas, they added. Stepping up vigil According to them, the only way to prevent the contamination of waterbodies was to intensify local-level vigil and night surveillance by residents’ collectives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dumping-of-septic-waste-in-rural-areas-continues-unabated/article33541303.ece
10 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu road action panel seeks clarification from MLA||The Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu Road Action Committee has come out against Kozhikode North MLA A. Pradeepkumar, seeking clarification on the exclusion of the road widening project from the second phase of the Kozhikode City Road Improvement Project. The committee leaders, including historian M.G.S. Narayanan, Gandhian Thayat Balan, Mathew Kattikkana and M.P. Vasudevan, in a statement here, said the 8-km stretch of Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu Road that needed to be widened had not been included in the recently announced projects. However, it welcomed the decision of the State government to improve eight roads in the second phase. They said Mr. Pradeepkumar, who had been a legislator for the past 15 years, should explain the lapse to the residents. Poll manifesto The manifesto of the Left Democratic Front in the 2016 Assembly polls had clearly mentioned that the project would be taken up in right earnest, they added. However, the government had sanctioned only Rs. 50 crore in the three years after it came to power, they said. On the eve of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the government had sanctioned Rs. 100 crore. That was because Mr. Pradeepkumar was contesting the polls from Kozhikode constituency, they added. It was following an agitation that the government released Rs. 50 crore as the first tranche in July 2019. The amount remained unutilised in the Treasury for six months. The balance amount of Rs. 50 crore was released after 14 months and that too just before the three-tier local body polls, they said. Transfer of funds The committee leaders said that the Finance Department failed to transfer funds to the account of the Collector even though the Special Tahsildar had issued an order that the landowners in Chevayur and Vengeri villages had submitted the mandatory title deeds for the purpose. They said that a total amount of Rs. 184.5 crore was required to acquire three hectares for the road widening project. Only then could the Kerala Road Fund Board take up the project, they said.

Artists have been supporting the local campaigns, with many creating mass paintings to draw public attention. On Sunday, a ‘maha rally’ will be organised in Kozhikode city under the aegis of the Kozhikode Citizens Forum to offer unconditional support to the Delhi agitation. Office-bearers of the Kerala Samyuktha Karshaka Samiti, which is part of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, say they have sought the support of all labour organisations in Kerala to lend a hand to the ongoing protests and stand by the farmers’ rights. “Since December 12, 2020, we have been on an indefinite strike in all districts and there has been tremendous support from all sections of the society,” they add. On January 11, a number of farmers from Kozhikode will join a 1,000-member group from Kerala who will leave for Delhi to join the protests there. The Kerala Karshaka Sanghom is coordinating the activities with the support of numerous farm organisations and service associations. A second batch of farmers is likely to be sent later if the Centre is not ready to consider the farmers’ demands.

10 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Action against three jail officials||Disciplinary action has been taken against three officials of the Kozhikode District Jail for “poor surveillance” which reportedly led to the unnatural death of a remand prisoner. While the Jail Superintendent and the Deputy Prison Officer were transferred, the Assistant Prison Officer was placed under suspension. It was on January 6 that a 61-year-old man, who was remanded in connection with a child sexual abuse case, was found dead. According to jail authorities, the man ended his life following the mental trauma he suffered after the arrest. There were also allegations that he was arrested on the basis of a false complaint, they said. Following the man’s death, there were a series of protests seeking legal action against the police for “falsely implicating him” in the child abuse case. According to the protesters and some of the local residents close to the victim’s family, the man was not involved in the sexual assault case. They sought a reinvestigation into the incident and a re-examination of the victim’s statement. Action was taken against the three jail officials on the basis of a preliminary internal investigation report submitted by the Deputy Inspector General. The report stated that the jail officials were careless and did not ensure proper checking of cells or conduct periodic visits. Earlier incidents in which prisoners had attempted suicide also prompted the officer to recommend immediate disciplinary action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/death-of-prisoner-action-taken-against-three-jail-officials/article33541309.ece

Briefing the media after the working committee meeting of the organisation here on Saturday, MYL State general secretary P.K. Firoz alleged that the CPI(M) had tied up with the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Manjeswaram to defeat the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and with the BJP in Ranni to defeat the Congress in the election to the posts of chiefs in those local bodies. The meeting, chaired by MYL State president Syed Munawar Ali Shihab Thangal, charged the CPI(M) with orchestrating a controversy over the Welfare Party of India (WPI) aligning with the United Democratic Front (UDF) only to conceal its electoral association with the SDPI in the three-tier local body polls. Replying to questions, Mr. Firoz said the MYL had staunchly taken a policy not to have either an alliance or understanding with the WPI in the Assembly elections. The organisation will expose the unholy nexus of the CPI(M) and the SDPI in the polls, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-in-covert-alliance-with-sdpi-says-myl/article33541304.ece

10 January 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Preparations for Makaravilakku begin||With just days left for the Makaravilakku festival at the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has started preparations for the smooth conduct of the ritual in adherence to the COVID-19 protocol. Addressing mediapersons, TDB president N.Vasu said only 5,000 people who had booked their slots in advance through the virtual queue system would be permitted to the Sannidhanam on the day. No persons would be permitted to camp in the adjoining forests or the vantage points at Parunthumpara, Panchalimedu, and Pulmedu for viewing the Makaravilakku. He said the Makarasamkrama Puja would be held at 8.14 a.m on the day. The presiding deity would be adorned with the Thiruvabaranam during the Deeparadhana to be held later in the evening. The annual pilgrimage season would draw to a close on January 20 morning, a day after the Guruti ritual at Malikappuram. Revenue of Rs. 14.11 cr. As per official estimates, 1,16,706 pilgrims visited the temple during the Mandalam-Makaravilakku season till January 8. The income during the period stood at Rs. 14.11 crore. “This is absolutely insufficient considering the expenditure involved in organising the pilgrimage. We have sought additional financial assistance from the State government to address future needs,” Mr.Vasu said. The government had so far granted Rs. 70 crore as assistance to the TDB over the last six months. Meanwhile, the measures rolled out by the authorities to rein in an outbreak of COVID-19 at the Sannidhanam have begun to pay off with a sharp fall in the number of cases. A recent antigen testing drive found that all 78 persons examined at the Sannidhanam were negative for SARS-CoV-2. At the same time, only one of the 44 samples collected from Nilackal tested positive. The TDB president attributed this “encouraging results” to the collective effort of the departments on pilgrimage duty. Over 360 officials on Sabarimala duty had tested positive for the infection till January 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/preparations-for-makaravilakku-begin/article33541402.ece
10 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||News, TV content come in for criticism||The presentation event of the State Television Awards for the year 2019 at the Ayyankali Hall here on Saturday became a platform for strong criticism against news channels as well as the quality of content in the entertainment channels. Both Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, who inaugurated the event, and Culture Minister A.K. Balan, whose message was read by Kerala State Chalachitra Academy chairperson Kamal in his absence, spoke on the need for the channels to mend their ways at a time when they were facing stiff competition from online platforms. Mr. Surendran said the news channels in the State, which had played a remarkable role during the floods, had played a negative role after the COVID-19 outbreak. “Even some of the people at the top of some media organisations have talked to me of the issues regarding coverage by Malayalam news channels. While even the international media were praising Kerala for its efforts in fighting COVID-19, the news channels here were broadcasting news that would even affect our fight against the pandemic. An example for this is the news report that led to migrant workers gathering in large numbers. Before the local body elections, the channels became a tool for political propaganda, even attacking a prestigious project like the LIFE housing project with lies,” he said. He said if the channels failed to produce programmes with a progressive viewpoint, it would lead to Kerala walking back to the dark ages. “The media here itself would be in danger if that happens. Polarising debates instead of informed discussions on socio-political issues are not helping our cause. Some of these news channels are soft on political parties which stand for communal and regressive viewpoints. The people behind television serials should keep in mind that the mental health of the viewers is also paramount,” said Mr. Surendran. Media ethics Mr. Balan, in his message, said the channels should not forget media ethics when commercial interests took precedence. The decision of the jury not to award the best teleserial or the best short film for children this year as there were no deserving entries pointed to the fall in standards of television programming. He said a lifetime achievement award in television would be part of the State Television Awards from next year onwards. Thiruvananthapuram Corporation Mayor Arya Rajendran presided over the function, which was organised following COVID-19 protocols.  Side Effects directed by Sujith Sahadev was selected as the best telefilm (above 20 minutes’ duration) in the State Television Awards for the year 2019. Mr. Sahadev also won the awards for the best director, writer, and editor for the same telefilm.

For the proposed sewerage system from Poonthura to Veli, the area has been divided into four zones — F1, G1, F2 and G2. In the G1 block, covering the Poonthura, Manikyavilakom, Beemapally, Beemapally East, Valiyathura, and parts of the Vallakkadavu ward, 6.52 kilometres of PVC pipes and 1.109 kilometres of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipes have been laid. But as this network has not been completed, none of the houses in this area are connected to the city’s sewerage network, says a reply from Executive Engineer’s office to a Right To Information application submitted by Tony Oliver, president of the Trivandrum Kambavala Matsyathozhilali Federation. After the project was launched in 2013, pipes were laid at several areas by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) through a project funded by the city Corporation under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme. The private company, which had been contracted for the project, was able to construct only one of the required number of four pump houses due to lack of availability of land. The plan was later redesigned to get the network running using just one pump house. But, this change necessitated that the sewerage pipes be laid at a depth of 9 metres. Empowered committee The project dragged on due to this and came to a standstill a couple of years later, after the Empowered Committee for the project terminated the services of the contractor citing delays. Funds of Rs. 7.35 crore were spent on this project, as per the RTI reply. “For several years, all the waste water from the city used to end up at the sewage farm at Valiyathura. With the opening of the treatment plant at Muttathara, we had hope of a sewage system coming in these parts too, but to no avail,” says Mr. Oliver. In the F2 block, comprising the Kadakampally ward and parts of the Perunthanni, Muttathara and Vallakadavu wards, 73% of the work on pump house and installation of sewer pipes and manholes has been completed, as per a reply given by Water Resources Minister K. Krishnakutty in the Assembly in 2019. In the F1 block, covering Shanghumughom, Vettukad and Kannanthura wards, three pump houses were planned. Land availability But the project has not begun because of non-availability of land. In the G2 block, comprising the Puthanpally, Ambalathara and Idayar wards, and parts of Muttathara, work has not begun because land for pump house is unavailable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/citys-coast-yet-to-get-proper-sewerage-facilities/article33541526.ece
10 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Govt. ignoring NRIs’ plight: Congress||The Central and State governments are ignoring the plight of NRI returnees, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has said. He was speaking on Saturday after inaugurating the Pravasi Bharat Diwas organised by the Kerala Pradesh Pravasi Congress. Thousands of NRIs returned to India after losing their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Scarcely anything was done for their proper rehabilitation. In Kerala, many of the schemes launched by the previous United Democratic Front (UDF) government through NORKA had been halted, Mr. Chandy said. Row over Speaker Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan should step down as chairman of the Loka Kerala Sabha, UDF convenor M.M. Hassan said. The Customs was preparing to question Mr. Sreeramakrishnan in connection with the dollar and gold smuggling cases. Mr. Sreeramakrishnan continuing as chairman of the Loka Kerala Sabha was tantamount to insulting the NRK community, Mr. Hassan said. He also blamed the LDF government for ignoring the expatriate Keralite community during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Isaac Thomas presided. DCC president Neyyattinkara Sanal and other leaders were present on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-ignoring-nris-plight/article33541296.ece
10 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Assault at prison: 3 officers transferred||Three prison officials of the Poojappura Central Prison were transferred following a preliminary probe conducted by Kerala Prisons into allegations of torture meted out to a life convict in the Kevin murder case on Saturday. While prison officers Biju Kumar and Sanal were transferred to the Open Prison at Nettukaltheri, a third officer Biju Kumar has been transferred to the Special Sub-Jail in Neyyattinkara. The enquiry was conducted by Deputy Inspector General of Prisons (South Zone) P. Ajay Kumar under directions by Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services Rishi Raj Singh. The official, who submitted the report in the Thiruvananthapuram Sessions Court, recommended the transfers, pending detailed enquiry, of the three officials who were apparently on duty on January 1 when the convict Tittu Jerome had been allegedly manhandled. The incident was allegedly in connection with a purported incident of a few prisoners having consumed alcohol on December 24. While it does not ascertain the torture as alleged, the report recommended a detailed investigation on the basis of a report of findings by the medical team that was treating Tittu at the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital where he was admitted on Friday, following a Kerala High Court order. Mr. Singh, meanwhile, told mediapersons in Kannur that measures would be adopted in prisons to prevent such instances. HC intervention The High Court had intervened in the issue following a habeas corpus petition by Tittu’s parents who accused the prison officials of lodging their son in an isolated cell and brutally manhandling him. Later, an enquiry panel led by Additional District Judge II, Thiruvananthapuram, N. Seshadrinathan, reported their findings after visiting the prison and collecting the convict’s statement. The prisoner told them that he was beaten on the back of his chest and also showed a cane mark on his left foot and three cane marks on his right foot. The doctors, who were part of the panel, also found tenderness of the left renal ankle that suggested renal injury. Subsequently, Tittu was shifted to the hospital where he has been kept under surveillance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/prison-officers-transferred/article33541331.ece

10 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Post-poll, cases stay much below projected numbers||Notwithstanding projections which predicted a major surge in new cases of COVID-19 in the State after the local body polls, the case graph seems to have remained steady over the past two weeks. “The graph of new cases did show a surge in the post-poll period but it reached nowhere near the projected figures. After the initial surge, the graph plateaued. The surge was not uniform across the State as cases went up primarily in Pathanamthitta, Kollam, Ernakulam and Kottayam districts,” a senior public health official says. However, epidemiologists say that the surge may not be ‘visible,’ especially in northern districts like Malappuram and Kannur, where testing has been inadequate. Health officials say that people are now reluctant to undergo testing, because they do not want to go into quarantine. People also know that they can remain at home unless they developed serious disease . Two weeks ago the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) came up with a post-poll projection that by mid-January, Kerala could report between 11,000-12,000 cases daily and that the active caseload could go up to 1.2 lakh cases. However, going by the reported cases over the two weeks, the case graph is unlikely to reach the projected numbers. (On Thursday, the new cases in Kerala was 5,051 and the active case load, 64,445.) New cases, which had shown negative growth throughout November, suddenly showed an increase by 5.6% in the second week of December. Between December 7-13, the State had reported 32,938 cases. This went up to 36,539 cases during December 14 to 20. Cases dipped again between December 21-17 to register 34,647 cases. Though the cases were expected to spike, last week, the increase was just marginal, with 35,048 cases between December 28-January 3. Overall, the State’s test positivity rate actually went down to 9.5% last week from 9.9% the week before.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/post-poll-cases-stay-much-below-projected-numbers/article33541386.ece
10 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Vidyajyothi to be given to city schools too||The district panchayat’s Vidyajyothi programme to boost the pass percentage of students in the SSLC examinations is to be extended to students in the city Corporation limits. The programme was launched in 2015-16 in schools under the district panchayat to provide extra attention to students not faring well in academics and improve their academic standards. In 2018-19, it was extended to the higher secondary level. Vidyajyothi has undergone some tweaks this academic year. With studies largely online till a few days ago and no changes to textbooks this year, the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), which is responsible for the academic support for the programme, has prepared activity-oriented worksheets for students. Till now, handbooks were prepared and distributed to schools. These handbooks contained basic concepts that children needed to grasp in each unit of the textbooks, sample question papers, unit tests, and so on. The handbooks were prepared in Science (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology), Mathematics, Social Science, and English, in both English and Malayalam mediums. This year, worksheets have replaced the handbooks. Besides the existing six subjects, the worksheets have been prepared in two more subjects—Malayalam and Hindi—as in-person learning has been negligible till this month, DIET senior lecturer Geetha Nair says. In-book form The first volume of worksheets has been prepared and printed in book form under 13 titles, in both English and Malayalam mediums. These will help students understand the content through various activities and equip them to face the examinations. Focus areas for the languages have been given adequate attention in the worksheets. A second volume, keeping in mind the focus area requirements for Science and Mathematics, too will be brought out. The second volume will most likely be available online. Intensive coaching Now that schools are open for students, on the basis of feedback from teachers, there are plans to provide intensive coaching in topics that children find difficult to comprehend. A review meeting of school headmasters will help decide the needs of students and the kind of support that will be needed. Teachers, too, will be extended support to prepare the students for the examinations, Ms. Geetha Nair says. DIET Principal Sheeja Kumari says students could be made to complete the worksheets in school itself. In case students are not coming to school, these could be sent to them online or arrangements made to deliver it to them. She says steps are under way to make available the worksheets to students in city Corporation limits using the civic body’s funds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vidyajyothi-to-be-given-to-city-schools-too/article33541514.ece

10 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Three-member gang attack police team||Tense scenes unfolded on S.S. Kovil Road at Thampanoor here on Saturday evening when a three-member gang of habitual offenders attacked a team of officers from the Fort police station and rammed their car into a police vehicle. The accused were arrested. The incident occurred around 6.15 p.m. when the police attempted to apprehend the accused Chandrabose; Feroze, aka Deepak; and Vishnu who were wanted for their alleged roles in vandalising and committing burglary at a house at Fort in December last. On learning that the trio were in a bar, the Fort police dispatched a team. Sensing police presence, the accused rammed their car into the police vehicle. Allegedly under the influence of alcohol, the gang went on to attack the police squad. However, they were soon overpowered as an additional team of police was rushed to the scene. While the three were arrested, the police suspect that one more person who was along with them managed to flee when they rammed their car into the police vehicle. Investigation was on, Fort SHO Rakesh J. said. A sub-inspector and the driver of the police vehicle suffered minor injuries. They were taken to a hospital and later discharged. Chandrabose is an accused in the Althara Bineesh murder case, while Feroze is an accused in the Renjith Krishna murder case. Cases had been registered against Feroze under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act earlier, Mr. Rakesh said. The incident bore similarities to another one that had occurred on December 24 when a joint team of the Fort and Thiruvallam police stations had come under attack during a bid to nab those involved in burglaries reported in Manacaud and Kamaleswaram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-member-gang-attack-police-team/article33541515.ece

The police identified the men as Niyas, 27, and Sanju, 21, of Kilikollur in Kollam; Navas, 19, of Thrikkovilvattom in Kollam; and Mohammed Aslam, 26, of Mangatt village, also in Kollam. They allegedly abducted Shafeek of Thazhuthala in Kollam following a dispute over not returning hired cars. On December 11, the four had entered a resort on the Varkala cliff where Shafeek who had hired the vehicles was staying. Shafeek was assaulted with lethal weapons and taken in a car to Chenthapur in Kilikollur and again beaten up. Taking him to be dead, they left Shafeek in a field at Polachira in Paravur, Kollam. A dispute between Shafeek and Ajimsha, who is yet to be arrested, over car rental allegedly led to the murder attempt. In retaliation for the attack on Shafeek, an attempt was made on the life of Shemeer of Ayathil in Kollam, who was part of the gang that attacked Shafeek. Following the incident at Varkala, both the gangs kept fighting each other in various police station limits in Kollam city.

When asked about the options available for the government, the Minister said it was looking into all legal options, including knocking on the door of the Supreme Court as the SEC had violated the directives of the apex court to conduct the elections in consultation with the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-mulling-to-move-apex-court-rb-minister/article33540953.ece

Chandrababu Naidu, has announced the elections to the gram panchayats in the State in utter disregard to people’s safety in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, Minister for Panchayat Raj Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy has alleged. Addressing the media at Kuppam on Saturday, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said, though a three-member official delegation had met Mr. Ramesh Kumar and expressed the government’s inability to conduct the elections in February in view of the massive efforts being made for the COVID-19 vaccination drive and the threat posed by the new strain of the virus, the SEC stuck to his decision only to “politically benefit Mr. Naidu.” ‘Will win hands down’ “The SEC decision is undemocratic and illogical. The government teachers too have expressed reservations against kick-starting election process at this hour of crisis,” Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said. Refuting the TDP claim that the YSRCP was afraid of facing the elections, he said his party would win them hands down whenever they were conducted. The Minister, who arrived in Chittoor district after a pilgrimage to Sabarimala, made a whirlwind visit to Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Shantipuram and Gudupalle mandals of Kuppam Assembly constituency.

Addressing a gathering of people who would be impacted if the pharmaceutical company was established, Mr. Pawan Kalyan appealed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to shower his affection on people by evolving policies that were not hazardous. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had vowed to fight against the pharma project in the run-up to the elections, the JSP president recalled, and wondered what was preventing the Chief Minister from committing himself to his plighted word. “The Chief Minister is not my enemy. But I confront his policies that lack values and vision,” Mr. Pawan Kalyan said, and explained how the proposed factory would pose a hazard to environment and people’s livelihood as well. “The pharma factory will utilise 55 lakh litres per day from the local water sources and release 45 lakh litres. The daily requirement is equal to the per-day need of the Samarlakota civic body,” said Mr. Pawan Kalyan. Referring to the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report prepared by experts of Ramky, the JSP leader said it would not pass the scientific test on the hazards of the project. “If the government is committed to going ahead with the project, it should constitute an expert team to prove that the project will not harm the marine ecosystem,” Mr. Pawan Kalyan observed. Later, JSP Political Affairs Committee chairman N. Manohar screened a four-minute video that showed how Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to stop the project and explained the health hazards in the run-up to the elections. ‘Release protesters’ Earlier, Mr. Pawan Kalyan took out a rally from Annavaram to the project site, and interacted with families of those who had been arrested following the recent violent incidents at the project site.

Samithi president Bojja Dasharatharami Reddy along with other farmer leaders condemned the efforts of the government to set up the office in Visakhapatnam. Mr. Reddy said that in the last KRM meeting in December, the government, which had earlier sought establishment of the office in Vijayawada (Amaravati) had made a fresh request to shift it to Visakhapatnam, an area that is not even remotely connected to Krishna river basin or the farmers depending on it for irrigation water. The leaders submitted a memorandum to the Gandhi statue and raised slogans demanding location of the office in Kurnool as Srisailam is the major reservoir catering to the drinking water and irrigation needs of the people and every year depending on the availability of the water, decisions need to be taken in the KRMB, hence locating it in Kurnool would be beneficial, he said. A meeting of all farmer bodies and leaders is scheduled on January 6 in Vijayawada and they took a decision to urge the government to establish the office in Kurnool instead of Visakhapatnam, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-want-krmb-office-in-kurnool/article33541472.ece

In a video conference, Mr. Naidu pointed out that the poll notification would be released on January 23 and the whole exercise would be completed by February 17. He alleged that a secular rule in the State came to an end when Jagan Mohan Reddy became Chief Minister and “unleashed a tyranny” against people of the State. There was no safety to anything, temples and temple properties were under attack, he said. The incoherent behaviour of the Chief Minister was subjecting people of the State to miseries, he said, alleging that the 19-month rule of the YSRCP was replete with atrocities against the Dalits. Muslims were at the receiving end of the autocratic rule of the YSRCP, he alleged, claiming that the TDP had been rescuing them wherever they were targeted. The TDP had established the Waqf Board and had also constructed Haj Bhavans. In the TDP rule, equal importance was given to development of the graveyards for Hindus, Muslims and Christians. Central funds allocated under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act were utilised to develop these places. But the YSRCP stalled these works, he alleged. He said the Jagan government’s decision to allot lands to the poor in Hindus’ graveyards was unfortunate. He said the only way to teach the YSRCP a lesson was to vote it out of power in the coming polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-switches-to-poll-mode/article33541550.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy and the SEC were engaging in a “personal” war, defeating the spirit of the Constitution, and urged Mr. Ramesh Kumar to call for an all-party meeting on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/decision-unilateral-alleges-sailajanath/article33541465.ece

10 January 2021||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Poorly-built free lanes take a toll on exempted vehicles||Drivers of exempted vehicles are facing an ordeal while passing through the free lane at toll plazas constructed by the National Highways Authority of India at Bhogapuram, Chilakapalem and Narasannapeta. While all lanes are properly paved and are wide enough for large vehicles to pass, the free lanes meant for auto-rickshaws, two-wheelers and exempted vehicles are narrow and poorly built, making it difficult for drivers of such vehicles to pass through. “Irrespective of toll tax, all vehicle owners pay taxes in different forms to the government for maintenance of the roads. It is the responsibility of the NHAI to ensure construction of proper lanes for exempted vehicles also at toll plazas as they cannot pass through the other lanes. Not ensuring proper free lanes is highly deplorable. Vehicles suffer damage to the underbody due to the bad roads. Drivers new to the area will be in for a rude surprise if they fail to completely slow down before entering the free lane,” said Kantubhukta Srinivasa Rao, former president of the Vizianagaram Bar Association. Some exempted vehicles are even entering cash payment lanes just to avoid passing through the free lane and risking damage to their vehicles. It leads to traffic jams in cash payment lanes where service is poor. “NHAI should direct contractors to improve the road conditions at toll plazas as the amount to be spent is very little but helps many people every day,” said A.P. Lorry Owners’ Association State vice-president M. Janakiram Reddy. Toll gate supervisers told The Hindu that construction of roads on both sides would be beneficial for them too as the exempted vehicles would not then need to come into cash and FasTag lanes. They said that the issue would be brought to NHAI officials of Visakhapatnam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/poorly-built-free-lanes-take-a-toll-on-exempted-vehicles/article33541492.ece

10 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||13,900 in TS to get vaccine on Jan. 16||Around 13,900 people in Telangana would receive vaccine against COVID-19 on the first day of the much awaited COVID-19 immunisation drive which is set to be rolled out from January 16. The State’s Health Minister Eatala Rajender said on Saturday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would interact with staff in two vaccine centres in the State on January 16. Mr Rajender said that he would take the first vaccine dose. However, officials from the State Health department have mentioned on multiple occasions earlier that the priority will be given to healthcare workers, front line workers from other departments such as municipality, people above 50 years of age, and those under 50 years with co-morbidities. List of beneficiaries from Health and other departments is being fed into COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN). General population can self-register in Co-WIN. However, the Co-WIN app or website did not go live till Saturday evening. A few hours after Ministry of Health and Family Welfare announced-on Saturday- that the drive will kick off from January 16, the State Health department officials participated in a meeting with the Ministry’s officials. Around 1200 vaccination centres in the State were identified in the State. On the first day, the vaccines will be given in 139 centres. “There will be two to three centres in each district, and more centres in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC),” the State Health Minister said. Till date, at least two dry runs of the vaccination programme were held in the State. Officials have been anticipating that the drive will roll out from next week. A few of them and staff heaved sigh of relief that it will begin after Sankranti. The vaccine doses were not received till Saturday evening. Officials said that they have made preparations to store the vaccine. They said that temperature in walk-in coolers at State Health campus were set at two degrees indicating readiness to store the vials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/13900-in-ts-to-get-vaccine-on-jan-16/article33541269.ece
10 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Now, RTC bus pass at your doorstep||Applying for and obtaining Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) bus passes across categories has now become easier as staff will now arrive at your doorstep, collect the application, and deliver the travel document within a matter of a few hours. The move is part of the transport juggernaut’s attempts to build confidence among bus passengers of the Greater Hyderabad Zone, and also to increase the occupancy ratio (OR), and drive revenues forward, both of which have taken a hit post the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Pre-COVID occupancy According to data, the TSRTC’s OR in 2018-19 was a little over 70. In the subsequent year, it dipped marginally to around 69. However, given the pandemic, the OR since resumption of services plummeted to around 49. “Instead of going to the 30 bus pass counters, we have decided to send our staff to the doorstep of offices where there will be a minimum of five people desiring to take bus passes. For example, they will arrive an hour early to work, go to the doorstep of those who have applied for bus passes and, on the way back, deliver them,” said a senior TSRTC official. The move is also intended to encourage passengers to use bus passes. Before the lockdown, the TSRTC used to generate substantial revenue by means of issuing of different categories of bus passes of around Rs. 75 lakh per day. Post the lockdown, the revenue has decreased to less than half. Bus pass applications nosedived due to education in schools and colleges moving to the digital space. Further, with work-from-home being the norm, especially in the IT corridor, a large number of support staff working in IT and ITeS companies and are bus pass holders have not applied for the passes. Pick up, drop In a separate development ahead of Sankranti, the transport juggernaut will offer point-to-point pick up for passengers to destinations which do not have a direct route. For instance, a group of passengers travelling from the same neighbourhood in Chengicherla to Palakonda in Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh can book the tickets. A TSRTC bus will arrive at their doorstep, pick them up and drop them to a destination as specified by them. “We are looking at a minimum of 30 passengers. There is no direct bus to Palakonda. One has to go to Srikakulam first and then take a connecting bus to Palakonda. We have launched this initiative ahead of Sankranti. Now, this will be available for different destinations throughout the year,” said Greater Hyderabad Zone executive director V. Venkateshwarlu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/now-rtc-bus-pass-at-your-doorstep/article33541222.ece
10 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Genco’s two new units by March-end||As the demand for energy is going up steadily in the State for the last three weeks with the agricultural activity of the Yasangi season gaining momentum, power utilities are gearing up to meet the increasing demand for energy along with their preparedness to meet the expected peak demand during February-March. The peak demand (load) on the system has crossed 11,530 megawatt during this week and the consumption has touched 212 million units on January 5, with the intensified transplantation of water-intensive paddy and horticultural crops. Yasangi crops have already been cultivated in over 15 lakh acres with over 7 lakh acres being paddy. On their part, the power utilities have tied up with short, medium and long term power purchase agreements to meet the demand, which is expected to cross the 14,000 mw barrier during the February-March period. In addition, they also have plans to make some capacity addition to reduce the burden of spot purchases (from the exchange) of power. “Work on the third unit of the 4×270 MW Bhadradri Thermal Power Station has already been completed and the final checks were in the process for its commissioning by the month-end,” Chairman and Managing Director of Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TS-Genco) said. It would come in handy when the demand goes up during the peak agricultural activity, he stated. Work on the fourth unit of the BTPS is also in the final stages and the Genco has plans to commission it too by March-end. But for the delays, first due to a petition in the National Green Tribunal and later on behalf of the agency executing the work, the project was planned to be completed by the end of 2018-19 itself. Officials of Transco stated that maximum load recorded in the State was on February 28 last year when the peak load on the system was 13,168 mw. Similarly, the consumption energy touched all-time high in the State on March 18 last year when it clocked 255.34 million units. “With the availability of water in most of the major reservoirs in the State, the lift irrigation schemes based on them, as also new projects such as Kaleshwaram, are expected to consume bulk of the energy demand along with the agricultural pumpsets during the peak demand period,” a Transco official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/genco-to-commission-two-new-units-by-march-end/article33541265.ece
10 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||K.T. Rama Rao’s programmes marred by strident protests||The series of inaugurations and foundation laying ceremonies on Saturday attended by Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao, were marred by raucous and concerted protests by the opposition. Newly-elected BJP corporators along with their party colleagues, protested at different venues about their names not being mentioned on the plaques, while MP A. Revanth Reddy entered into an argument about breach of protocol. Unperturbed by the uproar, however, Mr. Rama Rao attended all the programmes and appealed to the Opposition for calm and decency in politics. Tension prevailed at Mohan Nagar in L.B. Nagar circle after the minister had left the venue post inauguration of two reservoirs built by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB). Though the launch was scheduled for 12.30 p.m., the minister had left the venue before noon, by the time Mr. Revanth Reddy, another prominent invitee, arrived. Incited, Mr. Reddy entered into a heated argument with Minister Ch. Malla Reddy and legislator D. Sudheer Reddy who were at the venue. Congress workers and local leaders ripped off the TRS flags adorning the way, allegedly in retaliation for the removal of Congress party flags by municipal workers. Slogans were raised, and spot protests were conducted, causing severe traffic jam on Kothapet-Nagole road. To control the situation, the police took Mr. Revanth Reddy into detention. Earlier in the day, Mr. Rama Rao laid foundation stones for the GHMC zonal office building at Domalguda, and the modern market at Narayanguda, besides inaugurating the double-bedroom housing complex in Baghlingampally and a multipurpose sports complex at Adikmet. At all the venues, the newly elected BJP corporators along with their supporters protested inclusion of the names of incumbent corporators instead of theirs on the stone plaques. At Domalguda, the corporator G. Rachana Sri questioned non-inclusion of MLC N. Ramachander Rao’s name on the plaque, while at Baghlingampally, corporator Ravi Chary questioned why he was not called to the event. Mr. Rama Rao, however, placated them on both occasions, and invited them to join him in the ceremonies. He had to face the same situation at Adikmet too, which spiralled into slogan shouting match between BJP and TRS cadres even after the minister had left the venue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kt-rama-raos-programmes-marred-by-strident-protests/article33541243.ece
10 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Litterbugs choke artificial lake||The Katora Houz lake inside Golconda Fort has been turned into one of the largest trash bins in the city by residents of surrounding areas. Months after the wall of the 500-year-old artificial lake collapsed during incessant rain in mid-October last year, the lake is littered with garbage. The trash being dumped ranges from household trash generated every day to discarded sofa sets, stryofoam from the innards of refrigerators to building debris. “People drive their two wheelers and throw the plastic bags and drive away,” says a resident waiting outside the masjid. During daytime, goats and dogs scavenge the trash. “We have inspected the site and have made an estimation to get it repaired. Once our Delhi office gives the go-ahead, we will start work on the site,” said an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) official. “We were planning to create a barrier to prevent people from dumping waste before we start work on the site. But for doing that also, we need to get the area cleaned,” said the ASI official. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation has a garbage bin that is cleared every day but gets filled up quickly as the population in the area has increased like in the rest of the city. There are frequent quarrels between sanitary staff and residents as two other trash bins are near the Patancheru Darwaza and the GHMC office near Habshi Kaman. Two years ago, the GHMC even built a ramp inside the Katora Houz to clear the accumulated trash. The civic body hired a private agency to clear the water hyacinth to take care of the mosquito menace. While it has succeeded in diverting sewerage channels that used to drain into Katora Houz, the collapse of the retaining wall has upended whatever plans the civic body had to restore the Katora Houz to its old glory. The Katora Houz is one of the lakes built during the Qutb Shahi era (1518-1687) as a storage tank before the water was raised through Persian water wheels to higher areas of the Golconda Fort.  We have inspected the site and have made an estimation to get it repaired.

The carousal is only such for IOC with high speed filling capacity of 4,000 cylinders (14.2 kg) per hour and has three stage filling for better accuracy. Vision readers and integrated weight correction units in the carousel facilitates filling of refill cylinders to the precise weight. The plant can churn out3,900 LPG cylinders per hour, an IOC release said. The bottling plant, located on a little over 32 acres, fills around 55,000 LPG cylinders per day, translating into an annual bottling capacity of 1.80 lakh tonnes. The LPG storage capacity is 2,300 tonnes in the form of six above ground bullets, with a combined capacity of 900 tonnes, and one Horton sphere with a capacity of 1,400 tonnes. Additional tankage There are plans to establish additional LPG tankage of 2,400 tonnes in mounded storage, something the officials confirmed, but did not want to elaborate as they are at a preliminary stage. Besides the facility, IOC has another bottling plant in Thimmapur, much of whose requirement of bulk LPG is supplied from Cherlapally, which in turn receives the fuel on a pipeline from Visakhapatnam. The release said the in Cherlapally plant supplies LPG cylinders to customers through a network of over 300 Indane LPG Distributors across all Telangana, excluding Mahabubnagar, and auto LPG to all the outlets in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

10 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Congress holds day-long Rythu Deeksha||The TRS government’s sudden silence on opposing the new farm laws of the Central government came under severe criticism from Telangana Congress leaders, who accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of taking a U-turn after his visit to New Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Congress leaders, who participated in a day-long Rythu Deeksha at Indira Park, hit out at the TRS and also the BJP government, which they said, was ignoring the farmers’ protests in New Delhi in order to benefit the corporate sector at the cost of farmers. The Rythu Deeksha was organised under the leadership of Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka in support of the farmers protesting in New Delhi. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said lakhs of farmers continued their protests for the last 44 days braving the cold in New Delhi but Prime Minister Narender Modi was not considering their demands even on humanitarian grounds. He slammed Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for his U-turn saying the TRS not only supported the farmers' agitation but its ministers, MPs and MLAs, including KCR's son K. T. Rama Rao and daughter MLC K. Kavitha, took part in the Bharat Bandh programme. “However, KCR, as always, decided to sail with the BJP government announcing support to the new farm laws by scrapping the IKP and procurement centres to purchase agriculture produce.” Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy said the BJP government was not sincere in its approach and to favour a few corporates it had decided to put the future of millions of farmers at stake. He suggested that the Telangana Congress take up a Chalo Delhi programme in support of the farmers and that he would take the responsibility if the TPCC decided on it. CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka explained the pro-farmer decisions of the previous Congress governments and said Mr. Modi was hell-bent on negating all of them. He said if the nation of more than 100 crore population had become self-sufficient in foodgrains it was because of the Congress that constructed irrigation dams. He criticised KCR for scrapping the procurement centres and reminded that government was not a business organisation to talk about profits and losses while buying produce from the farmers. He said the Congress was not directly participating in the farmers protests.“We are extending support through dharnas and other means.” he said. Manthani MLA D. Sreedhar Babu asked the Chief Minister to be the “Tekhedaar” of the farmers’ interests and not see them from a rice or dal millers’ point of view. MLAs Podam Veeraiah and Jagga Reddy, AICC secretary G Chinna Reddy, AICC Kisan Congress vice chairman Kodanda Reddy, former PCC presidents V. Hanumantha Rao and Ponnala Lakshmaiah, and former ministers K. Jana Reddy and J. Geeta Reddy addressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-holds-day-long-rythu-deeksha/article33541273.ece
10 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Oncology block at NIMS gets a facelift, inaugurated||The Oncology block at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) which was completely renovated and expanded by Megha Engineering & Infrastructures Ltd. (MEIL) under its corporate social responsibility, was inaugurated by Health Minister Eatala Rajender on Saturday. A few years ago, NIMS director K. Manohar had approached MEIL managing director P.V. Reddy to construct a paediatric cancer ward. MEIL constructed a medical oncology wing on the second floor of a building on NIMS premises, with 50 beds, including five ICU beds, with ventilator facility in 2018. Around Rs. 10 crore was spent on the works and infrastructure. Head of the Medical Oncology department G. Sadashivudu said they have been experiencing overcrowding of patients due to significant increase in the number of people who opted for NIMS for cancer treatment. An average of 100 patients waited for 45 beds. Around 30 new admissions are registered at the department. Most patients who opt for treatment there avail the services under Aarogyasri Health Scheme and Employee Health Scheme. MEIL renovated the old medical oncology ward and oncology outpatient wing located on the ground and first floors, respectively. Around 35 beds are available which would be used to provide daycare treatment such as chemotherapy to cancer patients. As part of daycare facilities, the patients would be provided with doctor consultation, counselling and post treatment suggestions. MEIL chairman said based on a request, they would renovate the orthopaedic ward and food court at the institute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/oncology-block-at-nims-gets-a-facelift/article33541249.ece

Addressing a seminar organised by the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) and Asa Bhanu Japan Centre, he said this while urging entrepreneurs to explore business opportunities. Noting that Japan wass keen on expanding presence in Telangana due to investor-friendly policies of the State, the Consul General said some Japanese companies like Toshiba had already successfully invested. Japan was also associated with various infrastructure projects of Telangana such as the Outer Ring Road (ORR) of Hyderabad.

10 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Calcutta Paan price rise leaves a bitter taste||Paan lovers in Hyderabad are in for disappointment as supply of Calcutta Paan, favoured by the majority, has dried up due to unseasonal rain and floods in West Bengal. Nawabi luncheons are incomplete without an exotic assortment of mouth freshers wrapped in Calcutta Paan. However, the mouth-melting luscious paans are now leaving a bitter taste as the prices have gone through the roof, says Syed Afzal Ali, a paan lover in Humayun Nagar. Calcutta Paan flavoured with Meenakshi, gulkand, Kashmiri Qiwan and Raj Ratan Kashmiri used to be sold for Rs. 20-30 a few months ago, but now has the asking rate of Rs. 35-60. Fancy shops in uptown Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills and Madhapur charge higher given the delectable ingredients that go into the making of special paans. M. Bala Murali, whose family has been in wholesale betel leaf business for the last three generations, says Calcutta Paan is now hard to find in Telangana as well as in other parts of the country due to a severe shortage in betel leaf supply from West Bengal that has left traders gasping. Fewer baskets Every day, Telangana’s largest paan mandi at Darussalam here gets only 25-30 baskets from Kolkata, down from 35-40 baskets earlier, with each consisting of at least 4,000 leaves, he points out. Later, they are supplied to other districts in the State. According to Mr. Bala Murali, the buying price of Calcutta Paan has gone up from Rs. 400 for 100 leaves to anywhere between Rs. 1,800 and Rs. 2,500. That is more than a six-fold increase, but paan makers are sure that they cannot raise the price of a ready-to-consume paan to that level, asserts Pan Shop Owners Association of India general secretary Mohammed Salahuddin Dakhni. “Some shop owners are getting only a few leaves and making paan for old, regular customers. Others are turned away since we do not want any arguments over the new pricing. We are in dire straits now but nobody cares about our plight,” he says. Mr. Bala Murali says Assam is the largest consumer of Calcutta Paan, followed by Varanasi, Prayagraj, Lucknow, Nagpur, Mumbai and Hyderabad. He adds that Telangana is the only south Indian State which gets the paan from West Bengal. General shortage On the other hand, the usual betel leaves have been in short supply since the recent Chennai floods, and hence, the price of all paans, especially that of speciality paans, have shot through the roof. “These days, the market is getting chewing leaves supply from Chennai, as most of the farmers in Chittoor and Kadapa districts of Andhra Pradesh are supplying the harvest there,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/calcutta-paan-price-rise-leaves-a-bitter-taste/article33541254.ece

One Channabathina Ravi (30) of Shiva Traders, who employed the children, was arrested and handed over to the local police.

In another case, the Anti-Human Trafficking unit raided Sri Pavan Putra Plaster Company and Laxman’s Plaster Company and rescued 10 children, including two from Uttar Pradesh and seven from Maharashtra, police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fifteen-child-labourers-rescued/article33541258.ece
10 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Probe by HC judge into land deals sought||The BJP has demanded an inquiry by a sitting High Court judge into the controversial land deals at Hafeezpet, Miyapur and in the suburbs of the twin cities. “The ongoing land disputes are not an issue between two families but just the tip of the iceberg of the nefarious activities happening on the real estate front with the connivance of ruling party bigwigs,” alleged party vice -president and former MLA N.V.S.S.Prabhakar at a press conference on Friday. ‘KTR should resign’ The BJP leader demanded that Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister K.T. Rama Rao resign to facilitate the probe, especially in the light of allegations surfacing. The gangs were not sparing even lands belonging to temples as was evident during the recent bid to snatch land belonging to the Kala Matha temple in the old city. “All these illegal activities have become rampant because the government and the CM’s Office have been shielding the corrupt from facing any penal action. Mafia gangs dealing in real estate, liquor, drugs and sand have become emboldened under the protection of people at the top,” accused Mr. Prabhakar. The so-called reforms of ‘Dharani’ and the Layout Regularisation Scheme appeared to be meant to facilitate illegal deals and not for the benefit of the common man. T he lack of clarity with regard to the Nizam properties and Wakf land was being utilised by the Majlis-TRS combine to make a fast buck. This also could be one of the reasons for the government delay in swearing in newly elected corporators and electing the new Mayor, he maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/probe-by-hc-judge-into-land-deals-sought/article33541270.ece

10 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Mafia controlling all lands in Telangana’||Former MP and BJP leader, Vijayashanti has said the recent developments indicate that land mafia was controlling every inch of Telangana and the TRS leaders names were invariably connected to every land scam in the State. In a statement here, she said land mafia seemed to have not left any space in Telangana including lakes and parks meant for protection of environment and the government seemed to have failed totally in controlling them. The land sharks were increasing with tacit support of the Telangana rulers, she alleged. She said because of the lenient attitude of the government land cases were piling up in the courts. The Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao's much-touted Dharani had only increased the problems of people and the realtors leading to further litigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mafia-controlling-all-lands-in-telangana/article33541274.ece

The ABVP activists said walls on the eastern side of the campus had been demolished to pave way for some colonies occupied by people playing a key role in the government. A 120 feet road was being constructed in the land, which had been with the university since its inception, said ABVP UoH Secretary Karnia Singh. Uday Inala, ABVP Central working committee member, said that the university administration too remained silent on the encroachment but the students would continue to fight to save the lands for future generations. The organisation demanded that police cases be filed against the encorachers and immediate survey be taken up to fix the varsity boundaries.

R.L.Murthy, president and T, Nagaraju, State secretary of SFI in a statement said students who were fighting against the encroachments were being threatened with police cases and the varsity administration, which had the responsibility of safeguarding the lands, was also mysteriously silent, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/save-uoh-lands-abvp/article33541275.ece
10 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||WhatsApp users concerned about new privacy policy||After WhatsApp, one of the biggest messaging services, recently sent notifications to users about a planned update in its terms and privacy policy, several users, expressing concerns, have either moved or are planning to move to other messaging services. The updates concern aspects such as location information, connecting WhatsApp services with Facebook Companies Products, and data which could be shared with third parties, among others. Several WhatsApp users said that they were uncomfortable with the new policy and began to move either to Signal or Telegram. Entrepreneur Fatema Kanchwala who was been on WhatsApp for many years said that after reading the privacy policy, which would come into force in February, she was planning to move to Signal. “The new WhatsApp privacy policy is indeed scary and I am definitely eyeing switching to Signal for both personal and professional conversations. Being a home baker, most of my conversations with my customers take place online - on Instagram or WhatsApp - and with this new rollout, the data privacy is questionable,” she says. Similarly research scholar Fasiullah Shaik too expressed similar views. For him, transparency and how his data is used is important. “A sudden change in its privacy policy puts my data at risk. I have decided to switch to Telegram. Migrating from WhatsApp to another platform at a stroke is not easy. Besides being emotionally challenging, it is technically difficult as well,” he says. To move to the other messenger, he says, will be done in phases. Harish Kotra, a techie raises a point. He says that privacy is a largely ignored concept in India as compared to Western countries. “The fact that people are taking cognisance of the importance of privacy is good. The challenge is with moving the older generation to other messengers,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/whatsapp-users-concerned/article33541282.ece

10 January 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Ground water level goes up in Sangareddy dist.||Thanks to the rains that hit the district last year, the groundwater levels have increased considerably. With Manjeera, Singur and Nallavagu full with water, it has resulted in recharging the dried up borewells. The groundwater was up by 7.06 metres in December 2020, when compared with December 2019. For instance in Nyalakal mandal, the groundwater level stood at 28.08 metres in December 2019 whereas it has rose to 13.7 metres in December 2020 with an uplift of 14.91 metres. In Gummadidala, the increase was of 12.46 metres followed by 12.16 metres in Zaheeerabad, 10.88 metres in Pulkal, and 10.45 metres in Raikod. The impact of increase in groundwater levels was such that many apartments in the district headquarters got their bores recharged and they have given up hiring of tankers. In apartments, every portion was charged a minimum of Rs. 800 per tanker. For many, the expectations are that there will be no problem for groundwater for the next two years. “There will be no water scarcity for the next two years given the present conditions. By that time we are hopeful that Kaleshwaram water will be diverted from Kondapochammasagar to Mahabubsagar in Sangareddy through a canal under initial stage of construction,” said an officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ground-water-level-goes-up-in-sangareddy-dist/article33541511.ece

10 January 2021||Aurangabad,||900 hens die at poultry farm in Parbhani||As many as 900 hens have died at a poultry farm in Murumba village in Parbhani district, a senior official said on Saturday. Their samples have been sent for examination to identify the cause of death, said Parbhani district collector Deepak Mulgikar. He said the poultry farm is run by a self-help group. “This farm has 8,000 birds and 900 died over two days. No death was reported in the last 24 hours,” he said. Prima facie, the deaths could be related to nutrition, he said, adding that the test results are awaited. So far, Maharashtra has not reported any cases of bird flu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/900-hens-die-at-poultry-farm-in-parbhani/article33541364.ece
10 January 2021||Bhandara,||“Victims’ kin complained of power fluctuations”||The families of some of the 10 infants killed in a fire that broke out at Bhandara district hospital on Saturday had complained about power fluctuations but no action was taken, a former State minister has alledged. The scale and nature of the incident left the people of the city shaken and condolences poured in from various sections of society. While politicians, including current and former ministers, were allowed inside the building, scarcely anybody else was. Access was restricted as barricades were put up to keep the media away as restless crowds milled outside, anxious for information on the deaths of the infants, aged between one and three months, in the neonatal unit.  Hospital authorities were tightlipped, refusing to divulge any information on the tragedy that had made national headlines. As anxiety mounted, speaking to those allowed inside was the only way for reporters to get information and try and piece together the facts. Former Maharashtra energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule of the BJP claimed that relatives of the infants had complained about power fluctuations in the ward for the last week. “I spoke with relatives of the deceased infants. They told me that power fluctuations had been happening in the hospital ward since the last seven days. The relatives had asked the hospital staff to check the electric switches, but apparently no action was taken,” he said. Demanding a high-level inquiry, Mr. Bawankule alleged that the hospital didn’t have proper fire safety and electrical equipment. He said a proposal to buy fire safety equipment worth over Rs. 1 crore sent by the hospital to the principal secretary, health, and director of health, is awaiting approval. Covered in ash, dust While most people were not allowed inside, photographs of soot and smoke from the ward gave an indication of the intensity of the fire and its aftermath. The walls were blackened, only the occasional patch of yellow showing through, the floor was thick with ash and dust and much of the furniture was charred. The metal stretchers and a few other accoutrements of a special hospital care unit such as the drip stand survived the fire, which broke out around 1.30 a.m. In the midst of the gloom shone a bright blue and white sign saying LED. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope told reporters that at least three of the 10 infants died of burn injuries, while seven suffocated to death because of the smoke. District civil surgeon Pramod Khandate said there were 17 babies in the unit and seven were rescued. A nurse first noticed smoke coming out from the neonatal section and alerted doctors who reached there in five minutes, he said. Fire brigade personnel rescued seven babies from the ‘inbound ward’ but could not save the 10 other babies. Mr. Khandate said the ward where newborns are kept requires a continuous supply of oxygen. “There were fire extinguishers and staff used them to douse the fire. There was too much smoke,” he added.  Fluctuations in power had been happening in the hospital ward since the last seven days.

10 January 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Probe ordered into embankment case||The Odisha Lokayukta directed the State Vigilance Directorate to investigate if a road embankment was blown up at the instance of a Biju Janata Dal MLA and an engineer to cover up corruption. The Lokayukta directed while hearing a petition filed by RTI activist Sarbeswar Beura. Mr. Beura had alleged that some people, who were involved in substandard construction of an irrigation embankment in Jajpur district, had deliberately blown it up using dynamites during flood on August 28 last year. They had carried out the alleged act in order to give an impression that the swirling floodwaters had caused the breach. The embankment from Gokarneswar to Majhipada on National Highway-5 was widened and improved at a cost of Rs. 21.99 crore through a private contractor. “Dharmasala MLA Pranab Balabantray and JE Naren Jena took money from the contractor, who used substandard material. To cover up, the MLA and JE hired miscreants to blow up the embankment,” the complainant said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/probe-ordered-into-embankment-case/article33541155.ece
10 January 2021||GUWAHATI,||Akhil Gogoi named chief of new party in Assam||The Raijor Dal, a three-month-old political party formed by about 70 organisations, has named jailed peasants’ rights activist Akhil Gogoi as its president. He will lead the party from the Central Jail in Guwahati, party leaders said during the three-day conference of the Raijor Dal that concluded in eastern Assam’s Moranhat on Saturday. ‘BJP leaders afraid’ “The government is keeping Akhil Gogoi in jail because the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are afraid to face him in the electoral battlefield,” said the Dal’s working president Bhasco de Saikia. The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), a peasants’ rights organisation founded by Mr. Gogoi two decades ago, had taken the initiative of forming the Raijor Dal in October 2020. There are speculation about the Raijor Dal tying up with another new regional party, the Assam Jatiya Parishad, for the election. But the Dal leaders said the decision has been kept in abeyance. Mr. Gogoi’s anointment as the Raijor Dal president followed the rejection of his bail plea by the Gauhati High Court on January 7. He was arrested by the police in December 2019 when the protests in Assam against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) had turned violent, claiming at least five lives. He was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency in an earlier case registered against him for alleged links with the CPI(Maoist). The NIA had charged him with sedition, intention to cause riot against national integration, punishment for criminal conspiracy and unlawful association under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the State government did not have any role in Mr. Gogoi’s arrest. He also clarified that NIA arrested him for his alleged links with the Maoists and not for fomenting violence during the anti-CAA protests. “NIA mentioned in its chargesheet that he (Mr. Gogoi) had attempted to carry out activities in Assam at the behest of the CPI(Maoist) after getting some KMSS members trained at its camps,” Dr. Sarma said. The elections to the 126-member Assam Assembly are expected by May.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/akhil-gogoi-named-chief-of-new-party-in-assam/article33541153.ece
10 January 2021||GUWAHATI,||Arunachal wants to recruit porters for moving foodgrains in remote areas||Arunachal Pradesh has sought a return to the British-era system of using porters to transport foodgrains in remote administrative circles to save on air freight charges paid or payable to the Indian Air Force.  “We have a backlog of Rs. 337 crore in air freight charges to be paid to the IAF for service in 13 air-fed circles of the State. It is high time we reintroduce the porter system for transportation of foodgrains,” State Food and Civil Supplies Minister Kamlung Mosang said. He saw merit in going back to the old system of people lugging essentials on steep mountainous tracks and through jungles. “This will not only minimise the expenditure on air freight charges but also create job opportunities for the rural youth in areas along the State’s international borders,” Mr. Mosang said, adding that he had directed the officials concerned to work out a plan for obtaining the approval of the State Cabinet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/arunachal-wants-to-recruit-porters-for-moving-foodgrains-in-remote-areas/article33541154.ece
10 January 2021||JAIPUR,||Pro-Vasundhara Raje outfit creates ripples in Rajasthan||The formation of a new outfit in support of former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has created ripples in the political circles in Rajasthan, with its office-bearers claiming to be “active Bharatiya Janata Party members” and raising the banner for Ms. Raje’s appointment as the CM for the third time in the event of the party’s victory in the 2023 Assembly elections.  Office-bearers appointed The letterhead of the ‘Vasundhara Raje Samarthak Rajasthan Manch’, which closely resembles that of the BJP, carries the pictures of Ms. Raje and her mother Vijaya Raje Scindia. The Manch has appointed its office-bearers in 25 districts and announced its plans to generate awareness about the schemes, policies and works of the governments led by Ms. Raje in the past. Manch convenor Vijay Bharadwaj said here on Saturday that the outfit was formed last month with the objective of strengthening the BJP and supporting Ms. Raje. “We will work to ensure BJP’s victory in the next Assembly election and return of Ms. Raje as the Chief Minister,” he said, adding that the wings for women and youth and an IT cell would also be created shortly. The Manch has been floated in the midst of rumours about Ms. Raje’s growing differences with BJP’s State leadership and the increasing clout of the party’s central leaders in the State. Ms. Raje’s absence in a meeting convened by BJP national president J.P. Nadda in New Delhi earlier this week on the upcoming Assembly byelection in the State was also perceived as an attempt to sideline her. The new entity’s formation is being seen in the political circles here as an effort of Ms. Raje’s supporters to assert her authority amid friction in the party. The BJP State unit has taken a stand that the Manch was only being floated on the social media platforms and the central leadership would take a decision on it. Ms. Raje, who has been conspicuous by her absence in the posters of BJP’s regular events, has generally maintained silence on the issues of the State and avoided making a public appearance. She held the Chief Minister’s post twice in Rajasthan, first from 2003 to 2008 and later between 2013 and 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pro-vasundhara-raje-outfit-creates-ripples-in-rajasthan/article33541157.ece

10 January 2021||Mumbai,||NCB arrests British national, 2 others with high-grade drugs||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Saturday arrested three persons, including a British national, for allegedly supplying imported strains of ganja in the city, an official said. One of those arrested is a suspect in the drug case being probed after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year, he added. Over 200 kg of ganja, including imported strains like ‘OG Kush’ (a strain of cannabis indica), and curated marijuana, some of which had been sourced from the United States as well as local areas, were recovered in the NCB action. “A team of NCB’s Mumbai unit led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede conducted a raid in Bandra (West) and seized ganja from a courier initially. It also conducted searches in Khar (West) and recovered a huge stash of imported strains of ganja from British national Karan Sajnani,” he said. Mr. Sajnani’s questioning revealed the role of Rahila Furniturewala, a suspect in the drug probe following Rajput’s death. “Contraband like ganja and bud [street slang for marijuana and hashish] was recovered from Furniturewala, who was also providing financial aid to the network. Shaista, the sister of Rahila, was also arrested with ganja. The drugs were rolled into joints by Sajnani for supply to high-class clients in Mumbai and other States,” the official said. Earlier in the day, the NCB’s Mumbai unit conducted searches across the the city in connection with the drugs case linked to Rajput’s death. Several people were apprehended during these searches, and questioning of some of them is under way, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ncb-arrests-british-national-2-others-with-high-grade-drugs/article33541363.ece
10 January 2021||Mumbai,||Plea seeking compensation for erectile dysfunction surgery rejected||The Additional Thane District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has dismissed a man’s plea seeking compensation from a private insurance company for a surgery to treat erectile dysfunction. The forum ruled that drugs for the ailment are not covered by plans based on the National Medicare Guidelines. The man obtained a rider policy from March 2016 to March 2018, which increased the sum assured, and a top-up policy from November 2017 to November 2019 from ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company. On January 22, 2018, he wrote to the company seeking a pre-authorisation letter for a penile implant surgery. Rejecting the request, the company said, “Present ailment for which treatment is being availed is not covered; hence the cashless hospitalisation request is rejected.” He sent a legal notice to the company on February 1, 2018, but did not receive a reply. He underwent the surgery on February 16, 2018. The man then moved the forum seeking Rs. 6.24 lakh with 18% interest from March 2018, Rs. 2 lakh as compensation, and Rs. 30,000 for the mental torture suffered. The company’s counsel in its reply denied deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. The counsel said the request was rejected as the ailment is not covered under its mediclaim policy. The Bench, comprising presiding member G.M. Kapse and member S.A. Petkar, said the case is based on terms and conditions of the policy, pre-authorisation letter, and medical certificate of the doctor. The Bench said, “Under the law, drugs to treat erectile dysfunction are excluded from the coverage unless they are used as a part of treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for a different situation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-seeking-compensation-for-erectile-dysfunction-surgery-rejected/article33541365.ece

10 January 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. looking for students to play role of ‘wetland mitras’||The Delhi government is looking for schoolchildren aged above 12, and others for the role of “wetlandmitras” for local-level participation for conservation of wetlands and creating awareness about the same. A person selected by the government can work for two years and will get a certificate from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. The Delhi government has issued a notice inviting interested people to apply to be “wetlandmitras”. “Wetlands play an important role in groundwater recharging, biodiversity, climate change and flood control. They are critical habitat for domestic and migratory birds. They fulfill livelihood needs of nearby residents too. But due to regular anthropogenic activities and misuse they are in a stage of degradation,” the notice stated. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi came back to power in 2019, he announced a 100-day agenda and in connection with this, the Union Environment Ministry had sent a letter to all States to identify wetlands in the States. In the letter, it was mentioned that the World Wildlife Fund had floated the idea of assigning “wetlandmitras” to increase public participation in conservation. “This was just a suggestion, but it was implemented in Kerala and we adopted the Kerala model. We get many complaints from people regarding air pollution, but we do not get anything on wetlands. The idea is to increase public participation on wetlands,” said K.S Jayachandran, Member Secretary of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. “Any individual who can provide their time and services for the protection, management and beautification of their nearby wetland/s can apply to become wetlandmitras,” the notice read. Interested students and others should visit the website of Delhi Parks and Gardens Society.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-govt-looking-for-students-to-play-role-of-wetland-mitras/article33541150.ece

10 January 2021||Washington,||Twitter bans Donald Trump, citing risk of violent incitement||Twitter banned President Donald Trump’s account on Friday, citing “the risk of further incitement of violence” following the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. Twitter has long given Mr. Trump and other world leaders broad exemptions from its rules against personal attacks, hate speech and other behaviours. But in a detailed explanation posted on its blog on Friday, the company said recent Trump tweets amounted to glorification of violence when read in the context of the Capitol riot and plans circulating online for future armed protests around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. The social platform has been under growing pressure to take further action against Mr. Trump following the Wednesday violence. On Thursday, Facebook suspended Mr. Trump’s account through January 20 and possibly indefinitely. Twitter merely suspended Mr. Trump’s account for 12 hours after he posted a video that repeated false claims about election fraud and praised the rioters who stormed the Capitol. Mr. Trump’s Twitter persona has long functioned as a mix of policy announcements, often out of the blue; complaints about the media; disparagement of women, minorities and his perceived enemies; and praise for his supporters, replete with exclamation marks, all-caps, and one-word declarations such as “Sad!”He has fired numerous officials on Twitter and his posts, like his speeches at rallies, are a torrent of misinformation. @POTUS remains live  The official account for the President of the United States, @POTUS, remains live. In fact, Mr. Trump, who issued a statement on Friday evening that denounced Twitter as an enemy of free speech, floated the idea that he might build his own “platform”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/twitter-bans-donald-trump-citing-risk-of-violent-incitement/article33540838.ece

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Malé makes no apology for ties with India’||Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih , rose to power in 2018, promising democratic governance and justice to citizens. While the two years he has completed in office have seen major policy changes, his incumbent government faces many challenges, only heightened by the pandemic. In an email interview, President Solih speaks on economic revival plans, regional cooperation, and responds to criticism over his government’s “over-reliance” on India. Excerpt:  Mr. President, you have completed over two years in office. How would you evaluate your performance? This administration has accomplished much in the past two years across every major policy sphere. We have made education free up to the first undergraduate degree; initiated a health sector reform programme which has seen the upgrading of medical centres; we’ve strengthened our decentralisation legislation to empower local communities and reverse decades of over-centralisation. We have also demonstrated our commitment to gender equality by legally mandating that 1/3rd of our local councils be comprised of women and by appointing the first ever women justices to the Maldives’ Supreme Court. We have repealed regressive legislation such as a defamation act that criminalised speech critical of the government. On the international front we have reinvigorated our relationships with our global partners, re-entered the Maldives into important organisations such as the Commonwealth of Nations, and reiterated our ambitions towards mitigation and adaption against the climate emergency. Like the rest of the world, the Maldives too is reeling under the impact of the pandemic. How do you plan to revive your economy? Our economy has long been reliant on tourism. The pandemic and the consequent restrictions on global air travel have adversely affected this industry and the overall economy. With the reopening of our borders, and stringent health measures in place at our resorts in accordance with guidelines developed by our health authorities and Tourism Ministry, the tourism industry is now slowly recovering, as is our economy. However, the pandemic has also made clear the danger of our economy being overly reliant on a single sector. We will also need international assistance and support for our recovery efforts, to shore up our depleted foreign currency reserves, and reduce our debt burden. The Maldivian Auditor-General recently voiced concern over your government’s “heavy reliance” on a single country for grants, alluding to India. Given that Male-New Delhi bilateral relations improved drastically after your election, how do you respond to that? We appreciate the proactive role that India has taken in economic relief efforts and providing financial assistance to the Maldives, as well as for its continued development assistance. We are also very happy that bilateral relations have improved with India, as it has between the Maldives and many of our partners across the globe. The Maldives is keen to engage with all our partners. It is significant, because the political opposition and critics of your government have accused your administration of “selling off Maldives” to India, taking out rallies on Male’s streets and leading ‘India out’ campaigns on social media. Moving away from an isolationist foreign policy and engaging with our neighbours strengthen our national security and increase respect for us as a sovereign country. The Maldives makes no apologies for our positive engagement with our largest neighbour, and one of our closest international partners, India. We welcome constructive criticism of our foreign policy, as well as other aspects of our governance. Undermining relationships that are in the interest of the Maldives for the sake of demagoguery and cheap political points is irresponsible. One of your key election promises was that your government will revisit the deals signed by the Yameen administration with China - loans and infrastructure projects - if elected. Have you been able to restructure the debt — over $ 1.4 billion — Male owes Beijing? China is a close and valued partner to the Maldives. We welcome their participating in the G20’s DSSI [Debt Service Suspension Initiative], and appreciate that we have been able to positively engage with them to renegotiate the terms of ongoing development assistance and economic projects, in a manner mutually beneficial to both countries, and consistent with our friendly relations. Your government recently signed a defence deal with the U.S., and another agreement with Japan to strengthen your Coast Guard. Last month, the Indian Foreign Secretary visited your capital. Is Male leaning towards the ‘Quad’ bloc? The Maldives’ priorities lie in a peaceful Indian Ocean region. Our international engagements are to enhance our commercial cooperation, strengthen regional peace and security, facilitate economic prosperity for our country, and voice out on issues important to us on the international fora, such as climate change and environmental preservation. We will pursue our goals alongside our partners who share our mutual priorities. The geopolitical contest in the region has escalated this year, especially after the border tensions between India and China. How does this impact the Maldives and your foreign policy choices? Not at all. The Maldives believes that differences between international partners can be settled peacefully through dialogue and mediation. While this is ongoing, it does not hinder our ability to constructively engage with our partners on issues of mutual interest. What, in your view, are the prospects for regional cooperation, including through SAARC, in the Indian Ocean Region in this difficult climate of the pandemic and persisting bilateral tensions between India and Pakistan? I reiterate that regional differences should be settled amicably through means and solutions agreeable to all concerned. While it is not in the Maldives’s policy to comment on disagreements between two sovereign countries, we also believe that such disputes are best resolved through strengthening multilateral and regional cooperation mechanisms, and using such channels for frequent dialogue and mediation. While the pandemic may be a challenge towards realising such ends in the immediate future I believe it has made especially evident that major global issues and crises cannot be contained to borders, and will thus help galvanise efforts to strengthen regional cooperation frameworks in the long-term. The Maldives is happy to be part of such efforts.  Moving away from an isolationist foreign policy and engaging with our neighbours strengthen our national security||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/mal-makes-no-apology-for-ties-with-india/article33540835.ece
10 January 2021||COLOMBO,||Removal of war victims’ memorial at Jaffna University sparks tension||A tense situation continued at the Jaffna University on Saturday, as dozens of locals, students, and politicians gathered overnight, protesting the removal of a war memorial on campus. According to students and eyewitnesses, on Friday night university authorities bulldozed a sculpture, of hands held out of water, erected in memory of several thousand civilians brutally killed in the final phase of the civil war in 2009, in Mullivaikkal in Sri Lanka’s northern Mullaitivu district. “We heard about this move to destroy the memorial and I rushed from my home in Vavuniya and got here at 2 a.m. Students and some local politicians had gathered here, and there was a heavy police presence,” said Pakianathan Ujanthan, President of the Jaffna Students’ Union. “Despite the police and the army in and around our premises, we continued the protests outside. Later, when police told us they would subject us to PCR tests, we decided to suspend our agitation,” he said. ‘Erasing’ history Following early reports of the development, social media users expressed shock, terming it an attack on Tamils’ attempt to memorialise, and an attempt by the Sri Lankan state “to erase” the troubling history around the massacre of scores of civilians in the country. When contacted, S.W.M. Senarathne, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police, Jaffna, said: “The decision to demolish the unauthorised structure was taken by the university administration. Our personnel were deployed there only after we heard students were gathering outside the campus last night. In this pandemic period, it is our responsibility to prevent such gatherings.” Pressure from the State The memorial, local media reports said, was erected in 2019, to mark the 10th anniversary of the civil war. “Since then, authorities have been asking the university administration to remove the unauthorised structure. I received multiple instructions from higher authorities, and this was discussed at several meetings with the university’s capital works, engineering and maintenance departments,” said University Vice-Chancellor S. Srisatkunarajah, who assumed charge in August 2020. Asked who the higher authorities were, he said: “Defence, intelligence, Education Ministry, everyone. I am a civilian carrying out an administrative responsibility. Sometimes, I have to take decisions beyond my personal likes and dislikes,” he told The Hindu . “So, I delegated the responsibility to the concerned departments about a month ago, giving no particular date. They have executed it, that is all.” Memorialisation has been a sensitive and contentious issue in Sri Lanka, with many instances of the state and its security apparatus preventing families from remembering their loved ones. While defending affected families’ right to remember the dead, some within the Tamil community, including university academics, have in the past questioned the “politicisation” of memorial events, in Sri Lanka’s post-war context. Jaffna University lecturer Mahendran Thiruvarangan wrote on Facebook: “… It is a conversation that needs to happen within the academic community. Demolishing, in the stealth of the night, a monument commemorating thousands of people who died during the last stages of the war cannot be justified under any circumstances. This is nothing but a high-handed, chauvinistic act by the state.” Jaffna parliamentarian S. Shritharan described the developments as “very disturbing.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/removal-of-war-victims-memorial-at-jaffna-university-sparks-tension/article33540840.ece

President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, said he is focused on his job as he prepares to take office. On impeachment, he said, “That’s a decision for the Congress to make.” The Democrats are considering lightning-quick action.

10 January 2021||Seoul,||Kim says U.S. is North Korea’s ‘biggest enemy’||North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said the U.S. is his nuclear-armed nation’s “biggest enemy”, state media reported on Saturday, as he threw down the diplomatic gauntlet to the incoming administration of Joe Biden. The declaration comes less than two weeks ahead of the new U.S. President’s inauguration and after a tumultuous relationship between Mr. Kim and the outgoing leader Donald Trump. Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump first engaged in a war of words and mutual threats, before an extraordinary diplomatic bromance that featured headline-grabbing summits. But little substantive progress was made, with the process deadlocked after their February 2019 meeting in Hanoi broke down over sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return. The North “should focus and be developed on subverting the U.S., the biggest obstacle for our revolution and our biggest enemy”, Mr. Kim told the five-yearly Congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, the official KCNA news agency reported. “No matter who is in power, the true nature of its policy against North Korea will never change,” it quoted him as saying, without mentioning Mr. Biden by name.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kim-says-us-is-north-koreas-biggest-enemy/article33540836.ece
10 January 2021||New Delhi,||Dec. fuel demand rises to 11-month high||India’s fuel demand rose sequentially for the fourth straight month in December as the resumption of economic activity took consumption to a 11-month high. Still, demand was about 2% lower than pre-COVID levels. Total demand for petroleum products in December fell to 18.59 million tonnes, from 18.94 million tonnes a year earlier, provisional data published by the oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell show. Fuel consumption, however, posted a month-on-month increase for the fourth straight month, helped by reviving transportation and business activity. India had consumed 17.86 million tonnes in November. The consumption in December was the highest since January 2020. While petrol had reached pre-COVID levels in September, diesel consumption returned to normal in October. However, demand for the main transportation fuel declined again in November and December. Diesel slips again Diesel demand, which had soared 7.4% year-on-year in October, dropped 6.9% in November and by 2.7% in December to 7.18 million tonnes. Month-on-month, the demand slightly improved from 7.04 million tonnes. Fuel demand had slumped by 49% in April after a nationwide lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, shut industries and took most vehicles off-road. The 69-day nationwide lockdown was followed by local and State-level restrictions. The curbs have eased only slowly and in phases, while localised restrictions in containment zones remain. The onset of the festive season had fuelled a rise in consumption, but public transport is not back to normal levels yet, as schools and educational institutions continue to remain shut in most parts of the country. Demand for naphtha, which is used as an industrial fuel for generating electricity and producing petrochemicals, fell 2.67% to 1.23 million tonnes in December. Bitumen, LPG But, consumption of bitumen, used in road construction, jumped by 20% to 7,61,000 tonnes. LPG — the only fuel that showed growth even during the lockdown period on the back of the government giving free cooking gas to the poor — was 7.4% higher at 2.53 million tonnes. Aviation turbine fuel or ATF sales fell 41% to 4,28,000 tonnes as most airlines are yet to resume full operations. However, on a month-on-month basis, it improved by 13.5%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/dec-fuel-demand-rises-to-11-month-high/article33540821.ece
10 January 2021||N. Anand,||Shriram City to focus on SME, gold loans||Shriram City Union Finance Ltd., which has reached pre-COVID-19 levels in disbursements, will focus on its core business of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and gold loans in FY22, a top official said. “During December, we reached the pre-COVID-19 levels in disbursements against the corresponding year-earlier period and also for Q3,” said MD & CEO Y.S. Chakravarti. “The first quarter was a washout. In the first half, we disbursed Rs. 4,387 crore against Rs. 11,475 crore,” he added. “The disbursement in Q3 is about Rs. 6,000 crore, and we hope to be able to keep up the momentum in Q4,” the CEO said. “The Pongal season will drive two-wheeler sales in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Out of the total portfolio, SMEs accounted for 55%, personal loans 20%, and gold loans 7%-8%,” he added. On an average, the non-banking finance company had been disbursing loans worth about Rs. 6,000 crore per quarter. It is targeting a growth of 12% to 15% during FY22 by prioritising lending to SMEs and for gold loans. Plans new forays While no new branches were being planned, Mr. Chakravarti said as far as SME loans were concerned, they would be entering new territories that could bring in additional revenue of Rs. 400 crore to Rs. 500 crore in the first 12 months of operations. Currently, the company disburses SMEs loans of Rs. 12 lakh-Rs. 15 lakh in five States, including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. This accounted for Rs. 1,000 crore revenue during Q2 of FY21. The NBFC also distributes small ticket business loans of Rs. 1 lakh. “In retail lending, we can’t go beyond 18% and that’s why we are looking at 12%-15% growth over FY20,” Mr. Chakravarti said. “While retail lending is growing during the current fiscal, we are not sure how the year-end would be and that’s why we are keeping our fingers crossed. We are extremely hopeful that FY22 would be a better year,” Mr. Chakravarti added. Southern share On gold loans, he said South India had a higher share in network and assets under management-contribution, especially in SME and gold loans. This is expected to increase in coming quarters due to business revival and festivals. Gold loan schemes would be introduced in Punjab and Haryana in a phased manner, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/shriram-city-to-focus-on-sme-gold-loans/article33540813.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Aiming to make Kirloskar’s overseas business debt-free’||The international arm of Kirloskar Brothers Ltd. is planning to streamline operations of the business and aims to be debt-free soon, Alok Kirloskar , director at Kirloskar Brothers Ltd. (KBL) and MD, SPP Pumps Ltd., U.K., said in an interview. Edited excerpts:  How big is the international business and what is the focus? The international business accounts for a little over 40-45% of KBL’s revenues. Our objective is not sales, but cash flow and profit. In these difficult times, we had focused on realigning the business. We plan to shrink the business and release the cash and enhance profitability. The focus is on improving the balance sheet. We have been doing that at KBL for the last 10 years. In March, at the net debt level, we [KBL] are almost debt-free and the next two quarters have shown similar improvements in our balance sheet position. The same focus is on the international side. The international business had revenues of about Rs. 1,400 crore as on March 31, 2020. We are looking at pushing towards a debt-free position. What is the debt now? The debt on the overseas side at the end of March 2020 was a little over Rs. 190 crore. We’re targeting to see if we can bring it down, this year, to a little over half that position, that is our target. What is the change in strategy? Going forward, our strategy is changing a mix of businesses, and adding a lot more services onto the businesses. That is our first and foremost focus, an overarching strategy across all our businesses. Whether we are in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, South Africa, or Thailand, our first focus is that. Our objective is to get 50% of the business to be service-oriented from 20% currently and 50% product-oriented. What is the way forward... Now, the objective is also subscription sales. We see slowly a lot of people are moving from product and services to subscription. That’s how we see the progression. Because of that we have been investing in a lot of technologies to see how we can support our customers. We want more active ways of engaging. In India, we have already released a product called Kirlosmart, which is a product that does product diagnostics. We have a similar product in the U.K. called FireEye. We introduced it in the fire segment because that is where we are strong. SPP U.K. is very strong in the fire segment. Any high rise building in the world that you can think of has an SPP fire pump. Whether it is the Burj Khalifa Tower or New World Trade Centre, The Shard in London or the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, all of them have SPP fire pumps. KBL used the same technology in the Atal Tunnel recently. What is the synergy between the Indian and international businesses? There is a huge synergy. A lot of the technologies that we develop in our centres in the U.K., the U.S., and the Netherlands are used in India. Quite often, we develop products jointly between India and the U.K., the Netherlands. We have a huge team across these areas. I would say we are able to introduce a lot of new technologies in India because we first introduce them overseas and then in India. We have installed the first fish-friendly pumps in the Netherlands. We have introduced this for new projects in India. Auto prime systems is another product which we developed overseas, in the U.K., and is used for storm water control in India. How has the international business helped Kirloskar Brothers? In Egypt, pumps are called Kirloskar. We are building a sustainable base. This is because owning well-known brands helps. Through our well-known brands — SPP or SyncroFlo — people are exposed to Kirloskar. One big learning is also about how to work with people. The new generation in India is very Western; it is different from the earlier generations. As a company, we learned how to deal with these people, because of our operations overseas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/aiming-to-make-kirloskars-overseas-business-debt-free/article33540815.ece
10 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||FinMin drafts model tender to ease purchases||The Finance Ministry has drafted a model tender document for public procurement by all central government departments, in a bid to standardise the language and clauses included, and avoid contractual disputes. Public procurement refers to the purchase of goods and services by the public sector or the government, accounting for an average 15% of GDP globally. In India, government procurement is estimated to constitute about 30% of GDP with the central government accounting for a major chunk. The Expenditure Department, which has developed a standard bidding document to be used for procurement, has sought comments on the draft from ministries, central public sector undertakings and the industry at large. The document was “in continuation with initiatives to increase effectiveness, good governance, competition and value-for-money in public procurement,” the department said. ‘Mix of nomenclature’ “There is no standardised nomenclature in public procurement in India and a mix of American, European and Indian nomenclature has become common,” the department pointed out in an introduction to the 130-odd page document for inviting bids for official supplies. As an instance, it pointed that a ‘Tender’ is taken to mean ‘Tender document’ or ‘Tender Process’ as well as the ‘Bid’ submitted by the prospective suppliers. “Similarly, participants in the Tender are called tenderers and bidders. This duality is reflected in ‘Notices inviting Tenders’ and ‘Instructions to Bidders, and so on,” the note reviewed by The Hindu points out. The standard bidding document developed now, seeks to ease out this duality by mooting that the ‘Tender’ should refer to the tender document and process, while the term ‘Bid’ shall refer to the bidders’ pitches. ‘Bidder’ is to be used instead of ‘Tenderer’ to refer to potential suppliers and the usage ‘Bid document’ be done away with, as per the proposed model. While the generic bidding document has been made for domestic open tenders for procurement of general goods, the department has said it can be tweaked by adding suitable clauses to call for global bids, annual running supply contracts, and other types of procurement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/finmin-drafts-model-tender-to-ease-purchases/article33540818.ece

10 January 2021||Sydney,||Australia in a commanding position at the SCG||First innings heroes Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith steered Australia to a commanding 197-run overall lead in the third Test here on Saturday, leaving an injury-hit India with a mountain to climb. Sitting pretty They came to the crease after Will Pucovski and David Warner fell early, pushing Australia to 103 for two at stumps and a strong position with the four-Test series locked 1-1. Labuschagne, who scored 91 in the first innings, was batting on 47 and Smith, who blitzed 131 in his first knock, was unbeaten on 29. Australia padded up again after taking eight wickets on day three to dismiss India for 244 in reply to its 338. Mohammed Siraj then stepped up to remove Pucovski for 10, caught by substitute ’keeper Wriddhiman Saha. R. Ashwin then took the prized scalp of David Warner for 13, his ninth career dismissal of the opener. But the disciplined Labuschagne and Smith steadied the ship, building a threatening 68-run partnership that is slowly taking the game away from India. India's task was made harder by the absence of Ravindra Jadeja and Rishabh Pant who were injured during India’s innings. India was all out just before tea after some scintillating bowling and razor-sharp fielding, having resumed on 96 for two. Captain Ajinkya Rahane whacked Lyon for six before his aggression cost him his wicket, chopping a Cummins ball onto his stumps in the next over. Josh Hazlewood removed a dangerous Pant after a breezy 36 while Cummins snared Pujara, who ground out his 26th Test half-century, four balls later. India slumped further, with Ashwin slow off the mark for a single and an alert Cummins quickly throwing to Labuschagne standing at the stumps. Before lunch, Vihari was run-out by a brilliant piece of fielding, with Hazlewood diving and throwing the ball in one movement. Bumrah became the third run- out of the day, courtesy a lightning-fast Labuschagne.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/australia-in-a-commanding-position-at-the-scg/article33540993.ece
10 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Finally, domestic cricket action begins||After much deliberation and delay, the Indian domestic season commences with the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy on Sunday. The group stages will be played in six cities, while the Motera Stadium (Ahmedabad) will host all the knockout fixtures. With the IPL auction slated for February, it stood to reason that the T20 tournament was picked as the domestic lung opener ahead of the Vijay Hazare Trophy and the Ranji Trophy. Eager scouts from IPL teams will be in attendance, raising the stakes for players looking to hit the auction jackpot. The Indian team players may be away in Australia, but the tournament is not short on quality talent. Devdutt Padikkal (Karnataka), Suryakumar Yadav (Mumbai), Ishan Kishan (Jharkhand), Abdul Samad (Jammu & Kashmir), Sanju Samson (Kerala) and Rahul Tewatia (Haryana) — standout performers in the recent IPL — will look to continue in the limelight. Uttar Pradesh warhorse Suresh Raina, who missed the IPL, is set to play his first competitive match in nearly two years. Kerala pacer S. Sreesanth, making a comeback after serving a seven-year suspension for his alleged involvement in the 2013 IPL corruption scandal, could count as the biggest draw of all. Two-time defending champion Karnataka, crippled without the services of K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal and Manish Pandey, faces a stiff test from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab in Elite Group A. Tamil Nadu, which fell short by one run in the final last year, boasts of an exciting prospect in G. Periyaswamy, whose slinging action and potent yorkers earned him high praise in the Tamil Nadu Premier League. Eternal favourite Mumbai could go all the way, powered by match-winners in Suryakumar, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shivam Dube and Sarfaraz Khan.

10 January 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Humpy disappointed at FIDE’s decision to go ahead with GP schedule||When FIDE postponed the fourth leg of the Women’s Grand Prix, Koneru Humpy felt she had a glimmer of hope, after all. So she wrote to the world chess governing body to consider conducting the event — scheduled to be held in Gibraltar from January 17 — at a time when she too could take part. She had pulled out because she had felt travelling to Europe from India wasn’t safe in the time of the coronovirus. FIDE, which has been forced to postpone the tournament after a new lockdown was announced on January 2 in Gibraltar, has said the event could be held in late February provided conditions allowed. “I was a bit disappointed when FIDE replied to me that they would be going ahead with their current schedule (without me) though they added that they will find a ‘fair solution’ if the last leg is postponed further,” Humpy told The Hindu from her residence in Vijayawada. “Looking back, I think my decision not to travel was the right one.” The World No. 3 said she wrote to FIDE because she felt if the event was held a little later, she could have participated. “Now that the vaccines to fight the coronavirus are available, things would improve and I too would be in a position to travel before long,” she said. “I am of course disappointed that I would not get a chance to win the Grand Prix, as things stand now.” In with a chance She needed only to finish inside the top three to win the GP, having performed superbly in both the legs she played. “I was confident of winning the Grand Prix,” she said. “Now I don’t know when I would be playing my next tournament, but I hope to compete in the World Cup and the Women Grand Swiss tournament,” she said. Those events are also the qualifying events for the Candidates tournament, the qualifying event for the World championship. “I think by virtue of my average rating, I have already qualified for the Candidates, even if I am not playing in the GP (the top two are seeded directly),” said Humpy, who had a great comeback by winning the World Rapids in 2019 after taking a break following childbirth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/humpy-disappointed-at-fides-decision-to-go-ahead-with-gp-schedule/article33541261.ece
10 January 2021||MUMBAI,||India files racial abuse complaint||The Indian cricket team has lodged an official complaint with the match referee, claiming that Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj were targets of racial abuse from sections of the crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.  The Hindu understands that the complaint was filed by the team management after discussing the issue in detail with match officials and security officials. The matter will now be dealt with by the International Cricket Council, the game’s governing body, and Cricket Australia. Immediately after the end of Saturday’s play, senior India cricketers, including captain Ajinkya Rahane and R. Ashwin, were seen in an intense discussion with umpires Paul Reiffel and Paul Wilson. While match referee David Boon visited the India dressing room, Bumrah and Siraj were spoken to by security officials before the team left the stadium. Cheteshwar Pujara evaded a query about the incident in the post-match interaction, but a BCCI insider confirmed to The Hindu that the discussion was about the alleged racial abuse incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-files-racial-abuse-complaint/article33540986.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Injured Jadeja likely to miss fourth Test||India could well be forced to chase down a mammoth fourth-innings total without its full complement of batsmen after Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja suffered injuries while batting on day three of the third Test.  The H i ndu understands that the left-handed duo “will bat only if required” . Pant took a blow to his elbow off a Pat Cummins short ball. Jadeja was later struck on his left thumb by a Mitchell Starc scorcher. Neither took the field for Australia’s second essay. While the team spokesperson revealed both were “taken for scans”, The Hindu has learnt that Jadeja has a “dislocated thumb” and is likely to miss the fourth Test. The all-rounder will risk batting only if the game is alive. Pant, however, doesn’t have a fracture and could bat in India’s second innings. Wriddhiman Saha kept wickets as substitute in Pant’s absence, but Jadeja’s left-arm spin will be missed, with the Sydney pitch starting to behave awkwardly. Senior batsman Cheteshwar Pujara admitted Jadeja’s absence will be a major loss. “It’s never easy to lose a bowler and someone like Jadeaja, who got four wickets in the first innings.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/injured-jadeja-likely-to-miss-fourth-test/article33540991.ece

Bayern was cruising at 2-0 up after 26 minutes thanks to a Robert Lewandowski penalty and a superb Leon Goretzka goal at Borussia Park. However, Gladbach roared back as midfielder Jonas Hofmann scored twice to make it 2-2 at the break, then set up Florian Neuhaus who scored what proved to be the winner for the host just after the break. In LaLiga, Sevilla forward Youssef En-Nesyri scored a hat-trick as it beat Real Sociedad 3-2 in a thriller after a chaotic start saw four goals in 10 minutes on Saturday.

10 January 2021||BENGALURU,||We are ready: Goud||Karnataka coach Yere Goud expressed confidence that youngsters would step up in the absence of bigwigs Manish Pandey, K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. “We can’t replace those three (Manish, Mayank and Rahul) because they are India players and a class apart,” he said. “But when we won the first Mushtaq Ali title two seasons ago, we didn’t have K.L. Rahul in the squad. So youngsters have shown that they can step up. They must see this as another opportunity to make a mark.” Goud’s confidence stems from his players’ performance in the recently concluded Y.S. Ramaswamy Memorial Trophy and KSCA T20 league. “We watched the knockout games of both the tournaments and all of them played at their highest level in those games. So I feel we are ready.” Karnataka is a two-time defending champion but Goud felt that in T20 cricket there was little to separateeams. “This format itself is high-pressure. We can’t burden ourselves by thinking that we are two-time defending champions. It’s a tricky tournament. The moment you start overthinking, you are in trouble. So we will keep things simple.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-are-ready-goud/article33540997.ece
10 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||TTFI braces up for Natls.||Nine-time champion Sharath Kamal will look to improve his record of titles in the National table tennis championships at Sonipat (Haryana) from February 18 to 27. “I had plans to go to Europe for training but in the prevailing circumstances, I’ll stay back and play the championship I love,” said Sharath. Since the previous edition of the Nationals in February last year, no competition was held. In this scenario, all the leading names are expected to participate. The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) has initiated steps leading to its flagship event. “So far, 19 of our affiliates have completed their state championship while eight more are in progress,” TTFI Secretary-General M.P. Singh told The Hindu .  Getting them ready “Since the ITTF has announced its calendar with two events in Doha (March 3-6 and March 8-13), we wanted to ensure our players are ready to participate in them. “All the safety protocols and government advisories will be followed, with daily Antigen testing of all involved. Players, coaches, match-officials, parents or support staff, everyone will have to get a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test report and produce the clearance certificate on arrival.” Singh continued: “After the Nationals, we will hold the Youth and Junior Nationals at Indore during the first week of March. The action returns to Sonipat for the National cadet and sub-junior championships in the second-half of March. “The participation in the Nationals helps many in getting admission to educational institutes or securing a job.”  Competitions will be held only in singles in all categories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ttfi-braces-up-for-natls/article33541062.ece

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Steinmann is SC EB’s hero||Bengaluru FC’s post-Carles Cuadrat era was off to a disappointing start as SC East Bengal handed the 2018-19 ISL champion its fourth successive defeat by beating it 1-0 at the Fatorda Stadium on Saturday. Interim coach Naushad Moosa handed defenders Ajith Kumar and Parag Srivas their first starts and gave another in Namgyal Bhutia a debut. But all they could do was watch as East Bengal goalkeeper Debjit Majumder’s heroics ensured that Matti Steinmann’s early goal would prove the winner. In the first half hour, BFC offered very little resistance and East Bengal routinely found space behind the two full backs. In the 20th minute, left-back Ajith’s mistake led to Ankit Mukherjee launching the ball across the penalty area into Narayan Das’ path, whose low cross was converted by Steinmann with the outside of his boot. BFC’s game slowly picked up, with a long-range effort from Erik Paartalu and an excellent set-piece routine on the stroke of half-time raising hopes. The uptick carried into the second half and it scored almost immediately after the restart, but Sunil Chhetri’s fierce left-footer, after a lovely one-two with Kristian Opseth, was parried away at the near post by Majumder. Opseth was involved in a similar move with Cleiton Silva, but couldn’t reach the return ball. On 62 minutes, Majumder denied Chhetri again, this time with a diving one-handed effort. It seemed like East Bengal was tiring, but Bright Enobakhare sprang to life, only to meet his match in Gurpreet Sandhu, who fended off his low drive from the edge of the area. Moments later, the Nigerian fluffed a one-on-one after receiving the ball on the counter. The Kolkata giant nearly paid for it, but Daniel Fox came to his team’s rescue, blocking a powerful shot by Paartalu from close range. Robbie Fowler’s outfit held on for only its second win of the season even as BFC dropped to sixth in the table.  The result: Bengaluru FC 0 lost to SC East Bengal 1 (Steinmann 20). Sunday’s matches: Chennaiyin FC vs Odisha FC (5 p.m.); Jamshedpur FC vs Kerala Blasters (7.30 p.m.).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/steinmanns-strike-helps-sc-eb-shock-bfc/article33540981.ece

Dennis Agyare Antwi put Gokulam ahead early in the second minute but Chennai City FC regrouped nicely to turn the tables on the former. Elvedin Skrijelj equalised for the Chennai side off a penalty midway through the first half before Vijay Nagappan found the winner early in the second half. Chennai City won the match despite not having the head coach (owing to suspension), assistant coach and goalkeeping coach (COVID-19) in the bench. Earlier, in the opening match of the tournament, Mohammedan SC made a winning return to the league as it downed Sudeva Delhi FC by a solitary goal at the Salt Lake Stadium. Faisal Ali found the target early in the second half to help Sporting secure the full quota of points. For a team making its first appearance, Sudeva FC put up an impressive challenge and created some nice scoring opportunities. But it lagged behind in the finishing department.  The results:   Mohammedan Sporting 1 (Faisal Ali 58) bt Sudeva Delhi FC 0.   RoundGlass Punjab FC 1 (Pritam Singh 19) bt Aizawl FC 0.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The art of silence||In 1977, Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa wrote an article about his first visit to the Soviet Union a few years earlier. By then Kurosawa was acknowledged as one of the great masters of world cinema and his films were regarded as classics. Kurosawa describes a lunch at Mosfilms, the huge government film complex, where he meets Andrei Tarkovsky who is also beginning to be recognised as a major film director. Tarkovsky, 22 years younger than Kurosawa, pays his respects and then excuses himself, saying he has to get back to work. A little while later the windows of the dining room are shaken by a huge explosion. The startled Kurosawa is informed that Tarkovsky is shooting a film called Solaris and a rocket-launch has just been filmed on the set. The director of Mosfilms assures Kurosawa that no world war has broken out but “this work with Tarkovsky... has proved a Great War for me.” Coming to fame at the age of 30 with Ivan’s Childhood , Tarkovsky was very much a part of state-supported cinema and at the same time a maverick who was always at odds with Soviet ideology. The relationship may have seemed contradictory but it was actually quite symbiotic. Despite his openly professed spirituality and his sharp angularity to the state-approved forms of social realist cinema, such was Tarkovsky’s talent that Russian officialdom needed to showcase him internationally as the genius of Russian cinema; such was Tarkovsky’s cinematic vision that only a state-funded apparatus — one with large funds and no concern for profit — could mount his massive productions. Master on master The film that preceded Solaris was Andrei Rublev , a project involving major sets and war scenes with a cast, literally, of thousands. After the shooting was almost complete, the entire processed negative of the film burnt down in a fire. A Hollywood studio would have collected the insurance and forgotten the project; at Mosfilm, Tarkovsky could shoot the whole film again, giving us one of the masterpieces of cinematic art. In contrast, Kurosawa, despite all his great films and awards, managed to get comparable Western big-budget backing only towards the end of his career, for his battle epics Kagemusha and Ran. 20th Century Fox’s completion funding for Kagemusha came about because the project was pushed by two serious fans who were themselves hugely successful in Hollywood, Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas. After the Mosfilm lunch, when Kurosawa was taken to see the set of Solaris, he was greatly impressed by the detailing and the money that’s clearly been spent. There is, however, not a trace of envy in his description of the visit. “...it takes a huge talent and effort to spend such a huge cost. I closely gazed at his [Tarkovsky’s] back when he was leading me around the set in enthusiasm.” Anyone who has seen Kurosawa’s films will remember what meaning and eloquence the man puts into his observation of characters’ backs, whether the back belongs to a Samurai or a princess, whether it is clothed in rich silks, battle-dress or completely bare. Here there is also the recognition of the expenditure of one’s very self that a massive filming project demands from an auteur . Steven Speilberg once said that he prepared for a big film by increasing his visits to the gym, and here you can see the observant Kurosawa noting Tarkovsky’s back actually ‘carrying’ the budget and the responsibility of the film. Intense experience When Kurosawa is finally shown the completed Solaris , made with a ‘handwriting’ that is completely different from his own, he is equally acute and generous. After defending the long opening sequences of nature and a futuristic Earth, he writes: “I saw this film in a preview room in Moscow for the first time, and soon I felt my heart aching in agony with a longing to return to earth as soon as possible.” In the piece Kurosawa writes a few more lines laying out what he sees in Tarkovsky’s films while noting that the man himself stays silent, offering no explanations. Kurosawa ends the piece with a line we would do well to remember in these times of grotesque self-promotion: “There can be no bright future for those who are ready to explain everything about their own film.” Reading this, one aches too, to return to the earth of a very different time — one where one of the most draconian states allows the flowering of a great, mystical, poetic cinema; where an older man, further along in his sadhana , notes with wonder, respect and love the growing practice of a younger seeker; where with Zen-like clarity a great artist reminds us that art, ultimately, is not about word-explanations but intense experience.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Illusion of a makeover||Francis Fukuyama had professed that the post-war evolution of mankind will spur the ideological universalisation of liberal democracy. In saying so, the author of The End of History and the Last Man had assumed that the world of globalisation will subsume spiritual values and national identities. However, in her innovative analysis, Ravinder Kaur, an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen, questions this assumption and argues instead that identity politics is being capitalised as a brand in recent times to gain greater economic value. India’s recent mega-publicity campaigns aimed at transforming the nation-state into an attractive investment destination has been one such utopian vision of a 21st century nation-building. It is built on the optimistic illusion that ‘good times’ are just around the corner, strengthened by ‘attention-grabbing spectacles that keep its consumers constantly hooked’. Thoughtful enquiry  Brand New Nation is a thoughtful enquiry into the capitalist project that has transformed the state into an authority that holds the power to brand, legislate and rearrange the nation as a market-ready investment enclosure. The populist nature of India’s new image building, driven by necessary infusion of global capital, has led to a plural society becoming polarised. That the populist image-building force has developed into an instrument of coercion isn’t the concern of the large majority. These seeming contradictions have come to characterise the image makeover. It is indeed a seductively repackaged idea of image building wherein ancient cultures and modern ambitions have been made to co-exist in a democratic set-up that has majoritarian autocracy at the top. Not many seem to be complaining though as capitalist growth and hyper-nationalism have created social enclosures that have come to characterise the brand new nation. In an engaging multi-layered narrative, Kaur explains how seemingly contradictory positions cohere in rearranging the so-called liberal political order. Where else can one find identity economy and identity politics holding joint currency in creating a populist notion of good times that harbours seeds of sectarian violence triggered by an exclusionary economic growth agenda?  Much has been written in recent times on how India has expressed its ambitions of becoming a global power. However, the market logic of reconfiguring the nation-state as a cultural hub of profitable business enterprise of a specific kind provides fresh insights on the subject. Global power ambitions The book bridges the past and the present in proposing that the re-imagination of the country is rooted in the past. Packaged in glitzy words by Brand Modi, the younger generation has embraced this idea. “Put simply, Brand Modi is manufactured and marketed on a well-calibrated play of attention and diversion, of secrecy and excessive publicity that creates its own truth and ‘public secrets’ that people know not to know.” However, a culturally troublesome fact in the new brand is the political push for the pre-Islamic imagery of the country — tactically evicting minorities and the others (the Muslims, the Dalits) from the image frame. It is here that the new image holds potential to develop serious social fissures. Can the country hold on to its new image beyond the current political dispensation that nurtures it? Can the brand new nation remain afloat in the permanent anticipation of good times? Can the state of optimism be sustained under falling economic growth? Unless we begin to make sense of the return of ethno-nationalism with a majoritarian impulse, argues Kaur, understanding the limitations of branding the nation-state will remain incomprehensible. Economic challenges Outwardly attractive it may seem, but the unabashed illiberal majoritarian politics taking over liberal democracy has yet to stand the test of time in addressing pressing economic challenges.  Brand New Nation makes interesting and absorbing reading but leaves the reader to draw his/her inferences on the transition that the nation-state is passing through. While the imagery of a brand new nation offers an optimistic sales pitch, the consequences of the socio-political experimentation that conveniently categorises those who doubt or raise troubling questions has yet to be fully assessed. Whether it strengthens the political leadership or will lead to its weakening will determine the endurance of the new image. Kaur deserves appreciation for taking the reader on a tour of the changing trajectory of re-building a nation-state.  The reviewer is an independent writer, researcher and academic.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Artist for all seasons||A senior printmaker and artist, Lalitha Lajmi has never got the recognition she deserves even though her work has been critically appreciated both in India and abroad for decades. She’s better known for her appearance in the 2007 film Taare Zameen Par , and for her familial relationships — her brother and daughter were Bollywood directors Guru Dutt and Kalpana Lajmi. But over the past several decades of being a caregiver and teacher, Lajmi has stubbornly continued to learn and make art and teach others, becoming a source of inspiration in her own right. She has nurtured her creativity during the pandemic as well, creating art with the material at hand. The result is two 21 ft. long Japanese scrolls drawn with stories of family, ageing, bonding, relationships, birds, flowers and hybrid animals with pencil, watercolour and crayon. The scroll had developed a sepia tint lying in its tube and Lajmi uses this shade as a base for her monochromes. Curious and restless Scroll 2 that looks at relationships between mother and child, siblings, birds, flowers and hybrid animals will be on view in Mumbai next month. Lajmi is still working on Scroll 1 which shows life in the womb. “The thought was that I would start with the beginning of life because creativity begins in the womb. When I worked with watercolours, I did a series on the psyche of the child,” she says. “These scrolls were not for an exhibition. This was for myself. During the lockdown, I wondered initially what I would do because I’d already done etchings, watercolours and oils. So I thought I would try to draw in pencil. I used to work in oil earlier but you need daylight for oils and I had no time during the day earlier. I’ve got daylight now but I’m already done with those mediums.” This curiosity, restlessness and desire to explore are expressed in all of Lajmi’s work. A self-taught artist, her first painting was at the age of five when her uncle bought her a box of paints. She went on to win the first prize in a competition. At 17, she got married to a Merchant Navy sailor, Gopi Lajmi, who told her at their first meeting that he wasn’t interested in art. This came as a blow to Lajmi, but she wasn’t allowed to call off the wedding. Her daughter Kalpana was born when Lajmi was just 20. With a husband away on work a lot and a huge house to manage, the shy young woman soon found herself bound by domesticity. Reflections of the self However, Lajmi was surrounded by artists, including her brother Guru Dutt and sister-in-law Geeta Dutt, the well-known singer. But it was her cousin, adman and director Shyam Benegal, and artist K.H. Ara who were her biggest supporters. Ara, her mentor, included her in an exhibition by the Progressive Artists Group in 1960 at the Artist’s Centre in Mumbai and arranged her first show at the Jehangir Art Gallery in 1961. She sold her first painting, even before the exhibition, to Dr. Heinzmode, a German collector working at Shantiniketan, and at the same price that Ara charged. Her first exhibitions were sold out but not the ones after that. So she took up a job teaching art to school children while continuing her studies alongside. “When at my job, I decided I was not going to compromise on my painting,” she says. Then, her beloved brother Guru Dutt passed away, followed by her mother and husband. A neighbour encouraged the traumatised Lajmi to go to a psychoanalyst. “The doctor was young and when I told him I couldn’t afford his sessions, he said I could pay him when I earned.” The sessions proved fruitful, helping Lajmi understand her dreams and herself better. It had a tremendous influence on her art. Hidden tensions Lajmi was invited by the director of the Prince of Wales Museum (now, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya) in Mumbai to read up on iconography at their library since she was interested in Tantrism and the bindu . So, when her younger son went to school, she would catch a bus to the museum and read for two hours every day. From 1973 to 1976, she attended evening classes for intaglio and etching printmaking at the Sir J.J. School of Art, setting up a graphic press in her kitchen to work on at night, sleeping for only a couple of hours. These prints would travel to West and East Germany in 1983 for an exhibition supported by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. This portfolio, ‘The Mind’s Cupboards’, narrated the story of early Indian feminism. While Lajmi doesn’t like repeating herself in her work, there are a few major recurring themes such as masks, clowns, human relationships, loneliness and sexual intimacy. The hidden tensions between men and women are rendered lifelike in her arresting portraits. Her women are not meek but assertive and aggressive. “Perhaps that’s why she likes painting,” says fellow artist Anjana Mehra. “For her, life has always been difficult and that’s why she seeks out paintings and drawing because it’ll do what you tell it to do. It’s a surface that can’t react to you so you can put in whatever you want.” Lajmi’s motto has always been to “go to the recesses of the mind and develop imagination to come to terms with your work and life”. This honesty, curiosity and stubbornness to create have kept her interested in new techniques and materials even at the cost of her health — the constant bending over a table while drawing and painting has given her sciatica, she says. It’s this perseverance that makes her continue with a project that she herself admits will probably never find a buyer because “a 21ft scroll will be impossible to sell to a collector since it won’t be easy to display. So, it may need to go to a museum,” says Lajmi, and shrugs. An artist’s sole purpose, after all, is creation. The writer is the author of theWeapons of Kalkiseries and interested in South Asian art.  Lajmi’s motto has always been to “go to the recesses of the mind and develop imagination to come to terms with your work and life”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/artist-for-all-seasons/article33540796.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Our actions mean something’||On 22 January 2020, a motion was tabled in the European Parliament … It detailed what the CAA [Citizenship Amendment Act] was about… The resolution said, ‘The indivisibility of human rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, is one of the main objectives of the European Union in its relations with India.’ From here it laid out the case against the Indian government in such harsh terms as have not been seen by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).… This sort of public hiding on human rights was not something the Indian government has received before. The MEA diplomat abroad is not trained to defend the country against such direct attacks, especially from institutions which it wants to be on the right side of, such as the organs of the European Union… It made the government squirm enough for it to try and block the resolution. What it succeeded in doing was to get the MEPs to table the motion but agree to a delay on the vote, which Modi feared, correctly, would be in favour of the resolution. This, the Members of European Parliament agreed to, putting off the vote for a session a few weeks down the road, which was then delayed by the COVID-19 epidemic. It remains dormant because the actions have ceased at the Indian end …. [In India] Shaheen Bagh was the most prominent site of the protests but it was not the only one. The strength of the movement came from its spread and its numbers and the resolve…. In the face of what was by then a nationwide movement, the Modi government deprioritised the NRC from January… The threats to rid India of Muslims through the NRC went away and the termites and chronology phrasing was never repeated… The government simply stopped talking about the citizenship laws, and Hindutva instead turned to what it usually does when it is angered: violence against other Indians …. The RSS is the civil society of majoritarianism…. Its affiliates, the ABVP, the Bajrang Dal, the Durga Vahini are also civil society groups. They do at the campus and neighbourhood level the same lumpen mischief that the BJP does in national politics…. The agenda is limited though the damage is immense. The opposition to them must come from a civil society that pushes back not against them alone, but in favour of a general secular pluralism that our Constitution stands for. It must stand not just against the majoritarianism alone but for the wider liberal constitutional values. This is what must be strengthened. How? To illustrate this let us look at a recent example that touches our lives directly. On 12 August 2020, the Indian Express reported (‘Asha workers protest at Jantar Mantar demanding better pay, face FIR’) on the protest of India’s six lakh Accredited Social Health workers. Paid Rs. 2,000 a month, this group of all-female workers are the ones doing contact tracing of COVID-19, while not been given protective clothing. They had gone on strike to demand better conditions for work… The report… said that they had been booked for unlawful assembly and an FIR filed.... Whom does it benefit that these women are given their rights? All of the nation. We cannot win over COVID-19 if those actually fighting it are saying they are handicapped in their fight. It is undeniable that their cause is just, and their demand is correct. But they are alone, and for asking for their rights they are persecuted by the Indian State. This is a group that is standing up for its rights on its own. In another democracy such a large number of women in such a vital role at a time of a pandemic would generate public and media interest of a very high level. Why did this not happen in India? Even when our individual interest is aligned with a group’s, we did not extend it support. Why did we not? What might have happened if a large number of middle-class people had? This is something we have to ask ourselves and answer honestly…. We must try and take an action daily in favour of expanding our civil society. It doesn’t matter if the action is online, offline, a donation, attending a talk or even just learning about the new environment law and how it will affect India. Our actions mean something. Participation expands civil society. It is through mass individual participation in everyday activism, through raising of voices, through funding just causes and funding organised civil society groups, through supporting progressive calls for engagement and supporting those who need that the Western democracies have become the open societies they are. It is our dream as well to be there, and most of us agree that we want an India that is prosperous and resembles those nations whose people have the most freedoms. We are not alone in wanting this. The world also wants to see a secular and plural India and especially, that part of the world that the Indian State cares about. Civil society can use this global interest in our progress as a lever. The opportunities will continue to come, as Hindutva majoritarianism pushes ahead with its agenda. Majoritarian intolerance in India was first flagged by the United States government officially in 2004. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) looked at the post-Godhra riots situation in Gujarat and recommended to the George W. Bush administration that Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government be classified as a ‘Country of Particular Concern’ (CPC)… The following year, the Vajpayee government fell and the report, noting that Manmohan Singh had taken over, dropped India from the list. However, the issues raised in the report remained. In March 2005, the Commission issued a statement encouraging the US State Department to prevent Modi’s planned visit to the United States, citing evidence presented by India’s National Human Rights Commission and numerous domestic and international human rights investigators of the complicity of Gujarat state officials in the mob attacks on Muslims. This was, of course, the famous visa ban on Modi, and he did not visit the US from then on, till he won the 2014 election. On 28 April 2020, India was again marked as a country of particular concern, with five dozen references in the report (the highest in the 22-year history of the bipartisan body) … It said the Modi government’s prejudice against India’s Muslims was showing through India’s actions on citizenship, cow slaughter, Kashmir and conversions. The report notes the Ayodhya ruling, and the conduct of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. It recommended to US President Donald Trump that he designate India as CPC, ‘for engaging in and tolerating systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations, as defined by the International Religious Freedom Act’. It wanted Trump to ‘impose targeted sanctions on Indian government agencies and officials responsible for severe violation of religious freedom by freezing those individuals’ assets and/ or barring their entry into the US’…. India’s official response to the report was quite breezy and brisk. It read: ‘We reject the observations on India in the USCIRF Annual Report. Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels. It has not been able to carry its own Commissioners in its endeavour. We regard it as an organisation of particular concern and will treat it accordingly.’… Of course, this is interference in our internal affairs, but we have to accept that we brought it on. The Trump administration has little interest in human rights in India, and as such Modi should have had an easy pass. But even the USCIRF chair, Tony Perkins, who was nominated by the Republicans, weighed in against India. What has transpired in the USCIRF will not end with the releasing of the report recommending action against India. Unless the Modi administration shows great change of direction, India will figure again in next year’s report… This will give leverage to the activists and Indian civil society over a government that has thus far been dismissive and contemptuous of them and their work. It opens up for them the space to try and pressure the Modi government in a way that is not possible purely through politics locally or through the compromised justice system… The stronger the pressure there is on the structure, the more likely it is to fragment in its opinion and the less likely it is for the government to push something through that is extreme. Civil society can and must mobilise so that this pressure on the government is kept up when it abandons secularism and pluralism. The State in India has little interest in constitutionalism. No awards are given for it, and on the other hand, the judiciary and the system does not punish errant and often even criminal behaviour. The State can, for example, harass activists with bogus cases and there will be no punitive action against those who did the framing. Such things as wrongful detention, excessive use of force, harassment and malicious action by the State are not penalised. Civil society must get the State to be more invested in constitutionalism. We have to ensure that where the State and its agents bend or break the law or the values of the Constitution, they are held to account and called out. These attempts may fail, and that is fine. Structural change requires construction at the foundation. Effort is the critical investment. Results will follow. Constitutional space has been given to us. Even if it has been severely restricted over time, it exists. The space needs to be appropriated in a way that it has not been, and especially not been by the urban middle class. And it has to be expanded. We have to fray the ‘reasonable restrictions’, we have to unravel them, and we have to let the true meaning of the fundamental rights shine through. Progress on rights is inevitable. History is with the progressives: the future is also with us. Conservatives seek to conserve a past that is not possible to hold on to. Change is inevitable and constant, and the arc of the moral universe is headed in the direction of progress on individual rights and dignity. Our task is to hasten the arc along on its path towards justice.  Extracted fromOur Hindu Rashtra: What It Is. How We Got Hereby Aakar Patel (Westland, December 2020).

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Here we come, 2021||Like a lot of industries, English-language publishing in India is in the middle of a slow recovery following a drastically lean patch in the summer of 2020. December is typically a strong period for sales across sectors (thanks to Christmas and New Year gifting), and publishing is no different. Because of this, Indian publishers are looking forward to 2021 with a sense of cautious optimism. In the second half of 2020 we saw a number of writers releasing books written during and about the lockdown; Zadie Smith and Slavoj Žižek, among them. There were also books by medical experts, breaking down the science behind COVID-19 to its basics. According to Udayan Mitra, Publisher (Literary) at HarperCollins India, this general trend will continue in 2021, and even expand in scope. Mitra says: “Many 2021 books were written over the pandemic-hit months of 2020. Since, contrary to some early estimates, it now appears that 2021 is going to be as COVID-impacted a year as its predecessor, the topicality of these books will be a main feature.” Publishers are readers too; indeed, as Mitra wrote in an essay, they are readers first and foremost. But for many publishers, 2021 may well be the year where they see their lists diverging from their usual spaces and often, their personal tastes. In the news Teesta Guha Sarkar, Senior Commissioning Editor at Pan MacMillan India, says: “I’d like to see (and publish) more fiction that pushes the boundaries of the craft.” But, Sarkar adds, it is likely that there will be more non-fiction than literary fiction in 2021. “To an extent, our tastes are influenced by the state of the world. Personally speaking, I have been reading a lot of political non-fiction and books about other pandemics like the Spanish Flu.” Sarkar, of course, is well aware of the way current affairs influence the amount of interest a book generates. In January 2020, she published Dilip D’Souza and Joy Ma’s The Deoliwallahs , the story of 3,000 Chinese-Indians who were taken from their homes in various parts of India just after the Sino-Indian War of 1962, and packed off to an internment camp in Deoli, Rajasthan. While the book deserves many readers in itself, it can’t be denied that it grabbed the limelight when the Indo-Chinese border conflict started in May 2020. How-to volumes During the months when lockdown measures were at their strictest, a lot of people had to acquire basic cooking skills on a war footing. In 2021, self-improvement will continue to be a big publishing trend. And food books (already a robust sales category for Indian publishers) will be a sizeable part of this. Krish Ashok’s Masala Lab (published by Penguin Random House India) and Claire Chambers-edited Desi Delicacies (published by Pan MacMillan India) were both big-ticket December releases in this category — expect more of the same. Aman Arora, Deputy General Manager (Marketing) at HarperCollins India, says: “Broadly speaking, self-improvement books have received a huge response from readers in 2020 and we expect this trend to continue in 2021 as well. This includes spirituality and self-help books, but also titles that have an element of skill enhancement — how to read and write better, how to manage your finances, how to be more productive on a day-to-day basis.” Creating conversations In general, creators across media are adapting to the new economic realities of a post-COVID world — which is why we can expect more collaborations in the publishing space. Performers — musicians, artists, comedians and so on — will be seen at digital book launches, since in-person launches are not an option at the moment. This shift will also cause publishers to take a long, hard look at the expenses incurred in hiring large, expensive launch venues, for example. A digital influencer-led strategy may find more takers, especially if the author in question does not have a significant online presence. Literature festivals, a reliable time-bound promotional tool for marketers, are also moving online, which is another aspect that readers, writers and promoters have to adapt to. “At the end of the day, it’s all about creating conversations around the new book. It’s just that we will have to achieve this through a different platform now. I don’t think the basic marketing plan will change a lot,” says Arora. One thing is clear: in this era of unique and unprecedented challenges, English-language publishing in India is prepared to make some tough choices and weather the storm, so to speak. The writer and journalist is working on his first book of non-fiction.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Shades of the macabre||What is the purpose of art? Is it to satisfy the aesthetic lust of modern life or is it to shock people into imagining new possibilities, even terrifying ones? Or, as Oscar Wilde would have it, does art exist for its own sake? These questions hang heavy in the murky air and the bloody corridors of Belle Époque Paris in Vault Comics’ new book, The Picture of Everything Else , a work deeply inspired by Wilde’s 1890 Gothic classic, The Picture of Dorian Gray . Conceived by Dan Watters — the writer of the Coffin Bound series of Image Comics and Lucifer of DC’s Sandman Universe — and stunningly illustrated by Trivandrum-based artist Kishore Mohan, The Picture of Everything Else is set in the ecstatic, artsy years of the late 1890s. Aditya Bidikar’s lettering adds to the comic’s vintage aesthetics. Painted faces The story follows two Parisian art thieves, who might be more than just partners-in-crime, and a series of macabre killings that have shocked the city’s rich. It is suspected that the murders are the work of Basil Hallward, the painter of Dorian Gray’s infamous portrait, which kept him eternally young while itself ageing and decaying in response to Gray’s hedonistic life. The first issue begins at a private art expo in a Parisian mansion where Marcel and Alphonse, our uninvited art thieves, mingle with the elite crowd. The hot topic of discussion there is the impact that the new medium of photography will have on painting. Watters weaves a tale of art and blood true to the age it’s set in. The cultural explosion happening in turn-of-the-century Paris still shaken by the bloody excesses of the Paris Commune is felt in all aspects of life — it will give birth to lasting trends in art and literature like Emile Zola’s naturalism or Claude Monet’s impressionism. The comic explores the two extremes of art — is it an object of harmless admiration exhibited on a gallery wall or a powerful instrument of radical, even violent, change? Such a compelling theme deserves equally compelling art. Mohan’s atmospheric, often impressionistic, watercolour and acrylic panels offer just that. Everything from the gaudy mansions to the riverside walkways of Paris pulls you back in time, while the goriness of a person getting torn in half has never looked so stunning. This is art of which the likes of Hallward and Dorian Gray would be proud. The reviewer is a freelance journalist and copy editor.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I would not take the vaccine without efficacy data’||A year after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which has claimed 1.8 million lives so far, scientists, manufacturers and drug regulators the world over have been speeding up the timelines for the development, testing and approval of vaccines for emergency use. Three safe and efficacious vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have already been greenlighted. In India, the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has been working feverishly to develop and test a COVID-19 vaccine, Covaxin, that uses a time-tested inactivated vaccine platform; but the haste shown by the Indian drug regulator to approve it in the absence of efficacy data has taken the shine off an indigenously developed lifesaver. We speak to Gagandeep Kang, Professor of Microbiology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, who has extensive experience in vaccine research, about the rush to grant approval for the vaccine without efficacy data. “Bharat Biotech has data from animal challenge studies that are supportive of efficacy, but that is not an automatic bridge to human efficacy,” says Dr. Kang. From humans, Bharat Biotech must be following up their Phase I and Phase II participants for safety and immunogenicity, and may have some data, but that is not going to be sufficient, she says. The company really will need efficacy data from its Phase-III trial and is in the process of recruitment, vaccination and data collection. But that interim data, crucial for an approval, will still take a few weeks or months to come. The approval granted to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin flies in the face of the regulator’s own guidance to vaccine manufacturers. The September 2020 guidance explicitly mentions that 50% efficacy would be considered acceptable for emergency use approval. But it appears that our expert committee has followed a path similar to the Russian and Chinese regulators in not requiring human efficacy data for approval, says Dr. Kang. More sense to wait The urgency to approve the vaccine even in the absence of efficacy data would have been permissible if COVID-19 had been life-threatening with a very high likelihood of death in those who are infected, as in the case of Ebola and Nipah. “For a disease with a low mortality rate and a population-wide vaccination strategy, it makes more sense to wait and have an efficacious vaccine instead of wide use of a vaccine that might not work,” she says. While granting permission, the regulator had said the vaccine will be used in a ‘clinical trial mode’, a phrase never before used in any vaccine approval. “I really do not know what ‘clinical trial mode’ after approval means,”  says Dr. Kang. “I am not sure what is planned for consent post-introduction and I am not clear about whether these studies and medical expenses in case of serious adverse events will be the responsibility of the company or the government. If it is the company, it is not clear to me how expanding their studies from thousands to lakhs or millions with the increased requirements benefits the company in its goal to full licensure.” The assertion that Covaxin will be effective against mutant strains even in the absence of efficacy data is based on the premise that using the whole virus that is inactivated might provide increased protection. So if Covaxin is based on an old viral strain, will it continue to work? We will just have to wait for data from humans and from the laboratory to know that, says Kang. With Prime Minister Modi emphasising atmanirbharta (self-reliance) one wonders if that is what prompted the regulator to approve the vaccine even in the absence of any supporting efficacy data. “Covaxin, Covishield and many other vaccines are made in India, and we should be proud of our vaccine companies. But if the question is — did Indian science make the vaccine candidate and did Indian companies develop it, then the answer to the first part is variable and to the second is always yes,” says Dr. Kang. “Covaxin is based on an Indian strain and a proven technology that Bharat Biotech has used for many vaccines, but has a new adjuvant that was developed in the U.S. Covishield’s viral vector construct was developed by the University of Oxford and then transferred by AstraZeneca to India. So, both are examples of atmanirbharta but have an element of non-Indian science — and to me that is fine.” Vaccine hesitancy “There is a real danger that the non-transparent manner in which the approval was granted to Covaxin even without efficacy data might lead to increased vaccine hesitancy. Even without missteps we have misinformation, and any grounds for concern will be blown up into much larger conspiracy theories,” warns Dr. Kang. “We are not yet as badly affected with vaccine hesitancy as the West, but we do have a growing problem. We ignore this at our own peril. Decreased trust in vaccines can lead to an inability to achieve our public health goals of reducing mortality and preventing spread.” Given that the inactivated vaccine platform is time-tested and Bharat Biotech has developed many vaccines using this platform, animal studies show promise and the vaccine appears to be safe, will Dr. Kang be willing to take Covaxin even in the absence of efficacy data? “I have no problem with volunteering for the Covaxin trial, because I think it is potentially a good vaccine, but unfortunately CMC Vellore is not a centre. I would go through the process as a volunteer and could get a vaccine or placebo and I am fine with that because I would be contributing to the generation of scientific data that would inform vaccine development,” says Dr. Kang. “But if the vaccine were to be offered to me under conditions of ‘restricted use’, as a matter of ‘abundant caution’, in ‘clinical trial mode’, I would not take the vaccine without efficacy data, because it makes no sense to me. Once clinical efficacy data are available and have been reviewed by the regulator, [I have] no issues at all with taking the vaccine.”  M.B.B.S., M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the Christian Medical College, Vellore Awarded the Infosys Prize in Life Sciences in 2016 First Indian woman scientist to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society Played a leading role in developing Rotovac, Bharat Biotech’s diarrhoea vaccine   ‘We are not yet as badly affected with vaccine hesitancy as the West, but we do have a growing problem.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||An uncompromising aesthete||To some souls, beauty is a trusted intoxicant. They would happily give up their lives for it. Vikram Lall was one such, an eternally journeying rasik in the untranslatable sense of the term. He made his life and livelihood as an architect, the Buddha Smriti Park in his hometown, Patna, probably being his finest work. He also had a significant role in the design of the Akshardham temple in Delhi. He spoke of how much he learned in the process from traditional vastukars , of how different it was to work on this project where chaos reigned in the meetings, but there was always order in practice, as opposed to his work on the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, whose orderly meetings had little to do with the chaos at the building site! We shared a Patna childhood in the 1970s. From the time we were boys, Vikram had a very swift and steady hand at drawing. He could stand before a river or at a street-corner, take in the whole view, and sketch what lay before him very quickly. He had a honed, sensitive eye for detail, without ever losing the larger perspective. More than an architect He had to know everything about the context before imagining and designing a building. His enormous admiration for, as well as diverging views from, the architect of Chandigarh, Le Corbusier, might have been rooted in this all-too-forgotten Indian respect for context. As a result, he became much more than an architect. He pored over books of art, history, poetry, philosophy and religion to enrich his understanding. We would have endless conversations about the world’s vanishing heritage, about metropolitan expansion, and the enormity of challenges that aggressive modernity posed to culture and civilisation everywhere. Vikram spent over two patient, often lonesome, decades doing extensive field studies of Buddhist monuments, travelling for long periods to more than 20 countries with his team of photographers. He can be said to have pioneered the study of Buddhism from an architectural perspective. Nobody anywhere had attempted this before him, as the Dalai Lama also noted. He intended to write a series of six illustrated volumes, but only the first could appear before his death. Magnificently produced, The Golden Lands is a story told beautifully in vivid images, drawings and words. Traversing more than two millennia, it offers a clear, comprehensive account of the Buddhist architecture of Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Indonesia. The book is full of insights such as the homology the author illustrates between the cardinal Buddhist notions of Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha on the one hand, and their architectural expressions in the Stupa, Caitya-Griha , and Vihara, respectively, on the other. Music was Vikram’s other lifelong companion. He was a most perceptive and knowledgeable critic of Hindustani classical music, with enormous patience for it. I recall a day when all he played for me the entire afternoon were recordings of Ustad Faiyyaz Khan of the Agra Gharana — till my slow head understood what a bol taan was! Close to many classical musicians, Vikram hosted a series of Doordarshan Baithaks a few years ago. Whenever he was alone, he had a guitar nearby to restore himself at night from an exhausting day’s labours, singing (sentimentally) some forgotten composition of genius from Madan Mohan or Naushad. His knowledge of the history of Mumbai film music was encyclopaedic and Vikram was a popular lecturer, not just on architecture but also on music. Humble patron A mark of Vikram’s character was his humility. He was president of the Oxbridge Society of India, but used his honorary position to support little-known folk or classical musicians, often organising open-house baithaks for them at his Delhi home. His warm, cheerful disposition struck everyone who met him. Photography was another of Vikram’s interests, and his vast archive spilled over with breathtaking images from around India and the world.  Our last conversation was less than a month ago, when Vikram was in Delhi to attend to his ailing father and had come home for a meal. After a Bihari dinner of methi parathas and panch-phoren ka rasa, we found ourselves, strangely, contemplating death, especially one’s own, and about how much more mysterious than death is life itself. He spoke for a long time about detachment. Little did I know then, though perhaps he knew…  Perhaps true to poetry, Vikram breathed his last on Ghalib’s birth anniversary. Over the years, we had spent hours talking about Urdu poetry. Subah hoti hai, sham hoti hai, yun hi zindagi tamaam hoti hai . Every now and then these lines of Mir, so poignantly true of the lives of millions today, cruelly broken by the world, were on his lips. Vikram’s life and work are proof that under all the cowardly barbarism and horror of our times, beauty perennially abides. You lived well, dear friend, and you leave your child-like, disarming smile in many sad hearts. In the lap of the goddess now, you must be in bliss. The writer is one of the authors ofChurning the Earth: The Making of Global India. He teaches ecosophy at Ashoka University.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The not-so-subtle art of creating data Frankensteins||In the beginning was the data. And with it came manipulation. Satan who disrupted paradise was armed with data. He knew a lot about the people he wanted to gaslight. He knew a lot more than they did about God, about Paradise and such. Powered by data, Satan was able to fill the minds of Adam and Eve, naive for their period and upbringing, with thingamajigs that could get them to do what he wanted and get out of Paradise eventually. Original Sin is perhaps the oldest example of the result of data manipulation. Satan was the Cambridge Analytica of The Book of Genesis .  Simulmatics Corporation, whose story Jill Lepore chronicles in If Then , was the Cambridge Analytica of Cold War America. Not many know of this enterprise today. But the impact of what it started back in the late-1950s continues to haunt the globe, in more virulent and pervasive forms. This is the company that pioneered the art of data manipulation in America, creating a toxic model that anyone could easily emulate in future. Simulmatics used data and technology to create tools that could influence people to change their mind on myriad matters. From voting behaviour to buying choices to support causes, the company played with almost everything and found immense success, so much so that the People Machine, a program Simulmatics created for predicting and tweaking human behaviour, is credited with installing John F. Kennedy as the President of the United States in 1960. Mind you, Nigel Oakes, the founder of Cambridge Analytica, was just two years old then. It would take another Alexander Nix, its infamous CEO, to be born. ‘Mad Men’ corporation Simulmatics was founded by Ed Greenfield, who worked in the popular advertising industry in Madison Avenue known for its ‘Mad Men’. To know that Simulmatics was able to blend data analytics with political, marketing and advertising campaigns and create incredible results in the 1950s and ’60s is a shocker for us who tend to think such manipulations are an offshoot of the current crop of information technologies. Turns out, data was always a deadly weapon. Those who knew how to use it had their way. Lepore’s story of Simulmatics has many pointers to the future of data and the first of which is the fact that these experiments by default hold the potential to become Frankensteins in their own right if there are no policies or regulations to guide them. The next important takeaway could be that data analytics-driven commercial interests or authoritarian or utopian dreams can create opportunities that look so alluring financially and present people with immense and unwanted God-like power that they, by rule, will misuse. Spectrum of views Lepore’s research is mindblowing. Her eye for detail is enchantingly meticulous. She profiles the evolution of Simulmatics with a phenomenological understanding of the data economy and offers a multipronged spectrum of views on how data was/is used to buy people without their consent. Her prose is spirited but neutral. Regular readers of Lepore (she writes regularly for the The New Yorker ) can easily spot the philosophical richness in the narrative nonfiction she produces and it is clearly visible in If Then as well. This is a book everyone with interest in the world of data (manipulation) will read like a gospel. This is easily in the company of Shoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism or Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil and, inarguably, one of the most relevant and readable works of 2020. This is a stark reminder of a Paradise lost.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The hornbill catchers||There are two things to know about working with large hornbills, says Rohit Naniwadekar. First, never let their beaks get close to your face or they can gouge your eyes. Second, don’t let them grab your fingers because they can break them. Their enormous bills capable of delicately picking ripe fruits can also apply devastating pressure. Catching hornbills to strap GPS transmitters onto them for his research was a nerve-wracking experience, says Naniwadekar. The team rigged two nets between fig trees about 25 metres off the ground and 100 metres apart in Pakke Tiger Reserve, Arunachal Pradesh. The operation had to be conducted at 3 a.m. before the sharp-eyed birds arrived to feed at first light while also being watchful of elephants. If the hornbills saw people, they wouldn’t come close. The researchers also had to make sure the nets weren’t visible since the wary birds would then avoid approaching that side of the tree. Then everyone took their places. Naniwadekar and assistant Tali hid under bushes below one of the fig trees while three other team members retreated to the vehicle to wait for the signal that a bird had been caught. Endless wait The interminable wait began. They had been trying to net these birds for five months, and the assistants expected that day to be a failure like the others. Tali removed his shoes, made himself comfortable, and fell asleep. The rest of the team waiting in the vehicle dozed too. Naniwadekar wondered if his luck would change that day. When the sun rose, birds arrived in flocks to feast on the figs. Seven hours after setting up the nets, an incautious hill myna got caught and raised a racket in its panic. A curious great hornbill landed on a branch nearby to see why the small bird was crying. Spotting an opportunity, Naniwadekar shook Tali awake and instructed him to scare the bird into the net. The barefoot assistant stumbled out of their hiding spot and shouted. The hornbill cocked its head to one side and watched the human. Instead of flying into the net, it flew in the opposite direction, still keeping an eye on Tali. It blundered into the second net and was trapped. The hill myna escaped in the meantime. The assistants quickly lowered the hornbill, which tried to snap at the researchers within reach. Unable to approach, Naniwadekar took off his t-shirt and covered its head before grasping the four-kilogram bird. The researcher made the cardinal mistake of loosening his grip, and the bird seized his hand. “I felt its strength,” he says. “It could have broken my fingers.” Fortunately, the hornbill didn’t clamp down hard enough to hurt. But Naniwadekar couldn’t yank his hand either, since the bird would tighten its hold. So he waited patiently until it became distracted and eased its grip. Only then did the researcher free himself. A second net To catch more birds, Naniwadekar incorporated the strategy of setting up a second net where great hornbills least expect it. Despite the lengths he went to conceal himself and his team, he had a hard time getting another species, the wreathed hornbill. Since these smaller birds frequented fruiting trees outside the sanctuary, they were attuned to the ways of humans and wary of their presence. “They are much smarter than great hornbills,” says Naniwadekar. “At the slightest hint of something being off, they won’t come. One brushed against the net but didn’t get trapped.” Eventually, the team caught two wreathed hornbills. But the researcher still hadn’t learned how to keep his fingers away from the birds’ beak. “My hands were held by three species of hornbills: the great, wreathed, and oriental pied hornbills,” he lists. At least he escaped with his fingers intact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-hornbill-catchers/article33540811.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Reinventing death||There is an acute need to reinvent death. For too long, humans have suffered from anxiety and fear around end of life. Religions, hierarchical structures, medical science and intellectuals have exploited the grief and sense of loss. For centuries, uncertainty around the process of dying forced leaders and thinkers to come up with some explanation about the natural phenomenon. Unfortunately, the solutions proposed added to the negative thinking, fear and darkness. Concepts of hell, sin, torture, punishment and painful death reinforced the anxiety. Great collective and individual human effort has gone into activities primarily designed to prevent death. Invention of fire and agriculture were basic tools which prevented untimely death. Clothes, safe places to sleep, easy access to basic life needs were all invented to prolong life and improve its quality. The desire to live longer, or perhaps forever, has driven humans to invent great things. The science of medicine as a whole is a tool devised primarily to keep people alive as long as possible. Prevention, cure, regeneration and prosthetic techniques have developed into a large industry and thrives on the desire to live longer, healthier and better-looking lives. However, every time a person dies, medicine now thinks it is a failure of science. The doctor has a problem in letting go a patient at the appropriate time. In the end, the person will go as nature decides. But before that, medicine is capable of doing significant damage to his or her dignity and well-being. Facts of death are largely unknown. So are facts about god and religion. The combination has created an ever more fearful ambience. Enigma of death, in a way, is the root cause for the stranglehold of religion over society and a source for the invention of god. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, the doctor we see, and the scripture we read, all were primarily invented to either prevent death or address the fear of it.  Death and species For the survival of the species, death is an absolute essential. Without clearing out the old and the birth of the new, the genetic selection and survival of the fittest will not be possible. There won’t be any evolution. So, for nature, recycling of individuals creating newer breeds and recycling elements to make them is an essential activity. That theory can apply to the human species at the intellectual level as well. Without recycling of individuals, world will be full of same thought and personalities. Every new generation comes with a new set of ideas, skills and genetic make-up and life keeps evolving. People living longer and having fewer progeny can’t be advantageous to the progress of the species. The alternation of death and birth, is the pulse beat for the species. There were dark clouds of depression and anxiety related to COVID-19 in the U.K. Yet, the fear of death and the determination to overcome it, collectively as a nation, made some impossible things happen. The first Nightingale Hospital in London was built in nine days. The “sense of time” death injects in humans and its power are enormous. k.shanbhag@live.co.uk  Every time a person dies, medicine now thinks it is a failure of science||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/reinventing-death/article33540751.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The class reunion||In December, 15 of us met at a friend’s house for planning a trip to a nearby resort to commemorate the 50th year of leaving school. We could contact three of our teachers, all in their 80s, and invited them for lunch as we thought they would not travel to the resort. The pandemic put brakes on our trip, but we had a great time together. We have been able to track 24 of the 30 of us from the first batch of our government school in Chandigarh and nearly everybody agreed to be back in the city a month later. The three teachers were thrilled to know that we had two doctors, two chief engineers, two professors, a leading lawyer, a marine engineer, an IAS, an IPS and an Army officer, a politician, a cricketer, a senior Microsoft functionary and a couple of businessmen among us. As a doctor, I had stayed back in the city in a teaching institute and so was the lawyer friend. Over the past five decades, we had kept in touch with others, sometimes to offer our services or expertise to whoever asked for. What separates your school mates from your later-life friends and colleagues? School life creates the ultimate bonding, which is based upon purity of thought, selflessness and a unique camaraderie. When you meet your old mates, you are transported back in time as if in a time machine. You are Chotu, or Pinky or Napoleon. You still remember the pranks you played and the excursions you made, the school plays and sports, the inter-school competitions and the quirks of your teachers. We talked of our school canteen and how we still remembered the flavours of the snacks we were served by its owner, Fauja Singh. We met as what we were five decades ago, children of middle income parents in the 1960s when life was so simple — no cars, no TV, no malls and above all, no pretensions. We met with the same warmth as we had then, unmindful of how well we performed later in life — whether it was as a secretary to the Union government or a top entrepreneur or a humble office superintendent. Our teachers too shared their stories, including who were their favourites and who were on their “hit list”. It was fun for them to know we had nicknames for some of them and how we used to hoodwink them at times. The gathering ended with formation of a WhatsApp group. In a month, it has become the most active group on our smartphones. And guess what are the commonest messages being exchanged? They are riddles, quizzes and links to online games! dr_kochhar@hotmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-class-reunion/article33540753.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Series of thumbnails||There is a diversity of South Asian voices in The Banyan and Her Roots . The durable, predictable themes of our world emerge — small rebellions, forbidden or simply problematic love, the indifference of power, and the tug of family ties against the siren song of opportunity — but there is little to justify the lavish promotional quotes on the cover. Still, disappointment is the lot of any reader of a short story collection, since we will inevitably disagree with the particular taste of the compiler. Perhaps it’s best to remain politely silent on the sub-par stories in this lot and pick up some that have pith to them. Towards hope Neeru Iyer’s Moonwalker , about a porn actress’s renewed friendship with her suicidal brother, overcomes the clutter of Michael Jackson references to give us a story arc that bends faintly toward hope. It has a tight cast of sister, brother and mother who reach tentatively towards a reconciliation. In The Flyover , Saadia Azim draws the pulsating scene at a newly-built flyover, with debris being cleared before the inauguration and young Babon gathering with other migrant children who have been schooled in situ . They have gathered for a festival with balloons and a promised lunch, and some of them will recite poems, sing songs and win prizes. The chief guests smile and take phone calls, and their patient schoolteacher gives the families their last instructions. Only then does Babon realise that life will not continue in the way he imagined, in his sari-walled home with his mother, with cars whizzing past above on the flyover. The actual builders of the new marvel are all to be cleared out, like the post-construction debris. It is the second time Babon and his mother have lost their home, and we know it certainly will not be the last. Meghna Pant writes what we know will be a harsh tale just from the title. You can’t put the words “oleander” and “girl” together without forecasting murder. The narrator is forced by Taiji, her aunt-in-law, to terminate one pregnancy after another because the foetus is female. She finally prevails in carrying a girl child to term during the same months that Taiji approaches death. But when the child is born, is it the tiny screaming life that is possessed by Taiji or is it the narrator herself?  Iqbal, My Brother is Pakistani author Sonal Arshad Siraj’s portrait of a boy who parents his younger siblings, and the little brother who is the shining hope of the family. He takes wing and flies, and is there anyone who expects him to come back again? The story is told with powerful economy, almost in the manner of freeze frames that capture family moments. Slow anguish In The Water Level , C.V. Balakrishnan describes the hours before a river floods. Moideen Koya, having eaten his fill and settled in for a nap, is alerted by his workers that the water is rising. His mill, his truckload of new rice, his home and his family may all be washed away. Nearby, a destitute Soumini is also about to lose all she has, her own life and that of her infant. Balakrishnan tightens the two threads of his compact narrative till we too feel helpless in the face of an approaching disaster. And what happens after a disaster? Bangladeshi author Selina Hossain’s The Cyclone Survivor is a stark snapshot taken among the ruins. Halima, opening her eyes to daylight amidst the rubble of her life, has lost her husband, her daughter and her home. But she must face still more — the eyes of men who have scented an opportunity. Pakistani author Zoya Anwer’s The Missing Man takes the aftermath a bit further, to the anguish a family feels when a man has been taken away by the authorities and no one will tell them where he is. The anguish slowly becomes an everyday feeling, something almost banal. We’re left with an unfinished tale, as the family is too. Of the 25 stories in the collection, the best can be praised as readable, the reader’s reward an occasional mild shock or nod of recognition. We are unlikely to seek them out again, but the dutiful reader may stock this with similar volumes that attempt to represent in a thumbnail the lives of a huge swathe of humanity.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||New rules of engagement||The past 12 months have upended many of the basic assumptions about the India-China relationship, with the unprecedented crisis along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the biggest loss of life of Indian soldiers on the China border since 1967, putting a large question mark on the model of engagement since Rajiv Gandhi’s pathbreaking 1988 visit. That the model, predicated on shelving differences, maintaining peace on the border, and finding other areas of cooperation while managing competition, needs revisiting seems to be the growing consensus among most former senior Indian officials who have dealt with China. An intervention In his new book, Himalayan Challenge , Subramanian Swamy offers an intervention in this on-going debate and suggests a new way of engaging China — one that will involve, in his view, reassessing many of India’s fundamental positions on issues such as Tibet and the boundary. Few Indians have engaged with China for as long as Swamy has, going back to his time at Harvard University in the 1960s. An association that began with his interest in China’s economy evolved into a political association in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when he was among few Indians to travel to China and meet with the leadership. In the book, Swamy recounts his meetings with then leader Deng Xiaoping and provides a first-hand account of how Deng made the case for restoring the relationship after the post-war freeze. Among the most interesting chapters is the long history of contact between India and China going back to the early Buddhist interactions that Swamy delves into. He provides a colourful re-telling of the early travels of Indians to China and the importance with which they were received, and asks why those stories remain far less well-known than those of Chinese traveller-monks who came to India. His chapter on Tibet will certainly generate some debate, as he takes a hard look at the inconsistencies of how India has dealt with Tibet, going back to Nehru and more recently Vajpayee’s 2003 visit. The boundary dispute Swamy pulls no punches in assessing the current stand-off with China along the LAC and the crisis of 2020. He is critical of how the government has handled relations with China, and notes that he had, in 2016, warned then BJP President and now Home Minister Amit Shah, based on what he had heard from Beijing, that relations “were deteriorating” and “may end up in a major conflict in three to four years.” Shah was “dismissive” of this, he writes, and “sang the usual tune of Modi being highly popular everywhere”. He writes that the government has taken “soft measures in sticking together a response” to the current crisis and criticises the lack of transparency. He says there has been “an inability to take a unanimous position” which is “disturbing and fraught with national security consequences.” The matter of “acknowledging Chinese possession of Indian territory”, he writes, “cannot be treated as bad optics”. Swamy argues that “pragmatism” should dictate how India approaches a boundary settlement, and he makes a case for why pursuing a settlement that sees both sides find a “mutually convenient and maintainable border” is in India’s long-term interests. Only a settled border, he says, will enable India to pursue its more important long-term goal which, in his view, is “globally being a part of the triumvirate” with the U.S. and China.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Who let the cats out?||Dear Agony Akka,  We live in a very posh area and we are from a respectable family. But we are having no mental peace and no sleep for many nights because of a somewhat delicate matter concerning our new neighbours. They are a high society family: their house help told our house help that the man of the house is related to one Union Minister. We can see his SPG security. And he wears gem-rings on eight fingers. They have two imported cars and hold a satsang every week. But we are not bothered: we also have a posh car and our son works in a multinational bank. The problem is this: ever since they moved in, we are having a cat problem. How to say this? At night, their cats come to our balcony, our bedroom balcony, and make an infernal noise. It sounds like many infants shrieking in agony. There is so much noise that my husband and I are unable to sleep. I am getting migraine headache. So, we asked our house help to tell their house help to tell the wife of the relative of the Union Minister to keep their cats indoors. But they sent a reply back saying, sorry, cats have minds of their own, they cannot be controlled, we can’t do anything. How to deal with this situation? — Moderately Enraged Woman   Dear MEW,  Theburden of hailing from a respectable family is a heavy cross to bear. And clearly you bear it with great efficiency. But face it, the cats belonging to your well-connected neighbour are in season. In other words, their extra-territorial — and noisy — catty carnal congress is unavoidable. To do justice to your query, I scoured the Indian Penal Code (and the Feline Penile Code) to see which section of that spectacularly illiberal document may cover this peculiar contingency. But it appears that the keen and incisive minds of those who frame our laws have overlooked this everyday situation. Mind you, these are the same luminaries who drafted the law that makes kite-flying a violation of the provisions of the Aircraft Act, 1934, punishable with up to two years in jail. So, it’s not like they haven’t been thorough, just not thorough enough. Your neighbour’s hormonally excited cats, therefore, are cleverly exploiting a loophole in the law as they disport themselves on your balcony. In any case, given your neighbour’s day job, I am guessing you have no intention of proceeding against them in any legal sense. Discretion is arguably the better part of valour. Far easier to deal with amorous cats than with Black Cats. What then are your options? First, convert complaint to boast. Clearly, these sensitive creatures have picked your balcony over your neighbour’s posh interiors and exteriors for their l’affaires . You can discreetly drop this fact at your next bridge party. Second, drown the noise. You are an unusual woman. Other, cavalier people might have objected to their eardrums being assaulted by shrill satsinging but you’re disturbed only by cat-calls. Why not host louder all-night satsangs that frighten the felines away? Third, you could consider buying a dog. I am sure an expensive purebred with too much fur that makes it entirely unsuitable for this city would be right up your street. A disapproving upmarket dog would decrease the cats’ enthusiasm and increase your poshness quotient. But frankly, MEW, I wouldn’t recommend any of the above. Your daily life, however stylish, sounds vacuous. The nocturnal cat visits seem to provide the only frisson of excitement. Embrace the experience: your life will be the richer for it. — AA   agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/who-let-the-cats-out/article33540801.ece

North’s cue bid to show an invitational raise or better is standard practice today for tournament players. South won the opening club lead with his ace perforce and saw that his best chance to make the contract lay in the diamond suit. He would end with an overtrick if West held either missing diamond honor and might even bring in two overtricks if he caught a lucky diamond position. He drew trumps in three rounds, ending in his hand, and ran the eight of diamonds, losing to East’s jack. East shifted to the nine of spades, which ran around to dummy’s king. South ruffed a club back to his hand and ran the 10 of diamonds. He was sad to see that lose to the king, and another spade from East saw West take two spade tricks for down one. What happened? South had a good plan, he just executed it poorly. When East won the first diamond and shifted to the nine of spades, South should have played his queen. This would hold West to just one spade trick whatever he did, and declarer could then afford to lose another diamond trick, if he had to, and still make his contract.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/good-idea-bad-execution/article33540805.ece

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||New challenges for COVID-19 vaccine trials in India||On January 1, Pune-based Serum Institute’s Covishield vaccine was granted permission for restricted use, while Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin got a similar approval the next day with certain other riders. With two vaccines now being greenlighted for restricted use, the four high-risk priority groups, beginning with frontline health-care workers, will soon begin getting vaccinated. Nearly 300 million people belonging to the four priority groups are to be vaccinated with either of the two vaccines for free. The Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadilla only recently got the regulatory permission to carry out phase-3 trial and has to begin the recruitment, while the Hyderabad-based Biological E is yet to reach that stage. It is unclear if Dr. Reddy’s Laboratory has completed enrolment for phase-3. Challenges in recruiting In a webinar hosted by DBT on December 31, Krishna Mohan, Executive Director of Bharat Biotech, had mentioned about the challenges in recruiting participants for phase-3 trial, as many felt they had only a 50% chance of getting the candidate vaccine. The news about vaccines soon becoming available made the recruitment even more challenging. Pankaj Patel, Chairman of Zydus Cadilla said during the webinar that he anticipates difficulties in quick recruitment of volunteers but not with recruitment per se. “There are enough people committed to helping clinical studies. It might take longer but there won’t be a challenge with recruitment,” he said. Effects of approval Now, with two vaccines approved for restricted use, how much more challenging will it be to enrol participants for clinical trials, particularly phase-3 trials that need 25,000–30,000 people? “I think it would be more challenging than earlier for this reason,” says virologist Dr. Shahid Jameel, Director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University. Neurovirologist Dr. V. Ravi, formerly with NIMHANS, too, agrees that it would be challenging to recruit participants now. But says that DBT is addressing this through a call for research proposals for enhancing capacity for conduct of clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Dr. Jameel also points out other challenges in recruiting participants now. “With the daily cases coming down, many people who would have volunteered would not see the urgency now as earlier. Also, with increasing numbers of infected people, there would be a reduced pool of susceptible people. Prior infection is an exclusion criterion,” he says. Issues with slow spread With the number of daily fresh cases slowing down since mid-September despite the winter and festival season, the spread of the virus appears to be slowing down. This raises an altogether different challenge in carrying out phase-3 trials where the efficacy of the vaccine is measured by comparing the number of COVID-19 cases and the kind of protection offered in participants in the vaccine arm vis-à-vis the placebo arm. China had to rely on other countries to carry out phase-3 trials of its vaccines as the virus spread had slowed sharply. “It is going to be a challenge, mostly because of the requirement of certain cases to develop in the trial after vaccine administration to understand efficacy,” says Dr. Giridhara Babu, epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru. “It is best to recruit participants based on an antibody test, and have two distinct groups of people to participate (both infected and susceptible) in trials to understand the efficacy in both groups. This will ensure reaching the sample size efficiently.” Professor of Microbiology at CMC Vellore, Dr. Gagandeep Kang says vaccine manufacturers can carry out phase-3 trials outside India and efficacy results from such trials would be accepted by the Indian regulator for vaccine approval. Health-care workers are relatively better informed of clinical trials and are more likely to participate in trials. However, with the government vaccinating them on priority, this section of potential participants will now hesitate to take part in COVID-19 trials. Dr. Jameel sees another reason why health-care workers would hesitate to participate in trials when they have been prioritised to get the vaccine. He says: “Why would health-care workers participate if they are at high risk of infection, in line of vaccination, but have only a 50% chance of getting a vaccine?” Testing younger people Older people are particularly at risk of developing severe disease, and even dying, compared with younger people. That is precisely the reason why people over 50 years are one of the four high-risk groups to get the vaccine on priority. Since vaccines would become available in the market only after the government finishes vaccinating the priority groups, which would take many months, will trials be able to recruit only younger people? Less than ideal Only in an ideal situation will 100% of older people get vaccinated on priority. There will always be a certain percentage of older people who might be missed. Enrolling such people then depends on individual trial sites, says Dr. Ravi. Dr. Jameel says, “Yes, younger people can be induced to participate in phase-3 trials. But the vaccine will then only be tested largely in a young and generally healthy group, unlike the population it would target when approved.” Serum Institute suing a Covishield trial participant for Rs. 100 crore has surely not helped in encouraging people to participate in trials. “That was a public-relations disaster. The picture that emerged was a company abandoning and threatening a trial participant who volunteered initially for no monetary gain,” says Dr. Jameel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/new-challenges-for-covid-19-vaccine-trials-in-india/article33540907.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Harnessing what Einstein called spooky ‘action at a distance’||In last year’s budget session, the Finance Minister of the Government of India proposed that Rs. 8,000 crore be set aside to develop quantum science and technology. The detailed project report for a National Mission on Quantum Technology and Applications (NM-QTA) has been drawn out and finalised, and in the next couple of months, this mission might get approval. Recognising the importance of quantum technology, the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India had initiated a programme called QuEST at a modest 200-crore-rupee budget to explore the possibilities and engage with the researchers. Potential applications “In the international arena, huge investments, both public and private, are carried out to roll out quantum-based products. Potential applications include secure communication, fast computers that established quantum supremacy, sensors and quantum inspired devices,” says Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary DST. “The first mover has the advantage in garnering market share and technology supremacy.” Quantum technology Knowledge of quantum mechanics is an indivisible part of the electronics industry. However, in the twenty-first century, the term ‘quantum technology’ refers to something even more disruptive and radical. It involves exploiting the properties of individual, or a few fundamental particles, to achieve revolutionary changes in technology. One example is the property known as entanglement. When two objects, say two particles of light, also called photons, are in an entangled state, any changes made to the state of one, for example, its spin, are reflected in the other particle, however far they move from each other without breaking the entanglement. If developed, this property can be used to transmit a message at a very high level of secrecy from one point to another. In June 2020, China demonstrated quantum communication technology using the satellite Micius, by conducting a secret conference between two ground stations about 1,120 km apart. They used the satellite not to transmit the entire communication, but to simultaneously send a pair of secret keys to the two ground stations. Each secret key is one of two strings of entangled photons. Inter-ministerial mission The several areas in which this technology can be applied includes quantum communication, quantum encryption and quantum metrology. “In the years 1970-1980, people thought photonics would replace electronics, but it has actually augmented the latter. Similarly, now there is a big drive to look for domains where quantum effects can be harvested,” says Rajiah Simon, from The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai. Prof. Simon chaired the advisory committee to the team that drafted the detailed project report submitted to the government of India for approval. “NM-QTA is an inter-ministerial mission, and Department of Science and Technology is the nodal department," he added. Notable contributions One of the members of the committee, Hema Ramachandran of Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, who passed away in November 2020, contributed to the work of getting the report finalised under extremely trying conditions, many times from the hospital. This is recalled by Prof Simon: “She was extraordinarily brave, had talent, a remarkable sense of commitment and sacrifice. She was always concerned about the academia–industry interaction being less than desirable and had plans to improve this interaction and co-operation.” Dr. Sharma, describing her as a “gem of rare brilliance”, expressed hope that she would live through her work. The NM-QTA is yet to be approved by the government, and it is under process. “Around 300 scientists, faculty and researchers; 30 institutes and good number of stakeholders were involved in developing Detailed Project Report on NM-QTA. Mostly, these researchers and institutes shall be involved while implementing the mission once approved,” says Dr. Sharma. The approval, her colleagues hope, would be the best tribute to Hema Ramachandran who worked without letting any of them know her deteriorating health condition. Good progress There has been progress on several fronts as far as quantum technology is concerned, within India.  “There is a good progress in quantum communication, particularly in free space as well as in fibre. Prototypes have been developed and protocols are in place,” Dr. Sharma explains. “Once satellite-based transponders are available, free space communication could be demonstrated. Work is progressing smoothly and very soon, in less than six months, it will be demonstrated,” he adds. According to Dr. Sharma, on the fibre front, stretching beyond 150 km is being worked out. This includes development of repeaters so that signals could be boosted at every 150 km so that the desired communication can go for long distances.  There is a good progress in quantum communication, particularly in free space as well as in fibre.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Decoding a meteorite that fell near Jaipur in 2017||On June 6, 2017, at around 5 a.m., residents of Mukundpura village near Jaipur saw a bright trail in the sky followed by a thunderous sound. They spotted a burning object with a sulphur smell on the soft agricultural land. The meteorite broke into several fragments, but a pit of about 15 cm in diameter and 10 cm in depth was formed at the impact site. The local police immediately collected it and handed it over to the Geological Survey of India, Kolkata. Now, a new study has shed light on the mineralogy of the meteorite. Carbonaceous chondrite The meteorite named Mukundpura CM2 was classified to be a carbonaceous chondrite. “This is a type of stony meteorite, considered the most primitive meteorite and a remnant of the first solid bodies to accrete in the solar system. The composition of carbonaceous chondrites are also similar to the Sun,” explains Dwijesh Ray from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad in an email to The Hindu. He is the corresponding author of the work recently published in Geochemistry.  He adds that meteorites are broadly classified into three groups – stony (silicate-rich), iron (Fe–Ni alloy), and stony-iron (mixed silicate–iron alloy). Chondrites are silicate-droplet-bearing meteorites, and this Mukundpura chondrite is the fifth carbonaceous meteorite known to fall in India. Degrees of alteration The study revealed that Mukundpura CM2 had experienced varying degrees of alteration during the impact. Some minerals like forsterite and FeO olivine, calcium aluminium rich inclusion (CAI) minerals escaped alteration. Few magnetites, sulphides and calcites were also found. Detailed spectroscopic studies revealed that the meteorite had very high (about 90%) phyllosilicate minerals comprising both magnesium and iron. Further X-ray studies showed it also had aluminium complexes. Relevance to asteroids Dr. Ray adds that the results of the Mukundpura CM2 study are relevant to the surface composition of near-Earth asteroids Ryugu and Bennu. In October 2020, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission collected samples from Bennu and is expected to return in September 2023. Last month, Japan’s Hayabusa-2 mission landed on Earth with samples from Ryugu. “Infrared spectroscopy results suggest that spectral properties of the surface of these asteroids are consistent with CM carbonaceous meteorites. Therefore, a better understanding of the nature and evolution of such meteorites that have been aqueously altered will help considerably in the interpretation of results of these missions,” he writes. Early solar system On being asked why it is important to study meteorites, Dr. Ray explains: “Meteorites are representative of asteroids. Asteroids are the remnant debris of the inner solar system formation process and thus offer the formation history or the building blocks of the planets. Therefore, by studying meteorites in the laboratory and asteroids by exploration and sample return mission we try to reconstruct the activity of early solar system events. Also, asteroids are often rich in volatiles and other minerals and can be exploited for future planetary exploration.”  The composition of carbonaceous chondrites are also similar to the Sun.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Identical twins aren’t perfect clones, study shows||Identical twins are not exactly genetically the same, new research shows. Scientists in Iceland sequenced DNA from 387 pairs of identical twins – those derived from a single fertilized egg – as well as from their parents, children and spouses. That allowed them to find “early mutations that separate identical twins,” said Kari Stefansson, a geneticist at the University of Iceland and the company deCODE genetics, and co-author of the paper published Thursday in the journal Nature Genetics.  Genetic mutations A mutation means an alteration in a sequence of DNA – a tiny change that is not inherently good or bad, but can influence physical features or susceptibility to certain diseases. They can occur when a cell divides and makes a slight error in replicating DNA. Identical twins On average, identical twins have 5.2 of these early genetic differences, the researchers found. But about 15% of identical twin pairs have more genetic differences, some of them up to 100, said Stefansson. These differences represent a tiny portion of each twin's genetic code, but they could influence why one twin is taller or why one twin is at greater risk for certain cancers. Previously, many researchers believed that physical differences between identical twins were related mostly to environmental factors, such as nutrition or lifestyle. Jan Dumanski, a geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved in the new paper, praised it as “a clear and important contribution” to medical research. “The implication is that we have to be very careful when we are using twins as a model” for teasing apart the influences of nature and nurture, he said. Previous studies, including a 2008 paper in The American Journal of Human Genetics, have identified some genetic differences between identical twins. Setting the stage The new study goes beyond earlier work by including DNA of parents, children and spouses of identical twins. That allowed the researchers to pinpoint when genetic mutations occurred in two different kinds of cells – those present in just one individual and those inherited by that person’s children. They also found mutations that occurred before the developing embryo split into two, setting the stage for twins.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/identical-twins-arent-perfect-clones-study-shows/article33540906.ece

The crocodiles of today look very similar to those that lived during the Jurassic period some 200 million years ago. Though lizards and birds have evolved and diversified into many thousands of species, crocodiles have only a few species – just 25. Now, scientists at the University of Bristol explain how a particular pattern of evolution known as the ‘stop–start’ pattern and certain environmental changes could explain why crocodiles haven’t changed much. In a paper published in the journal Communications Biology, the scientists explain that crocodiles have a very slow rate of evolution. The team used a machine-learning algorithm to estimate the rates of evolution. Lead author Max Stockdale from the University of Bristol’s School of Geographical Sciences said in a release that it was fascinating to see how intricate a relationship exists between the Earth and the living things we share it with. He explains that the crocodiles landed upon a lifestyle that was versatile enough to adapt to the enormous environmental changes that have taken place since the dinosaurs were around. The team is also working to identify why some types of prehistoric crocodiles died out, while others didn’t||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/unchanging-crocs/article33540900.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Satya Paul: The sari shaper||“He lived his life with totality, not leaving anything unfinished,” begins Puneet Nanda about his father, Satya Paul, who passed away on Wednesday at the Isha Yoga Centre in Coimbatore. He was 79. Nanda had posted a few details on Facebook about Paul’s “inner journey” to spirituality and his last five years at Jaggi Vasudev or Sadhguru’s ashram . As the tributes poured in, designers, Paul’s former clients, and the media referenced his legacy and contribution to Indian fashion. Paul, originally born in Layyah, Pakistan, established his eponymous brand in 1985 with his then 17-year-old son. This was five years after he had launched L’Affaire in Delhi, reportedly the country’s first sari boutique. Their mission with Satya Paul was to be an Indian fashion brand that had mass appeal. “The choice of working with a sari was deliberate, as at that point 90% of women wore a sari and we wanted this to be a brand that was relevant to every Indian woman,” recalls Nanda, 52. Paul soon came to be known for his prints and vivid colours, and by the end of the 1980s, the label produced more than 50,000 units. At the time, many designers were struggling to produce even 100 pieces a year. Their print-forward designs were often inspired by wildlife, art and music. When they were bought over by Genesis Colors in 2001, Nanda had taken over as creative director of the brand. In the early 2000s, no other homegrown brand had a retail footprint even close to Satya Paul’s, with 30 exclusive stores across India. This brand stood for freewheeling experimentation, which included a limited edition of silk scarves that featured S.H. Raza’s paintings. A tie made of silk and white gold, studded with 261 diamonds, made headlines when actor Salman Khan wore it at a charity event. Questioning norms “The brand played a large role in supporting the weaving crafts,” Nanda adds, referring to the saris that were categorised under four collections every season. He says that they had a clear vision with the creative process. “This was at a time when there was no designer brand, no fashion awareness,” he continues, explaining how the Museum collection came from master weavers and that “it often took years to convince them to work on special designs”. Renaissance was a print collection with global influences, while Signature had exuberant florals and optical illusions that were described as “pieces of kinetic art” back then by The New York Times . Popularly known as cocktail saris today, they are synonymous with the brand. Meanwhile, with the Avant Garde collection, “everything that was the norm in a sari was questioned”, according to Nanda. “We stitched it like a dress, or down the middle as a trouser, or a Grecian drape. We made it out of various materials, with metallic fibre weaving, or printed graffiti or cartoons, and used it as a billboard for social messaging.” These drapes were a precursor of today’s concept saris. “The brand that [Satya Paul] set up had so much foresight. He was the first person to take the sari, a staple in every woman’s wardrobe, and turn it into a ready-to-wear piece,” says leading fashion stylist Anaita Shroff Adajania (who was behind a successful Satya Paul campaign with celebrities a couple of years ago). “I met him a few times at fashion shows. He was very elusive, but always very warm,” she adds. Not lost legacy Since Nanda left the label a decade ago, several other designers took over the creative helm, including Masaba Gupta. “As a fashion student, I remember not being taught at all about Indian fashion,” says Gupta. “His passing has reminded us that young Indian designers must know about the resources that came before them. Satya Paul is and was one of India’s few brands that was both creative and had a retail footprint, and this is an important story for Indian fashion.” Today, Satya Paul is owned by Reliance Brands, India’s largest player in the luxury market, operating close to 50 brand partnerships (including Tiffany & Co, Giorgio Armani and Bottega Veneta). Last June, renowned fashion designer and India’s master of minimalism, Rajesh Pratap Singh, was named Satya Paul’s creative director. “Satya Paul took textiles and turned them into something very modern and relevant. I hope to take that emotion and spirit forward,” he tells me. Having first interacted with Paul when he had his final submission as a student at NIFT, Singh has, in the past, referred to Paul’s impeccable dressing, his interest in textile innovation, and his attention to detail at his many showrooms. The recent Satya Paul collection under Singh, Valley of Flowers, clearly references the bold colour and design language of the label’s founder. Nanda has big hopes for Singh, who is leading the brand that bears his father’s name. Paul was a seeker all his life, Nanda had observed in his recent Facebook post. But in many ways he was also the man who set India’s contemporary fashion grammar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/satya-paul-the-sari-shaper/article33541342.ece

10 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||After handling farm and home, women reinforce stir||Forty-two-year-old Kavita Singh reached the Singhu border on Saturday after holding down the fort back home in Haryana for over a month while her husband protested in Delhi for the repeal of the three controversial farm laws. A resident of Bhiwani district, Ms. Singh said: “All these days we were back home. This is the first time that I have been able to come to the Singhu border for the protest. All our relatives, especially the men, have been at the protest since the first day. Now that they have gone back for a few days to water the fields, we have got the chance to come here.” Ms. Singh is among several women protesters who have been working on the fields — while managing household chores — for over a month, and taking part in the agitation whenever their relatives returned to the village. Several women explained how they have been attending the protest in a rotational manner so that work on the fields continued unabated ahead of the harvest season. Sarabhjit Kaur, 68, who reached the Singhu border from Punjab’s Anandpur Sahib two days ago, said: “There was a lot to do at home over the last few weeks. While most of the farmers are here protesting, several others are also required to stay back to take care of the fields. There are household chores to be done as well. This week, some of the people who had been here since the beginning have gone back and so, I decided to join the protest in their absence.” The farmers who have remained at the Capital’s borders for over a month now have been demanding a legal guarantee of the Minimum Support Price system and have reiterated that they will not move an inch till their demands are met.  Residents of Punjab’s Patiala, Sukhwinder Kaur and Balwinder Kaur said that “unity” among relatives and neighbours ensured that all the fields were equally tended to when the people concerned were away to participate in the protest. Unity and trust “We come here quite often and are usually alternating with other members of the family. There is enough unity between neighbours and we follow a rotational basis. This ensures that when we are here they can look after our fields and when we go back we do the same for their fields. There is trust among all,” said Sukhwinder. Meanwhile, coming to the Singhu border with langar is a weekly affair for Rajwant Kaur Bassi and a group of 16 others. “We come to the border every weekend and bring langar with us. Apart from the trolleys that have already come from our villages, we are a group of 15-20 people who make sure to come here. For the rest of the week, we are the ones managing the fields. Now with Lohri around, even though it is a festival of happiness, we really have nothing to celebrate this year. How can we celebrate under these circumstances?” said Ms. Bassi. While several of the farmers are attending the protest on a rotational basis, for some like 55-year-old Jasmeet Kaur, participating in the protest has meant losses on the farm as there is a lack of manpower back home. “While I own two acres of land, who will work on it? Both my son and husband have passed away and I have a granddaughter to take care of. Despite a lot of losses, I will continue to stay here till the laws are repealed. If the laws are not repealed, I will have nothing to go back to as it is going to affect us adversely,” said Jasmeet, a resident of Ludhiana. Mamta Kadyan, a resident of Haryana’s Jhajjar district, said that this year there was a “no profit, no loss scenario”. “Our forefathers have always told us to fight for our rights and that is exactly what we are doing. There is a huge possibility that we will not get the returns that we usually get from our farms, but this year there’s a larger battle that we are fighting. We will not move till the laws are repealed,” said Ms. Kadyan, who has been at the Dhansa border since the first day and visited the Singhu border for the first time on Saturday.  Our forefathers told us to fight for our rights and that is what we are doing.

10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The threat posed by avian influenza||The story so far: Avian influenza, popularly known as bird flu, has been reported from Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh in recent weeks. During the first week of January, reports of unusual deaths of a large number of birds, including wild ones, started coming in from many States, indicating that the virus is being actively transmitted among various bird groups. The two virus types identified so far in the outbreaks — H5N1 and H5N8 — come under the category of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which is of major concern to those keeping birds, because it leads to disease and death of fowl and causes economic havoc. H5N1 is a known threat to humans as well. The spread of the disease in a variety of birds in several geographical regions, and the seasonal movement of migratory birds, have prompted the Centre to issue an alert to States to adhere to the National Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza 2021. Internationally, the World Animal Health Information System in December 2020 identified outbreaks of HPAI in Taiwan, Iran, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, a dozen European Union countries, Ukraine, Russia and the U.K., leading to a loss of over 4.8 million birds by the end of December 2020.   How serious is avian flu for bird health? Avian Influenza (AI) is a highly contagious viral disease, affecting a variety of birds, including those connected with human consumption — chickens, ducks, turkeys, quails — as well as pet birds and wild birds. The World Organization for Animal Health, which collaborates with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), says HPAI virus strains H5N1, H5N2, H5N8, H7N8 have been identified in outbreaks, indicating active circulation. Infection histories point to H5N1 and H7N9 viruses posing a threat to human health as well. The FAO says wild birds act as a natural reservoir of AI viruses. Their migratory movement could bring these pathogens to poultry, waterfowl and other domestic birds through contact. HPAI produces severe clinical signs of disease in birds, causing a high degree of mortality and economic loss. The response to an outbreak is a containment strategy, which is primarily centred around removing the diseased birds through culling. Such mass destruction causes a severe impact on farmers. In the latest viral spread, in just one instance, Kerala has already identified over 69,000 birds, mostly ducks, stricken with H5N8, to be culled at four infection sites in the Kuttanad area of Alappuzha. What is the economic impact of bird flu? India’s poultry sector, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, is worth Rs. 80,000 crore, of which the organised sector represents 80%, and the rest is distributed among unorganised sectors, including backyard poultry-keeping which is crucial for income and nutritional security. Exports, mainly focused on West Asia, neighbouring countries and East Asia, were valued at Rs. 532 crore in 2017, with an emphasis on processed products such as egg powder, yolk powder, pharma ingredients, and chicken products. Avian flu is seen as a threat to the further growth of the sector as a whole. By the government’s estimates, there are 30 million farmers who keep backyard birds, while small and medium farmers who contribute to aggregators are crucial players in the larger ecosystem. India has a base of over 729 million poultry birds, of which 30% are layers and 40% are broilers, according to the National Action Plan for Egg and Poultry 2022. This large base shows that a serious outbreak of HPAI, as was witnessed during 2005-06 in some States, can be catastrophic. During that year, official data put the number of culled birds at over one million. In later years, bird flu surfaced in several States, such as Manipur, Assam, West Bengal, Tripura, Bihar, and Kerala, leading to destruction of millions of birds. Where culling of birds is undertaken to combat bird flu, the National Action Plan prescribes compensation to be given to farmers at fixed rates. This, once again, underscores the value of prevention to protect captive birds. Does bird flu pose a threat to human beings? The WHO, in its literature on avian influenza, states that humans can be infected with virus subtypes H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2. In a recent instance of human infection, a one-year-old was confirmed to have H5N1 in Lao PDR, thought to have been acquired from backyard birds kept by the family. Infection in other birds in the region was also confirmed. On the H5N1 virus, the WHO says, “Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%.” The global health body records that since 2003, there have been 862 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1, and 455 deaths have been reported from 17 countries. On the H5N8 strain, the consensus is that human infection cannot be ruled out, although the likelihood is low. However, H5N6 infection, of a related clade (a descendant type) has occurred among humans, the WHO says. One case of the H9N2 strain, in a three-year old girl, was reported last October from Guangdong, China. It was mildly symptomatic and was detected during routine surveillance for Influenza-like illness. AI viruses in poultry have a public health dimension because they cause severe disease in humans and “have the potential to mutate to increase transmissibility among humans”, the WHO adds. This calls for pandemic preparedness. Human-to-human transmission is believed to have taken place in some instances as a result of close or prolonged contact, but “there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission identified”. Why does bird flu recur? Did the major outbreaks not help form strategies? It is impossible to eradicate influenza viruses because they persist in a vast reservoir of aquatic birds. The answer to why there are periodic outbreaks that spread to domestic environments may lie in local bird-keeping conditions. After the unprecedented outbreak in 2006 in Asia, in which as many as 258 cases of bird flu in humans had been reported till November 13 of that year  , experts who met at an international conference in New Delhi under the aegis of WHO felt that continuous growth in poultry farming under poor sanitary conditions was sustaining the virus, with multiple susceptible species living in the same area. This underscores the importance of prevention and surveillance. The Delhi Declaration passed at the summit resolved on a common framework for countries to build local strategies, but it did not lay emphasis on preserving the natural environment, which is key to helping wild birds move safely in an unspoilt habitat and stop transmission of viruses to domestic fowl, which threatens humans with infections and a potential pandemic due to mutating viruses. What steps can be taken to minimise risk to domestic birds? Governments lay down biosecurity measures to keep domestic birds safe from transmission by wild or migratory birds and prevent local spread. The protocol involves active surveillance of bird areas to identify emerging outbreaks. On the other hand, it is wrong and counterproductive, the FAO cautions, to attempt elimination of wild birds near human settlements through hunting, poisoning, and habitat destruction. Such activity disperses wild birds, and the viruses, to new areas. Moreover, hunting of wild birds and the absence of biosecurity measures bring the viruses directly to domestic fowl. In the wake of an outbreak in 2020, the U.K. issued advice making it legally necessary for bird-keepers in that country to house them in such a manner that they do not come into contact with wild birds. The measures, which have general relevance to farmers everywhere, include housing or netting all captive birds, cleansing and disinfecting clothing, footwear and vehicles, reduction of people’s movement in the farm bird areas to reduce contamination, eliminating or reducing contact between captive and wild birds, particularly through feed and water storage, and cleansing and disinfecting production areas. The U.K. uses a checklist approach to help farmers with best practices. In India, the Central government requires veterinary staff to conduct inspections periodically under the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009, to catch any signs of disease among birds and other animals early. However, aquatic wild birds are often found in close proximity to domestic ones in many locations in India, near lakes, dams and reservoirs, making it difficult to achieve segregation. The waterways of Kerala are a good example of this phenomenon.  Governments lay down biosecurity measures to keep domestic birds safe from transmission by wild or migratory birds and prevent local spread.

10 January 2021||GURUGRAM,||Infrastructure projects hit COVID bump||Hit adversely by the COVID-19 outbreak last year, projects for improvement of various junctions in the Millennium City, including Atul Kataria Chowk and HUDA City Centre Chowk, widening of a section of the Gurugram-Alwar Highway (NH-248A) and Patadui Road, have been delayed for several months now. Scheduled to be finished in 2020, the projects of Atul Katariya Chowk and HUDA City Centre Chowk, involving the construction of a flyover and an underpass each, have now been delayed primarily on account of the restrictions on construction activities and non-availability of labour due to the pandemic since March last year. Initially, scheduled to be completed by December 4, 2019, refurbishment project of Atul Katariya Chowk junction, a project announced by the Chief Minister Manohar Lal, was expected to be completed by 2020-end. Shifting of utilities The delay was mostly caused due to shifting of utilities. However, a Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) meeting in December last year to review various projects found that only 27% work had been completed and extended the completion date for the project till February 2021. The tender for the project was allotted on May 5, 2018, at a cost of Rs. 47.70 crore and involves construction of 715 metre-long flyover along Old Delhi Road and 620 metre-long underpass along the Mata Road, besides a service road. Similarly, the project for the improvement of the HUDA City Centre Chowk involves construction of 270-metre-long flyover and 735-metre-long underpass passing from Signature Road to Subhash Chowk. More than 80% work for the flyover has been completed, but the progress of civil works achieved is only 41%. The completion date of work has now been extended up to March 2021. The work for the project was allotted on February 25, 2019, at a cost of Rs. 52.52 crore and the scheduled date of completion was April 15, 2020. Running far behind the schedule, the project for the improvement of junction at Mahabir Chowk and Aggarsen Chowk near city bus stand was awarded on February 15, 2019, and as per the contract, the work was scheduled to be completed by December 14, 2020, at a cost of Rs. 25.92 crore. However, the project has achieved progress of only 12% and is slated to be delayed. The work is being undertaken by the Public Works Department (Buildings and Roads) with funds being provided by the GMDA. Past deadline Slated to be completed by May 11, 2020, as per the contract, the project for six-laning of road from Umang Bhardwaj Chowk to Dwark Expressway has seen an overall progress of 36% and the completion date has now been extended till March this year. It involves 820 metre-long flyover at Basai Chowk and 910 metre-long railway over bridge (ROB) on the Delhi-Rewari railway line. The permission for construction of the ROB has been received and the most of the issues related to shifting of utilities and land litigations has been addressed. Running ahead of schedule, the four-lane underground U-turn near Ambience Mall, a National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) project, was likely to be completed by May 31 last year. But the project has now been delayed past its September 2020 deadline, as per the contract, due to the COVID-induced lockdown and scarcity of funds. The NHAI was to bear half of the cost for the Rs. 102.94-crore project, and the rest was to be equally shared by the DLF and the Ambience Mall owners. But the DLF and the Ambience Mall owners delayed the payments. “The DLF has now paid its share and the project is likely to be completed by March this year,” said a senior NHAI official. Travel time The motorists coming from Jaipur and going towards Ambience Mall and DLF Cyber Hub are now forced to travel all the way to Rajokri flyover in Delhi to take a U-turn. After completion, the 377 metre-long underground U-turn will not just reduce the travel time, but also help reduce traffic congestion under the Rajokri flyover during the rush hours. For the six-laning and strengthening of 22-km-long stretch of National Highway-248A, locally known as “Sohna Road”, starting from Rajiv Chowk, the NHAI has awarded two separate tenders. The first package of the project involves six laning and strengthening of the road from 0.340 km to 9.282 km starting from Rajiv Chowk and 4.752 km-long elevated road. The stipulated date for the completion of this package, as per the contract, is July 31, 2021. The second package, with the stipulated completion date of July 29, 2021, covers the remaining distance. Three-lane service road will also be constructed on both sides of the road. “Both the packages of the project are under progress. The first package, with 32% progress, is likely to be completed by June next year. However, the second package has finished around 70% works and we hope to wrap it up by this year end,” said the NHAI official, not willing to be named. Besides the pandemic, the first package of the project was also delayed due to collapse of a section of an elevated corridor in August last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/infrastructure-projects-hit-covid-bump/article33541136.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||The logistics of a massive vaccination drive||The story so far:The Union Health Ministry on Saturday announced that the COVID-19 vaccination drive will begin on January 16, after the forthcoming festivals of Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal and Magh Bihu. The government had earlier approved emergency use authorisation (EUA) for two vaccine candidates — the Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine developed jointly by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Bharat Biotech’s indigenous Covaxin. With Saturday’s announcement, the country is set to begin population-level immunisation for COVID-19 and finds itself facing one of the biggest logistical challenges in a long while. What are the challenges? U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, speaking to reporters on Friday, said about vaccine distribution in the U.S.: “[It would be] the greatest operational challenge we will ever face as a nation.” In India, with its vast geographical spread, the sheer volume of population, and questions of access, the vaccination drive will be fraught with challenges, and the most careful planning down to the last mile is required, not only to vaccinate and provide both the doses, but to also monitor adverse events. The Centre recently conducted dry runs of COVID-19 vaccination to check if the systems laid down for the operationalisation of vaccine delivery are in place and working well. Who is in line for a vaccine? Priority will be given to the healthcare and frontline workers, estimated to be around 3 crore in number, followed by those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities, numbering around 27 crore, the Health Ministry said on Saturday. People who have an active COVID-19 infection or associated symptoms are advised not to come to vaccination camps to avoid spreading the virus. They may seek a vaccine 14 days after the symptoms abate, according to the FAQ issued by the Health Ministry earlier. Taking the COVID-19 vaccine is entirely voluntary. What is Co-WIN? In good measure, the dry runs were not only a step to test the operational feasibility of various States to roll out the vaccine programme effectively, but also a recce to see if the electronic vaccine intelligence network, eVIN, used during routine immunisation programmes, and remodelled as Co-WIN, was functional at the field-level. Co-WIN aspires to be a comprehensive digital database of every COVID-19 vaccine that will be administered in India — tracking beneficiaries, intimating them about vaccine sites and dates, pre- and post-vaccination procedures, issuance of vaccination certificates, and follow up through the booster dose. On January 5, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the details of healthcare and frontline workers in line for a shot had already been updated on the Co-WIN system, in bulk, by State and district health authorities. Currently, self-registration is not allowed on the application. It has been promised that ‘at a later stage of implementation’, Co-WIN will also be available as an application or as a website in multiple Indian languages so that beneficiaries can access it to keep track of their own progress and be connected organically to the system, if questions were to arise. It will also be a tool for others to “register” for a vaccine once the first line of targeted beneficiaries is cleared. Aadhar or any accepted photo ID card may be used to verify the identity of the applicant to prevent misuse. Additionally, documents authorised by specialists to indicate co-morbidities or any other health conditions may be demanded. Further details are also awaited on the steps that will be taken to allocate turns in the schedule after the registration and for further communication regarding the date and venue of vaccination, even to people who may not have access to devices or the Internet. As per current information, text messages will be sent out after registration, telling the registrant where and when to go to get the shot. After the second dose, Co-WIN will generate a digital certificate of completion for individuals who have been vaccinated. Messaging, chatbots and helpline assistance are available on the app, and any adverse event after the vaccination may be communicated back to the authorities through one of these access points. What is the kind of field-level mobilisation required for the drive? The existing State and district health networks are readying themselves to set in place every nut and bolt in the elaborate systems that will be required for the vaccination drive. This includes mobilising personnel, making sure transportation systems are in place to take the vaccine packs to different camps, ensuring healthcare personnel are able to reach the spot on time, making sure a cold-chain system is in place, identifying and removing hurdles that might prevent beneficiaries in the general population (at a later date) from reaching the spot, and ensuring coordination between different teams on actual vaccination days to avoid any hitches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-logistics-of-a-massive-vaccination-drive/article33540828.ece
10 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||11 people detained for defacing Aurangzeb Lane signboards||Eleven people have been arrested for allegedly defacing two Aurangzeb Lane signboards in Lutyens’ Delhi on Saturday, the police said. A senior police officer said that police received information at 5.40 a.m. that a few people have gathered at Aurangzeb Lane at Tughlaq Road. “After reaching the spot, police personnel found that 11 people led by Anuradha Bhargav (30), a resident of Karnal and an advocate by profession, had defaced an Aurangzeb Lane signboard and pasted a poster saying Guru Teg Bahadur Lane on another signage,” the officer said. The 11 persons were detained and taken to Tughlaq Road police station where they were formally arrested after a case was registered under relevant sections. During probe, the accused allegedly told the police that they’re inspired by “Hind Di Chadar” — which is also used to refer Sikh Guru Teg Bahadur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/11-people-detained-for-defacing-aurangzeb-lane-signboards/article33541134.ece
10 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two minors held for killing 10-yr-old boy||Two minors have been apprehended for allegedly killing a 10-year-old boy whose body was recovered from a mosque in north-east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas, the police said on Saturday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-East) Ved Prakash Surya said that one Shamim, a resident of Shri Ram Colony, lodged a missing report of his son at Khajuri Khas police station on Friday. He told the police that the boy was missing since the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. Shamim said that on Thursday around 6.50 p.m., his son went to Madina Masjid of Shri Ram Colony, but did not return. Body was found buried During investigation, a joint search was conducted by the police and the parents of child in the nearby areas of their house. The boy’s body was found buried under the debris in a corner on the second floor of the Madina Masjid. Shamim identified him as his son, the police said. The police analysed CCTV footage of the area and all persons present at the masjid at 7.15 p.m. were examined. It was found that the victim was last seen with his two minor friends. “Both the juveniles were examined separately and contradictions were found in their versions. Later, they confessed to killing their friend and were apprehended,” Mr .Surya said. During interrogation, the accused allegedly told the police they wanted to extort money from the deceased’s father by kidnapping him. Earlier, a few ago, the accused had given the victim water infused with sleeping pills. However, nothing happened to him and their plan flopped. On Friday, the 17-year-old boy gave money to the other accused and asked him to bring momos from a nearby vendor. On the pretext of eating momos, they took the victim to the first floor of the masjid where they enjoyed the snack and thereafter, took the deceased to the roof of the mosque and strangulated him before hiding his body under the debris. Decomposed body In another incident, a decomposed body of a woman was found in a drain in east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar on Friday. No physical injuries are apparent. Teams are looking to identify the body, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-minors-held-for-killing-10-yr-old-boy/article33541138.ece
10 January 2021||January 10 2021 00:00 IST,||Ousting Trump||The story so far: There is a huge clamour for the removal of U.S. President Donald Trump before January 20, when Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th U.S. President. Democrats have launched a fresh drive to remove Mr. Trump from office after he incited his Republican supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, the seat of political power. Two avenues have been suggested for this: the exercise of the 25th Amendment of the Constitution or impeachment. On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was quoted by agencies as saying that she had instructed the House Rules Committee to move ahead with a motion for impeachment and the legislation on the 25th Amendment, if Mr. Trump did not resign. But it is easier said than done. What does the Amendment say? Section 4 of the 25th Amendment allows for the immediate removal of the President “whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” When that happens, the “Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.” However, Vice-President Mike Pence seems to have no desire to take that step. For exercising the 25th amendment, therefore, Congress has to set up a special commission to determine that the President is unable to discharge his duties. Since such a step has never been taken before, Congress will enter a new field altogether. It will not only have to decide on the composition of the special commission, but will also have to set up the modalities for making such a determination. In addition, it will be difficult to convene the Senate to take up the issue of this special commission. The Senate will not reconvene for any substantive business till January 19. Although it will hold twopro formasessions next week — on January 12 and January 15 — it is barred from conducting any kind of business during those days without agreement from all the 100 senators. The presence of Mr. Trump’s allies in the Senate makes that highly unlikely. Further, even if the Cabinet decides on the competency of Mr. Trump, he can resume his powers and duties by mere transmission to the two Houses his written declaration that no inability exists. He can also fire the principal officers who supported the initial declaration. Of course, the majority of the Cabinet, as it exists, or the special committee can again transmit to the house another fresh declaration that the President is unable to discharge his powers and duties, for the Vice-President to again assume the powers and duties of the President. For him to continue, however, it has to be sustained by a two-thirds majority of both the Houses. All in all, the removal of Mr. Trump from the presidency through the 25th Amendment before January 20 is highly improbable, if not impossible. What about impeachment? The House of Representatives can draw up the articles of impeachment and pass it without any difficulty. However, the impeachment trial would have to take place in the Senate, and as mentioned earlier, it will not be able to act on the articles of impeachment received from the House without agreement from all the 100 senators before January 19. Therefore, no substantive action can be taken to remove Mr. Trump from office before January 20. A copy of draft articles of impeachment circulating among members of Congress charged Mr. Trump with “inciting violence against the government of the United States” in an attempt to overturn his election loss to Mr. Biden,Reutersreported. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell sent a memo to Republican senators detailing a possible timetable for an impeachment trial. He noted the Senate will hold its next work session on January 19 and needs the consent of all the 100 senators to convene sooner, meaning a trial would not begin until Mr. Trump was out of office, a source familiar with the document said. What happens after he leaves office? Mr. Trump could still be impeached after he leaves office. Most constitutional lawyers agree that an ex-President can be impeached, which would have the effect of preventing him from running for the presidency again. Irrespective of one’s views on Mr. Trump’s character, he will continue to be the President till the noon of January 20. “Impeaching President Donald Trump with 12 days remaining in his presidency would only serve to further divide the country,” White House spokesman Judd Deere told the media on Friday. Dr. Balachandran is a policy commentator and a former Development Correspondent ofThe Hindu  The removal of Mr. Trump from the presidency before January 20 through the 25th Amendment or the impeachment route while in office is highly improbable, if not impossible, according to experts   People who have COVID-19 or associated symptoms are advised not to go to vaccination camps to avoid spreading the virus. They may seek a vaccine 14 days after symptoms abate, according to the Health Ministry||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ousting-trump/article33540830.ece
10 January 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi Congress workers stage protest over demolition of Hanuman temple||Delhi Congress workers staged a demonstration reciting ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ in protest against the demolition of a temple in Chandni Chowk on Saturday. The protesters led by party’s Delhi unit president Anil Kumar assembled at Gauri Shankar Mandir and were stopped by the police when they were moving towards the demolition site. The Congress workers raised slogans against the BJP and the AAP. The Hanuman temple was demolished by the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation on court orders. It was demolished as an “encroachment” to pave way for the Chandni Chowk facelift project of the Delhi government. “We wanted to hold the protest at the demolition site, but the police put up barricades to prevent the Congress workers from reaching there... so we recited Hanuman Chalisa in front of the Gauri Shankar Mandir,” Mr. Kumar said. The party has sought time to meet L-G Anil Baijal on Monday to talk about the issue, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-congress-workers-stage-protest-over-demolition-of-hanuman-temple/article33541141.ece

The AAP also said that it has held 267 “mohalla sabhas” in 60 constituency Assemblies of Delhi to expose the BJP’s alleged corruption in the three municipal corporations. On Monday, the AAP had announced that they will hold 2,500 mohalla-level meetings to tell people about an alleged Rs. 2,500-crore corruption done by the BJP-ruled civic bodies from January 7 to 15. “People are coming to the sabhas and revealing the past incidents with them in the public. Every day, hundreds of such incidents of corruption are being disclosed by the people in different mohalla sabhas,” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP leader and party in-charge for municipal corporations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/have-helped-farmers-send-defamation-notices-aap/article33541133.ece
