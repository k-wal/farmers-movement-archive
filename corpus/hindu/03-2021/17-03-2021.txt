17 March 2021||New Delhi,||Vaccines to foreign countries not at the expense of Indians: Centre||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan told the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday that COVID-19 vaccines were not being supplied to other countries at the expense of Indian citizens. He said on Monday alone, 30 lakh people were administered the vaccine, and till now nearly 3 crore people had been inoculated. “A healthy balance is being maintained. Yesterday [Monday] over 30 lakh people got the vaccines. The criteria has been fixed according to the World Health Organization and other international standards. It is a dynamic process. Even today among the priority groups if anyone who wants a vaccine can register on Co-WIN portal and get vaccinated. Vaccine is free in all government hospitals. Private hospitals can only charge Rs. 250. Rs. 100 has been fixed for hospital arrangements,” he said, responding to members during Question Hour. He said as a strategy, the price of vaccine had been fixed at Rs. 150. The Minister said 5.94 crore doses of vaccines had been sent to 72 countries till now. “Science is global. The technology could be local but the benefit should be shared with all.” As per the Union Health Ministry data till 7 p.m. on Tuesday (59th day of the drive), more than 3.48 crore vaccine doses had been administered in the country. ‘It will take 18 years’ Congress member Shaktisinh Gohil rued the slow pace of vaccination and said only 0.35% of the population had been vaccinated so far. “At this rate, it will take 18 years to complete the vaccination process,” he said. To a question by Sukhram Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party whether arrangements could be done for people above 60 years of age to get vaccinated at home, the Minister said, “The issue has been flagged to us but everyone who is vaccinated at hospitals is required to be kept under observation for 30 minutes. The matter will be raised before an expert committee and if it does not compromise their health, it can be considered.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vaccines-to-foreign-countries-not-at-the-expense-of-indians-centre/article34087293.ece
17 March 2021||Pune,||Plan for the worst, Maharashtra told||Concerned over Maharashtra’s soaring COVID-19 cases, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan has written to the State government, ticking-off the administration for inadequate contact-tracing efforts while urging that it must focus on strict and effective containment strategies and plan for a worst-case scenario. In a letter to Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte based on a Central team report, Mr. Bhushan, while cautioning that the State was in the throes of “a second wave” of the pandemic, has stated that the measures like weekend lockdowns and night curfews (currently being deployed by the State government), had a “very limited impact on containing or suppressing the transmission.” “There is a very limited active effort to track, test, isolate cases and quarantine contacts. There is no adherence to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour among people both in rural and urban areas,” wrote the Union Health Secretary. Ramping up vaccination He also pointed out that eight of the top 10 districts of India in terms of active COVID-19 infections were in Maharashtra and the only way to rein in the contagion was to ramp up the pace of vaccination, especially in those districts witnessing a steep case surge. “Hence, the administration should focus on a strict and effective containment strategy…For every positive case, at least 20 to 30 close contacts [including family contacts, social contacts’ workplace contacts, and other casual contacts] need to be promptly traced and tracked. While the health infrastructure is adequate as of now, the State should plan for a worse-case scenario,” Mr. Bhushan wrote. He further said that the Central team had inferred that the administrative mechanism in the State should be “re-instated to the level witnessed in August -September last year to contain/suppress the COVID-19 transmission.” State Health Minister Rajesh Tope, on his part, refuted allegations that the Maharashtra government was “not serious” about tackling the renewed surge. He said he had sought 2.20 crore vaccine doses from the Centre for the ongoing inoculation drive. Mr. Tope, who was in New Delhi on Tuesday, said he had written to the Union Health Minister, requesting the Centre to supply 20 lakh doses per week to the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/plan-for-the-worst-maharashtra-told/article34087921.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Older IIMs lag behind newer ones in enforcing quota rule||Although some of the newer Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) have made some progress in hiring faculty members from the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes over the past year, these communities make up less than 10% of the faculty at the older, more prestigious IIMs, according to data obtained through RTI requests by a Ph.D. graduate from IIM-Bengaluru. Members of the Global Alumni Network, a group of about 300 alumni of the IITs and the IIMs fighting for social justice in these elite institutions, welcomed the limited progress but asked why the older IIMs were being allowed to break the law “with impunity”. No data from IIM-A At the very top of the prestige list, IIM-Kolkata has no SC or ST faculty member, but it does have two OBC faculty members, who make up less than 3% of its total strength of 77. IIM-Bengaluru has 6% of its 103 faculty members from the reserved categories: 3 SC, 1 ST and 2 OBC community members. IIM-Ahmedabad said it “does not maintain category wise information for faculty” and failed to provide any information to the RTI plea filed by Siddharth Joshi. Of the other first generation IIMs, Lucknow has less than 5% of faculty members from the reserved categories, while Kozhikode has less than 10%. Indore echoed IIM-A and said no information was available. All data is for December 2020. “The key is to implement reservation in the doctoral programmes, so that the pool of diverse candidates available for faculty hires increases. But most of these Ph.D. graduates [from the reserved categories] are now filling up positions at the newer IIMs as the older IIMs are still resistant,” Dr. Joshi said. Some of the second generation IIMs have done better. The institute at Shillong has more than 30% of faculty members from the reserved categories, while Raipur has 25% and Jammu more than 22%. At the other extreme is IIM-Nagpur, which does not have a single faculty member from any of the reserved categories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/more-diversity-in-faculty-recruitment-in-newer-iims/article34087302.ece
17 March 2021||Shiv Sahay Singh Kolkata,||Protests, violence continue to rock BJP||For the second consecutive day protests rocked the West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as hundreds of party workers took to the streets across the State, protesting against nomination of candidates for the third and fourth phase of the eight-phase Assembly elections. On the second day, the BJP supporters turned violent at the party’s office in Hastings. The police had to resort to force to disperse BJP supporters in which one policeman was injured and six BJP supporters were taken in custody. Party workers from Panchla, Udaynarayanpur, Raidighi, Singur and other constituencies have been demanding that the chosen candidates be removed, claiming that those who have shed blood for the party for years have been overlooked to accommodate new faces. On Monday protests had rocked the Hastings office over the same issue. “Loving this slow unfolding of the WB BJP Candidate List soap opera the largest global political party” lacks enough faces & strength to announce 294 names in one go for a state it claims it will sweep!” tweeted Trinamool Congress MP leader Sougata Roy. “This was bound to happen. What is taking place is an implosion within the BJP,” he added. In another development Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee said that the party would support Debojyoti Singh Deo from Joypur Assembly segment in Purulia. The candidature of Ujjwal Kumar was cancelled by returning officer. While the candidature of Mr. Kumar was upheld by a single bench, the division bench cancelled his nomination. Mr. Banerjee, while addressing a rally in Purulia, said that the party will support Mr. Singh Deo instead of BJP, Congress or Samyukt Morcha nominee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/protests-violence-continue-to-rock-bjp/article34087501.ece
17 March 2021||New Delhi,||HC grants bail to 4 in riots case||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday granted bail to four men arrested in connection with a north-east Delhi riots case, noting that there was no evidence such as CCTV footage, video clip or photo linking them to the incident in question. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said none of the four accused has been named in the FIR. “Rather the complainant has specifically stated that he can identify a few of the rioters. It is a matter of record that the alleged incident took place on February 24, 2020 but the FIR in question has been registered on February 27, 2020,” the court said. Chargesheet filed With the chargesheet in the case already filed and the trial in progress, Justice Kait said, “Prima facie, I am of the opinion that the petitioners cannot be made to languish behind bars for a longer time and the veracity of the allegations against them can be tested during the trial.” The court also noted that the prosecution has examined four police officers who claimed to be eyewitnesses in the incident and said it failed to understand why despite having good understanding of law and order, “a police officer who is a witness to the riots would neither call PCR nor make a DD entry in this regard”. Three of the accused — Liyakat Ali, Arshad Qayyum, and Gulfam — were arrested on March 23, 2020, while the fourth person, Irshad Ahmad, was taken into custody on March 18 last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-grants-bail-to-4-in-riots-case/article34087606.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi remains most polluted capital: report||Delhi remained the most polluted capital city in the world but India, on the whole, had improved its average annual PM2.5 (particulate matter) levels in 2020 than in 2019, according to a report from IQ Air, a Swiss air quality technology company specialising in protection against airborne pollutants, and developing air quality monitoring and air cleaning products. Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration level, based primarily on data from the Central Pollution Control Board, was 84.1 μg/m³ in 2020, a 15% improvement from the 98.6 μg/m³ recorded in 2019 when the city was ranked the world’s most polluted capital for the second straight year. Average pollution levels were 51.9 μg/m³ in 2020 compared with 58.1 μg/m³ in 2019, making India the third most polluted country in 2020, unlike in 2019, when its air was the fifth most noxious. India ranked third Bangladesh and Pakistan were the countries in 2020 with worse average PM2.5 levels than India, said the report. China ranked 11th in the latest report, a deterioration from the 14th in the previous edition of the report. In the 2020 report, 106 countries were evaluated. The pollution levels are weighted averages, meaning that the population of a country influences the pollution values reported. In 2020, 84% of all monitored countries observed air quality improvements. Other improvements in major cities over 2019 included a 11% drop in Beijing, a 13% drop in Chicago, a 17% drop in Paris and a 16% drop in London and Seoul. However, of the 106 monitored countries, only 24 met the World Health Organization annual guidelines for PM 2.5, the report underlined. When ranked by cities, Hotan in China was the most polluted, with an average concentration of 110.2 μg/m³, followed by Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh at 106. Of the 15 most polluted cities, 13 were in India. In spite of being a pandemic year, 2020 was a particularly severe for agricultural burning. Farm fires in Punjab increased 46.5% over 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-remains-most-polluted-capital-report/article34087609.ece
17 March 2021||KANNUR,||Stalemate in Congress over Irikkur candidate continues||The stalemate in the Congress over the party candidate in the Irikkur Assembly constituency continues after reconciliatory efforts by incumbent MLA K.C. Joseph and United Democratic Front (UDF) convener M.M. Hassan failed to assuage the discontent among a section of party workers over the leadership’s choice. Mr. Joseph, who has represented the constituency for 39 years, and Mr. Hassan on Tuesday held discussions with the party leaders opposing the candidature of Sajeev Joseph, who is said to be a close confidant of Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal. Leaders who are associated with the ‘A’ group in the Congress remained adamant that they would field a rebel candidate if the party went ahead with the Mr. Sajeev Joseph.  The Irikkur seat is traditionally allocated to the ‘A’ group which proposed Sony Sebastian as the party’s candidate. After an initial round of discussion, the emissaries told reporters that when the local leaders were informed that the party high command’s decision should be accepted, their response was that the sentiments in the constituency should be conveyed to the high command. Special convention After the meeting failed, party workers belonging to the ‘A’ group held a special convention at Sreekantapuram here in the evening. Around 300 party workers reportedly attended the meeting. The convention unanimously decided to ask the high command to field Mr. Sebastian in the constituency. A 15-member committee has been formed to discuss the issue. They also rejected a compromise offer that Mr. Sebastian would be considered for the post of District Congress Committee president.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stalemate-in-congress-over-irikkur-candidate-continues/article34087471.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM Modi to visit Bangladesh on March 26||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Bangladesh on March 26 and 27 to attend the celebrations to mark the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 50 years of the war of liberation of Bangladesh, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Tuesday. The visit, which is the first foreign trip by Prime Minister Modi since the outbreak of the pandemic, is noteworthy as he is scheduled to travel outside Dhaka and visit Orakandi, which is sacred to the Matua community of West Bengal. “This visit is in connection with the commemoration of three epochal events — Mujib Borsho, birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 50 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh; and 50 years of Bangladesh’s war of liberation. The Prime Minister had last visited Bangladesh in 2015,” said an official press release. Prime Minister Modi will be the guest of honour during the National Day programme on March 26, said the Ministry. He was scheduled to visit Bangladesh in March 2020 for the inaugural events for the “Mujib Borsho” but the visit was cancelled as Dhaka rescheduled the celebrations in view of the pandemic. Mr. Modi and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a virtual summit on December 17 during which both sides highlighted plans for greater connectivity. Mr. Modi will hold talks with Sheikh Hasina and call on President Mohammed Abdul Hamid. Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen will call on him. At a press conference on Monday, Mr. Momen said Mr. Modi will deliver a speech at the National Parade Ground on March 26. The two leaders will jointly inaugurate the Bangabandhu-Bapu digital exhibition later that day. In a rare gesture, the Indian Prime Minister will travel outside Dhaka. On March 27, he will visit the famous Jeshoreshwari Kali temple in Satkhira and offer prayers at the Matua temple of Orakandhi. The temple at Orakandi is sacred to the Matua community of West Bengal as it is considered to be the place of birth of the Matua gurus. “We are fortunate that the leader of a country is travelling outside our capital. He will pray at Satkhira and also visit Orakandi. Whatever is said about this in West Bengal does not matter to us,” Dr. Momen said on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-modi-to-visit-bangladesh-on-march-26/article34087503.ece
17 March 2021||Pune,||MVA govt. not shielding anyone: Ajit Pawar||Maharashtra’s Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar asserted on Tuesday that the Maha Vikas Agahdi (MVA) government did not believe in shielding or protecting any official or politician if found responsible or involved in the Antilia bomb scare affair. His remarks come in the wake of opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) targeting State government for allegedly shielding police officer Sachin Vaze, now arrested and suspended, in connection with the incident outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai. Mr. Pawar also dispelled speculation about any rift between the three coalition partners — Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress — over the matter. His remarks were endorsed by NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who dismissed rumours of any problems within the parties. Asked in Delhi on reports about possible sacking of Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, the NCP chief remarked, “This is news to me.” Mr. Ajit Pawar told reporters in Mumbai, “Right from the start, the Chief Minister [Uddhav Thackeray] has maintained that the matter should be thoroughly investigated. He, as well as myself, assert that the MVA has no cause to shield anybody in this case nor will it do so. The law and order situation in the State must be good.” Meanwhile, Mr. Thackeray and Mr. Pawar on Tuesday morning met leaders from the coalition parties including senior NCP leader Jayant Patil and Sena leader Eknath Shinde. State unit Congress president Nana Patole is also expected to meet the CM. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant accused Leader of Opposition (LoP) Devendra Fadnavis of not helping agencies by keeping vital information pertaining to the case with himself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mva-govt-not-shielding-anyone-ajit-pawar/article34087916.ece
17 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Cong., BJP feigning rivalry, alleges Pinarayi||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said the Congress and the BJP play-acted rivalry where none existed between the two parties in the State. The Nemom constituency in Thiruvananthapuram was a typical example of the Congress-BJP axis in Kerala. Erosion of Congress votes in 2016 had advantaged the BJP there. For instance, in the Nedungadu division, the Congress had garnered just 74 votes against its previous record of 1,269. The Congress had lost 47,000-odd votes to the BJP, he said while addressing the media in Kannur. The 2021 Assembly election results would reveal whether the Congress was genuinely fighting the BJP or was making a mere show of tackling the Sangh Parivar. Eight lakh vacancies in the Central government remained unfilled. In contrast, the Kerala Public Service Commission had employed 1,58,00 people. However the , Congress had sought to eclipse the Left Democratic Front’s record. It has offered no criticism against the Centre. The BJP alleged that the LDF government had distributed free ration kits supplied by the Centre and claimed credit for itself fraudulently. “Free ration is not much. The government has made no tall claim. The State had extended the benefit irrespective of income given the COVID-19 pandemic. However, no BJP or Congress-ruled State had resorted to such a gesture,” he said. Mr. Vijayan suggested that a vote for the Congress could well turn out to be one for the BJP. In Goa, Manipur, Karnataka and Puducherry, Congress legislators had jumped ship to join the BJP for money and power positions. The Congress in Kerala has denigrated itself as the mouthpiece and ideological echo chamber of the Sangh Parivar. The Congress’s word carried no weight. It had collected large sums of money to build 1,000 houses for the flood-affected. However, the party could not even deliver a hundred dwellings or account for how it had utilised the donations. The Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League were facing a rebellion within their ranks over candidate selection. Mr. Vijayan said the Congress had reacted ham-fistedly to the former Mahila Congress president’s grievance. He also thanked the Kerala Congress (M) for ceding the Kuttiyadi seat to the CPI(M). He said the government had done all it could for the kin of the Walayar victims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cong-bjp-feigning-rivalry-alleges-pinarayi/article34087474.ece
17 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Fine those not wearing masks, Collectors told||With fresh COVID-19 cases on the rise, Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan on Tuesday instructed the Collectors to strictly enforce the safety protocol and fine those who do not wear masks at public places. At a meeting to review the situation, Mr. Ranjan instructed the Collectors to strictly enforce the Standard Operating Procedures issued by the government and impose a fine on violators under the Public Health Act. The local bodies and officials of the Departments of Health, Police and Revenue would ensure compliance. It emerged during the review that reasons for the rising number of cases were failure to wear masks at family and social functions and meetings and follow the safety protocols, an official release said. Asymptomatic patients and those with minor symptoms have come out of the mandatory home quarantine, thus infecting their family members. Clusters have formed in banks and schools, among other places, for lack of adequate precautions, it said. The number of cases had been fewer than 500 a day, but it had risen by 1.2% in the past 10 days, the release said. “Particularly, it is above 2% in Chennai and Coimbatore districts and above 1% in Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, Tiruppur, Kancheepuram, Thanjavur and Nagapattinam districts.” Mr. Ranjan instructed the Collectors to ensure compliance with the guidelines at all places. He also ordered that RT-PCR tests be done immediately on those with symptoms. The number of persons testing positive has risen to 800 a day. The number of persons under treatment, which was fewer than 4,000 in the first week of March, has been increasing. Strict enforcement of containment zone norms, deployment of officials to monitor vulnerable places, an increase in the number of fever camps at places from where a high number of cases have been reported, vaccination of eligible persons and monitoring of those on quarantine are the measures ordered by the Chief Secretary. Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy, Revenue Secretary Atulya Misra, Commissioner of Revenue Administration K. Phanindra Reddy, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan and other officials attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fine-those-not-wearing-masks-collectors-told/article34087342.ece
17 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||CID files FIR against Naidu in ‘Amaravati land scam’||Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has found himself facing a new set of issues concerning the alleged “Amaravati land scam”, with the Crime Investigation Department (CID) filing fresh FIRs against him and one of his former Ministers, P. Narayana. The new cases were booked based on a complaint filed by Mangalagiri MLA Alla Rama Krishna Reddy, under Section 120 B (conspiracy) and Sections 166, 167 and 217 of the IPC, read with the Prohibition of Assigned Lands Alienation Act of 1977 and the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Mr. Naidu has been asked to appear in person on March 23, at 11 a.m., at the Regional CID office at Satyanarayanapuram in Vijayawada. It is learnt that two special teams of the Andhra Pradesh CID went to his home in Hyderabad and served the notices. According to a officer from the CID, the new angle to the case was related to procedural irregularities, and the decisions taken to acquire lands and assign compensation for the capital city when Mr. Naidu was the Chief Minister and the Chairman of the A.P. Capital Region Development Authority. The CID was probing alleged irregularities in the alienation of the assigned lands. Mr. Reddy, in his complaint, stated that some farmers from his constituency had informed him that some “influential persons” in the then government had forcibly taken away their land illegally and fraudulently, by creating an environment of fear and confusion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fresh-firs-filed-against-naidu-in-amaravati-land-scam-case/article34087239.ece

K. Vanlalvena told The Hindu that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) was indulging in doublespeak as the Chief Minister had been assured recently that no one would be deported but on the other hand, the Ministry sent a letter to the State governments of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Mizoram that said people fleeing the coup should be identified and deported. The four States share a border with Myanmar. The Tatmadaw, or the Myanmar military, had taken over the country after a coup on February 1. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha during Zero Hour, Mr. Vanlalvena said, “Over 300 Myanmar nationals who have crossed the border include 150 police personnel who favoured the (pro-democracy) protesters.The State government and NGOs have given immediate help and shelter to these refugees. Meanwhile, the MHA has given directions to not entertain Myanmar refugees.” “It will not go down well with people in Mizoram if the Central government insists on deporting them. Being the largest democracy in the world, it is the responsibility of India to encourage and support any struggle to protect and uphold democratic rights and principles. They are our brothers; sending them back to Myanmar will mean killing them,” the MP added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cannot-send-back-myanmar-exiles-says-mp/article34087291.ece

17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Come out with ‘rule curve’ for Mullaperiyar: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary will be “personally responsible” and “appropriate action” will be taken on failure to give information on the ‘rule curve’ for the Mullaperiyar dam to the Supreme Court-appointed Supervisory Committee. The ‘rule curve’ in a dam decides the fluctuating storage levels in a reservoir. The gate opening schedule of a dam is based on the ‘rule curve’. It is part of the “core safety” mechanism in a dam. After a nearly day-long hearing, a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar directed the Supervisory Committee to issue directions or take steps to address the three core safety issues — the monitoring and performance of the instrumentation of the dam, finalising the ‘rule curve’ and fixing the gate operating schedule — and submit a compliance report in four weeks. “We find that the three core issues are directly concerned with the safety of the dam and will have a cascading effect on persons residing in the nearby areas,” the court noted. T.N. blames Kerala During the high-voltage hearing, the Tamil Nadu government blamed Kerala for delaying the finalisation of the ‘rule curve’ for the 123-year-old dam. “Right from the beginning, Kerala has adopted an obscurantist and obstructive stand... Kerala government is somehow not comfortable with Tamil Nadu operating the dam. Kerala has made consistent efforts to obstruct Tamil Nadu from operating the dam. Kerala is preventing the finalisation of the ‘rule curve’. We are not able to access data which is in their terrain. There is no road built, the power supply has not been restored, though we had paid for it... How do we function?” senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, for Tamil Nadu, said. “First you give the information on the ‘rule curve’ to the Supervisory Committee... Trees and roads do not immediately concern the safety of the dam,” Justice Khanwilkar told the Tamil Nadu side. ‘No politics’ The Kerala government, represented by senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, has accused Tamil Nadu of adopting an “obsolete” gate operation schedule dating back to 1939. However, the court sharply intervened to stop Kerala from making any politically-coloured statements in court. Justice Khanwilkar said the court was not the place to make political speeches to the masses. “Local politics between States should not be played out in the Supreme Court,” Justice Khanwilkar remarked. The court was hearing a petition filed by Dr. Joe Joseph and the office-bearers of the Kothamangalam block panchayat in Kerala, expressing their apprehensions about the lack of proper supervision of water levels in the dam located along the Periyar tiger reserve. “Meetings are held just for attendance. The instrumentation scheme, safety mechanism, etc., have not been finalised for the past six years. The sub-committee was formed by the Supervisory Committee without informing the Supreme Court... We are seeking a continuous mandamus from the Supreme Court to control and monitor the work of the Supervisory Committee,” senior advocate Gopakumaran, representing the petitioners, said. The court listed the case for hearing on April 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/come-out-with-rule-curve-for-mullaperiyar-sc/article34087244.ece
17 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Census interim data by 2024’||The provisional data for the latest Census and National Population Register (NPR) will be available before the Lok Sabha election in 2024, according to information provided by the Union Home Ministry to a parliamentary committee. The Ministry informed the committee that Census and update of the NPR would be among the major thrust areas for the financial year 2021-22. The previous Census was conducted in 2011 and the NPR, which has a database of 119 crore residents, was last updated in 2015. The first phase of Census House-listing and Housing Census that was to be conducted along with the NPR from April 1, 2020, was indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tentative timeline The Ministry shared a tentative timeline with the parliamentary panel, saying that provisional Census results will be released in the financial year 2023-24 and the primary Census abstracts (PCA) will provide village-level data on important indicators. As reported by The Hindu , a mobile application has been developed for collecting the Census details and NPR and residents can also self-enumerate The fieldwork for the first phase of Census 2021 that will provide data on housing conditions, household amenities and assets possessed by the households is expected in 2021-22. The fieldwork for population enumeration phase to provide data on demography, religion, SC/ST, language, literacy and education, economic activity, migration and fertility will be done in 2023-24. The committee was informed that the mobile app through which Census will be conducted will be available in 16 languages. The Ministry said the NPR database had been created by collecting family-wise data and it can be strengthened by linking Aadhaar to each member. It said “consolidated details of a family” are not available through Aadhaar and based on it “a family structure” cannot be created without visiting each household and collecting information such as relationship among family members. “Further, the Aadhaar database may not be made available to this office due to legal provisions in the Aadhaar Act, 2016. During the next update of NPR, the Aadhaar number is being collected voluntarily. The presence of the Aadhaar number in the NPR database will facilitate its integration with other databases,” the Ministry said in the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/census-interim-data-by-2024/article34087259.ece

The panel, headed by Congress leader Anand Sharma, tabled the report in the Rajya Sabha on Monday. “The Committee also expresses its concern that a large number of people are missing the second dose of the vaccine. The Committee believes that it is very serious issue as the virus is mutating and new variants of COVID-19 are being reported in different parts of the world,” the report said. The committee recommended that all frontline health workers and corona warriors, including central armed police force (CAPF) personnel and State police, receive the recommended doses of vaccine. “An attempt should be made to cover maximum people as early as possible,” the report said. Officials from the Home Ministry told the panel that a special campaign against vaccine hesitancy had been launched. Further, regular reviews are being undertaken with States and UTs for increasing the pace, the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccination-is-slow-mps-panel/article34087265.ece

17 March 2021||New Delhi,||Rajya Sabha passes MTP Bill||The Rajya Sabha on Tuesday passed the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 that increases the time period within which an abortion may be carried out. Opposition MPs pointed out that the Bill still did not give women the freedom to decide, since she would need a nod from a medical board in the case of pregnancies beyond 24 weeks. The Opposition’s demand to send the Bill to a parliamentary Select Committee for detailed scrutiny was defeated by a voice vote. Currently, abortion requires the opinion of one doctor if it is done within 12 weeks of conception, and two doctors if it is done between 12 and 20 weeks. The Bill allows abortion to be done on the advice of one doctor up to 20 weeks, and two doctors in the case of certain categories of women, between 20 and 24 weeks. For a pregnancy to be terminated after 24 weeks in case of substantial foetal abnormalities, the opinion of the State-level medical board is essential. The Bill was passed in March last year in the Lok Sabha. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the amendments in the Bill had been made after studying global practices and after wide consultation within the country. The amendments, he said, had been made pursuant to the rising number of pleas in the court. There are 23 petitions in front of the Supreme Court and many hundreds in the High Courts. “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we will not frame any law which harms women. This is to preserve and protect the dignity of women,” he said. The original Bill was framed in 1971. During the debate, however, many of the Opposition members, while welcoming the Bill, pointed out the severe lacunae and problems with its approach. Congress leader Ami Yajnik, who opened the debate, said the medical board had to have specialists but government data itself showed a grave shortage in availability of doctors. “Should the State intervene when the pregnant woman is worried about her own life, about the well-being of the foetus, and also about the stigma involved?” Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi said it was wrong to say the Bill was based on a “right based” approach. Instead, it had a “need based” approach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajya-sabha-passes-mtp-bill/article34087252.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Maharashtra told to plan for the worst||The Health Ministry has cautioned Maharashtra to plan for a “worst-case scenario” with sufficient lead time as the State continues to report the highest number of new daily COVID-19 cases and deaths across India. It has also directed the resumption of death audits to support public health action and minimise mortality. In a letter to the State earlier this week, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said while the available health infrastructure was adequate, Maharashtra needed to look into vaccine hesitancy among frontline workers, “as their services would be required if the trajectory follows the upward swing as is being witnessed now”. He also said the State should also expedite vaccinating those with comorbidities and the elderly. The letter comes a day after the State government announced a series of restrictions, mandating cinema halls, hotels, restaurants and offices to function only at 50% capacity till March 31 and prohibiting all social and religious gatherings. After its visit to Maharashtra, the Central team has recommended that treating physicians should be re-sensitised on clinical management protocols . “Maharashtra is in the beginning of a second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. There is very limited active effort to track, test, isolate cases and quarantine contacts. There is no adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour among people both in rural and urban areas,” the team noted. The Health Ministry has now recommended monitoring of the situation at the highest level, strengthened surveillance enhanced involvement of private practitioners, increased testing and reviewing the practice of isolating 80-85% of active cases kept at home. It added that measures such as night curfews and weekend lockdowns had limited impact on containing/suppressing the transmission. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope denied that the Maharashtra government was “not serious” about tackling the surge, and said he had sought 2.2 crore vaccine doses from the Centre.

17 March 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata must apologise for Batla House statement: Nadda||Three senior BJP leaders, including president J.P. Nadda, campaigned in West Bengal on Tuesday and raked up religion as a poll plank. Mr. Nadda, who held a roadshow and addressed a public meeting in Bankura, wondered why Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced a lockdown on the day the foundation stone was laid for the Ram temple in August 2020 but lifted it on the day of Muharram. At a rally at Kotulpur in Bankura, he took a dig at the Chief Minister for reciting “Chandi Path” at her public meetings, saying it was too late for her to “amend the wrongs by not allowing Durga Puja immersions”. The BJP president also alleged that Ms. Banerjee called Batla House encounter a “fake encounter”. “She should apologise after the court gave the death penalty to the convict,” he said. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also raised the issue of Ms. Banerjee reciting “Chandi Path” at public rallies. “There is a change. Before 2014, there was a generation in the country which used to fear that their secularism will be at risk if they visit a temple. But now, I see Mamata didi reciting Chandi Path at a temple,” he said while campaigning in Purulia. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who campaigned at Sabang in Paschim Medinipur, made a reference to Sourav Ganguly hitting a six. Not only did the remark draw loud applause from the people, it also triggered fresh speculation about the the former Indian cricket captain joining the saffron party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-must-apologise-for-batla-house-statement-nadda/article34087250.ece
17 March 2021||Bengaluru,||HC wants end to postings for money||In an unprecedented order, the High Court of Karnataka has urged the Chief Justice to initiate suo motu proceedings against the State government to put an end to the “pernicious practice” of posting officers “for monetary considerations and reasons other than public interest”. A Bench of Justice R. Devdas passed the order on March 15 taking note of “high-handedness” of the tahsildar and the assistant commissioner (AC) of Bengaluru South taluk, who acted contrary to the law even when an issue related to grant of a parcel of land, value of which is worth several crores of rupees, was sub judice before the High Court.“This court should take judicial notice of the fact that such high-handed action on the part of the respondent-authorities [tahsildar and AC] could not have happened if the authorities were sensitive enough about their powers and functions,” the court observed. “The obvious disregard may have been occasioned due to the fact that postings are given to such sensitive offices, not on merits or with public interest in mind,” the court observed. “It is obvious that the respondent-authorities are fearless of the consequences of being in conflict with the law. Such officers are emboldened by the fact that they are protected by the government.” Plum postings Pointing out that “every now and then the citizens of this State are given to understand that plum postings are assigned for monetary considerations,” the court said, “Such news and information are published in national newspapers, magazines, television channels and social media.” “Such allegations are even levelled by the Opposition leaders and social activists; and cutting across all political parties that have formed the government, [such] allegations are levelled against the heads of the departments, Ministers and Chief Minister.” The court also observed that “there cannot be two views that if an officer shells out money to get a plum posting, he would employ every means possible to recover the money he has invested and make every effort to make money for future needs and therefore, this forms the vicious circle of corruption.” “Time has come when this court has to step in to find out the truth of the fact and direct the State to put in place regulations to check the tentacles of corruption from taking stranglehold of the society. Therefore, this court would urge that the Chief Justice may take note of the observations and take up suo motu proceedings against the State government to put an end to the pernicious practice,” observed Mr. Justice Devdas in his order. Chequered history The land, measuring around 1 acre 30 guntas in Doddathoguru in Bengaluru South taluk, was sold in 2001 by a person to whom it was granted by the government. Later, it was divided into sites, changed many hands, and several large constructions were put up. However, the land has witnessed a chequered history of litigations since 2005 before the Revenue authorities and the court. The AC and the tahsildar in February 2020, in the guise of violation of provisions of the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978, had hastily demolished several buildings acting on an application made by one M. Muniraju who was claiming ownership alleging that parcels of land were sold using fabricated documents. The court observed that the records “clearly betrays the conspiracy and consorted effort” made by AC M.G. Shivanna and tahsildar Shivappa Lamani along with Mr. Muniraju in “defrauding the petitioners”, Jayamma and others, even when the litigation on the land was pending before the High Court. The court directed the government to enter its remarks in the service records of both the officers and hold an inquiry against them. The court allowed the petitioners to move the civil court to seek compensation for the damages caused to their properties while directing both the officers to pay cost of Rs. 10,000 each to each of the petitioners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-wants-end-to-postings-for-money/article34087229.ece
17 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,||Kerala BJP has secret deal with CPI(M): Balashankar||BJP leader R. Balashankar on Tuesday unleashed a political storm by accusing the party State leadership of acting like a mafia and forging a tacit nexus with the CPI(M). Co-convener of the BJP national training programme and its publications department, Mr. Balashankar’s name, who was largely expected to be fielded from the Chengannur Assembly constituency, was not included on the BJP candidates’ list for the April 6 Assembly elections. Mr. Balashankar told the media that he suspected a secret deal between the CPI (M) and BJP State leadership. He said he was denied the ticket to contest the polls from Chengannur as part of the deal. The BJP has a strong presence in both Chengannur and Aranmula, which are considered ‘A’ class constituencies by the party. By not fielding strong candidates in these constituencies, party’s poll prospects have been hit hard. The BJP’s candidate in Chengannur is a close ally of the CPI(M), he alleged. The BJP has fielded its Alappuzha district president M.V. Gopakumar from Chengannur, while the party has given the ticket to Biju Mathew in Aranmula. Mr. Balashankar claimed that he had the blessings of the BJP central leaders and the support of various religious and caste organisations in Chengannur. Former editor of the RSS mouthpiece Organiser , Mr. Balashankar, who is from Chengannur, said there was no democracy in the BJP’s Kerala unit. He questioned BJP State president K. Surendran seeking people’s mandate from the Manjeswaram and Konni constituencies. Chennithala’s reaction Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Mr. Balashankar’s statement that the BJP has struck an electoral understanding with the CPI (M) had substantiated the Congress’s allegation of the unholy alliance between the two parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-bjp-has-secret-deal-with-cpim-balashankar/article34087535.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. committed to protecting interests of bank staff: Nirmala||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the UPA government had “nationalised corruption” and “privatised taxpayers’ money”. She was responding to comments by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi earlier in the day that the Centre was “privatising profit and nationalising loss”. In a tweet supporting the strike by the public sector bank (PSB) employees against privatisation, Mr. Gandhi said: “GoI is privatising profit & nationalising loss. Selling PSBs to Modicronies gravely compromises India’s financial security. I stand in solidarity with the striking bank employees.” Ms. Sitharaman said, “Rahul Gandhi has probably outsourced his comments to a very hardcore communist.” The comments, which she termed “two-liners”, did not help the situation and Mr. Gandhi should have engaged in a serious discussion instead, she said. “Nationalising corruption and privatising tax payers’ money for the betterment of one family is all that Rahul Gandhi will have to take as a reply for that tweet, which probably some outsourced fellow in his team is feeding him with,” she said. Assurance to workers Ms. Sitharaman said the interests of all employees of state-owned banks that were likely to be privatised would be protected. She clarified that public sector presence would continue in the banking space. “...We have announced public enterprise policy based on which we have identified those four areas in which we said government presence, public sector presence, will be there, and bare minimum presence is what we have said, in financial institutions are also there. “Meaning, even in financial sector we will still have the presence of public sector enterprise... not all of them are going to be privatised,” she said. She said the government would ensure that these privatised institution would also continue to function. “After the privatisation, we will also have to ensure that the staff or the personnel who are there, their every interest will be protected.”  (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-committed-to-protecting-interests-of-bank-staff-nirmala/article34087255.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Post-vaccine blood clots a form of rare cerebral thrombosis’||Scientists at the Germany-based Paul-Ehrlich-Institut report that the blood clots observed in some of those vaccinated are a “special form of very rare cerebral vein thrombosis”. This corresponds to a deficiency in platelets and bleeding following vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The recommendations from the institute were the reason Germany put on hold ongoing vaccinations until a full review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA last week said that several cases of immune thrombocytopenia, a lack of platelets in the blood that can lead to bleeding and bruising, had been reported under its vaccine safety monitoring process. Several EU countries — France and Italy for instance — have called a halt to the AstraZeneca vaccine after reports from Denmark and Norway of possible serious side-effects, including bleeding and blood clots. EU nations suspend use Denmark was the first country to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on March 11 as a precautionary measure. Iceland and Norway followed suit. Last Friday, Bulgaria suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine as it probed caused the death of a woman with several underlying conditions who was inoculated. Sweden and Latvia, too, have suspended use. The blood clots observed post vaccination, however, are less than the background number of such thrombosis events even without vaccination. The World Health Organization (WHO) has ruled out any link between AstraZeneca’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and reported blood clots. “We do not want people to panic and we would, for the time being, recommend that countries continue vaccinating with AstraZeneca,” WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan was quoted as saying by news agency AFP. India also is reliant on Covishield, which is based on the AstraZeneca vaccine, and forms the bulk of the nearly 30 million vaccines that have been so far administered to the population. However, officials say no instances of such blood clots have been reported so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/post-vaccine-blood-clots-a-form-of-rare-cerebral-thrombosis/article34087262.ece

Mr. Birla made these remarks in the Central Hall of Parliament while hosting the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) president Duarte Pacheco. The event was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh, Union ministers, Members of Parliament and members of the diplomatic community. The Speaker’s remarks are significant as they come just days after lawmakers in Britain discussed the farmers’ protests in India in the British parliament. Without naming any country, the Lok Sabha Speaker also asserted that India has a clear policy against terrorism and expansionism. Addressing the gathering, Mr. Pacheco, a member of the Portuguese Parliament, said the coronavirus pandemic has shown that ‘multilateralism’ is the way forward and lauded India’s effort to provide vaccines across the world. Mr. Pacheco described India as a special friend of the IPU that had played an important role in parliamentary diplomacy. “Portugal supports India's claim for permanent member of the Security Council,” the lawmaker said, pitching for a greater role for New Delhi in the global order. He further said that in him, India has a special friend in the IPU.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-parliament-should-discuss-internal-issues-of-other-nations/article34087270.ece
17 March 2021||New Delhi,||Quad officials hail vaccine drive||The vaccine initiative announced by the Quad leaders last week was a “path-breaking effort” at a “truly historic” summit, said Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, as officials in the Australia-India-Japan-U.S. coalition also said that details of the plan to provide 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asian countries by 2022 are being worked out. “The Quad vaccine collaboration initiative is a pathbreaking effort, envisioning manufacture of U.S. vaccines in India — and delivery to countries in the Indo-Pacific region with support of Japan and Australia. It is an example of collective efforts which can be leveraged for global good in these challenging times,” Mr. Muraleedharan said, addressing an event organised by the Indo-American Friendship Association in Delhi. In Canberra, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne announced the pledge of an additional $77 million for the Quad effort, in addition to about $400 million that Australia has already committed for regional vaccine access. “Quad partners will take opportunities to implement joint or closely coordinated programmes of support for our partner countries in the Indo-Pacific with a particular focus on Southeast Asia,” Ms. Payne told the Australian Parliament on Tuesday. He added that the Quad countries’ plan to make “investments will ramp up vaccine manufacturing capacity, fund the procurement and distribution of vaccines and provide last mile delivery support”. According to a “Fact Sheet” released by the Ministry of External Affairs and other Quad partners, the billion vaccines planned would be manufactured at a Hyderabad-based private company “Biological E” (BE), with U.S. support. “The United States, through the DFC (US International Development Finance Corporation, will work with Biological E Ltd., to finance increased capacity to support Biological E’s effort to produce at least 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 with Stringent Regulatory Authorization (SRA) and/or World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL), including the Johnson & Johnson vaccine,” said the fact sheet jointly released after President Biden met with PMs Modi, Morrison and Suga on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/quad-officials-hail-vaccine-drive/article34087274.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||P.C. Chacko joins NCP||Days after announcing his resignation from the Congress, former MP P.C. Chacko on Tuesday joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) at party chief Sharad Pawar’s Delhi residence. “I am happy to be part of a party which is functioning, active and a party moving with a direction,” Mr. Chacko told reporters after being welcomed by Mr. Pawar, senior NCP leaders Praful Patel, Supriya Sule, and others.

Ironically, Congress general secretary in-charge of Kerala is Tariq Anwar, an old associate of Mr. Pawar, who was also a founding member of the NCP. Mr. Chacko said he would start campaigning for the LDF in Kerala that would go to the polls on April 6. “Today, what is needed is unity of the Opposition. A united Opposition should emerge as an alternative to the Bharatiya Janata Party. I do not see that initiative very much from the party that I was in earlier,” he said. Mr. Pawar, who earlier in the day met Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, endorsed the comment on an alternative front and said he was welcoming Mr. Chacko into the party on behalf of senior LDF leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pc-chacko-joins-ncp/article34087885.ece
17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Why no proposal on turmeric board, Uttam asks Centre||Congress and TRS have criticised the Centre for not setting up a turmeric board in Telangana in the two Houses of Parliament on Tuesday following a written statement made by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in Rajya Sabha that there was no proposal on setting up Turmeric Board in Telangana. In Lok Sabha, Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, who is also the president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC), sought to know why there was no proposal in spite of promises made by several Union Ministers during the last Lok Sabha elections and requests from Telangana MPs and the State government. He demanded that the Centre announce support price for turmeric and also create a market fund. He stated that the Regional Office cum Extension Centre of the Spices Board of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with the offices at Warangal, Hyderabad, Nizamabad and Khammam would in now way help export promotion and marketing of turmeric. Mr. Reddy said about 80% of the world’s turmeric production was being done in India and Telangana (Nizamabad) accounted for about 50% of it.Mr. Uttam Reddy reminded the Centre that Union Minister Rajnath Singh and Prakash Javadekar and Bharatiya Janata Party general secretary Ram Madhav had given clear assurance on establishing the turmeric board at Nizamabad on the lines of coconut and coffee board. He stressed the need for market intervention fund. According to the Nalgonda MP, Union Agriculture Minister Mr. Tomar had pointed that the Centre was not aware of land allotment made for the board at Nizamabad as the State Government did not inform the Centre about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uttam-flays-centre-on-turmeric-board-issue/article34087871.ece

17 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Bangladeshi man held with Indian passport||Immigration officials at the Kempegowda International Airport caught a 44-year-old Bangladeshi national with a valid Indian passport on Thursday. He had been living with his family in Kolkata for the past 19 years. The accused, Khokan Das, had gone to Muscat to work as a driver a few years ago. Khokan told officials that he had crossed the Bangladesh-India border illegally and had been staying in West Bengal since 2002, according to officials. He then started doing odd jobs and managed to get IDs, using which he obtained an Indian passport. He then went to Muscat a few years ago and stayed there for over a decade working as a driver. In between, Khokan went to Bangladesh twice — in 2014, and again in 2019 to meet his parents. This led the immigration officials to question him about the purpose of his visits, eventually leading to the revelation about how he had been staying in India since 2002. Khokan has been booked under various sections of the Passports Act. He has been remanded in judicial custody.  ‘He had been staying in West Bengal since 2002’ ‘He went to Bangladesh twice — in 2014, and again in 2019 to meet his parents’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bangladeshi-man-held-with-indian-passport/article34087459.ece

According to a press release, south Indian cities recorded relatively better air quality, though they remained above the daily WHO limit of 25 g/m3 for most parts of 2020. Bengaluru, for instance, recorded an average 15.6% dip in PM 2.5 levels. However, the pollutant levels were above the WHO prescribed limit in 46.7% of the days. The IT city’s annual average stands at 27.5 g/m3, nearly three times the prescribed limit. Also, Bengaluru’s PM 2.5 levels in December 2020 surpassed the January 2020 levels, indicating that the ‘better air quality’ has already faded away. The report showed that 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities globally are in India. None of the Indian cities met the prescribed annual limit of 10 g/m3. This is despite all Indian cities monitored recording improvement in air quality compared to 2018. As many as 63% of them saw improvements compared with 2019. Delhi ranked as the 10th most polluted city and the top polluted capital city in the world. The report added that major sources of air pollution include transportation, biomass burning for cooking, power generation, industry, construction, waste burning, and episodic agricultural burning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pollutant-levels-higher-than-who-limits/article34087792.ece

Declaring her decision to contest the polls at the Thrissur Press Club on Tuesday, she said she would contest as an Independent candidate. “I don’t want support from the Sangh Parivar.” “I am contesting the election to seek justice for my children. I want action against Deputy Superintendent of Police M.J. Sojan, who scuttled the investigation and denied justice to my children even after their death. He pushed me to the street for agitation.

17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Bhainsa riots case being probed impartially: police||The Telangana Police on Tuesday rejected allegations of the Bharatiya Janata Party that cases have been foisted upon youth of a particular community, even as they maintained that only those who were involved have been arrested in the Bhainsa riots case. Communal trouble began in Bhainsa Town on March 7, at the Zulfiqar Galli in the town when youths of different communities indulged in stone pelting, which led to a larger communal riot. Explaining the chronology of events which led to the conflagration, Inspector General of Police, North Zone, Y. Nagi Reddy said that on March 7, two two-wheeler borne youths belonging to a community, and connected to a right wing group, and riding near a mosque in Zulfiqar Galli allegedly hit another youth from a different community, who was walking with two of his friends. The latter then went looking for the two-wheeler borne youth in Batti Galli where they were allegedly attacked by the two youth and two of their associates, all of whom are connected to the right wing group. As the word of the altercation spread in the town, people belonging to the two communities began to gather, which resulted in stone-pelting in which nine civilians, and three police officers were injured. The conflagration led to as many as four houses, four autorickshaws, six four wheelers, five two wheelers and 13 shops being set on fire by miscreants. Police have registered 26 cases. As many as 38 persons are accused, out of which four are children in conflict with law. The accused from both communities were arrested and remanded to judicial custody. The involvement of 70 others has been established and efforts are on to arrest them. He also pointed out that subsequent cases of arson which were noticed in the second and third days in Pardi and Mahagaon villages were committed by those connected to this right wing organisation. He said that ‘by and large’ those who are connected to the right wing organisation were arrested for their alleged involvement. Mr. Reddy maintained that there is no bias in the police and the investigation is being conducted in an impartial manner. Special teams were constituted to investigate cases, and identification of the accused is being done by means of the CCTV cameras in the town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhainsa-riots-case-being-probed-impartially-police/article34087242.ece

Amit Shah babu , aren’t you interfering in its affairs? This is my question…My security in-charge has been changed. What do they want, to kill me?” Ms. Banerjee said, while addressing a rally at Chatna in Bankura district. “If this continues, I will not back out from protesting at the office of the Election Commission in Kolkata with a broken leg,” she said.  Ms. Banerjee, who addressed three public rallies in the district, wondered what Amit Shah was doing in West Bengal. “Amit Shah is frustrated at the poor turnout at his rallies. Instead of governing the country, he is sitting in Kolkata conspiring against Trinamool Congress leaders,” she said.  The Chief Minister also targeted those who had left the Trinamool and joined the BJP, calling them “goons and Mir Zafar”. “For us, it is blessing that these people have left. The TMC is a party of common people,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-interfering-in-functioning-of-election-commission-mamata/article34087257.ece
17 March 2021||MYSURU,||Karnataka wakf board restricts use of speakers||The Karnataka State Board of Auqaf (wakf) has restricted the managements of mosques and dargahs from using loudspeakers between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. The board, in a circular dated March 9, 2021, cited the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, and said loudspeakers used during daytime shall adhere to ambient air quality standards in respect of noise. The circular issued by the board’s Chief Executive Officer stated that the increasing ambient noise level around many mosques and dargahs owing to use of generator sets, loudspeakers, and public address systems have a deleterious effect on the health and psychological well-being of people. The issue of use of loudspeakers in mosques had been raised from time to time in various courts across the country. It is “heartening” to note that some of the mosques are adhering to the rules scrupulously, the circular stated, and added that “paramount importance” is attached by Islam to harmonious and sustainable protection of natural environment. The instructions issued to the managements of mosques and dargahs for “strictest compliance” said that loudspeaker shall be used only for azan and important announcements such as death, timing of burial, and sighting of the moon, during daytime. Congregational namaz, Friday sermons, religious, and socio-cultural and knowledge-based functions shall be held with speakers installed on the religious premises. Noise governing apparatus may be installed in the institution in consultation with local environment officers. No sound-emitting fire-crackers shall be burnt in or around the mosque or dargah, the circular said. The circular also asked the managements to discourage beggary on the religious premises and instead organise counselling or philanthropic measures at the institutional level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-wakf-board-restricts-use-of-speakers/article34087240.ece
17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Older IIMs lag behind newer ones||To understand the faculty recruitment process, Dr. Joshi’s RTI queries also asked for a break down of the number of candidates who applied from each category applied, were interviewed, offered jobs, and accepted employment at each IIM between January 2019 and December 2020. The response showed that in some cases, hundreds of applicants were listed but none made it through the hiring process. At IIM Lucknow, for example, there were 888 applicants for faculty positions over the two year period, including 197 from reserved categories. Only seven were shortlisted for interviews, and none were offered jobs. Of the 691 applicants from the general category, 59 were shortlisted and 12 were offered jobs. “The IIMs cannot continue to use the excuse of unavailability of qualified candidates. They need to be intentional, and scout for applicants, as done in affirmative action programmes by the world’s top western universities,” said Anil Wagde, an alumnus of IIM Kolkata. “They also need to ensure that biases are not allowed to play out through the shortlisting and interview process.” Since 2019, when Parliament passed the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act, the IIMs have been actively lobbying the Education Ministry to exempt them from the law's requirements to reserve faculty positions for SCs, STs, OBCs and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). They had earlier cited a 50-year old Central government memo which exempted scientific and technical posts from reservations. In November that year, the Education Ministry told the Lok Sabha that the 20 IIMs had only 11 faculty from the SC/ST categories. On Monday, it told the Lok Sabha that the IIMs have filled 21 posts reserved for SCs and 5 reserved for STs, along with 36 reserved for OBCs, which is still far below the legally mandated quotas. “There has been some incremental progress, but the IIMs are still not actually implementing the law. The problem is that most are not taking any intentional steps to change the situation, just paying lip service. The older IIMs are acting with impunity,” said Mr. Wagde.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/more-diversity-in-faculty-hires-in-newer-iims/article34087245.ece

The letter to Ms. Banerjee by Deputy Election Commissioner in charge of West Bengal Sudeep Jain in response to her letter on Sunday noted that the Commission had met representatives of the Trinamool Congress on four occasions in Delhi and Kolkata. “...if it is stated by Hon’ble CM that the Commission should meet political parties, it is only an attempt to belittle the institution of Commission with repeated innuendos and averments. Commission maintains the position that they would not like to keep on being put in the dock for alleged proximity to any political entity, etc. However, if Hon’ble CM persists in creating and attempting to perpetuate this myth for reasons best known to her, it is singularly unfortunate, and it is only for Hon’ble CM to adjudge as to why she is doing so,” Mr. Jain wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/attempt-to-belittle-institution-eci-replies-to-mamata-letter/article34087766.ece

Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Gujarat government, asked the court to list the case next week. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for the SIT, also sought an early hearing while objecting to the adjournment. The case has seen several adjournments in the past months. At one point in an earlier hearing, Justice Khanwilkar had orally remarked that “we cannot keep adjourning this. We have to hear it someday...” On February 8, 2012, the SIT had filed a closure report, giving clean chit to Mr. Modi and 63 others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-more-adjournment-of-zakia-jafri-plea-sc/article34087256.ece

Previewed at the virtual Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue, which began on Tuesday, the report proposes energy transition solutions for the narrow pathway available to contain the rise of temperature to 1.5 degree Celsius. Highlighting the need for countries to change direction with careful recalibrating of stimulus packages and recovery measures, director general of IRENA Francesco La Camera said, “The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the cost of tying economies to the fate of fuels prone to price shocks. Amid this, renewables have shown remarkable resilience.” IRENA observed that the emergence of a new energy system based on renewable technologies and complemented by green hydrogen and modern bioenergy. It estimated that by 2050, 90% of total electricity needs would be supplied by renewables, followed by 6% from natural gas and the remaining from nuclear. The agency has identified 30 innovations for the integration of wind and solar PV in power systems.  Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Natake, who delivered the keynote address, criticised the leaders for continuing to invest in fossil fuel commitments, saying, “We cannot eat coal and we cannot drink oil.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/energy-meet-calls-for-faster-shift-to-renewables/article34087767.ece

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Cannot send back Myanmar exiles: MP||The Tatmadaw, or the Myanmar military, had taken over the country after a coup on February 1. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha during zero hour, Mr. Vanlalvena said, “Over 300 Myanmar nationals who have crossed the border include 150 police personnel who favoured the (pro-democracy) protestors. The State government and NGOs have given immediate help and shelter to these refugees. Meanwhile, the MHA has given directions to not entertain Myanmar refugees.” “It will not go down well with people in Mizoram if the central government insists on deporting them. Being the largest democracy in the world, it is the responsibility of India to encourage and support any struggle to protect and uphold democratic rights and principles. They are our brothers; sending them back to Myanmar will mean killing them,” the MP added. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Vanlalvena said, “Most of them have relatives in our State. There are 16 to 17 roads that connect Myanmar to India, there is a small river, it is very easy to cross over to India. There is no fencing. The Mizoram government has also sent a petition to the National Human Rights Commission. They are not here for good; they will be sent back once the situation is peaceful. MHA should provide food and amenities to the refugees,” he said. He said the refugees from Myanmar belong to the Chin ethnic group comprising Lai, Tidim-Zomi, Lusei and Hualngo tribes — related to the dominant Mizos in the Northeast. “The Chief Minister spoke to Home Minister Amit Shah and he was promised that no refugee will be deported to Myanmar. But he gave this assurance about those who have already entered and now MHA has sent a letter to send them back,” the MP said. MHA in a letter dated March 10 to the four States said the State governments have no powers to grant “refugee” status to any foreigner” and India is not a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 and its 1967 Protocol. Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that “all foreign nationals (including asylum seekers)” are governed by the various provisions of law. “However, a standard operating procedure (SoP) was issued in 2011 by the Central Government and amended in 2019 which has to be followed by law enforcement agencies while dealing with foreign nationals who claim to be refugees,” the reply stated. The Mizoram government has said 383 Myanmar nationals, including women and children have crossed over. Mizoram’s Home Department officials told local journalists in State capital Aizawl that 297 of the asylum-seekers who entered five border districts have been verified while the remaining 86 are yet to be verified. The unofficial number of Chin refugees is at least twice that of the official figure of 383. “About 98% of the Myanmar nationals claim that they belong to the police force and fire service. They chose to leave the country rather than obey the military regime,” the local publications said, quoting unnamed Home Department officials. Six Mizoram districts – Hnahthial, Champhai, Lawngtlai, Saitual, Serchhip and Siaha – share a 404-km border with Myanmar’s Chin State. Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga and the State’s MPs have preferred a humanitarian approach, offering them temporary shelter and food. “The influx could not be prevented because much of the border is porous,” officials in the State were quoted as saying.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cannot-send-back-myanmar-exiles-mp/article34087225.ece

17 March 2021||JAIPUR,||Uproar in Rajasthan House over phone taps||The Opposition BJP members on Tuesday staged a demonstration in the well of the Rajasthan Assembly after Speaker C.P. Joshi rejected two adjournment motions seeking a debate on the phone tapping of some political leaders, which was admitted by the State government in reply to a question asked by an MLA. The House was adjourned four times amid the ruckus. ‘Breach of privacy’ The adjournment motions, moved by Deputy Leader of the Opposition Rajendra Rathore and BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf during the Zero Hour, referred to the “breach of privacy” caused by the phone tapping of elected public representatives, MLAs, MPs and Union Ministers. The two members sought a debate on the subject in view of “seriousness of the matter”. The BJP had on Monday demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on moral grounds, while alleging that he had told a lie and misled the Assembly on the issue. The State government had said that it had tapped the phones in the interest of public safety and order. Separately, Mr. Gehlot said in a Facebook post that no illegal surveillance of phone conversations was done by the State government and he had already clarified it in the Assembly on August 14, 2020. “The way the BJP is disturbing the Assembly proceedings shows that it is a fight for dominance. This is their internal tussle...” ‘No names given’ While the BJP sought to link the government’s reply with the political crisis in the State in July last year, the Speaker rejected the adjournment motions on the ground that they did not provide names and specific details on whose privacy had been breached. Mr. Joshi added that the Speaker’s ruling could not be challenged. When he did not allow the BJP MLAs to speak, they created an uproar and trooped into the well of the House. Leader of the Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said the adjournment motions had some substance because the ruling party’s chief whip had lodged FIRs on the basis of recordings of telephone conversations, after which some persons were arrested. BJP MLA Madan Dilawar was suspended from the Assembly for seven days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uproar-in-rajasthan-house-over-phone-taps/article34087624.ece

17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||30 OMC medicos hospitalised due to ‘food poisoning’||At least 70 MBBS students staying at the Osmania Medical College hostel, Koti, suffered from food poisoning, and of them, 30 were admitted to Gandhi Hospital for treatment. The students had consumed food provided by a private caterer on the campus. Condition of the 30 medicos was stable and they were expected to be discharged on Wednesday. The medicos started falling ill on Saturday and the college administration learnt about their condition on Sunday. Some developed fever and diarrhoea. When their condition did not improve on Monday, they were shifted to the hospital. College principal P. Shashikala said the students were dehydrated and hence, hospitalised as a precautionary measure. “We are investigating the matter. Food samples have been sent to the Institute of Preventive Medicine for examination. Blood and stool samples are being checked in our college,” Dr Shashikala said. The mess where the private caterer provides food is now closed. Another private canteen was asked to provide food to the students. Telangana Junior Doctors Association members said the number of students who suffered from food poisoning is higher than 70. Current medical students and alumni said the task of finding a caterer and awarding the tender has to be executed by students. This system is followed in all medical colleges across the State. Scores of students come from poor background and cannot afford high mess fee. Junior doctors and faculty said the students opt for low-cost food owing to financial constraints and they end up eating low quality food. “Ironically, doctors in the making who are supposed to advise people about leading a healthy lifestyle are having low quality food,” said a source. Junior doctors have requested authorities to help them in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/30-omc-medicos-hospitalised-due-to-food-poisoning/article34087226.ece
17 March 2021||ARIYALUR,TAMIL NADU||J. Guru’s wife to contest||Sornalatha alias Latha Gurunathan, wife of former president of Vanniyar Sangam late Kaduvetti J. Guru, has decided to contest against the PMK in Jayamkondam constituency in Ariyalur district. She has been nominated by the Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi (IJK), which is part of the alliance led by the Makkal Needhi Maiam, in Jayamkondam constituency. She is expected to file her nomination papers before the Returning Officer in Jayamkondam on Wednesday. She will fight against the PMK candidate K. Balu, an advocate in Chennai. The DMK has named Ka.So.Ga. Kannan, union secretary of T. Palur (west) as its candidate for the constiutency. Shortly after her nomination by the IJK, Ms. Latha visited various parts of the constituency to muster support. Accompanied by the supporters of late J. Guru, she canvassed for votes in various villages including Melakudiyiruppu, Melaneduvaya and other villages near Jayamkondam on Tuesday. “We are all fed up with the way the PMK leadership has treated the family of Guru after his death. Ms. Latha will score a thumping win in Jayamkondam constituency,” said Veeramuthu, treasurer of Maaveeran Manjal Padai, an outfit floated by Kanalarasan, son of Guru. After the demise of Guru, a two-time MLA of the PMK and a trusted lieutenant of PMK founder M. Ramadoss, Ms. Latha had identified herself with the PMK leadership when her son Kanalarasan took a contrary stand and criticised the PMK for failing to protect the family and followers of Guru. Mr. Kanalarasan subsequently floated an outfit named “Maveeran Manjal Padai’. However, Ms. Latha is said to have switched sides after the arrest of Mr. Kanalarasan in February in a case registered about a year ago. His supporters alleged that he was arrested at the behest of the PMK leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/j-gurus-wife-to-contest-from-jayamkondam/article34087378.ece
17 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||City’s gateway goes to the polls with its own set of issues||Older than the city that came up around it, Harbour constituency is a hub of trade and is home to a cosmopolitan population. The narrow streets and alleys that dot the constituency are congested. With two major government medical college hospitals, healthcare needs are accessible but infrastructure improvement has been very slow. The largely business locality co-exists with residential areas. The constituency has its share of pavement dwellers and civic problems. In places like St. Xavier Street, families have lived along the compound wall of the Christian missionary schools for over three decades. The only improvement is their thatched roofs have given way to tarpaulin roofs. Women head most families here and have to provide as single mothers. In 2011, Pala. Karuppiah of the AIADMK was elected. But the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa expelled him in 2016 for “anti-party activities” and since then there has been no active representative here, say residents. Traffic bottleneck Traffic congestion is a major issue. The Elephant Gate bridge has been shut for repair since 2016 and work remains incomplete, says Praveen Jain, a resident of Sowcarpet. Hukmichand Shah, an electrical goods shop owner in Sowcarpet, says, “The area is the highest revenue generator yet there is no proper parking facility. Shops have installed cameras and it benefits the government as well, yet traders are neglected.” The roads are riddled with potholes and garbage clearance is poor. Electric wires hang haphazardly and people fear walking during the monsoon, he says. Mr. Shah wants an MLA who connects with the Centre. “Since the GST was introduced, they have brought 937 amendments and we simple traders are unable to keep track of them. We need someone who listens to our problems as a trading community,” he says. Residents like Manoj, a construction site supervisor with the civic body, believes the constituency has improved with e-toilets, street garden and a gym. S. Murali, a tailor in Varada Muthiappan Street and a Congress functionary, says the electricity supply network needs improvement. “Each building here has 10-15 AC units. Naturally, one transformer cannot take the entire load,” he says. MLA P.K. Sekar Babu, who is seeking re-election, is aware of the problems. “All streets are narrow and the floating population is high. There is no space to create a parking lot. The amount of garbage is twice what you see in other constituencies as this is a business district. The drainage system is 60 years old and though we have expanded its capacity, it requires improvement,” he says. Water is being supplied from the Kilpauk pumping station for the past 40 years, a reason why areas in the tail-end of the supply network suffer, he says. The government has closed the Elephant Gate bridge without preparing for the consequences, he says. He, along with Chennai Central MP Dayanidhi Maran, had represented repeatedly to the State and Union governments. After persistent pressure, the government has agreed to award work on the storm-water drains on Wall Tax Road that collapsed 10 years ago, Mr. Babu says. Though former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa issued a GO to build a 230 kV station, the government has not taken steps, he says. “Next time, if the DMK regime comes, we will solve these infrastructure issues of the people,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/citys-gateway-goes-to-the-polls-with-its-own-set-of-issues/article34087815.ece
17 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fishers oppose move on Pulicat||Fishermen of Pulicat lake and environmentalists have criticised the alleged move of the State Forest Department to reduce the protective buffer around Pulicat Wildlife Sanctuary from 10 km to 500 m. They expressed their shock in letters to the Union Government’s Expert Committee on Eco Sensitive Zones condemning the move which, they say, is designed solely to benefit polluting industries proposed to be set up in the Ennore-Pulicat wetlands. The letters were in response to a media article announcing the Forest Department’s intent. In March 2019, the department approached the Expert Committee of the Union Environment Ministry seeking a notification to reduce the zone from 10 km to 0 km, which, however, was not approved. The fishermen said the current move to reduce the zone to a mere 500 m was a bad idea since it would only benefit private companies that were likely to come up there. These industries would end up polluting the lake and its surroundings, said C. Parandhaman of Light House Kuppam. Activist G. Sundarrajan said that reduction of the zone would end up damaging the lake, birds and animals. “It is home to thousands of migratory birds and to crabs, shrimps and fish that are exclusive to the lake, which is spread over two States. The livelihood of fishermen depending on the lake, too, would be lost,” he said. The fishermen and the activists have urged the government to not reduce the buffer zone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishers-oppose-move-on-pulicat/article34087818.ece

On Tuesday, soon after a passenger posted pictures showing how badly this toilet was maintained, it attracted a lot of criticism on how an international airport should not be turning a blind eye to some of the basic facilities. Chozhan, a Twitter user, posted: “Dear Prime Minister, see the poor maintenance of our one of the important international airports @PMOIndia @AAI_Official. Strict action should be taken against the maintenance contract company.” Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said they had rectified this issue as soon as it was brought to their notice. “This toilet is not located inside the terminal. It is near the parking lot and is open to anyone entering the airport premises. The ones in the terminal for passengers are maintained well and are going through renovation now, one after another. We are taking care to provide the best of facilities to passengers,” an official said. As the construction of an integrated terminal and a multilevel car parking lot is in progress on the airport premises, hundreds of workers deployed here use the toilet, officials said. “Because so many use it throughout the day, it is difficult to maintain this toilet. We will see how to ensure this problem does not occur again,” another official said.

17 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||New mitral clip offers a way out for elderly heart patients||Four senior citizens, who were declared high risk for heart surgery, were treated for their condition and are now carrying on with their daily activities. The patients were treated at Apollo Hospitals using minimally invasive procedures. The hospital’s senior interventional cardiologist Sai Satish said the patients suffered from malfunction of their mitral valve. The valve monitors the flow of blood from the left atrium to the ventricle. Sometimes, the valve does not close properly, resulting in the blood not reaching the ventricle. Instead, it is pumped into the lungs. When this happens, people get choked and cannot even walk. Dr. Sai said when this happens in elderly patients, surgery is ruled out and such patients suffer heart failure. In western countries, a clip is used to enable the valve continue its function. The clip is implanted through a minimally invasive procedure. The therapy is used to repair the leaking mitral valve and has proved to be a lifesaver, he said. The hospital recently performed four such back-to-back procedures in elderly patients in their late 70s and 80s. All of them returned home within a few days and were independent, he said. In India, an estimated 4.6 million people might have suffered heart failure, he said. Suneeta Reddy, managing director, said it was important to recognise the need for the procedure. The hospital had so far done 13 mitral clip procedures, the oldest being an 88-year-old man, she said. Hospital vice-chairman Preetha Reddy attributed the success of the procedures to “the highest level of team work”. She said in the past year, “we have shown that we are as good as any hospital in the world”. Apollo Hospitals group chairman Prathap C. Reddy said: “With the MitraClip, we are able to treat patients with severe mitral regurgitation, who are at prohibitive surgical risk, and offer them a second lease of life. We are proud that Apollo Hospitals is among the select few hospitals in India that is accredited to perform the MitraClip procedure for these heart failure patients.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-mitral-clip-offers-a-way-out-for-elderly-heart-patients/article34087809.ece

17 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Keeping a police officer on compulsory wait is not punishment, says HC||Making it clear that keeping a police officer on compulsory wait is not a punishment since it is considered period spent on duty, the Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to give due weightage to the sentiments expressed by the court on the need to suspend a special Director General of Police (DGP) accused of having made sexual advances towards a woman Superintendent of Police (SP). Justice N. Anand Venkatesh wondered how an investigating officer in the rank of Superintendent of Police would be able to interrogate a special DGP without being intimidated psychologically. “This is where the suspension of A1 assumes significance. A1, coming with his official paraphernalia, even though he his kept under compulsory wait, will jeopardise the investigation,” the judge said. “Placing an officer under compulsory wait does not attach any stigma to it and such compulsory wait is resorted to only in cases where a government servant is not able to be accommodated in a suitable post or vacancy … The government servant concerned will be entitled for all service benefits including allowances during this period of compulsory wait. It can never be construed as a punishment,” he added. The observations were made in an interim order passed on a suo motu writ petition taken up by the court to monitor the criminal investigation being done in the case by the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) as well as an internal inquiry being conducted by the Internal Complaints Committee under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-keeping-a-police-officer-on-compulsory-wait-is-not-punishment/article34087377.ece

Puram Uzhavar Sandhai (farmers’ market) on Tuesday morning alleging discrimination in enforcing rules. Mr. Palanisamy said the Agricultural Marketing Department officials while allowing farmers or their representatives to sell vegetables grown in the hill denied the same relaxation to farmers who were within 40km radius. The officials insisted that only farmers who had the permit card to sell in farmers’ markets should set up shops and should not send their family members or farm labourers. This was unfair because the farmer would be tending to farm in the morning and therefore would have to depute somebody in his place. Besides, the Department officials gave roofed shops to those selling hill vegetables while asking the local farmers to take the ground or open space. The Department officials should evenly deal with all farmers and not show preference to one group to another, Mr. Palanisamy said and added that he had taken up the issue with the Collector, who had promised to look into it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-protest-alleging-discrimination/article34087419.ece

Kumar of Siruvalur carried a pot of water on his head from bus stand in Gobichettipalayam to Revenue Divisional Office and filed his nomination paper as Independent candidate to contest in Gobichettipalayam Assembly constituency. Since, police did not allow him not to carry the pot within 200 metre from the office of the Returning Officer, he placed the pot and later filed his papers. The 38-year-old nominee employed at a workshop has declared his total asset worth Rs. 45,000. He contested in the Tiruppur Parliamentary constituency in 2019 and secured 1,599 votes. He said that implementation of the scheme would benefit people in Erode and Coimbatore districts and wanted the long demand of the people to be fulfilled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/13-file-nominations-in-erode-dist/article34087430.ece
17 March 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||Pollution, a grave concern in the region||The constituency with 2.91 lakh electorates accounts for the largest number of voters in the district where agriculture, textile processing and power looms continue to be the major activities. Over one-third of the areas in corporation limits, town panchayats of Chithode and Nasiyanur and areas on the city outskirts come under the constituency that is facing pollution, traffic congestion, lack of basic amenities as a major issue. It is indeed an herculean task for the DMK combine to prove that Erode West and Kongu region are no longer the fort for the AIADMK. Untreated effluents discharged by textile processing units into Pitchaikaran Canal that finally mix with River Cauvery continue to be a major concern for the residents who complain of contamination of ground water for many years. Despite inspections by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board officials, the perennial problem remains unresolved as establishing common effluent treatment plants is seen as the only solution and the promises remain only in papers. Though a large number of residential areas and houses have come up in rural areas, little steps were taken to ease traffic congestion and improve the basic amenities. Turmeric that is grown across the district is brought to the regulated market located in the constituency and farmers were demanding a cold storage facility to stock their products when price falls. They also wanted an integrated turmeric market to tap more opportunities. Encroachment of Perumpallam Canal and Kanirowther Kulam are yet to be removed despite court orders. Over 30,000 power loom units were located in Chithode and Veerappanchatiram that were struggling over an increase in yarn price and job loss to workers. Their long demand for a textile park is yet to take shape. K.V. Ramalingam of AIADMK and S. Muthusamy of DMK are the key contestants who had been Ministers. While Mr. Ramalingam highlights the schemes implemented by the AIADMK government from 2011 to 2021, Mr. Muthusamy garners votes by projecting the party’s election manifesto. Mr. Muthusamy served as Transport Minister in MGR cabinet and as Health Minister in Jayalalithaa cabinet in 1991. He later joined the DMK and lost to Mr. Ramalingam in 2016. Both belong to the dominant Gounder community and tough fight is expected on the cards in the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pollution-a-grave-concern-in-the-region/article34087438.ece

17 March 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||‘Expedite probe into murder of 10-year-old boy in Bargur’||The Tamil Nadu State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights has sought a status report on the unsolved murder of a 10-year-old boy, whose remains were found in early February this year. Human sacrifice The tortured remains of the body of the boy, who was unidentified, were found at the foothills of Malleswaram in a remote village in Bargur in February. The body was spotted by locals residents. The boy was found with his head tonsured, mouth stuffed with chilli powder, burns on the body and attired in new clothes, alluding to a possible human sacrifice. While the crime scene was investigated with the help of a sniffer dog, the investigation has failed to turn up any leads for the police. A month after the crime, the police are yet to make any headway in the case and secure the offenders. Taking cognisance of the case, and expressing concern over the gravity of the crime, V. Ramaraj, Member, SCPCR, has called for a status update on the crime from the district police and also from the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU). Speaking to The Hindu , Dr. Ramaraj said this case is being closely monitored by the SCPCR. ‘Grave crime’ “This is a grave crime but the culprits are yet to be secured and brought to book. I’ve spoken to the SP (Superintendent of Police) for a status update. I’ve also instructed the district child protection office to closely monitor the case,” he said. According to Dr. Ramaraj, grave crimes such as this should be cracked at the earliest and the criminals brought to book, which is the only deterrent against such crimes against children. The SCPCR member has urged the police to grant special attention to the case and expedite its solving. As of date, there have been no missing children complaints in any of the local police stations that could be of the victim. The District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) has also been asked to give an interim report on the status of the police case and directed to closely monitor the case, coordinating with the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-probe-into-murder-of-10-year-old-boy-in-bargur/article34087406.ece
17 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Problems aplenty in Madurai Central||Madurai Central Assembly constituency houses the famed Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple — the landmark around which Madurai evolved. However, for the residents of this constituency, which forms the core city, problems are aplenty. The inconvenience endured by the public in the name of developmental projects, traffic congestion, and lack of basic civic infrastructure are some of the major grievances highlighted by the residents. Madurai Central assembly constituency has a set of diverse voters belonging to different communities and economic groups. For instance, the constituency has affluent voters of S.S. Colony as well as the working class voters from areas like Thathaneri and Aruldosspuram. There are also habitations of Scheduled Caste voters from Melavasal, Subramaniapuram and Simmakkal. The four Masi streets, which form the commercial hub of the city, also fall under the Madurai Central constituency. Arapalayam, Arasaradi, Ellis Nagar, Mahaboopalayam, Ponnagaram and Sundararajapuram are some of the other areas that fall under this constituency. A common concern that the residents echoed was the hardship that they had to endure due to the execution of smart city projects in the core city- ‘smart roads’ laid on the four Masi streets and Periyar bus stand project. K.P. Thangavel, a resident of Melavasal, says that the delay in completion of Periyar bus stand project has caused inconvenience to hundreds of commuters in the absence of alternative arrangements made for the commuters. There is an urgent need to establish additional number of toilets and drinking water facilities around the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, says S. Jeeva, a trader near the temple. “Although thousands of foreign tourists visit the temple every year, no steps are taken to fulfill these basic needs of the people,” he adds. Ashraf Tayub, Secretary of Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association, says that there is a need to ensure free flow of vehicular traffic and availability of adequate parking facilities for the four Masi streets. The poor maintenance of Thathaneri cremation grounds, which functions round-the-clock, is another issue present for many years. Another issue which has remained as the ‘elephant in the room’ is the incomplete road overbridge at Palanganatham. Interestingly, one portion of the overbridge falls under the Madurai Central constituency and the remaining portion comes under Madurai West constituency. “The bridge is now the preferred choice for walkers in TVS Nagar and nearby areas in the mornings,” points out S. Ravi, a resident of TVS Nagar. To contest in this core city, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has fielded the sitting MLA P.T.R.P. Thiagarajan. He complains that the civic body authorities were not being transparent and disclosing information to him, as he was an MLA from the opposition party. “I am asking voters to evaluate me based on my performance in the last five years,” he adds. He has completed around 150 projects, including construction of anganwadis, roads, new classrooms, bus stops and, installation of borewells and scan machines, under his MLA Constituency Development Fund, says Mr. Thiagarajan. Pasumpon Desiya Kazhagam, which is in alliance with All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, has fielded N. Jothi Muthuramalingam. G.S. Sikkandar Batcha of Social Democratic Party of India, which is an ally of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, is also contesting from Madurai Central constituency. Makkal Needhi Maiam has fielded B. Mani who owns a few eateries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/problems-aplenty-in-madurai-central/article34087894.ece
17 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||DMK renamed projects implemented by BJP to include them in poll manifesto: V.K. Singh||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has renamed the projects that are already implemented by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has announced those schemes as part of the DMK’s manifesto, charged the Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V.K. Singh. He was addressing the mediapersons here on Tuesday, along with P. Saravanan, BJP’s candidate for Madurai North constituency and BJP State general secretary R. Srinivasan. Mr. Singh welcomed the move of Dr. Saravanan, who quit the DMK and joined the BJP. He said that Dr. Saravanan, who was earlier the MLA of Tirupparankundram, felt that the DMK was making false promises to the public. “The DMK is a party that uses muscle power. That party is known for not fulfilling their promises or working for the cause of the public,” he charged. He exuded confidence that Dr. Saravanan will win. When questioned about the rising price of petrol, diesel and cooking gas, Mr. Singh replied that the prices were affected due to the fluctuations in the international market. In reply to a question on the AIADMK’s announcement in its election manifesto that it would press the Centre to withdraw the Citizenship Amendment Act, Mr. Singh said that the matter will be discussed after the end of elections. He added that many sections of the society had wrongly misinterpreted the CAA. Dr. Saravanan, who spoke about the reasons for shifting loyalty to BJP from DMK, said that it was the BJP government which successfully produced a vaccination for COVID-19 in a short period of time. “I am a doctor and a social worker who will work for the welfare of the public,” he said.  When questioned about a group of BJP cadres protesting against the announcement of Dr. Saravanan contesting for BJP, he said that it was a small misunderstanding and all of them are working together now. Mr. Srinivasan who had worked extensively in Madurai North constituency was questioned why he was denied a seat to contest from the constituency. “Being a member of RSS, I will always obey the decision of the top leadership. The top leaders even consulted me before announcing Dr. Saravanan as the candidate for Madurai North. So, there is no ego between us. We are united and will work to ensure that BJP is winning Madurai North constituency,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-renamed-projects-implemented-by-bjp-to-include-them-in-poll-manifesto-vk-singh/article34087898.ece
17 March 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||DSP injured in stone pelting||A mob of over 200 persons hurled stones at a police team in which five police personnel, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police, were injured and a few police vehicles, a fire tender and an ambulance were damaged near Melur in Madurai, in the early hours of Tuesday. The police party, led by Additional Superintendent of Police, S. Vanitha, had rushed to Vellalapattipudur, under the Kottampatti police station limits, past Monday midnight, when they received information about the installation of a statue of Muthuramalinga Thevar without permission. Local residents had installed the five-foot-high cement statue near the village ground, late in the night. When the police team, along with Revenue officials, attempted to remove the statue, the mob that had been objecting to the removal of the statue, suddenly started to pelt stones on the police officials. “One of them had switched off power supply by turning off the transformer,” a police officer said. Making use of the darkness, the mob surrounded the small police force and started to pelt stones. Though the police managed to switch on the power within five minutes, by then, the police personnel had suffered injuries. Deputy Superintendent of Police (Oomachikulam), Vijayakumar, sustained injuries. He has been admitted to a private hospital in Madurai. Among the other injured are Kottampatti Sub-Inspector of Police Suthan, Special Sub-Inspector of Police Palaniappan and two Tamil Nadu Special Police constables Deenadayalan and Arunkumar. All the injured have been admitted to the government hospital in Melur. Police vehicles of the ADSP, DSP, a fire tender and an ambulance were damaged in the incident, the police said. Statue removed The police said that the statue had been removed and brought to the Melur Taluk office. Deputy Inspector General of Police (Madurai) R. Sudhakar and Superintendent of Police Sujit Kumar, inspected the scene of crime.

17 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC directs Collector to look into priest’s plea||Quoting French-Algerian philosopher and writer Albert Camus, “Democracy is not the law of the majority, but the protection of the minority”, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court directed the Kanniyakumari Collector to hold an inquiry and process an application that was submitted by a priest who sought permission to conduct prayer meetings. Justice V. Parthiban took note of the State’s submission that the area was a sensitive place and directed the Collector to call for reports from the official concerned with the maintenance of law and order and pass appropriate orders. Conditions can be imposed in order to ensure that public peace and order was not disturbed, if permission was granted, the court said. The court was hearing the petition filed by Rev. J. Devadhason, designated priest of ‘South India Assemblies of God’. He had proposed to construct a building in Agastheeswaram taluk in Kanniyakumari district for conducting prayer meetings. However, permission was denied to conduct the prayers, citing law and order problems. The petitioner challenged the rejection. The right to propagate, profess and follow different faiths was a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution. However, indisputably, such a right was also circumscribed by certain limitations. The fundamental rights guaranteed, as every one is aware of, are not absolute and are always subordinated to maintenance of public peace and social order, the court said. The court observed that it was for the administrators to take a comprehensive decision in such sensitive matters as they alone were competent to decide and at the same time, the petitioner cannot be denied his right to carry on his legitimate religious functions. Under such circumstances, a delicate balance may have to be maintained as between the public order and peace on one hand and citizens' fundamental right to worship and propagate their faith in tune with the constitutional scheme, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-collector-to-look-into-priests-plea/article34087896.ece
17 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||NEET impersonation case: HC seeks CBI response||With a larger conspiracy involved in the NEET impersonation case, spreading across States, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court sought a response from the CBI. Other than in Tamil Nadu no other State had reported such impersonation. The apprehension was that the modus operandi adopted in other States has not been reported, the court observed. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar suo motu impleaded the CBI in the case and observed that the CBI was added as a party to find out whether such malpractices had taken place in other States. The court directed the CBI-ACB, Madurai District to file its response in the case. The court was hearing the bail petition filed by Rasheed, a key accused in the case. During the course of the hearing, the court was informed by the CB-CID that the investigation was in progress. Various documents had been collected and instructions sent to colleges to find out the impersonator. A letter was sent to the UIDAI for comparison of photos and fingerprints. Taking note of the submissions, the court observed that there was no coordination between the UIDAI, the Director of Medical Education and the other stakeholders in the case. All the particulars are collected from applicants and a biometric check is done for the identity of the person. If this was not followed outside the State, it would give room to malpractice. The students involved in such malpractices deny bright students their rightful medical seats. The NEET examination was an All India entrance examination and malpractice in one place will have an effect on the students across the country, the court said. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the accused had already been granted statutory bail in the case and sought to withdraw the petition. However, in the view of the larger issues involved and in the interest of justice, the court sought a response from the CBI and posted the case for hearing to March 18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/neet-case-cbi-response-sought/article34087379.ece

17 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Nellithope: a marker of hard bargaining within NDA allies||In a bizarre development, allies within the NDA stand as adversaries at the moment in the Nellithope Assembly segment with the candidates of the BJP and the AIADMK filing nominations for the seat on Monday. This comes against the backdrop of the NDA agreement allotting 16 seats to the AINRC and the BJP staking claim for a larger slice of the 14-seat pie it has to share with the AIADMK. Om Sakthi Sekar of the AIADMK and his son Tamil Sengolan filed their nominations for Nellithope while son of A. John Kumar, now with the BJP — J. Vivilian Richards — also submitted his nomination for the seat. Meanwhile, on the rival Congress-DMK-Left front, the DMK has fielded V. Karthikeyan for Nellithope, from where former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy had won in a byelection in 2016. Mr. John Kumar, who was then Congress MLA representing the constituency, had vacated the seat. Now, Mr. John Kumar is contesting from Kamaraj Nagar while his son has filed nomination in Nellithope. These moves could signify that Nellithope could be a marker of hard bargaining in the negotiations for other constituencies between the BJP and the AIADMK. As per the ECI schedule, the last date for filing nominations is March 19; scrutiny is on March 20 and final date for withdrawal of nominations is March 22. In the rival Congress-DMK-Left camp, Nellithope has been chosen by the DMK, which has been allotted 13 against the 15 seats for the Congress. The DMK has fielded a new face V. Karthikeyan in Nellithope. “The party has agreed to support our candidature,” Mr. John Kumar said. The necessary A and B forms would be submitted to the returning officer on Tuesday, he said. According to Mr. John Kumar, the margin of victory in 2016 when he defeated Om Sakthi Sekar by over 6,000 votesvindicated his claim to field his son from Nellithope. “I was informed by my leadership that Nellithope seat was included in the discussion with the BJP and it was set aside for the AIADMK. After I came to know that Mr. John Kumar’s son filed the papers, I decided to submit the nomination. Because I should not give an opportunity for my leadership to question me,” Mr. Sekar told The Hindu . Eventually, the Nellithope seat was allotted to Mr. Richards (BJP) while Mr. Sekar was accommodated in Orleanpet as the two parties in the NDA alliance released their candidates’ list on Tuesday night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nellithope-a-marker-of-hard-bargaining-within-nda-allies/article34087960.ece

17 March 2021||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK notorious for unruly behaviour: Palaniswami||AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday dubbed the DMK as a party notorious for “unruly” behaviour. Recalling the ruckus created by sections of DMK legislators in the Assembly during the floor test conducted in 2017, Mr. Palaniswami alleged that the DMK MLAs “danced” on the tables and sat on the Speaker’s chair “after pushing him aside” and plunging the House into pandemonium. “If such an atrocity was committed by the DMK members inside the revered house, what would happen if they were given the power to rule the State? Will the State grow and go on the right path?” Mr. Palaniswami wondered. Campaigning at Viralimalai, Illupur, Annavasal, Pudukottai and Tirumayam seeking support for AIADMK candidates, he recalled the attacks allegedly committed by DMK functionaries at business establishments and traders in Chennai, Perambalur and Tirumayam. “What will happen if such a party regains power?” he asked and appealed to the electorate to defeat the DMK in the upcoming election.  Stalin’s petitions  The Opposition leader was trying to fool the electorate by accepting petitions from the general public during his campaign and promising to solve their grievances upon coming to power in a matter of 100 days. The DMK had ruled the State for several years and Mr. Stalin had not accepted petitions when he was the Local Administration Minister or the Deputy Chief Minister to solve people’s problems, he claimed. The DMK was least bothered about the public when in power but was now accepting petitions when they were in the Opposition which was farcical, he charged. The Chief Minister claimed that the DMK would never emerge victorious and that the boxes containing the petitions given by the people during Mr. Stalin's campaign would never be opened. Ministers of his government, on his instructions, had received over 9 lakh petitions from people and solutions were found for more than 5 lakh petitions, Mr. Palaniswami said. Mr .Stalin was not aware of facts and was bent on spreading canards accusing the AIADMK regime of not having done anything over the past four years, the Chief Minister said.  AIADMK achievements Highlighting the welfare schemes executed by the AIADMK government, he said the Cauvery-Gundar river link project would turn Pudukottai district into a fertile region in the coming years. The AIADMK government was the one that had protected the farming community. The waiver of crop loans disbursed by cooperative societies was not aimed at securing votes but to alleviate the sufferings of the farmers, Mr. Palaniswami claimed. The AIADMK government had also waived the loans taken by self-help group members from cooperative institutions, heeding their representations. The government would increase the number of days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme from 100 days to 150 days. Internet connectivity would be provided to over 17,000 revenue villages through BharatNet, he said and added that there would be no tariff for the Arasu cable TV connection in future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-notorious-for-unruly-behaviour-alleges-palaniswami/article34087350.ece
17 March 2021||S. SundarAruppukottai,TAMIL NADU||A few spinning mills, a lot of powerlooms and little else||Traditionally, the contest in Aruppukottai Assembly constituency is between the rival Dravidian parties. This time, it will be a hat-trick showdown between Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s heavyweight K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran, who will fight his 11th Assembly election, and one-time MLA S. Vaigaiselvam of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. However, it was Vaigaiselvam who put spokes into the wheel of veteran Mr. Ramachandran, in 2011. But Mr. Ramachandran bounced back in the next election for his 8th win in 10 electoral battles. After delimitation in 2009, Aruppukottai Town and Aruppukottai union came into Aruppukottai Assembly Constituency from erstwhile Sattur where Mr. Ramachandran had won six times. Predominantly a rural area, Aruppukottai segment has a handful of spinning mills that are major employers. Besides, over 6,000 powerlooms give employment to over 2,500 families and its ancillary units give jobs to few thousands of semi-skilled workers. After Jayalalithaa government offered concession in electricity bills, it was M. Karunanidhi government that introduced free power supply leading to a spurt in powerlooms. “Most of the powerlooms are in houses where husband, wife and their wards work. Each family can make upto Rs. 25,000 a month if everything goes well,” says a leading powerloom cloth manufacturer V. Arivanandam, 62. However, weavers are wary about an imminent danger of scrapping free power under the Centre’s UDAY scheme. “We want the government to re-introduce monthly cycle of billing which will benefit weavers in a big way. Besides, the administrators should intervene to bring down the price of yarn that has almost doubled in the recent times,” he said. They also want to find a way out for prolonged delay in getting GST refunds and want a trade centre in Madurai for selling their goods. Water supply Drinking water has been a major issue in the town. After Vaigai river scheme failed in the past, the DMK government brought Tamirabharani combined drinking water scheme. Even now, water is supplied once in 10 days. Mr. Ramachandran boasts of having brought another combined water scheme which will fulfil drinking water needs of the town for the next few decades. Traffic congestion is a major problem in the town with narrow roads. Mr. Vaigaiselvam, who was a Minister for a brief period after winning in 2011, said he was instrumental in bringing a government college, Regional Transport Office, Fire Station building and an academy to coach civil servant aspirants. He promises to find a permanent solution for two major issues plaguing this segment – a common facility centre for dyeing units with effluent treatment plant and a cottage industry set up for making paper wrapping of black fuses in a safe way. Lack of underground drainage has ruined groundwater quality in Periya kanmoi in Ramasamyapuram, says R. Velusamy, 67, who says the constituency needs better care. P. Uma of Naam Tamilar Katchi, Uma Devi of Makkal Needhi Maiam and R. Ramesh of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam make the rest of the contestants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-few-spinning-mills-a-lot-of-powerlooms-and-little-else/article34087383.ece
17 March 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Washing machine being offered instead of water: Kamal Haasan||Criticising the election manifesto of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Makkal Needhi Maiam president Kamal Haasan said they offered washing machines when people were asking for water. Campaigning at Thadagapatti here for the candidates of his party and those of his allies, he asked them to identify incomplete projects in the constituencies and execute a bond with the people on completing the projects within a stipulated time-frame. Mr. Haasan said he would sign as guarantor on the bond. Mr. Hassan said that if the present regime had not troubled him, his assets would have been over Rs. 200 crore, and that they caused a loss of Rs. 60 crore by not letting him work. He charged that 33% of elected representatives in the present Assembly were accused in various criminal cases. Criticising the ‘Thaliku thangam scheme’, Mr. Haasan charged that free thalis were offered on the one hand and they were snatched away through TASMAC outlets. Mr. Hassan said that he was able to notice several flyover construction sites where work was midway in Coimbatore and charged that they read ‘Palam’ (Bridge) as ‘Labam’ (Profit). The actor said that he was heckled at when he refused to reveal detailed plans regarding his manifesto and planned to offer wages for housewives. He had expressed concern that it could be copied. But, today it had become a reality, he said. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has declared that he had assets worth Rs. 3 crore when he came to power and that these had reduced to Rs. 2 crores now, but the CM was doing well, Mr. Haasan said. The MNM leader also appealed to the people not to vote on the basis of caste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/washing-machine-being-offered-instead-of-water-kamal-haasan/article34087410.ece

17 March 2021||SALEM/ NAMAKKAL,TAMIL NADU||Stalin confident that DMK, allies will win in all 234 seats||DMK leader M.K. Stalin said on Tuesday that his party-led alliance would win in all 234 seats in the Assembly election and a government would be formed, with no Opposition party in the Assembly. Mr. Stalin campaigned for the DMK’s candidates in the Yercaud and Veerapandi constituencies near Selanikenpatti here. During the day, he walked through the streets of Shevapet Market seeking votes for DMK candidate R. Rajendran. Addressing crowds here, he said that earlier he used to say that the DMK would win in 200 seats, but after ‘Vidiyalai Nokki Stalinin Kural’ and ‘Ungal Thoguthiyil Stalin’ were conducted and owing to the public response during the campaign, he was confident that the DMK-led alliance would win in all 234 constituencies. Mr. Stalin outlined the promises made in the DMK’s manifesto and said they would be fulfilled as he was Kalaignar Karunanidhi’s son. He said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s claim that he was made the Chief Minister by Jayalalithaa was not true. Whenever Jayalalithaa had to step down from the post, she would hand over the charge to Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, he said. The upcoming election would put an end to the “unjust governance” in the State, and would be the last one for Mr. Palaniswami, he said. Jaya’s death Mr. Stalin said no one knew the truth behind the death of Jayalalithaa, though it had been four years since an inquiry commission was formed. He added that Mr. Panneerselvam, despite having been summoned eight times, had not appeared before the commission. He said he was ready to appear before the commission, if summoned Mr. Stalin said the AIADMK had taken a photocopy of the DMK manifesto and claimed it as its own. Seeking votes for the candidates of the DMK and the Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi at Namakkal, he charged the Ministers for Electricity and Local Administration with corruption. Mr. Stalin alleged that even during the COVID-19 pandemic the ruling AIADMK had made money in the procurement of masks, bleaching powder and broom sticks. He promised the voters that outer ring roads would be laid in Thiruchengode, Namakkal and Rasipuram.

17 March 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||CPI criticises CM for blaming DMK reagrding Jaya’s death||CPI State secretary R.Mutharasan on Tuesday criticised Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami for “making allegations against the DMK leaders” regarding the death of former AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa forgetting his official stature. Talking to reporters in Thanjavur he pointed out that AIADMK coordinator, O.Panneerselvam was the one who had demanded CBI inquiry into the death of the former Chief Minister. Hence, the AIADMK government constituted an inquiry commission to make truce with him. But now the Chief Minister was levelling charges against former Chief Minister M.Karunanidhi and the DMK president M.K.Stalin holding them responsible for the death of Jayalalithaa. “The Chief Minister should speak and act keeping in mind the stature of his position and refrain from making untrue statements”, he added. When the Madras High Court directed the State government to waive the farm loans, it went on an appeal in the Supreme Court. But when the DMK assured that it would waive the farm loans, if voted to power, the AIADMK hurriedly waived the farm loans sanctioned by cooperative societies, he charged. Alleging that the BJP does not have faith in democracy, Mr.Mutharasan charged that the BJP’s sole aim was to wipe out State-level political parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpi-criticises-cms-allegation/article34087376.ece
17 March 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘Wearing masks in public places is mandatory’||Collector and District Election Officer K. Senthil Raj has warned that hefty fine would be slapped on the candidate or the event coordinators if the participants of election meetings do not wear masks. With the COVID-19 cases steadily increasing across the country, the district administration has started slapping a minimum fine of Rs. 200 on those who refuse to wear masks while visiting public places even though the number of fresh cases in the district is less than 5. As the imposition of fine came to force on Monday, Rs. 50,500 was collected as fine from the violators. If the violation was observed in a marriage hall during an event, the owner would be fined Rs. 5,000. The officials had been instructed to conduct surprise check for violators in wedding and the functions being organised in places of worship. “So far, Rs. 23.89 lakh has been collected from 11,161 persons who violated the COVID-19 norms. The drive will be intensified further in the days to come,” he said. He said that 900 persons were being screened on an average everyday and the positivity rate was only 0.03%. “But we don’t want to be slack which would prove to be very costly,” he said. Apart from 20 government hospitals and primary health centres, 30 private hospitals had been authorised to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to every citizen above the age of 60 and to those who had crossed the age of 45 but with co-morbidities. The Collector informed that every polling official including the policemen would be vaccinated before April 6, the day of polling. Of the 18,000 polling personnel, 6,000 had been vaccinated so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wearing-masks-in-public-places-is-mandatory/article34087993.ece

Dr. Narayanababu said there was a spurt in positive cases and sporadic clusters in a few districts. No room should be given to undermine the efforts to check the spread of the viral infection. The health authorities had been asked to step up vigilance and MGMGH had sufficient beds to treat patients. The authorities had been instructed to identify or add beds, if needed.

17 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||A long wait for better infrastructure||The infrastructure-starved Tirunelveli Assembly segment which faced the past 14 Assembly polls with a lot of promises from its MLAs in the past is gearing up to face yet another election. Dusty narrow streets, roads further narrowed down by encroachments, no step taken for laying broader roads, improper drainage channels and free flow of drainage into channels carrying water for irrigation from the Tamirabharani continue to be eye sore of this town. While religion plays a major role in the voting pattern in elections in the Kanniyakumari district, the caste factor decides the winners in the districts of Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi. The constituency has 33,000 voters of Thevar community, followed by Pillai (32,000) and Yadhava (18,000). While the DMK has fielded A.L.S. Lakshmanan, sitting MLA, from the Pillai community, the AIADMK-BJP combine has nominated Nainar Nagenthran, State vice-president of the national party, who belongs to Thevar community. Interestingly, the AMMK, which is expected to make inroads in the vote bank of the AIADMK, has fielded Paul Kannan from Yadhava community. Since the AMMK, led by T.T.V. Dhinakaran, is expected to enjoy the overwhelming backing of Thevar community voters as it had in the local body elections, Mr. Paul Kannan is likely to get the support of the Yadhava and Thevar voters. However, getting the votes of 22,000 Muslim voters living in Pettai and Tirunelveli Town areas for Mr. Paul Kannan is likely to be daunting task even though the AMMK has firmed up electoral alliance with Social Democratic Party of India. “Since the BJP has deployed its candidate (Mr. Nainar Nagenthran) in Tirunelveli, the Muslim voters will certainly back the DMK candidate, who has no bad name in the constituency despite the SDPI’s alliance with the AMMK,” says ‘Minnal’ Mohamed Ali, a MDMK functionary from Maanur. The SC voters may support Puthiya Thamizhagam candidate as the outfit founded by K. Krishnasamy has been forced to face the Assembly poll without any alliance after being shown the door by the AIADMK. Political analyst Surya Xavier says the PT had been silently moved out of the alliance without like the Chirag Paswan episode in Bihar. “Since the SC voters will never support the AIADMK, the PT has been moved out of this alliance. If Mr. Nagenthran faces the election as AIADMK candidate and without any ties with the BJP, he’d be the winner. Even though the constituency is favourable to the AIADMK, its alliance with the BJP plays the spoilsport and it will be advantage for DMK in Tirunelveli,” he says. Though this constituency, with 50% of voters in rural areas, is all set to go in for the 15th Assembly poll, some issues still remain unattended. Even as the existing narrow roads are in the worst shape after these stretches were dug for the Ariyanayagipuram Drinking Water Scheme, which is being executed to take the surface water from the check-dam at Ariyanayagipuram to the Tirunelveli Corporation, the long-pending demand for the execution of ring road to connect Thathanooththu on north of Tirunelveli with Ponnaakudi on the south of the town via the western parts of the town still gathering dust. Moreover, the plan to connect South Bypass Road in Palayamkottai and Abhishekapatti via the fields still remains only on paper. Consequently, Tirunelveli Town experiences the worst traffic snarls throughout the day. “The irrigation channels passing through this segment and the irrigation tanks should be desilted completely. Concrete lining should be provided in the channels while infrastructure should be created to check mixing up of sewage in the Tamirabharani water flowing through these channels,” says Mr. Mohamed Ali, also a fertilizer trader. The Kandigaiperi Hospital should be upgraded with more facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-long-wait-for-better-infrastructure/article34087995.ece

17 March 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Farmers in Kangeyam a disappointed lot||A slew of demands put forth by the farmers of Kangeyam Assembly constituency seem to remain unaddressed, following which they have now decided to file nominations to contest in the Assembly election. In January, a group of farmers went on a five-day hunger strike demanding adequate release of water to the Vellakoil branch canal within the constituency under the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project (PAP). Members of the PAP-Vellakoil Branch Canal Water Protection Committee, which comprises farmers from Kangeyam and Vellakoil blocks, alleged that water was not being released for irrigating agricultural lands in accordance with the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project (Regulation of Water Supply) Act, 1993. According to P. Velusamy, member of the Committee, the strike was called off after their representatives petitioned Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who assured them of action. Alleging that no action had been taken, he said the farmers resorted to file nominations en masse to contest from the Kangeyam constituency to garner attention. The farmers have also condemned the concrete lining of the Lower Bhavani Project canal that would impact farming in Kangeyam, Vellakoil and neighbouring locations, said A. Kalimuthu, president of Tamil Nadu Politically Unaffiliated Farmers Association. Noting that paddy, turmeric, sugarcane and moringa were some of the main crops cultivated in the region, he said that a long-pending demand of setting up a moringa research centre in Mulanur had not been fulfilled. With over 100 coconut oil extraction units and over 1,000 copra processing units that employs over one lakh workers, Kangeyam is home to a large coconut oil and copra industry. However, the imposition of one percent market committee cess on coconut and copra each has affected the farmers and businesspersons, according to N.S.N. Dhanapal, president of Kangeyam Coconut Oil Manufacturers Association. “We have petitioned the Chief Minister and he assured us of action,” he said. While Kangeyam is famous for its eponymous breed of cattle, the next government must take more steps to incentivise breeding of Kangeyam and other indigenous breeds by cattle farmers as opposed to imported breeds of cattle, said V. Sivakumar, trustee of Palayakottai Pattagar Cattle Farm and Research Centre. Steps must also be taken to regulate Kangeyam and other indigenous breeds from being sent for slaughter to prevent any further decline in their population, he said. Mr. Palaniswami announced during his election campaign that the State government would install a statue of the Kangeyam breed of bull in Kangeyam Municipality. However, no preparatory works had been carried out, said CPI (M) Kangeyam taluk secretary K. Thiruvengadasamy. Civic issues such as stagnation of sewage water, laying of roads and air pollution caused by stone crushing units had not been redressed despite multiple representations made to the municipal officials, he alleged. For the upcoming election, the DMK has fielded former Minister M.P. Saminathan, who will face the AIADMK’s A.S. Ramalingam in the Kangeyam constituency. The incumbent Kangeyam MLA, U. Thaniyarasu, founder of Tamil Nadu Kongu Ilaignar Peravai, was denied ticket by the AIADMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-in-kangeyam-a-disappointed-lot/article34087830.ece

17 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Action taken against 324 of over 1,200 illegal quarrying sites’||Minister for Mines and Geology Murugesh Nirani on Tuesday admitted that there was corruption in his department and said, “Wherever I go, people complain about having to pay bribes to department officials.” He told the Legislative Council that this was raised even during a mine owners’ association meeting. As per the government’s answer, there were over 1,200 illegal quarrying sites and action had been initiated against 324 owners. Two officials in Bagalkot have been kept under suspension following complaints, he added. He was speaking during a debate on the need for controlling illegal mining in the State in light of deaths due to explosions in Shivamogga and Chickballapur. “I have told them [people] to approach me if officials demand bribes. Despite this, if they give money what can I do?” he asked. Earlier, Opposition members, including Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil, had attacked the government over illegal quarrying and the two recent explosions at quarrying sites. The members asked why action was not being initiated against all illegal quarries. They also raised the issue of explosives being used without any regulation. Part of the problem, Mr. Nirani said, was that 40% of the department’s posts were lying vacant. “Mines officials, along with police and revenue officials, are part of the corruption. I am putting in my best efforts to curb corruption,” he said, adding that the current single-window system for issuing licence was not working properly. New policy   Stating that a new mining policy would be released for consultation in the next 15 days, the Minister expressed hope that it would become a model for the neighbouring States as well. “This will also plug the existing loopholes, besides addressing incidents of double taxation in terms of collection of royalty,” he said. Furthermore, he said, mining adalats would be held across four regions to address various problems. The government, the Minister said, was working towards a free sand policy in which sand would be allowed to be transported freely for government-tendered works. “This way, we can also work out the quantum of sand for calculating royalty,” he said. He added that the government was considering supplying sand free of cost to those building houses at a cost of less than Rs. 10 lakh in rural areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/action-taken-against-324-of-over-1200-illegal-quarrying-sites/article34087591.ece
17 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Average of 4.5 contacts per patient traced in the last week||With a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the State, the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has recommended that for every patient, 20 contacts need to be traced in districts where the positivity rate is above 1%. However, according to data provided by the Karnataka State COVID-19 war room on an average, not a single contact has been identified in 45.3% of the cases reported in the last week. The data also points out that on an average, for every patient in the State over the last week, 4.5 contacts have been traced. For a total of 5,868 patients who tested positive between March 8 and March 14, as many as 12,298 primary contacts and 13,995 secondary contacts were traced. According to the data, the best contact tracing has been done in Gadag, where for every patient, 50.9% contacts have been traced in the last week. Kodagu and Chamarajnagar are in the second and third spots, with 29.1% and 24.9%. In four districts – Haveri, Koppal, Raichur and Vijayapura, data shows that not even one contact of a patient has been traced. However, in many of these instances, the local administration may have traced the contacts and isolated them and even sent their samples for testing but may not have updated this on the app. Munish Moudgil, who is in charge of the State War Room, said the data was as per the entry done on the contact tracing app, and added that details have to be entered on the app as manual claims cannot be accepted. Giridhar R. Babu, member, TAC, said that the health workers were busy with testing and vaccination. “In addition, all other health services have resumed. It would be unreasonable to expect them to do contact tracing at this stage. It is advised that people from other wings of the BBMP get involved in contact tracing. This can be done by decentralised actions at the level of the urban primary health centre and in coordination with the other departments,” he said. He added that persons from other departments need to mobilised if required by the BBMP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/average-of-45-contacts-per-patient-traced-last-week/article34087467.ece

In a letter addressed to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the league accused the government of adopting delaying tactics on enhancing the salary of the employees as per the recommendation of the Sixth Pay Commission. The letter stated that when the employees went on a strike from December 11 to 14, 2020, the government had given a written assurance about fulfilling nine demands, including increasing salary, within three months, but had failed to do so. “Before the media, the corporations have made claims about fulfilling certain demands. We were not consulted prior to issuing the orders on certain demands. As our demands remain unfulfilled even after three months, we are going on an indefinite strike from April 7,” said Chandrshekar R., founder-State president of the league. The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, on the other hand, has been claiming that orders on implementing seven of the nine demands have been issued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rtc-employees-to-go-on-indefinite-strike-from-april-7/article34087468.ece

Minister for Mines and Geology Murugesh Nirani said on Tuesday that a large part of this was because of the unrealistic imposition of fines by officials. “A one-time settlement of these disputes is in the offing so that the State can realise at least Rs. 1,000 crore,” he said. He pointed out that officials have been so unrealistic that in one instance, a penalty of Rs. 80 crore was imposed on a miner quarrying in an area of one and a half acres. Mr. Nirani explained that officials were undertaking a drone survey on the volume of stone that has been mined to calculate the payment of royalty. While the normal is to recover 10% to 20%, officials were calculating 90%, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/huge-royalty-pending/article34087592.ece

In the Assembly, Congress member P.T. Parameshwar Naik’s decision not to ask a question to Minister for Planning K.C. Naranayana Gowda triggered a heated exchange between him and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai. Mr. Naik said the six Ministers had no moral right to continue in office as they had gone to court for a media gag order, following the alleged sex-for-job scandal involving Ramesh Jarkiholi. But Mr. Bommai defended the Ministers’ right to “protect their dignity”. Later in the day, Congress member Eshwar Khandre demanded that the government opt for a High Court-monitored probe into the CD scandal. In the Legislative Council, furore ensued when P.R. Ramesh refused to pose a question to Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekar.

Staging a demonstration in front of the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad, the protestors said that the government had banned ram fight citing a vague reason of an increase in COVID-19 cases, while it had allowed political programmes in which thousands of people were participating.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/revoke-ban-on-ram-fight-sri-ram-sene-urges-state-government/article34087463.ece
17 March 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Samiti seeks Rs. 8,000 a quintal as minimum support price for red gram||Members of Ikya Horata Samiti along with farmers staged a protest outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office here on Monday urging the State government to ensure that red gram was procured at a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs. 8,000 per quintal. They poured red gram over the main road bringing vehicular traffic to a standstill for some time as part of the dharna. The protestors, led by the former MLA B.R. Patil, accused the State government and the Centre of not taking steps to protect the interests of farmers. Accusing the Yediyurappa-led State government of refraining from paying incentives for red gram this year, Mr. Patil added that the then Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in the State had extended Rs. 450 as incentive for each quintal of red gram. Mr. Patil said that red gram growers were exploited by private traders because the district administration was hesitant in procuring red gram even after establishing procurement centres. He said last year around 11 lakh quintals of red gram had arrived in the market, but this year only five lakh quintals have come to the market as nearly 30 % of farmers have stocked harvested produce and are reluctant to sell it at a low price. Meanwhile, an argument erupted between the police and the agitators when the former asked the latter to withdraw the agitation. The police then detained more than 15 agitators only to release them later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/samiti-seeks-rs-8000-a-quintal-as-minimum-support-price-for-red-gram/article34087464.ece

17 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Border check-posts to come up in Dakshina Kannada by Monday||Check-posts at Talapady and 24 other places in Dakshina Kannada that borders Kasaragod in Kerala for checking COVID-19 negative certificates will become operational on Monday, said Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra. Talking to The Hindu , Dr. Rajendra said that the major check-post at Talapady will be manned by a taluk level team of officers while the other check-posts will be manned by the gram panchayats concerned. “These check-posts will be operational by Monday,” he said. The State government has made it mandatory for those entering Karnataka from Kerala and Maharashtra to carry COVID-19 negative certificates after RT-PCR test done 72 hours prior to their entry. Dr. Rajendra said that apart from checking COVID-19 negative certificates, personnel at these check-posts will maintain data of regular commuters between the two States. These regular commuters will be asked to submit COVID-19 negative certificate once every fortnight. The Health Department staff at the check-posts will carry out random testing of commuters, he said. First round of testing students from Kerala staying in hostels in the district has been completed and the second round will start shortly, he added. In a video conference with district officials on Monday, Dr. Rajendra said that except from roads that has the maximum movement between Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod district, other roads connecting the two districts will remain closed. All those entering the district have to show COVID-19 negative certificates, as Rapid Antigen Test reports will not be entertained, he said. While asking people to wear masks and maintain social distancing, Dr. Rajendra said that task forces have been formed at the village and taluk level to ensure compliance with COVID-19 safety protocol. RT-PCR testing has been increased to quickly find COVID-19 patients, Dr. Rajendra said and called upon people with fever and other COVID-19 symptoms to get their test done at nearby health facilities at the earliest. The village and taluk level task force personnel and health workers have been asked to reach out to senior citizens and those aged between 45 and 59 with co-morbidities and encourage them to undergo vaccination at the health facilities in their areas.

17 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Criminal cases, fines for refusal to follow protocol||While asking administrators of malls and shop owners to ensure wearing masks and maintenance of social distance, Udupi Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha on Tuesday said criminal cases will be booked and fine levied against violators of COVID-19 protocol . Talking to reporters after taking the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine at the District Hospital in in Udupi, Mr. Jagadeesha said the government has directed DCs to ensure strict compliance of protocol. In addition to fines, criminal cases will be registered for disobedience of orders passed by public servants, he said. “There is talk about a second wave. We have seen an increase in the numbers in Kerala and Maharasthra. Udupi district too is seeing rise in numbers. While the district used to record about six cases (last month), now it has increased to over 20. Similarly, the positivity rate also has increased to about 1.6. Precautionary measures are needed to avert danger,” he said. The guidelines should be strictly followed. Apart from wearing marks and maintaining social distance, guidelines on public functions should also be followed. “For the next two days, we will continue with the fines. Then we will start booking cases against violators. It is the responsibility of shop and mall owners to ensure that all their employees follow protocol. They should ensure that those entering their premises also wear a mask. Trade licenses will be cancelled if they fail to follow norms. A COVID-19 negative certificate following RT-PCR test done 72 hours before arrival is mandatory for those entering the district from Kerala and Maharashtra. He asked people to pass on information to authorities about persons failing to do so. The administration will subject such people to RT-PCR tests. While Udupi stands second in the State in terms of number of frontline and health workers getting vaccinated, the DC said with 17,000 senior citizens and those aged between 45 and 59 with comorbitities receiving the jab so far, the district stands sixth in this category. A village-wise list of senior citizens was prepared. Village-level COVID-19 task force members and health workers were asked to facilitate vaccination of all senior citizens in their areas.

17 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||CFR dips despite case surge||Notwithstanding the surge in COVID-19 cases in the State during the last few days, the case fatality rate (CFR) has dipped from 0.7% during the last 15 days to 0.3% during the last 5 days. Karnataka State COVID-19 War Room, while sharing the data from its performance review dated March 15, 2021, pointed out that a total of 5,868 cases had been reported in the last seven days across the State, while number of COVID-19 deaths during the period was 28. CFR here denotes the proportion of people dying from COVID-19 out of all the individuals testing positive during a certain period of time. While Bengaluru Urban accounted for the maximum 20 deaths during the seven-day period, Mysuru and Dharwad districts accounted for two deaths each. One person each had died Dakshina Kannada, Kalaburagi, Tumakuru and Bidar due to COVID-19, but as many as 23 districts in the State reported no deaths during the period. Positivity rate While a total of 4.92 lakh tests including 2.58 lakh in Bengaluru Urban were conducted across the State in the last seven days, the positivity rate stood at 1.1%. However, this varied from one district to another with Kalaburagi and Bidar showing a high rate of 1.8%, followed by Mysuru and Tumakuru with 1.6%, and Bengaluru Urban and Dakshina Kannada’s 1.3%. The lowest was reported from Haveri and Koppal, which had reported only 2 and 9 cases, respectively, in the last seven days. Meanwhile, amid the surge, the number of active cases in the State too had reached 8,860 on April 15 from a low of 5,501 on February 26. ICU numbers The media bulletin issued by Department of Health and Family Welfare did not show any corresponding rise in the number of active cases admitted to ICU. The number of active cases admitted to ICU had marginally risen from 118 on March 1 to 125 on March 15. But, Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Bengaluru, who is also a member of the Karnataka COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said the data needs to be looked at carefully in the backdrop of the discontinuation of government quota beds in private hospitals. “You will come to know of ICU admission only if the patients come to government hospitals,” he said. Pointing out that the number of people, particularly the elderly with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), seeking admission to ICU had increased in the last two weeks, Dr. Babu said some private hospitals were refusing admission for COVID-19 patients citing absence of isolation facilities. “Lack of evidence is not evidence of absence,” he said. Second wave Though there is no doubt that the cases had increased, a few more days of monitoring is necessary to conclude if it were a temporary variation or the actual beginning of a second wave. “We can’t deny a second wave. There is no dispute globally that there will be a second wave. It is only a matter of time,” Dr. Babu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cfr-dips-despite-case-surge/article34087584.ece

Though the polls were not held on party lines, the elections to the co-operative body were a proxy war between former Ministers G.T. Deve Gowda and S.R. Mahesh, both JD(S) MLAs, whose followers were in the race for the posts of 15 directors of MYMUL. Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy too had campaigned for candidates supported by Mr. Mahesh.

He was speaking to reporters in the mutt during the 400th Patthabhishekham of Sri Raghavendra Swamy on Monday. “The statue will be installed on 3.2 acres of area, which has been marked for the purpose. Sculptor Krishnamurthy and his team will carve the statue and install it in Mantralayam before the Sri Ram statue is inaugurated at Ayodhya. The entire area will be developed with a garden. Visitors can have the darshan of Sri Ram after paying obeisance to Anjaneya,” the swamiji said.

(Bescom) and Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will evolve a scheme to permit installation of electricity transformers on footpath without compromising the safety of pedestrians. Also, the court directed the Managing Director of Bescom to file an affidavit on whether it can install transformers on footpaths without consent or approval of the BBMP. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the order on a PIL petition by G.B. Athri, a retired Wing Commander of the Indian Air Force. During an earlier hearing, it was contended on behalf of Bescom that at present it was not required to take permission from BBMP to install transformers on footpaths as the State government has not framed rules under provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. However, the bench, from the terms and conditions of licence granted to Bescom pointed out that it has to follow provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, which state that immovable property vested in or under the control or management of any local authority cannot be used without permission from that authority. The bench said that it would, based on the contention to be taken by Bescom’s MD, consider interpreting provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act and the Electricity Act to find out whether Bescom is required to take consent or permission from BBMP for installing transformers on footpaths. The High Court of Karnataka clarified that the question is not issue of removal of transformers from footpaths but whether transformers can be installed at a height of 6-7 feet on a footpath without consent from the local authority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fix-transformer-on-footpath-without-compromising-safety/article34087790.ece
17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Mysuru gets new daily test target after fresh scare||Amidst fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections, Mysuru has been given the target of carrying out nearly 7,000 swab tests daily. As of now, 4,500 tests using the RT-PCR method were being done across the district. Since the last two days, the testing has been scaled up by about 1,000 but reaching the target of 7,000 is a challenge considering the response from the public. About 3,000 RT-PCR tests of swab samples are done at the Microbiology Lab of the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) and about 1,500 tests at the facility run by the CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI). Mysuru city alone has about 10 mobile teams for the collection of swabs besides 10 static swab collection centres. Half-a-dozen mobile teams also function in the district. Sources in the MMCRI told The Hindu that the contract of data entry operators of its lab who update the test results was expiring this month. Unless their contract was renewed or new operators were taken for the task, it would become difficult to meet the testing target. As on Monday, 9,11,451 people had been tested in Mysuru district. This includes 8,39,072 tested in government labs and 72,379 in private labs. A total of 54,491 had been tested positive since the outbreak and 53,228 had been discharged as on Monday. The active stands at 226 until Monday with total deaths reported include 1,037.  Task for health workers Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and anganwadi workers in K.R. Pet and Nagamangala taluks in Mandya district have been assigned a new task – to alert the health authorities on coming across new persons in the households – as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19 since many from these two taluks work in Maharashtra, which has reported a spike in cases triggering the scare of a second wave of infection. These two taluks had reported the highest number of cases last year as many locals returned to their respective villages from the neighbouring State following the lockdown and for other reasons. Alternative routes Though the checkposts put up on the Karnataka-Maharashtra border in Belagavi district screen the people entering the State besides checking the COVID-19 negative reports, it had come to light that people used alternative routes to enter the State in their own mode of transport during the outbreak last year to dodge screening and quarantine rules. “As of now, the situation is normal with two to three cases per day being reported locally in the two taluks. In case of a spurt in infection, as discussed with the deputy commissioner earlier, we may have to consider putting up checkposts in the taluk borders to screen and test returnees. Presently, instructions had been given to keep an eye on the returnees and persuade them to undergo RT-PCR tests if they haven’t done it while returning to their homes from Maharashtra,” said Mandya DHO Manche Gowda. Many from K.R. Pet and Nagamangala taluks work in Maharashtra in various professions. After the lockdown curbs were lifted and the situation returned to normal with drop in cases, people from the two taluks returned to their respective professions. Now, with a fresh spurt in cases and growing threat of lockdown once again in the neighbouring State, there are possibilities of the return of the residents to Karnataka.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-gets-new-daily-test-target-after-fresh-scare/article34087581.ece

The police seized electronic devices and several SIM cards from him. According to the police, the accused, Ashraf Unichiravittal from Calicut, Kerala, was a roadside tea vendor in Chikkabanavara, but he had the technical expertise to set up the illegal telephone exchange to convert international calls into local calls using SIM cards. He would buy several SIM cards and used electronic devices to bypass routers and cheat telecom companies. His clients would pay a meagre amount to make international calls, said the police who suspect that many of them could have used this service for anti-social activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ccb-busts-illegal-telephone-exchange/article34087788.ece
17 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Can the Left fill the vacuum left by heavyweights?||As the cradle of the Communist movement in the State, elections in Alappuzha are always a matter of prestige for the Communist parties. From the first-ever Assembly polls of 1957 to the 2016 elections, Communist parties [back in 1957 and 1960 there was only Communist Party of India (CPI)] had fielded one or more big names in each of the Assembly polls in Alappuzha district. In 1957, it gave the ticket to T.V. Thomas and T.K. Varghese Vaidyan, the latter was one of the founding leaders of the Communist Party of India in Kerala. That election also saw the birth of a future heavyweight — K.R. Gouri who won from Cherthala. Since then, Ms. Gouri went on to contest in every single Assembly poll — on the CPI ticket in 1960 and as a Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] candidate thereafter — until she was expelled from the CPI(M) in 1994. In the 1965 election, the split in the CPI saw the introduction of V.S. Achuthanandan and Susheela Gopalan as CPI(M) candidates. Mr. Achuthanandan soon joined Ms. Gouri as a household name after contesting in three consecutive elections in 1967, 1970 and 1977. When P.K. Vasudevan Nair of the CPI became Chief Minister in 1978, he was an MLA representing the Alappuzha constituency. Some of these names along with Rosamma Punnoose and C.K. Chandrappan, both CPI, featured in 1980, 1982, 1987, and 1991 polls. Second generation However, after Ms. Gouri formed the Janadhipathya Samrakshana Samithi and Mr. Achuthanandan was defeated in Mararikulam in 1996, the big-name mantle was handed over to G. Sudhakaran and T.M. Thomas Isaac. The duo was joined by P. Thilothaman of the CPI, who won from Cherthala in 2006, 2011 and 2016. In 2021 Assembly polls, the Left Democratic Front, especially the CPI(M), is on the cusp of another generational shift in the district with no big names contesting this time around. This is at a time when the Left is about to observe the 75th anniversary of the Punnapra-Vayalar uprising later this year.While deciding not to field both Mr. Sudhakaran and Dr. Isaac, both four-time MLAs, the CPI(M) has given the tickets to only two sitting MLAs, Saji Cherian (Chengannur) and U. Prathibha (Kayamkulam). The party has fielded Alappuzha district panchayat vice president Daleema Jojo (Aroor), P.P. Chitharanjan (Alappuzha), H. Salam (Ambalappuzha) and M.S. Arun Kumar (Mavelikara). With Mr. Thilothaman too not in the fray, it is now up for a new batch to carry the Left mantle in the district. However, the question that is looming large is whether the LDF will be able to repeat the performance of the 2016 elections when it won eight of the nine seats in the district. Although there are a few rumblings in the CPI (M) over the names, party leaders remain confident of a good show in the elections. “When Ms. Gouri contested the polls in 1957, she was practising in a Cherthala court. She was not in active politics. She became a heavyweight later. Our attempt is to bring fresh faces and give opportunities to all. Let new ideas and thoughts emerge,” says C.B. Chandrababu, State committee member, CPI(M). As communist parties are looking to groom the next generation of leaders, it should also be noted that stalwarts like Ms. Gouri and Mr. Achuthanandan and so on had tasted defeats in communist strongholds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/can-the-left-fill-the-vacuum-left-by-heavyweights/article34087538.ece

17 March 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Wayanad bird survey finds 166 species||A comprehensive bird survey conducted jointly by the State Forest Department and the Hume Centre for Ecology and Wildlife Biology on the mountain ranges of the South Wayanad Forest Division recorded 166 species of birds, including 13 species endemic to the Western Ghats and two globally threatened species. The survey, conducted after almost 15 years, recorded, for the first time, the nesting of Asian brown flycatcher, a migratory bird from central India found breeding in the shola forests of Camel’s Hump mountain complex. Usually, the bird arrived in the Western Ghats during October for wintering, returned by the end of April and bred in northern India, said Hume Centre director C.K. Vishnudas. As many as 40 bird enthusiasts from across the State participated in the survey. A similar survey was conducted in the region in 2007, said Mr. Vishnudas. The survey covered most mountain tops on the Western Ghats, including Kurichyarmala, Vannathimala, Ambmala, Mandamala, Lakkidi, Kargil, Chembramala, Vellarimala, Aranamala, Thollayiram, and Kattippara. It recorded 15 species of raptors, including rufous-bellied eagle, white-eyed buzzard and Bonelli’s eagle. Besides 11 species of flycatchers, the survey also recorded seven species of woodpeckers, seven species of owls, six species of bulbuls and eight species of babblers. Rare bird sightings include long-billed Pipit from Chembra and bright-headed cisticola from Kurichyarmala and Chembra. Banasura Chilappan ( Montecincla jerdoni ), an endangered forest bird, was spotted in good numbers from the shola forests above 1,800-m elevation in the Camel’s Hump mountains. The global distribution of the species is limited to the three mountain ranges of Wayanad, and that too in an area less than 50 sq. km. The endemic birds recorded include grey-headed bulbul, Malabar grey hornbill, Nilgiri wood pigeon, white-bellied treepie, flame-throated bulbul, white-bellied blue flycatcher, black and orange flycatcher, crimson-backed sunbird and Malabar barbet. As many as 14 species of migratory birds were found. The survey was coordinated by Rathish R.L. and Shahil of the Hume Centre, and supervised by South Wayanad Divisional Forest Officer P. Ranjith Kumar. “Considering the small range of habitat of the Banasura Chilappan, the Camel’s Hump mountain ranges should be elevated to a national park status to protect the remaining habitat of one of the rarest birds of India,” said Mr. Vishnudas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wayanad-bird-survey-finds-166-species/article34087485.ece

Sudhakaran has said he has lost all ‘hope and confidence’ after the announcement of the list of party candidates. Speaking to the media here on Tuesday, Mr. Sudhakaran said the Congress high command was misled by leaders of Kerala. Mr. Sudhakaran said he did not want rhetorical positions and said that he was not willing to continue as KPCC working president. Responding to the outburst of Congress workers in Irikkur against the candidature of Sajeev Joseph, he said the understanding within the party here was violated. Even the Mattannur seat was given to the Revolutionary Socialist Party without consulting the leaders of Kannur, he said, adding this would weaken the Congress in the district. Stating that a committee comprising Oommen Chandy, Ramesh Chennithala, and K.C. Venugopal had chosen the Congress candidates, he said many were not given a chance regardless of their chances of victory. Their views were not considered, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/k-sudhakaran-lost-all-hope-and-confidence/article34087558.ece
17 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Crackdown on water theft||With severe drinking water scarcity in parts of Ernakulam, the anti-theft squad of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has been cracking the whip on illegal connections, misuse and theft. Between February 1 and February 15, the squad detected 29 cases and imposed a total amount of Rs. 5,43,743 as fine. A single desperate consumer near Angamaly was fined a whopping Rs. 2,33,000. In a rare instance, the individual had drawn water from an air valve attached to the distribution network and extended the pipeline for irrigating his agricultural land nearby, said Ajish V.C., assistant executive engineer in-charge of the anti-theft squad. Having destroyed the air valve, the enterprising farmer had been consuming water this way for nearly a year, according to local residents, and was fined with rates fixed for commercial purposes taking an average consumption of 15,000 litres per day, with extra charges for replacing the defunct air valve. The four-member squad covers the KWA central region comprising Ernakulam, Thrissur, Idukki and Alappuzha, and usually relies on tip-offs from the public. In parts of Fort Kochi, Thammanam, Chellanam, Njarakkal and Vypeen, residents were found to have connected a hose to public taps to transfer water to their tanks, altogether bypassing the need to pay for a water connection. A total of 22 such cases were recently detected. Two people were also fined for having set up an illegal connection to draw water for construction purposes for about a month. In some cases, residents have resorted to hiring a plumber and getting a pipeline drawn parallel to the existing one to avoid the meter, consequently registering a lower meter reading. A hotel in the city was found to be using a residential connection and paying a residential tariff but using the water for commercial purposes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crackdown-on-water-theft/article34087888.ece
17 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Seafood exporters seek measures to tide over crisis||From the rising diesel price to shrinking supply of local raw materials for processing are hurting the seafood export industry in Kerala, which directly and indirectly employs thousands of people and earns around Rs. 6,500 crore annually in exports. Another round of elections to the State Assembly is an opportunity to think of the negative and positive developments in the past that have affected the industry, the fortunes of which depend largely on wild catch now as well as imports from neighbouring States. The industry suffered major setbacks in the year of the COVID-19 pandemic during which operations came to a standstill, fishing harbours closed and movement of workers was totally banned. The labour strike at the Colombo port as well as scarcity of containers in the later half of 2020 further affected the fortunes of the seafood export industry. The COVID-19 lockdown in March last and subsequent restrictions saw fishing operations being curtailed extensively till the middle of August. The shortage of raw materials forced some processors in Kerala to shift their operations to Andhra Pradesh. The industry now wants the government coming to power after the election to help it tide over problems such as the high price of diesel, which has made fishing expeditions too costly. This is a major problem facing the industry now, said Alex Ninan of Seafood Exporters’ Association, Kerala. He said that the cost of diesel affected fishing activities and considerably reduced the availability of raw materials. He said that the government should look into the possibility of exploiting the thousands of hectares of water space available for aquaculture in the State. A rough estimate is that around 60,000 hectares are available and if the area can be utilised it will give a big boost to raw material availability. If areas that have been lying idle for 10 years or more can be pressed into aquaculture, it will make a big difference, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/seafood-exporters-seek-measures-to-tide-over-crisis/article34087890.ece
17 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Water, power integral part of right to life, says HC||Holding that electricity connection is an integral part of the right to life, the Kerala High Court has said that it is the statutory duty of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) to supply electricity within one month after receipt of an application for power connection. Justice Murali Purushothaman, dismissing a petition by two KSEB engineers, observed on Tuesday, “Water and electricity are an integral part of the right to life within the meaning of Article 21 of the Constitution. Section 43 of the Electricity Act provides that there is a statutory duty on the distribution licensee to provide electric connection to the applicants within one month after receipt of the application requiring such supply. The KSEB is the sole distribution licensee for electricity within the State and therefore the board and its officials shall make every endeavour to provide electricity supply to applicants without any delay.” The petition The court’s observations came on a petition filed by K. N. Raveendranadhan, assistant executive engineer, and K. Keeran, assistant engineer, KSEB, challenging the order of the Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) imposing a fine of Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 25,000 respectively for not giving electricity connection to P. Sainuddeen of Malappuram. The court observed that to light up a bulb in his tiny house, Sainuddeen had to run from pillar to post. An order of the KSEB’s Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum (CGRF) in his favour could not dispel the darkness at his home and the KSERC imposed fine on the two officers for the delay in giving electricity connection. Sainuddeen had applied for electric connection to his newly built house before the assistant engineer, electric section, Edarikkode, on May 20, 2013. But it was rejected by the petitioners citing that the house was constructed without keeping the minimum distance from the low tension electric line and that only after shifting the electric line, electric connection could be given. Despite the directive of the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum and Electricity Ombudsman, the KSEB engineers had delayed implementation of the directive to provide connection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-power-integral-part-of-right-to-life/article34087486.ece

This year, the district has recorded 166 suspected and 107 confirmed cases of the disease so far. The recent increase in cases could be attributed to improved reporting of cases, according to Dr. Vinod Paulose, District Surveillance Officer for non-COVID diseases. “We have strengthened surveillance in private hospitals to ensure that the first case in an area is detected early and health and local body officials, and residents in the area can be alerted to prevent further breeding of mosquitoes.

Apart from enforcing green protocol during meetings, house visits and receptions, the committee will also make sure that COVID-19 guidelines are followed, sources said. Wall graffiti will be promoted and party leaders and campaign coordinators will be asked to opt for environment-friendly methods. While the use of disposables and indiscriminate garbage dumping will not be allowed, the officials will visit party offices and booths to check if they are functioning in adherence to the protocol. Measures will be taken to ensure that there are no violations during ‘kalashakottu’ and all campaign material will be handed over to the Haritha Karma Sena or other agencies for recycling under the supervision of committees. Resource persons The resource persons of the Haritha-Suchitwa Missions will be organising various events and competitions to spread awareness about waste processing and the importance of green protocol. Bottled water will not be allowed in polling stations and only reusable glasses and food containers will be permitted.

Mr. Chandy, accompanied by District Congress Committee president Joshy Philip, reached the Pambady block office and submitted three sets of papers before the assistant returning officer. The upcoming election marks the 12th consecutive fight of Mr.Chandy from Puthuppally to the Assembly. According to an affidavit by Mr. Chandy, three criminal cases, including a cheating case, are pending against him. The candidate has a cash of Rs. 1,000 in hand while his spouse Mariamma Oommen and son Chandy Oommen posses Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 7,500 respectively.

17 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Joseph group in a bind||With the Supreme Court upholding the Kerala High Court’s confirmation of an Election Commission order allotting the title and election symbol of the Kerala Congress (M) to the faction led by Jose K. Mani, the rival group led by P.J. Joseph appears to have come under immense pressure ahead of the coming Assembly election. According to sources, the Joseph group has now become a collective of politicians without a valid registration by the Election Commission of India and this, in turn, will force the candidates fielded by it to contest as Independents under different election symbols. “Its candidates will not be able to submit nominations with endorsement from the party and, hence, are not entitled to the same election symbol. The group may now request the support of any smaller outfit to stake claim for a uniform symbol, but it is a risky option,” they said. Despite the setback, the faction, however, remains confident of resolving the issue in a couple of days though it is yet to reveal the plan of action. “There will be no trouble as far as the UDF is concerned as we have already taken steps to ensure the same symbol for all our 10 candidates,” said a senior leader with the Joseph faction. Meanwhile, none of the ten candidates to be fielded by the Joseph group has submitted their papers as they are apparently awaiting a solution to tide over the crisis. During the local body elections last year, the candidates fielded by the party had contested under the election symbol of ‘drum’. As the Kerala High Court had earlier stayed the Election Commission’s order in favour of Mr. Mani in November 2020, the State Election Commission allotted special symbols for both factions in the local body polls. But with the High Court revoking the stay later, the SEC reallocated the name and reserved symbol of the KC(M) to the faction led by Mr. Mani. The possession of ‘two leaves’, a party symbol supposed to have an emotional connect with voters of central Travancore, assumes significance as the Assembly election also involves a direct confrontation between the Mani and Joseph groups in four seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/joseph-group-in-a-bind/article34087563.ece
17 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||‘Implement plantation policy without delay’||The progressive decline in productivity coupled with soaring wages and low prices for produce has brought the century-old plantation sector in Kerala to its knees. Struggling to cope with the situation, it now pins its hopes on the next government to marshal its focus on bringing the financial health of these plantations back to normalcy and act decisively. According to Ajith B.K., secretary, Association of Plantations of Kerala, an umbrella organisation of planters of tea, rubber, cardamom and coffee, there is an urgent need for the next government to implement the proposed plantation policy that envisages multi-cropping and inter-cropping without changing the basic structure of these plantations. Unless and until the government brought out changes in the Acts and rules concerning the sector, this would remain a task unaccomplished, he says. “The recommendations made by the Krishnan Nair Commission such as abolition of plantation tax, seniorage on felled rubber trees and moratorium on the agricultural income tax are yet to become a reality. The plantations in Kerala still remain a high-cost sector compared to its counterparts elsewhere in the country and this issue can be addressed only by implementing the plantation policy,” says Mr. Ajith. Eco zone notification Another key area that the new government should focus on will be the Central government’s draft notification on eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) that may cripple the sector. “The draft, which envisages inclusion of cultivated lands and even human habitations in the ESZ, will make the basic operation of the plantations practically impossible as the Forest Department will invariably come up with unnecessary regulations,” he says. At the same time, the government may take proactive steps in leveraging the agro-forestry schemes rolled out by the Central government as the plantations provide the perfect avenue for growing valuable timber. ‘Centre apathetic’ Pius Scaria Pottankulam, rubber grower and trader in Kottayam, says the successive State governments have done their maximum to protect the natural rubber plantation sector from the vagaries of globalisation. The Union government had completely ignored the rubber plantations of Kerala and it is incumbent on the new State government to show the political will to resist this trend, besides coming up with new initiatives. “The proposed Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL)-model rubber industry park is a welcome initiative, but prior to launching the venture, the government should rope in experts to ensure the cost viability of products coming out of it so that it ensures competition at a global level,” he says. Job scheme Mr. Pottankulam also proposes that the new government make efforts to include rubber tapping in the scope of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to overcome the acute labour shortage faced by the sector, while also bringing down the wage component. “The inclusion of rubber tapping in the employment guarantee programme, coupled with initiatives to mechanise the tapping process will help the beleaguered planters, especially those having fragmented holdings, to continue with rubber for some more time,” he observes.  Rubber industry park is a welcome initiative, but steps needed to ensure cost viability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/implement-plantation-policy-without-delay/article34087539.ece

Meetings should not be held without prior permission and only at places designated. If required, more spaces would be identified for the purpose. Seats should be spaced well, while masks, sanitisers and thermal scanners should be available at the venues. Holding meetings without prior permission is a criminal offence and will be dealt with by the police.

The most talked-about of them all is K. Muraleedharan, Vadakara MP, who has been picked by the Congress to contest in the Nemom seat in Thiruvananthapuram, now held by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr. Muraleedharan had won from the nearby Vattiyurkavu segment both in 2011 and 2016. However, his party chose to pack him off to the Vadakara Lok Sabha seat in 2019 to give a tough fight to CPI(M) nominee P. Jayarajan. Mr. Muraleedharan won with a resounding margin. Again, he is going back to the capital city to reclaim the lone Assembly seat of the BJP in the State. M.V. Shreyams Kumar (Kalpetta) of the Loktantrik Janata Dal and Suresh Gopi (Thrissur) and K.J. Alphons (Kanjirappally) of the BJP are serving members of the Rajya Sabha who are contesting the Assembly polls. Mr. Shreyams Kumar had been an MLA from Kalpetta twice. Mr. Alphons had represented Kanjirappally once as an LDF Independent. There are some other MPs who relinquished their posts recently to come back to the State politics. P.K. Kunhalikutty of the Indian Union Muslim League had represented the Malappuram Lok Sabha seat since 2017. He had resigned from the post of Vengara MLA to contest a bypoll then and was re-elected in 2019. Less than two years later, he quit his position and is now contesting from Vengara again. Jose K. Mani, who was chosen as a Rajya Sabha MP in 2018, recently resigned to contest from the Pala Assembly seat. There are some former MPs too in the poll fray this time. Prominent among them is M.B. Rajesh of the CPI(M), who was Palakkad MP twice, but was defeated by a slender margin in 2019. Mr. Rajesh has been fielded in the Thrithala seat in Palakkad against incumbent MLA V.T. Balram. Others on the list are veteran Congress leader N. Peethambara Kurup, who represented Kollam in the Lok Sabha once, and K.S. Manoj, who won as an Left Independent candidate from Alappuzha once. Mr. Kurup is now contesting from Chathannur. After he switched his loyalty to the Congress, Dr. Manoj is contesting in Alappuzha. MLAs too The State had also seen serving MLAs being paraded in the Lok Sabha polls. K. Sudhakaran (Kannur), Mr. Muraleedharan (Vadakara), Hibi Eden (Ernakulam), and Adoor Prakash (Attingal) were the Congress MLAs who tried their luck in 2019 and won. Left Democratic Front MLAs A. Pradeep Kumar (Kozhikode), P.V. Anwar (Ponnani), A.M. Ariff (Alappuzha), Chittayam Gopakumar (Mavelikara), Veena George (Pathanamthitta), and C. Divakaran (Thiruvananthapuram) too contested the polls, but only Mr. Ariff won.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-parties-bank-on-serving-and-former-mps/article34087545.ece

The decision of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) to offer Elathur and Perambra to the Nationalist Congress Kerala (NCK) and the Indian Union Muslim League respectively has led to a rebellion in the Congress in the district. Protest in the open Elathur has become a political hot potato for the Congress State leadership. Party workers have come out publicly against the leadership’s decision to offer the seat to the NCK. The NCK has already announced its candidate - Sulfikkar Mayuri - in the segment. In protest, several office-bearers of block and mandalam committees and the president of the Mahila Congress district unit have submitted their resignation. More leaders are planning to follow suit. Claim support of allies The dissident leaders pointed out that its allies, including the IUML and a splinter group of the Janata Dal, were also supporting their demand that the Congress should contest the seat. Protests meetings were held at Thalakulathoor. Meanwhile, backing the demand of the dissidents, Kozhikode MP M.K. Raghavan said the Congress leadership would hold discussions with the NCK to settle the issue. “Certainly, the Congress should nominate its candidate in Elathur. Already the workers have said they would not work for the NCK nominee,” Mr. Raghavan, who wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to take back the Elathur seat, said. Regarding Perambra, Mr. Raghavan, also a member on the election committee, said the IUML would decide on a candidate possibly on Wednesday. The Janata Dal (United), now known as Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), had unsuccessfully contested from Elathur and the Kerala Congress(M) from Perambra. District Congress Commitee president U. Rajeevan said the central leadership would have to take a decision on Elathur and Perambra.

Rema of the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) in the Vadakara Assembly constituency in the coming Assembly election. Uncertainty over the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate in the segment ended on Tuesday with the RMP declaring that Ms. Rema, wife of the slain party founder T.P. Chandrasekharan, will be its nominee backed by the former. It was RMP State secretary N. Venu who announced the decision at a press conference in the afternoon. The RMP had earlier thought of nominating Mr. Venu for the polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rema-is-udf-candidate-in-vadakara/article34087555.ece
17 March 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||LDF brings back showstopper to breach Muslim League citadel||The Left Democratic Front changed its candidate in Tirurangadi with the objective of exploiting the displeasure brewing among a section in the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) over K.P.A. Majeed’s candidacy there. The CPI’s official candidate Ajith Kolady had already begun electioneering in Tirurangadi for the LDF when a section within the IUML raised a banner of protest against Mr. Majeed. Making a calculated move, the LDF replaced Mr. Kolady with an Independent candidate, Niyas Pulikkalakath. Currently the chairman of the Kerala Small Industries Development Corporation (SIDCO), Mr. Pulikkalakath had proved himself to be a showstopper against IUML’s incumbent P.K. Abdu Rabb in 2016. He had given jitters to Mr. Rabb in the IUML citadel when he narrowed down the latter’s lead to 6,043 from 30,208 in the 2011 Assembly elections. Mr. Majeed has never been a preferred choice of the IUML in Tirurangadi. Even when expressing no personal animosity towards him, party workers in Tirurangadi they did not want him. Although he had represented Mankada five times in the Assembly in 1980, 1982, 1987, 1991 and 1996, the two big losses he suffered in 2001 (Mankada) and 2004 (Manjeri) had cast shadow on his political image.  The ghost of Mankada-Manjeri debacles still remain in the minds of the people, though they harbour no ill-will towards Mr. Majeed. “That’s exactly the reason for people turning their back on Mr. Majeed. But as it is a crucial Assembly election, most IUML workers are aware of the importance of not losing a party seat,” said Mohammed Mustafah, an IUML worker from Tirurangadi. The IUML leadership is confident in Tirurangadi. Unlike the situation in 2016, the UDF appears well set and intact. In the 2019 Ponnani Lok Sabha election, the UDF had gained 46,984 votes lead in the Tirurangadi Assembly segment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-brings-showstopper-to-breach-iuml-citadel/article34087487.ece

17 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Nemom buzz hits fever pitch||Campaigning for the Assembly elections in the Nemom constituency has hit a fever pitch, with all the three fronts now commencing their work on the ground. United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate K. Muraleedharan arrived for the first time in the constituency on Tuesday evening, after the announcement of his candidature on Sunday following weeks of intense speculation. Though Mr. Muraleedharan arrived over two hours after the scheduled time due to a delayed flight, a large number of Congress workers waited patiently to accord him a rousing welcome at the Jagathy bridge, one of the boundaries of the Nemom constituency. Flags of all the constituent parties of the UDF were on display as he was led to Karamana on an open four-wheeler, with party workers jostling to get close to him. Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate V. Sivankutty, who had begun his campaign much earlier, also ratcheted up the mood on Tuesday with a roadshow that covered several areas coming within the key constituency. A sea of red flags and confetti shower welcomed him at some of the major points along the way as he travelled on an open four-wheeler, with party workers following in two-wheelers and cars. Mr. Sivankutty is set to submit his nomination papers on Wednesday, after which he will address a series of ward conventions in various parts of the constituency throughout the day. Outreach efforts The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Kummanam Rajasekharan, who kicked off his campaign two days ago, spent the earlier part of the day attending family meetings. He later visited some temples in the constituency where pongala festival was on. Mr. Rajasekharan also met community leaders as part of outreach efforts. In the evening, the BJP’s mandalam committee office was inaugurated, during which he accepted contributions from some residents of the Kottoor tribal settlement for his election deposit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nemom-buzz-hits-fever-pitch/article34087988.ece

The move comes against the backdrop of a high-level meeting chaired by Forest Minister K. Raju in Pazhayakunnummel a day ago to allay the concerns of the local populace. While three cameras were installed a few days ago, three more have been installed in the region, said Palode forest range officer B. Ajith Kumar. He said that four squads have also been tasked with ensuring round-the-clock surveillance in the region. Two cages were also kept in Kilimanoor and Pulimath from where the forest officials had received reports of the sightings. Despite the claims, the department is yet to confirm whether the animal on the prowl is a leopard. Official sources suspected the possibility of a wild dog having devoured two goats and a turkey, sparking panic in the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/leopard-sighting-surveillance-stepped-up-in-kilimanoor/article34087983.ece

The party, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will transform the State, he said. Mr. Deb, who was in the district to campaign for the BJP for the Assembly elections, was speaking at a press conference here on Tuesday morning. “The people of Kerala should stop electing the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) alternately as the State had not benefited from their rule. Both the LDF and the UDF are corrupt. This is an opportunity to keep out of power the two fronts and to elect the BJP,” he said. Citing Tripura, Mr. Deb said the BJP had gone from a negligible presence there to forming the government, bringing to an end 25 years of continuous Left rule. The people of Tripura knew that both the communists and the Congress were in cahoots with each other. The moment they got a commitment from the BJP, they voted for change.  Tripura had also made good progress in implementing Central schemes and in areas such as digitisation, he said, adding that his State was a development model for Kerala, courtesy the vision of Mr. Modi and implementation of Central schemes in a time-bound manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-will-transform-kerala-biplab-deb/article34087565.ece

17 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||‘Livelihood, growth issues to decide results’||Communist Party of India State secretary Kanam Rajendran says factional feuding is the engine that powers the Congress. The current bout of bitter infighting in the party is nothing new. Mr. Rajendran spoke to The Hindu on Tuesday about the Assembly election campaign and the forces that could shape the result. The Congress has given outsize importance to the electoral battle in the Nemom constituency to show that the United Democratic Front is seriously opposed to the BJP. In actuality, the BJP and the Congress are in cahoots in Kerala. The ideological line between them is very thin. The Congress toes a soft Hindutva line. Its economic agenda is congruent to that of the BJP. “If K. Muralidheeran garners the majority of the Congress votes that gravitated towards the BJP in 2016 in Nemom, then the LDF would coast to victory there,” he says. Sabarimala issue Sabarimala is a non-issue now. The Supreme Court is reviewing seven questions related to its majority decision in 2018 to allow women of all age groups to worship at the Ayyappa temple. It has set aside the NSS prayer for not allowing women in the 10-50 age group. The NSS should honour the court verdict instead of blaming the government. Mr. Rajendran says the LDF’s decisive victory in the local body elections has demonstrated that livelihood issues and development aspirations matter most to the electorate. An LDF win would also be a political message against the Centre’s infringement on federalism and its bid to cripple non-BJP-ruled States economically and politically. Such an outcome could also pave the way for a secular and more federal alternative to the BJP at the Centre.  Congress has given outsize importance to the electoral battle in Nemom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/livelihood-growth-issues-to-decide-results/article34087541.ece

17 March 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Report: fraudulent means adopted to take over assigned lands in Amaravati||A report by an investigative agency said that 2,353.28 acres of assigned lands, mostly in the riverfront villages in the Amaravati area, given to the ex-servicemen and political sufferers on or after 1954, were allegedly taken over by those in the TDP “through registered or unregistered agreements” after making them believe that the government would re-assume the lands without giving them any benefits, or through sheer intimidation. Based on a complaint by Mangalagiri MLA Alla Rama Krishna Reddy, the AP CID had booked cases against former Chief Minister and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu and former Municipal Administration Minister P. Narayana under IPC Sections 166, 167, 217, 120-B r/w 34, 35, 36, and 37, and Section (3) (1), (f), (g) of SC/ST POA Act, 1989, and Section 7 of the A.P. Assigned Lands (POT) Act, 1977. They were asked to appear before the CID Regional Office in Vijayawada on March 23. ‘Legally unsustainable’ The report stated that the TDP government had framed the Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) rules allegedly without amending the provisions contained under Rule 3 of the AP Assigned Lands (POT) Act, or the provisions under the SC/ST (POA) Act, 1989 (Section 3 (1V) and (V), by virtue of which the exercise vis-a-vis assigned lands and SC/ST lands appeared to be legally unsustainable. The report also said that ineligible persons allegedly in occupation of assigned lands were made eligible to get the benefits of the LPS through illegal GOs. The original assigned land-holders were thus deprived of their rights in a systematic manner, the report alleged. The TDP government had adopted the LPS to acquire more than 33,000 acres of farm land. Those owning dry lands were given a residential plot of 500 square yards and 250 square yards of commercial land, while those owning fertile wetlands were given a residential plot of 1,000 square yards and 250 square yards of commercial land. After coming to power, the YSRCP government had constituted a Special Investigative Team (SIT) to probe the “irregularities in the LPS, choosing of the Capital area, and defining the boundaries of the CRDA,” which allegedly benefited a select group of people. The report also alleged that persons who were aware of the likely location of the Capital had purchased lands in the Capital city / region prior to the formal official declaration. It also alleged that certain highly placed individuals had procured lands through benami transactions, and that the boundaries of the Capital region had been defined to benefit certain people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/report-fraudulent-means-adopted-to-take-over-assigned-lands-in-amaravati/article34087938.ece

Calling upon them to complete the construction of Rythu Bharosa Kendras by May, he said that they should also focus on YSR Health Clinics. “Bulk milk cooling units will bring in revolutionary changes in the rural areas,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said, and asked the District Collectors to ensure the setting up of the units by the end of this month. He also asked them to complete CC roads and drains under the NREGS. He further asked the Collectors to complete the process of handing over house sites, and instructed them to ensure that the new beneficiaries were handed over the sites within 90 days of submitting the application. “Ensure that house site pattas are delivered to 11,334 new beneficiaries and complete the verification of their applications. Start identification and procurement of land for house sites from April. We are going to construct 15.60 lakh houses in the first phase. Ensure that the layouts have all amenities.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, he alleged that Mr. Naidu was known for getting stays to escape investigations. Referring to Nara Lokesh saying that the court had given them a clean chit, he stated that TDP leaders were trying to distort the fact and mislead people.

17 March 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘YSRCP misusing probe agencies for political gains’||Congress Working Committee member(CWC) Chinta Mohan on Tuesday accused Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of competing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in allegedly misusing probe agencies against political adversaries for political gains. Addressing the media at Gudur in SPSR Nellore district, the former Union Minister said the CID notice to former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in connection with Amaravati land deals was nothing but “political vendetta”. This was akin to the Narendra Modi government allegedly misusing Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI), Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax department and other departments to target leaders of the Congress and other Opposition parties with ulterior political motives, he said. Welcoming the Election Commission notification to hold Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election on April 17, he said the bypoll is a springboard for the Congress party to come back to power at the Centre in 2024. All sections of people were fed up with the BJP Government and the State government in the State, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-misusing-probe-agencies-for-political-gains/article34087928.ece

17 March 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD dispenses with several weekly, daily arjitha sevas||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has resolved to do away with certain arjitha sevas such as Sahasra Kalasabhishekam, Visesha puja and Vasanthotsavam and perform them only once in a year by converting them into ‘circar events’. The decision was taken with the sole intention of avoiding the conduct of more ‘abhishekams’ to the idols to save them from erosion. Statistics suggest that ‘abhishekams’ are performed to the idols about 450 times on an average in a year including the ‘ekantha thirumanjanams’ on certain festive occasions at the hill temple of Lord Venkateswara. Of these, the ‘abhishekams’ conducted during the performance of daily Vasanthotsavam, weekly Visesha puja and Sahasra Kalasabhishekam alone constitute to more than 415 times, which the TTD feels shall affect the longevity of the idols. Anticipating the threat to which the idols are exposed due to frequent ‘abhishekams’, the TTD had introduced annual Jyestabhishekam (Abhidheyaka Abhishekam) in 1989 to contain the frequency. When the issue came for discussion in 2019, the TTD had resolved to stop the conduct of frequent ‘abhishekams’ to the panchaloha idols. While the weekly Visesha puja, performed on every Monday, was introduced in 1991, the authentications by noted historians such as Dr. N. Ramesan, T.K.T. Veera Raghavacharya and Sadhu Subramanyam Sastri in their narrations quoting inscriptions available on the temple walls that both ‘Sahasra Kalasabhishekam’ and ‘Vasanthotsavam’ were not obligatory in nature, but performed once a year. Sriman Pedda Jeeyar, senior pontiff of the hill shrine, as well as the five-member committee constituted to look into the issue also felt that there was an urgent need to save the idols from the danger of possible erosion. Meanwhile, the temple officials welcomed the decision. They opined that the dispensation of sevas would add to more darshan hours, benefiting more than 5,000 devotees on the days they were actually performed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-dispenses-with-several-weekly-daily-arjitha-sevas/article34087232.ece

The discovery has been published in the latest edition of the noted international journal ‘Phytotaxa’. During their field study, botanists P. Sivaramakrishna and P. Yugandhar from Sri Venkateswara University and Lalji Singh, Scientist-E from the Botanical Survey of India, Andaman and Nicobar regional centre, came across the species growing in the pasture lands in Sadasivakona.

Named as Crotalaria lamelliformis, the ascending herb is unique for its distinct features such as adpressed white hairs beneath the lower surface of leaves, inflorescence short-terminal racemes, 6-8 bright yellow flowers, unequal calyx lobes, anterior two sepals fused and standard petal sub-orbicular with short claw surrounded by white cottony hairs. Speaking to The Hindu , Dr. Sivaramakrishna said that the plant was also found in the nearby Kailasakona and Pudi areas. As the population and distributional range of the species is not clearly known, it has been assigned under ‘data deficient’ category following the IUCN (International Code for Botanical Nomenclature) rules, he said. “The discovery of Crotalaria lamelliformis is an addition to the existing 116 species from India. Diversity of Crotalaria species is mostly confined to the peninsular India region,” Dr. Sivaramakrishna added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-plant-species-found-in-chittoor/article34087308.ece

Chandrababu Naidu, leaders of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) hit the streets by taking out demonstrations against the ‘high-handed act’. In Tirupati, party leaders led by former MLA and constituency in-charge Mannur Sugunamma staged a demonstration at Ambedkar Circle, resenting the manner in which notices were served on their party chief, just a day after the municipal election results were out. Terming the notices ‘illegal’, Ms. Sugunamma said the ruling party was ‘in a high’ after tasting an overdose of victory and was hence bulldozing its way on opponents. Terming the victory ‘unjustifiable’, Ms. Sugunamma said the YSRCP government should treat the Opposition leader with due respect and not slap irrelevant cases on him. In Kadapa, TDP politburo member and district party president R. Sreenivasa Reddy dared the YSRC government to arrest their party chief and be ready to face the consequences. He wondered how party leader Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, being neither a buyer nor seller of assigned land, could claim to be a victim in the land deal and slap a case under SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-leaders-condemn-notices-served-on-naidu/article34087934.ece
17 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP to seek legal remedy||Close on the heels of the CID filing a FIR against TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on the alleged Amaravati land scam, the opposition party has launched a counter-offensive against the YSRCP and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. “The family of former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy has been enjoying assigned lands for decades. The former Chief Minister of the combined State had diluted the Assigned Lands (POT) Act through an ordinance in 2007 only to benefit his near and dear ones,” the TDP alleged on Tuesday. Pointing that the State High Court had already made it clear that there was no “insider trading” in the Land Pooling Scheme in Amaravati, the opposition party, while asserting that the notices served on Mr. Naidu were legally invalid, said it would seek legal recourse. In his reaction, TDP State president K. Atchannaidu alleged that the YSR family had been enjoying 700 acres of assigned lands at Idupulapaya for decades. “As the issue had come to light, Dr. Rajasekhara Reddy announced in the Assembly that he was returning 610 acres, and later said he was returning only 300 acres.” “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had constructed a house on the assigned lands,” he alleged. ‘Notices invalid’ TDP Polit Bureau member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the government made a laughing stock of itself by issuing notices regarding lands belonging to the SCs and STs in Amaravati. “The notices are invalid. The TDP will seek legal remedy. The unlawful actions of the government based on untruth will be met with lawful rebuttals,” he said. TDP national general secretary and MLC N. Lokesh accused the government of stooping so low as to filing SC/ST case against Mr. Naidu out of frustration over deadlock in shifting the Capital. Several TDP leaders, who included Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy, Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu, K.S. Jawahar, N. Chinarajappa, Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy, D. Veeranjaneya Swamy, and V. Ramaiah, took to the Twitter and denounced the FIR on Mr. Naidu. They alleged that the CID’s action was at the behest of the Chief Minister through Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy. “The government wants to create political terror,” they alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-to-seek-legal-remedy/article34087948.ece
17 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Injustice to Backward Classes in Telugu States, says BJP||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) OBC Morcha national president K. Laxman has asserted that the governments of both Telugu speaking States are doing gross injustice to Backward Classes (BCs). Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments were going against the interests of BCs in their own ways. Neither the Opposition parties were rallying behind the BCs though injustice was being meted out to them in all spheres, he said. Dr. Laxman held a meeting with the BJP OBC Morcha leaders here on Tuesday. Addressing a press conference, he said it was only the BJP which could ensure social justice to all the BCs, as the NDA-led Modi government at Centre was working for the development of the BCs. The Centre with a commitment to the BCs had accorded constitutional status to the BC Commission. Now, the BCs were being categorised. There were many castes that ddid not even 1 % of reservation. Efforts were on to do justice to all of them, he said. Referring to BCs from Uttarandhra, Mr. Laxman said that 26 castes from North coastal Andhra were denied BC reservation as soon as the combined Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy who hobnobs with his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrasekhara Rao remained silent much to the agony of BCs. Mr. Jagan was requested to act swiftly at least now, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/injustice-to-backward-classes-in-telugu-states-says-bjp/article34087310.ece

Justice D.V.S.S. Somayajulu agreed with the petitioners’ argument that inquiring into the unanimous elections where Form-10 had been issued, was beyond the powers of the SEC. The SEC wanted to probe the unanimous elections as a large number of candidates had claimed to be chosen uncontested, in response to several complaints of forced withdrawal of nominations and prevention of the candidates from filing their papers.

Though the bank unions have given the strike call for the two-day strike on Monday and Tuesday, the preceding two days on Second Saturday and Sunday being bank holidays seemed to have had a double impact on the flow of cash. Bank employees staged a protest outside the UCO Bank branch at Dwaraka Nagar against the decision of the Central government to privatise PSBs. Addressing the large gathering of bank employees and officers, CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy said this movement should be turned into a people’s agitation drawing inspiration from the farmers’ agitation in Delhi. Banks must be continued under government management for the benefit of the common man, he said. The government should implement stringent laws for the recovery of corporate bad loans instead of privatising PSBs, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bank-strike-atms-go-dry-on-second-day/article34088010.ece

In the first phase, microscopic organisms will be studied. A 90-day expedition onboard research vessel RV Sindhu Sadhana with 30 scientists took off from Visakhapatnam on Monday and will be completed in two-legs by the end of May, covering over 9,000 nautical miles, and ending in Goa. The data generated will help achieve the SDG14 goals, which aim at conserving and sustainably use marine resources. Biological diversity in the oceans has decreased since industrialisation began in the 19th century. However, only a small fraction of the species in the deep sea and polar oceans have so far been identified, making the loss of species difficult to record and evaluate. The CSIR-NIO scientists are on a mission to identify and characterise the genes and proteins in the ocean to understand the cellular-level operations of organisms by utilising the emerging biomedical techniques, such as proteomics and genomics. Proteins act as a catalyst for the biogeochemical reaction the organisms undergo in the ocean. These studies will help one understand cellular biochemistry and the response of ocean to the climate change, nutrient stress and increasing pollution. This extensive study will enable scientists to identify the factors controlling the changes in RNA and DNA in the marin organisms and the stressors impacting them. Further, they will be used as tracers to track the causative factors and suggest possible solutions for their mitigation impacting society. In addition, these large pool of RNA and DNA library of the oceans would also be utilised for future bioprospecting in the Indian Ocean, the scientists said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nio-to-map-genetic-diversity-in-indian-ocean/article34087972.ece

Chandrababu Naidu is caught in his own web for cheating the SCs and STs of Amaravati, according to Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister Botcha Satyanarayana. Referring to the CID FIR filed against Mr. Naidu and former Minister P. Narayana at a press conference here on Tuesday, Mr. Satyanarayana alleged that both the leaders had cheated the poor and forced them to part with their land. He criticised the opposition parties for giving a “vengeful colour” to the issue. ‘A vote for development’ “We are not vindictive, and law and investigation will take their own course,” he added. “If he (Mr. Naidu) is innocent, he should not be afraid of the probe and face it bravely,” Mr. Satyanarayana said. On the resounding victory in the recent ULB elections, the Minister said the people had voted for development, good governance and the Chief Minister’s idea of uniform and holistic development through three capitals. “It is now clear that people like the idea of three capitals,” he said.

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||CID files FIR against Naidu||It is learnt that two special teams of Andhra Pradesh CID went to his home in Hyderabad and had served the notices. According to a senior officer from the CID, the new angle to the case basically dealt with some procedural irregularities and decisions taken to acquire the land and assign compensation for the capital city, when Mr, Naidu was Chief Minister and also the Chairman of AP Capital Region Development Authority. In this case, the CID is probing various alleged irregularities in the alienation of assigned lands. Mr. Reddy in his complaint stated that some farmers from his constituency had approached him and informed him that some “influential persons” in the then government had forcefully taken away their lands illegally and fraudulently by creating an environment of fear and confusion. The middlemen also allegedly conspired to make a false representation that their land would be taken away and no compensation would be paid. Based on the representation made by the farmers who are from the SC and ST community, Mr. Reddy approached the CID for a probe into the allegations on February, 24, 2021. Based on the complaint, Additional DG of CID had asked DSP S. Surya Bhaskar Rao to conduct a preliminary inquiry. Submitting a report on March 12, Mr. Bhaskar said that inquiry had revealed “cognisance of offence was made out”. Based on the inquiry report, the CID registered a case and started an investigation and as part of it summoned Mr. Naidu. One of the major charges against Naidu pertains to alienation of about 500 acres of assigned lands, which was part of the 30,000 acres of land identified or pooled for the capital city. As per the CID investigation, the 500 acres (approx) of assigned land was purchased by various persons and the government had passed an order for one-time exemption allowing alienation to the non-assignees, which qualifies them for Mr. Naidu’s compensation scheme of 1,450-1,500 sq yards of developed commercial and residential plots for every acre surrendered. Sources say that Cabinet approval was reportedly not accorded before the GO was passed and this was seen as violation. The ‘Amravati land scam’ gained focus immediately after Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy took over as CM and ordered probe into allegation of insider trading during TDP rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cid-files-fir-against-naidu/article34087945.ece

Medchal-Malkajgiri Health officials said after receiving information that some students at the school had developed symptoms of COVID-19, they conducted tests and found the 34 students to be positive for coronavirus. While 10 teachers were tested, their tests turned up negative. Tests on 12 teachers who were not present on Tuesday will be conducted on Wednesday. A little over 160 students stay at the residential school. Those who tested negative were sent home. The 34 COVID-positive students have been isolated at the school itself. Home isolation kits were handed over to them. More in Mancherial Health teams in Mancherial found 35 more cases in the Mancherial ZPHS cluster on Tuesday. Health officials in the district came across the cluster after a teacher from the school was detected with the virus two days ago. Till Monday, 13 teachers, a cook and a student had tested positive for the infection. When testing of their contacts was taken up on Tuesday, 29 more students, and six parents were found to be COVID-positive. With that, the cluster has increased to 50. A few more of their contacts would be tested on Wednesday. Officials said all the patients were asymptomatic. The school will be closed for three days and the campus will be sanitised. Classes might resume thereafter. Mancherial District Medical and Health Officer M. Neeraja said their teams are tracking the condition of all the positive cases every day, and they would be shifted to a government hospital in case their condition warrants medical attention. Dr Neeraja has urged people eligible to take COVID-19 vaccine to step forward and get immunised. “Others have to continue wearing masks, avoid unnecessary public gatherings and public functions,” the DMHO appealed. Interestingly, the daily COVID bulletin put Mancherial’s count on Monday at 8 even though at least 14 had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/another-covid-cluster-found-in-nagole-school/article34087855.ece
17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rail projects held up as State fails to pay up||If MMTS Phase Two project is a classic case of a joint venture between railways and government caught in a blind alley, there are other cost-sharing projects either moving at a snail’s pace or are stalled. This is due to delays in land acquisition and funds from respective governments of both Telugu states. Inside Telangana, the 151-km Manoharabad–Kothapalli new line project was cleared in 2006-07 for Rs. 1,160 crore with government accepting one-third cost and providing land free and free annuity for first five years after commissioning. First section of 32-km Manoharabad-Gajwel is done and railways has allotted Rs. 325 crore in the current budget. Parts of around 2,681.73 acres of revenue land and 5.43 acres forest land in Siddipet, Medak, Rajanna Siricilla and Karimnagar handed over, although funds release “is not on par with the expenditure incurred by us”, reveal senior railway officials.  New line project The 54-km Bhadrachalam-Sattupalli new line project was sanctioned in 2010-11 for Rs. 928 crore with Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) supposed to share costs. While 800.85 acres of the 853.04 acres revenue land and 10.81 forest land was acquired, about Rs. 618.55 crore is SCCL’s share with Rs. 267 crore of railways finally allotted now, so officials expect the progress to be quicker. Akkannapet-Medak is new 17-km line cleared in 2012-13 at Rs. 118 crore with 50% cost to be borne by the government. Railways has allotted Rs. 83.6 crore this year and land acquisition has been completed but government funds are yet to be released. To recap the MMTS phase II 85-km project, it was cleared in 2012-13 at Rs. 817 crore with the government accepting two-third cost. First section of 5.75 km of Telapur-Ramachandrapuram was commissioned and 12 km of quadrupling between Moula Ali-Ghatkesar completed. Works in Malkajgiri- Bolarum-Medchal and Falaknuma-Umdanagar sections are getting ready. Railways has allotted Rs. 10 crore after claiming to have spent more than Rs. 500 crore whereas the government’s pending payment is more than Rs. 400 crore. Also, Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple is nearing completion at Yadadri but extension of MMTS Phase II from Ghatkesar by 33 km is non-starter as the government has been silent on its two-third share of Rs. 412 crore cost after showing interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rail-projects-held-up-as-state-fails-to-pay-up/article34087864.ece
17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Nagarjunasagar bypoll on April 17||The Election Commission on Tuesday issued the schedule for by-election to Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency along with 14 other constituencies across the country. Bypoll will be held on April 17. The by-election has been necessitated by the death of sitting TRS member Nomula Narasimhaiah recently. According to the ECI schedule, notification would be issued on March 23 and ladte date for filing of nominations is March 30. Scrutiny of the papers would be taken up on March 31 and April 3 is the last date for withdrawal of candidatures. Polling would be held on April 17 and counting would be taken up only on May 2. State is all set to witness another round of intense political activity coming close on the heels of conclusion of the MLC elections on March 14. Intense lobbying is already on among the principle players in the TRS and the BJP while AICC president Sonia Gandhi has approved the name of Mr. Jana Reddy as Congress candidate. AICC General Secretary Mukul Wasnik released a statement to this effect on Tuesday tonight. Fresh from its success in the bypoll to Dubbak seat and impressive showing in the GHMC polls, the BJP has set its eye on the Nagarjunasagar seat. However, in the last Assembly elections, its candidate forfeited the deposit. But, the party leadership is maintaining its aggressive tempo by extensively touring the constituency. The party leadership is also witnessing renewed interest from the aspirants to try their luck. The TRS on the other hand is treading cautiously and does not wish to give any scope for another embarasment in the polls. Indications are that it might field a BC, keeping in view the large presence of Yadav votes. Narasimhaiah too hailed from the same community and his son is aspiring for ticket. In the event of the party looking for alternative, it might field someone from the Reddy community, which has sizeable presence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nagarjunasagar-bypoll-on-april-17/article34087873.ece
17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||MLC vote counting today||Elaborate arrangements have been put in place for counting votes cast in the recently concluded elections for the Mahabubnagar-Ranga Reddy-Hyderabad graduates’ constituency. The counting is to begin on March 17 at L.B. Indoor Stadium, and could take two to three days for completion. A total 3,57,354 ballots from 799 polling stations will have to be counted, for which officials and staff will have to work in shifts. The strong rooms where ballot boxes have been kept, will be opened at 7 a.m. on Wednesday, in the presence of contesting candidates and their agents who should reach there by 6.30 a.m. The boxes will not be opened without the agents’ signatures. Mobile phones, pens and note books by agents will not be allowed inside the counting halls. Officials will provide pencils and note books to the agents instead. Eight halls in the stadium are being used for counting, with seven tables in each hall. On each table, ballot papers will be bundled in 25s, which could consume time from 8 a.m., up to 8 p.m. on the first day. Each bundle will be reopened to separate valid and invalid votes in the presence of Returning Officer, Assistant Returning Officers, micro observers, and counting agents. Then the first preference votes will be counted candidate wise, simultaneously on all the 56 tables. This process could take over an hour and a half, which means the initial tidings could be expected only after 9.30 p.m. on the first day of counting. The total counting is expected to take over 10 hours, and any clarity about who is leading will come only on second day morning, a statement from GHMC informed. Officials and staff have been kept on alert for duties up to March 19, and all the necessary arrangements for basic facilities have been made for them at the counting centre. Returning officer Priyanka Ala met the candidates and agents on Tuesday, and explained the counting procedure to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mlc-vote-counting-today/article34087876.ece
17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rich tributes paid to Nomula||Telangana Legislative Assembly on Tuesday paid rich tributes to the departed sitting legislator Nomula Narasimhaiah, who passed away in December last year. Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao moved the condolence motion expressing deep sense of sorrow at the demise of the TRS legislator who had been elected from Nagarjunasagar constituency in 2018. Drawing from his native district’s history of movements, Narasimhaiah dedicated his life right since student days to the welfare of people and society, Mr.Chandrashekhar Rao said. Born into a poor family at Palem village of Nakrekal mandal in Nalgonda district, Narasimhaiah went on to finish post-graduation and acquired a degree in law. While in the Osmania University, he had led students’ movements, and earned name as people’s lawyer while practising. Joining CPI(M) ranks, Narasimhaiah began his political journey as MPP, and rose to being elected a legislator. His speeches in Legislative Assembly were full of idiom and wit typical of Telangana dialect, the Chief Minister reminisced. Narasimhaiah always fought for irrigation rights of undivided Nalgonda district, and for farmers on the left bank canal of Nagarjuna Sagar. Differing with the CPI(M) over its stance on Telangana as separate state, Narasimhaiah later joined TRS. Terming Narasimhaiah as the representative of the underdog, Mr.Chandrasekhar Rao said he could never forget the latter’s congeniality and commitment to values. Minister for Energy G.Jagadeeshwar recalled his association with Narasimhaiah who, he said, had been committed to the poor and downtrodden. Minister for Municipal Administration & Urban Development K.T.Rama Rao said the deceased leader had been very keen on development of Nandikonda and Alair, the newly constituted municipalities in his constituency. Younger generation of political leaders had a lot of inspiration to draw from Narasimhaiah whose demise is an irreparable loss for the poor in Nalgonda district and the TRS party, he said. Minister, Animal Husbandry, Talasani Srinivas Yadav recalled that the house had seen Mr.Narasimhaiah’s commitment towards the poor people a number of times, and his contribution to the cause of shepherd communities is laudable. Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Errabelli Dayakar Rao reminisced his bonding with the departed leader, and said the latter would fondly call him ‘mama’ (uncle). Though born in poverty, Narasimhaiah rose to become an important leader. Minister for Roads & Transport Vemula Prashanth Reddy said Narasimhaiah served a long time for people, first as MPP and then twice as MLA. He spoke and conducted himself with dignity in the House, he said. R.Ravindra Kumar, Jaffer Hussain, Sandra Venkata Veeraiah, Raja Singh, B.Malaiah Yadav, Chirumarthi Lingaiah, Podem Veeraiah, and Jaipal Yadav were the other members who paid tribute to the deceased MLA. The House observed two-minute silence for Narasimhaiah, and for former members Gunda Mallesh, Naini Narasimha Reddy, Kamatam Ram Reddy, Katikaneni Madhusudan Rao, Katta Venkata Narasaiah, Dugyala Srinivasa Rao, Chengal Baganna, and K.Veera Reddy who had passed away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rich-tributes-paid-to-nomula/article34087875.ece
17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Students’ admission at Gandhi Hospital irks OGH doctors||Senior faculty member and junior doctors at Osmania General Hospital (OGH) were a disgruntled lot as Osmania Medical College (OMC) students who suffered from food poisoning were admitted to Gandhi Hospital instead of OGH on Tuesday. For their part, officials said the 30 medicos were shifted to Gandhi Hospital as there was shortage of beds at OGH. Why the State government has not been sanctioning a new building for OGH despite repeated demands over the past few years has baffled the doctors there. OGH has been facing space crunch for beds after the over-a-century-old In-Patient (IP) block was shut down in July last year following severe flooding during monsoon. The tertiary care hospital has three bocks — IP Block, Quli Qutb Shah block, and Out Patient block. The departments from the IP block were shifted to a pre-fabricated structure on the fourth floor of Quli Qutb Shah block. General Medicine, Orthopaedics departments are located on the same floor. The beds in both departments are always full. “On some days, floor beds have to be arranged when number of admissions exceed bed capacity. Since OGH is a government hospital, patients are not asked to go to visit another hospital when beds are full. Shifting to this pre-fabricated structure was supposed to be a temporary solution but it has extended for far too long,” a senior doctor from the hospital said. “Admitting OMC students at Gandhi Hospital speaks a lot about the infrastructure available at OGH,” said a faculty member. Doctors reiterated that they are ready to attend more patients but sufficient resources have to be made available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/students-admission-at-gandhi-hospital-irks-ogh-doctors/article34087852.ece
17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Unrestricted movement making it tough to find source’||As a second COVID-19 cluster was detected in Telangana, dreadful memories from last year started playing on the minds of State Health officials. Emerging clusters, rapid spread of coronavirus and its containment had given sleepless nights to the officials even as they clocked in extra hours to keep the situation under control.  A big disadvantage over last year, however, is the difficulty in finding the source of the infection. Health officials said unrestricted movement of people, possibility of an asymptomatic COVID patient spreading the infection and lack of COVID-appropriate behaviour among people are making it difficult for them to track the source. At the Zilla Parishad High School, Mancherial, 13 teachers, 30 students, a cook, and six parents have been detected with COVID-19. The cluster size is 50. Besides, 34 students at Telangana Minority Residential School in Nagole were detected with the virus on Tuesday. Officials said with unrestricted movement of people, it becomes difficult to trace how a person contracted the infectious disease. “During the lockdown and after that, people who tested positive were able to list out all the places they had been to and who they met. They used to visit limited places owing to fear of contracting COVID. Their movement was restricted. But people are not restricting their movement now, which makes it difficult to recall all the places they visited and people they came in contact with. Besides, a person who was asymptomatic could have spread the virus,” said an official of the Health department. They said a large number of people are not observing precautions such as wearing mask and maintaining physical distancing which makes it easy for the virus to spread. Clear signs Only two clusters might have been detected till Tuesday night, but District Medical and Health officials are trying to find out if there are any more such clusters. Mancherial district officials said one more teacher in a government school in Chenur has been detected with the virus. However, when tests were conducted among the teacher’s contacts, they were COVID-negative. The clusters are clear signs that coronavirus is spreading again and people have to continue taking COVID-19 precautions including wearing masks, maintain physical distancing and avoid public gatherings to steer clear of the infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/unrestricted-movement-making-it-tough-to-find-source/article34087856.ece
17 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Over 60k tests performed in a day||After a gap of five-and-a-half months, over 60,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted in the State on Monday. Such high testing was last conducted between August 25 and September 11 last year.

TS secretary Praveen Reddy informed the media on Tuesday that most of the universities are in bad shape both “academically and financially” with the government not taking up appointment of vice chancellors despite the end of the tenures for the last two years. The deep cut in budgetary funds for the last few years meant the universities administrations had funds sufficient to pay the salaries for the vastly dwindled teaching and non-teaching staff. The students wing of the BJP also accused the government of taking “revenge on the students” deliberately in the abject neglect of the education sector as a whole. It is a big setback to the students hailing from the poor especially, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/demand-for-funds-for-higher-education/article34087974.ece

17 March 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||‘Make farmers’ struggle into a people’s movement’||Terming the Centre’s three farm laws as “unconstitutional”, veteran journalist and Ramon Magsaysay Award recipient Palagummi Sainath said the need of the hour is to buttress the ongoing resilient farmers’ struggle into a people’s movement to safeguard agriculture and the national food security. Local committees be formed at the district and mandal level across the country by involving all sections of society to espouse the cause of farmers under the banner ‘Kisan Bachao – Desh Bachao’ (Save Farmers – Save the Country), he said, adding that the products of the corporate companies hurting farmers’ interests should be boycotted. A special session of Parliament be convened immediately to discuss agrarian crisis and a permanent commission on agrarian welfare be set up to protect the interests of farmers, he said. He was delivering the K L Narasimha Rao memorial lecture on the topic ‘Vyavasaya Rangam – Rythu Chhattalu’ (Agriculture Sector – Farm Acts) here late on Tuesday evening. The memorial lecture was organised by Bodepudi Vignana Kendram (BVK) to commemorate the 10th death anniversary of the Telangana peasants armed struggle fighter, prominent CPI (M) leader and former Yellandu MLA K L Narasimha Rao.

The BJP regime at the Centre miserably failed to deliver on its 2014 election promise of implementing the Swaminathan Commission report till date, he charged. “These anti-farmer and pro-corporate laws contained provisions to confer the powers of judiciary on executive and, if implemented, these laws will bring the public distribution system to an end thereby diluting national food security and affecting every citizen of the country,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/make-farmers-struggle-into-a-peoples-movement/article34087880.ece

17 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||HC orders probe into ‘illegal’ arrest of labour rights activist||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday marked an inquiry into allegations of illegal detention and custodial torture of labour rights activist Shiv Kumar, who was arrested by the Haryana police in January this year. The court asked the District and Sessions Judge at Faridabad to hold the inquiry after hearing a petition that sought transfer of the investigation of cases registered under the section 307 of the IPC and other sections at the Kundli police station in Sonipat to an independent agency. The petition also sought an independent inquiry into the illegal detention and torture of Mr. Kumar. Mr. Kumar, 24, district president of the Mazdoor Adhikar Sangathan — a workers rights’ group, is facing charges of attempt to murder, rioting and extortion under different FIRs registered in Sonipat in Haryana. Justice Avneesh Jhingan in an interim order said, “At this stage, there is nothing before this court to doubt the investigation by the Special Investigation Team. However, as there could be an occasion that the conclusion arrived at by the SIT and inquiry report with regard to two sets of medical reports may cast shadow on each other. Considering the facts and circumstances in entirety, let the District and Sessions Judge, Faridabad, hold an inquiry....” In the meantime, the court said the SIT may continue with the investigation but shall not submit its final report without seeking permission from this court. ‘Medical reports differ’ The petitioner’s counsel, Arshdeep Singh Cheema, pleaded that the comparison of the initial medical reports and the subsequent medical report, following the court’s order, was different, and hence a request for an inquiry. “Four medicals were conducted when the petitioner was in police custody and none of them showed any injuries on him. But the report of the medical conducted after the HC’s direction shows at least four fractures and grievous injuries on Shiv Kumar’s body,” said Mr. Cheema.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-orders-probe-into-illegal-arrest-of-labour-rights-activist/article34087622.ece
17 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Akali MLAs booked for accosting Lal||Nine MLAs of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) were on Tuesday booked by the Chandigarh police allegedly for attempting to wrongfully restraint Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal outside the Punjab and Haryana State Assembly complex last week. On a complaint from the Haryana Assembly secretariat, the police have filed an FIR under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) among other sections of the IPC. According to the FIR, nine MLAs of the Shiromani Akali Dal from Punjab on March 13 misbehaved and interrupted the official press briefing of Mr. Lal and made an attempt to attack him. The MLAs named in the FIR are Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, Bikram Singh Majithia, Baldev Singh Khaira, Sukhwinder Kumar, Harinder Pal Singh Chandumajra, Kanwarjit Singh Barkandi, Manpreet Singh Ayali, Gurpartap Singh Wadala and Narinder Kumar Sharma. Haryana Speaker Gian Chand Gupta had on Monday condemned the incident and informed the Assembly that a complaint was given to the police. SAD MLAs had allegedly shouted slogans during the press briefing, demanding the passage of a resolution by the Assembly against the Centre’s farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/akali-mlas-booked-for-accosting-lal/article34087618.ece

The move is being seen as an attempt to melt the ice and hand over an important role to Mr. Sidhu by reinducting him into the Cabinet or the PCC. State Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said, “Mr. Sidhu has his own following and we have to make use of his potential. It’s not the matter of just Punjab, the whole nation is looking towards Punjab and the Congress now.” Harish Rawat, the party affairs in-charge, had been working to resolve the differences between the two leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punjab-cm-sidhu-to-meet-rehabilitation-on-cards/article34087619.ece
17 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||IIT-Guwahati suspends research scholar for ‘defaming institution’||The Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati has suspended a research scholar for “defaming the institution” four months after he took to social media to question the credibility of the Joint Entrance Examination. Vikrant Singh had on October 29, 2020, posted on Facebook his reaction to the arrest of a JEE (Mains) topper from Assam for using a proxy to write the exam. He had said the “problem of proxy isn’t a new thing” and that the IITs have “acted in vague and sad manner” against teachers who have called out instances of corruption earlier. He mentioned former IIT-Kharagpur teacher Rajeev Kumar who had campaigned to reform the JEE process and Brijesh Rai of IIT-G who was given “compulsory retirement” for alleging corruption in the entry process. The IIT-G said Mr. Singh had collaborated with Dr. Rai, his former supervisor, in twisting facts “to disrupt the academic activities of the institute”. It said Mr. Singh has been kept in “suspended academic expulsion” from March 10 until July 27. The IIT-G said the students’ disciplinary committee took the decision on Mr. Singh after deliberations. The institute also found fault with Mr. Singh for sharing his suspension notice with the media. Mr. Singh accused the IIT-G authorities of lying and said the suspension was an assault on his freedom of expression.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/iit-guwahati-suspends-research-scholar-for-defaming-institution/article34087620.ece

Nadda, campaigned in West Bengal on Tuesday and raked up religion as a poll plank. Mr. Nadda, who held a roadshow and addressed a rally in Bankura, wondered why CM Mamata Banerjee announced a lockdown on the day the foundation stone was laid for the Ram temple in August 2020 but lifted it on the day of Muharram. He also alleged that Ms. Banerjee called Batla House encounter “fake”. “She should apologise after the court gave death penalty to the convict. Ms. Banerjee had said she will quit politics if the encounter is found to be true.” U.P. CM Yogi Adityanath and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also addressed rallies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mamata-must-apologise-for-batla-house-statement/article34087842.ece
17 March 2021||Mumbai,||Why did Mumbai Police hold press meet on TRP scam, asks High Court||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked why the Mumbai Police hold a press conference last year over the alleged television rating points (TRP) scam. A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and Manish Pitale said, “Do the police have an obligation to interact with the press? Why did the commissioner (of police) have to speak to the press?” The HC posed this question after senior advocate Ashok Mundargi, representing ARG Outlier Media, started reading points highlighted at  the press conference conducted by the Commissioner of Police on October 8, 2020. The HC was hearing a plea filed by Republic TV seeking to quash the FIR registered by the Mumbai Crime Branch against it. Mr. Mundargi told the Bench that an FIR was registered against Republic TV on October 6, 2020, and the police commissioner took a press conference on October 8 mentioning the channel. “However, the FIR does not name the company,” he said. He said that on October 13, Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief and owner of the channel, ran a show on how the channel was not involved in the TRP scam. Two days later, a case of abetment to suicide was registered in Raigad against Mr. Goswami, and he was arrested on November 4. Mr. Mundargi mentioned names of the employees of the channel and said there had been malafide in showing them as accused in the remand applications on December 13, 2020, and then suspects in the chargesheet by the Crime Branch on January 11, 2021. The court interrupted and said, “We are not getting into names, just the facts of the case.” The matter will now be heard on March 17. On October 8, 2020, Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh had said that a TRP racket had been busted which involved Republic TV, Box Cinema, and Fakt Marathi. He had said that the channels were manipulating TRPs and were involved in distorting the system used by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) to rate television channels. A total of 2,000 barometers are installed in Mumbai to monitor TRPs and BARC has given a confidential contract for monitoring the barometers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/why-did-mumbai-police-hold-press-meet-on-trp-scam-asks-high-court/article34087526.ece
17 March 2021||Mumbai,||Border dispute: Sena wants Belgaum to be declared UT||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said Belgaum should be declared a Union Territory, alleging that atrocities on Marathi-speaking people by pro-Kannada outfits were continuing there. An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana alleged that a pro-Kannada organisation recently beat up Marathi people in Belgaum, removed Marathi boards from shops there, and also targeted pro-Marathi social media users. The Karnataka police were also harassing Marathi people, it claimed.“If the atrocities are not going to stop, then the Centre should declare Belgaum a Union Territory,” it said. Maharashtra claims certain areas, including Belgaum, Karwar and Nippani which are part of Karnataka, contending the majority of population in these areas is Marathi-speaking. The dispute between the two States over Belgaum and other border areas has been pending before the Supreme Court for many years. The editorial requested Maharashtra BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis to take up the issue with the Centre and the Karnataka Chief Minister. There are Marathi people in Indore and Vadodaraalso. But, they never had any clashes with locals, the publication said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/border-dispute-sena-wants-belgaum-to-be-declared-ut/article34087523.ece

No casualties were reported in the blaze, whose cause is yet to be ascertained. “The fire erupted a little after 3.50 a.m. at the fruit and vegetable market. While there was no loss of life, there has been significant damage to property,” a senior fire department official said. Nine water tankers were rushed to the spot and the blaze was brought under control in 40 minutes, Pune Municipal Corporation’s fire department chief Prashant Ranpise said. “While the main structure of the market remained unscathed, a number of shops and items inside them were burnt,” Mr. Ranpise said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/25-shops-gutted-in-blaze-at-punes-shivaji-market/article34087527.ece
17 March 2021||Tokyo,||U.S., Japan warn China against ‘coercion’||The U.S. and Japan warned Beijing against “coercion and destabilising behaviour” on Tuesday after top-level diplomatic and defence talks aimed at bolstering their alliance against rising Chinese influence. Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and top U.S. diplomat Antony Blinken are on their first overseas trip, which began on Monday in Japan, looking to shore up regional alliances and send a message to Beijing. They will continue on to South Korea, and a policy review by the new administration of its approach to Pyongyang is also a key part of the diplomatic outreach. But discussions in Tokyo focused on China’s manoeuvres in the region, including its increasing presence around islands disputed with Japan. “China uses coercion and aggression to systematically erode autonomy in Hong Kong, undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet and assert maritime claims in the South China Sea that violate international law,” Mr. Blinken said at a joint press conference. “We’re united in a vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, where countries follow the rules, cooperate wherever they can and resolve their differences peacefully.” “We will push back if necessary, when China uses coercion or aggression to get its way.” In a joint statement, the U.S. officials and their Japanese counterparts also warned that “China’s behaviour, where inconsistent with the existing international order, presents political, economic, military and technological challenges”. “The Ministers committed to opposing coercion and destabilising behaviour towards others in the region,” they added. Pyongyang’s remarks Issues from the coup in Myanmar to the way forward with North Korea were also on the table. Mr. Blinken accused the Myanmar military of “attempting to overturn the results of a democratic election”, saying it was “brutally repressing peaceful protesters”. But he declined to comment on the latest bombastic pronouncement from North Korea, where leader Kim Jong-un’s sister earlier on Tuesday warned Washington against “struggling to spread the smell of gunpowder on our land from across the ocean”. The joint statement called again for Pyongyang’s “complete denuclearisation”, warning North Korea’s arsenal “poses a threat to international peace and stability”. Mr. Blinken said Washington was still examining “whether various additional pressure measures could be effective, whether there are diplomatic paths that make sense” as it reviews U.S. policy on the issue. “We reached out to the North Korean government through several channels, starting in mid-February, including in New York. To date we have not received a response from Pyongyang,” he added. “This follows over a year without active dialogue with North Korea, despite multiple attempts by the United States to engage.” President Joe Biden’s decision to dispatch the two top officials to Asia has been interpreted as evidence of his determination to set the agenda with Beijing. Mr. Austin is also scheduled to visit New Delhi after a trip to Seoul.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-japan-warn-china-against-coercion/article34087219.ece
17 March 2021||Brussels,||Beijing warns EU on Xinjiang sanctions||China’s Ambassador to the EU on Tuesday warned against imposing sanctions on Beijing over its actions in the Xinjiang region, as the bloc decides how to respond to the crackdown on the Uighur minority. “I want to emphasise that sanctions are confrontation. Sanctions based on lies could be interpreted as deliberately undermining China’s security and development interests,” Ambassador Zhang Ming said. “We want dialogue not confrontation. We ask the EU side to think twice. If some insist on confrontation we will not back down as we have no options but fulfilling our responsibilities to people of our country.” The EU is currently drawing up plans to expand the bloc’s global human rights sanctions regime after sanctioning four Russian officials over the jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. European diplomats said the bloc’s 27 Foreign Ministers are expected to agree at a meeting on Monday to add a small number of individuals or entities in China to the blacklist over the treatment of the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. Officials in other countries including Russia, North Korea and Eritrea are also expected to be hit with asset freezes and visa bans over alleged human rights abuses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/beijing-warns-eu-on-xinjiang-sanctions/article34087214.ece
17 March 2021||London,||U.K. turns to Indo-Pacific in post-Brexit foreign policy||Britain wants to expand its influence among countries in the Indo-Pacific region to try to moderate China’s global dominance, a document laying out post-Brexit foreign and defence policy priorities said on Tuesday. The document sets out a planned increase to Britain’s nuclear arsenal to weigh against evolving global security threats, and underlines the importance of strong ties with the U.S. while naming Russia as the top regional threat. Britain’s biggest foreign and defence policy review since the end of the Cold War sets out how Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to be at the forefront of a reinvigorated, rules-based international order based on cooperation and free trade. Calling the Indo-Pacific “increasingly the geopolitical centre of the world”, the government highlighted a planned British aircraft carrier deployment to the region. “China and the U.K. both benefit from bilateral trade and investment, but China also presents the biggest state-based threat to the U.K.’s economic security,” the report said. Britain, the world’s sixth-largest economy, is dwarfed economically and militarily by China, but believes through soft power and strategic alliances it can help persuade Beijing to play by the rules of a new, more dynamic international system. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab acknowledged Britain’s attempts to influence Beijing had been marginal so far, telling Times Radio it was better acting “in concert with clusters of like-minded countries... to have the maximum impact and moderating impact on China”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-turns-to-indo-pacific-in-post-brexit-foreign-policy/article34087217.ece
17 March 2021||Yangon,||Yangon residents flee as junta continues crackdown||Residents of a protest flashpoint district in Myanmar’s biggest city fled on small vehicles and motorbikes on Tuesday as security forces defied global calls for restraint and maintained their use of lethal force against anti-coup rallies. Much of the country has been in uproar since the military ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets to demand a return to democracy. Police and soldiers have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds to subdue crowds in near-daily crackdowns, along with blanket nightly internet shutdowns to stop protesters from mobilising. The junta has also throttled mobile data nationwide, delaying news of crackdowns against demonstrations. On Tuesday, one protester was killed in the central Sagaing region before noon when security forces opened fire. The deadliest day so far in the six weeks since the Army deposed Ms. Suu Kyi’s government was on Sunday, with the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) reporting 74 killed after the violent suppression of anti-coup unrest across Myanmar. The majority of those killed Sunday came from the impoverished Hlaing Tharyar township in Yangon, a garment-producing area in the commercial hub with mostly Chinese-owned factories — several of which were razed on the same day. Tuesday morning saw its residents — many of whom are migrant workers — pile onto flat-bed trucks and cars, which inched forward on a traffic-clogged road. The mass exodus comes after the junta imposed martial law over the Hlaing Tharyar and five other townships, home to about two million people — more than a quarter of the sprawling city’s population. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Myanmar’s military on Tuesday for its lethal use of force against protesters, accusing it of “brutally repressing” them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/yangon-residents-flee-as-junta-continues-crackdown/article34087223.ece
17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||China will allow travellers only if they take its vaccines||A number of China’s overseas missions, including its embassy in New Delhi, have announced they will begin “facilitating” travellers provided they have taken “Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccines”. Indians have been barred from travelling to China since November last year, when China suspended valid visas and residents permits not just for travellers from India but for most countries citing COVID-19 concerns. The ban has been a particular concern for many Indian students enrolled in Chinese universities, who have been unable to return to China. There are at least 23,000 Indians studying in China, most in medical colleges. The March 15 announcement will bring little relief for them as Chinese-made vaccines are not available in India. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday that China “stands ready to advance mutual recognition of vaccines with other countries”, but that process is expected to take time. For now, the limited easing of the travel ban will only apply to travellers who have taken Chinese vaccines. A notice from the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said, “For the purpose of resuming people-to-people exchanges in an orderly manner, starting from 15 March, 2021, the Chinese Embassies and Consulates in India will provide the persons having taken Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccine and holding the Certificates of Vaccination with the following facilitating measures”, including for those going to China for “employment contracts, work resumption and other relevant activities” and family members of Chinese nationals, provided they have taken Chinese vaccines. The announcement did not say if it would apply to students. ‘Similar situations’ Asked by a reporter in January if the Chinese government would take “a sympathetic view” of the plight of some of the 23,000-plus Indian students enrolled in Chinese universities who remain in India — many of them returned to India when China was dealing with the pandemic in early 2020, but there is no official figure of how many are now awaiting to return — as many had taken on considerable financial burdens to pursue medical degrees in China, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, “I can relate to your feelings, including the confusion and plight of so many Indian students as you mentioned. I believe similar situations exist all over the world. To my knowledge, there are many Chinese students who have invested heavily in studies overseas, but due to the sudden COVID-19 outbreak, they are unable to pursue their education as planned, and a lot of them have to stay at home for online courses. Such a situation is not what we want to see.” Ms. Hua said authorities had “required relevant departments and academic institutions to maintain close contact with overseas students, properly design and arrange online teaching, and duly handle reasonable demands and concerns.” Indian students, who account for the fourth-largest segment of international students in China, have faced particular obstacles, the South China Morning Post reported last month, with many of the Chinese apps used for online teaching banned last year, when India restricted more than 200 Chinese apps in the wake of the June border clash in the Galwan Valley. After WeChat was banned and students complained to their colleges, one university, the newspaper reported, began to use the Alibaba-owned DingTalk and Tencent’s Meeting for online classes. Eventually, those apps were banned as well. The larger concern for the students, who will have to pass challenging exams in India after graduation to be able to practice, is their inability to receive laboratory training as they remain unable to return. In a March 5 meeting with the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui, India’s envoy in Beijing Vikram Misri “flagged outstanding consular issues pertaining to Indian nationals” and “requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ facilitation in seeking a resolution,” the Indian Embassy in Beijing said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-will-allow-travellers-only-if-they-take-its-vaccines/article34087267.ece
17 March 2021||Las Vegas,||Biden joins roadshow to promote relief plan||President Joe Biden is joining top messengers already crisscrossing the country to highlight the benefits of his massive COVID-19 rescue plan, in his case by promoting aid for small businesses. Mr. Biden is set to visit a small business in suburban Philadelphia on Tuesday, his initial trip outside Washington for the “Help is here” tour that got under way on Monday. Vice-President Kamala Harris dropped in on a COVID-19 vaccination site and a culinary academy in Las Vegas while First Lady Jill Biden toured a New Jersey elementary school. “We want to avoid a situation where people are unaware of what they’re entitled to,” Ms. Harris said. “It’s not selling it; it literally is letting people know their rights. Think of it more as a public education campaign.” The White House is wasting no time promoting the $1.9 trillion relief plan, looking to build momentum for the rest of his agenda and anxious to avoid the mistakes of 2009 in boosting that year’s recovery effort. Veterans of Obama’s administration acknowledge they did not do enough then to showcase their massive economic stimulus package.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-joins-road-show-to-promote-relief-plan/article34087211.ece

Most infected children have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. School officials across the U.S. are under pressure to fully reopen as soon as possible, but many say they need portable classrooms or shorter school days to meet social distancing rules. Moderna said 17.8 million adults in the U.S. have received its vaccine. The Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have all been authorised for emergency use, and the companies are set to deliver more than enough to cover the entire U.S. adult population by mid-year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/moderna-says-it-has-started-vaccine-trials-on-children/article34087215.ece

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Responsible AI — the need for ethical guard rails||Since Czech writer Karel Čapek first mentioned robots in a 1920s play, humans have dreamed about intelligent machines. What if robots take over policing? What if nanny-bots look after our children and elderly? What if — and this has been rich fodder for dystopian literature — they became more intelligent than us? Surrounded as we are by the vestiges of our analogue world, to many of us, these wonderings may seem decades from fruition. But artificial intelligence (AI), the engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is already very much with us. AI’s exponential growth It is embedded in the recommendations we get on our favourite streaming or shopping site; in GPS mapping technology; in the predictive text that completes our sentences when we try to send an email or complete a web search. It promises to be even more transformative than the harnessing of electricity. And the more we use AI, the more data we generate, the smarter it gets. In just the last decade, AI has evolved with unprecedented velocity — from beating human champions at Jeopardy! in 2011, to vanquishing the world’s number one player of Go, to decoding proteins (https://go.nature.com/30N9BQz) last year. Automation, big data and algorithms will continue to sweep into new corners of our lives until we no longer remember how things were “before”. Just as electricity allowed us to tame time, enabling us to radically alter virtually every aspect of existence, AI can leapfrog us toward eradicating hunger, poverty and disease — opening up new and hitherto unimaginable pathways for climate change mitigation, education and scientific discovery. For better or for worse Already, AI has helped increase crop yields (https://bit.ly/3cAUv67), raised business productivity, improved access to credit and made cancer detection faster and more precise (https://go.nature.com/3qRmfbO). It could contribute more than $15 trillion to the world economy by 2030 (https://pwc.to/3tvmJq1), adding 14% to global GDP. Google has identified over 2,600 use cases of “AI for good” worldwide (https://bit.ly/3qSmsM2). A study published in Nature (https://go.nature.com/3tlzJyj) reviewing the impact of AI on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) finds that AI may act as an enabler on 134 — or 79% — of all SDG targets. We are on the cusp of unprecedented technological breakthroughs that promise to positively transform our world in ways deeper and more profound than anything that has come before. Yet, the study in Nature also finds that AI can actively hinder 59 — or 35% — of SDG targets. For starters, AI requires massive computational capacity, which means more power-hungry data centres — and a big carbon footprint (https://bit.ly/3lmsof4). Then, AI could compound digital exclusion. Robotics and AI companies are building intelligent machines that perform tasks typically carried out by low-income workers: self-service kiosks to replace cashiers, fruit-picking robots to replace field workers, etc.; but the day is not far when many desk jobs will also be edged out by AI, such as accountants, financial traders and middle managers. Without clear policies on reskilling workers, the promise of new opportunities will in fact create serious new inequalities. Investment is likely to shift to countries where AI-related work is already established (https://bit.ly/2NnrMt7), widening gaps among and within countries. Together, Big Tech’s big four — Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook — are worth a staggering $5 trillion, more than the GDPs of just about every nation on earth. In 2020, when the world was reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, they added more than $2 trillion to their value. The fact is, just as AI has the potential to improve billions of lives, it can also replicate and exacerbate existing problems, and create new ones. Consider, for instance, the documented examples (https://bit.ly/30Ny8VI) of AI facial recognition and surveillance technology discriminating against people of colour and minorities. Or how an AI-enhanced recruitment engine, based on existing workforce profiles, taught itself that male candidates were preferable to female. Privacy worries AI also presents serious data privacy concerns. The algorithm’s never-ending quest for data has led to our digital footprints being harvested and sold without our knowledge or informed consent. We are constantly being profiled in service of customisation, putting us into echo chambers of like-mindedness, diminishing exposure to varied viewpoints and eroding common ground. Today, it is no exaggeration to say that with all the discrete bytes of information floating about us online, the algorithms know us better than we know ourselves. They can nudge our behaviour without our noticing. Our level of addiction to our devices, the inability to resist looking at our phones, and the chilling case of Cambridge Analytica — in which such algorithms and big data were used to alter voting decisions — should serve as a potent warning of the individual and societal concerns resulting from current AI business models. In a world where the algorithm is king, it behoves us to remember that it is still humans — with all our biases and prejudices, conscious and unconscious — who are responsible for it. We shape the algorithms and it is our data they operate on. Remember that in 2016, it took less than a day for Microsoft’s Twitter chatbot, christened “Tay”, to start spewing egregious racist content, based on the material it encountered. Ensuring our humane future How then do we ensure that AI applications are as unbiased, equitable, transparent, civil and inclusive as possible? How do we ensure that potential harm is mitigated, particularly for the most vulnerable, including for children? Without ethical guard rails, AI will widen social and economic schisms, amplifying any innate biases at an irreversible scale and rate and lead to discriminatory outcomes. It is neither enough nor is it fair to expect AI tech companies to solve all these challenges through self-regulation. First, they are not alone in developing and deploying AI; governments also do so. Second, only a “whole of society” approach to AI governance will enable us to develop broad-based ethical principles, cultures and codes of conduct, to ensure the needed harm-mitigating measures, reviews and audits during design, development and deployment phases, and to inculcate the transparency, accountability, inclusion and societal trust for AI to flourish and bring about the extraordinary breakthroughs it promises. Given the global reach of AI, such a “whole of society” approach must rest on a “whole of world” approach. The UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap on Digital Cooperation (https://bit.ly/3cDBrV2) is a good starting point: it lays out the need for multi-stakeholder efforts on global cooperation so AI is used in a manner that is “trustworthy, human rights-based, safe and sustainable, and promotes peace”. And UNESCO has developed a global, comprehensive standard-setting draft Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence to Member States (https://bit.ly/3cC4pEH) for deliberation and adoption. Many countries, including India, are cognisant of the opportunities and the risks, and are striving to strike the right balance between AI promotion and AI governance — both for the greater public good. NITI Aayog’s Responsible AI for All strategy (https://bit.ly/30LMXIv), the culmination of a year-long consultative process, is a case in point. It recognises that our digital future cannot be optimised for good without multi-stakeholder governance structures that ensure the dividends are fair, inclusive, and just. Agreeing on common guiding principles is an important first step, but it is not the most challenging part. It is in the application of the principles that the rubber hits the road. It is where principles meet reality that the ethical issues and conundrums arise in practice, and for which we must be prepared for deep, difficult, multi-stakeholder ethical reflection, analyses and resolve. Only then will AI provide humanity its full promise. Until then, AI (and the humans who created it) will embody the myth of Prometheus: the Titan who shared the fire of the gods with mortals, and the trickster whose defiance of Zeus led to Pandora opening her box.

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||We need to urgently invest in public health||The worst pandemic in a hundred years has demonstrated the importance of healthcare and public health in times of a health crisis. The efforts of healthcare personnel, from ASHA workers with only basic training, to highly specialised intensive care physicians, have saved countless lives and made India proud. That healthcare is science-based was convincingly demonstrated. Lab diagnosis, clinical assessments, triage and management ranging from home quarantine to intensive care, clinical trials discriminating between useful and useless therapeutic modalities all gave society a glimpse of how modern medicine works. We learned that outcomes of well-designed clinical trials with their statistically significant differences between treatment modalities are sacrosanct for evidence — not unreliable personal anecdotes. Healthcare personnel worked tirelessly, with single-minded devotion to duty, putting the best interests of others who were in need over their own personal priorities. This made a mark in public perception. Now we realise why good grounding in theory, long years in basics and specialisation, and apprenticing to gain experience in ethical, evidence-based medical practice are essential for the making of caring medical and nursing professionals. Both the science base and the discipline belong to the allopathic system of medicine. This was brought to India just over a century ago and successfully adopted by us as our own. Healthcare and public health While the health-care capability in India ranks among the world’s best, it is a different story when it comes to public health. We need to distinguish between the two. Healthcare refers to the transaction between one caregiver and one sick person at a time – hence the client is the sick person and therapy is the mainstay. For public health, the client is the community at large and the goal is disease prevention and control. Disease control is the deliberate, intervention-based and quantified reduction of disease burden. It has to be data-driven. Data are required on baseline disease burden and real-time monitoring to track the control trajectory of all the highly prevalent infectious diseases. Reliable data must be collected from all sources including every healthcare provider, for monitoring disease burden by diagnosis and outcomes; for this exercise, the total population is the denominator. Data collection for HIV control is sample-based, under the unique Indian design of sentinel surveillance, established in 1986 and still continuing. It shows only the time trend of declining infection prevalence. Counting of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and laboratory tests for polioviruses (including molecular methods distinguishing wild from vaccine viruses) were crucial for polio elimination in India. The commonality between HIV/AIDS and polio programmes is the availability of denominator-based data. The denominator for polio elimination is the national total under-five population. So, we knew the total disease burden. And when it reached zero, we knew polio was eliminated. Our health management does not have a way of prospectively collecting data on all diseases and deaths by diagnosis. That is precisely the task of public health. In its absence, we have only the numerator data on various diseases, including COVID-19, but not the denominator — in short we do not have a comprehensive and quantified profile of any disease in the entire population, including those under vertical programmes — tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, AIDS. For COVID-19, computerised medical records informed us about how many were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection — and among them, how many were positive, hospitalised, survived or died. All statistics are available in the public domain. Everyone knows that the numbers cover only a fraction of the total, but what proportion of the total, will remain unknown forever. Social vaccination To get an insight into the totality of infections in the whole population, we rely on the shape of the COVID-19 epidemic curve that peaked in September and steadily declined to the present — with less than 20,000 daily new infections since January 7 until recently. That informs the proportion already infected — most probably 50%-60%, for 700 million to 800 million people. But the detected numbers are over 11 million. Where does the truth lie: nearer to 11 million or to 700 million? We will not know without a public health surveillance system. The sero-surveys on random samples, an attempt to derive the totality of infections, reported widely disparate figures and failed to give us a reasonably reliable picture. For COVID-19, there are non-pharmacological preventive interventions — face masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing — and pharmacological prevention by vaccination. Where we fell short is timely and comprehensive public education with authoritative and authentic information communicated effectively to the public for self-motivated behaviour modification. In other words, a ‘social vaccine’. Social vaccination is another function of public health. In the absence of public health infrastructure, India’s AIDS Task Force designed and successfully applied ‘social vaccine’ during the HIV/AIDS epidemic and this was continued by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). Sadly, there was no crosstalk between the COVID-19 programme and NACO; hence principles of social vaccine, so effectively deployed in AIDS prevention, were not adopted for COVID-19 prevention. Now, during the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out, authentic health education regarding vaccination is conspicuously lacking, leading to considerable vaccine hesitancy among even healthcare staff. Post-vaccination surveillance, vital for assessing vaccine efficacy and safety, is not being conducted, again a lacuna in public health. We sorely miss public health. COVID-19 has strong social determinants of infection transmission — overcrowding, lack of cough/sneeze etiquette, and urban-rural divide in health awareness and education. These factors are common for influenza and TB too. Typhoid, cholera, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, malaria, rabies, etc. have environmental determinants. In countries where public health is given equal status with healthcare, public health addresses both social and environmental determinants and controls these diseases. Public health personnel have jurisdiction over people in their homes and workplaces, food and water distribution chains, and over ecosystems — ranging from densities of arthropod vectors, rodent and canine populations, to flight ranges of fruit-eating bats. Our government errs when it thinks that healthcare for people’s felt need alone will suffice, without mitigating disease determinants through public health. India’s style of mounting ad hoc responses only when there is a pandemic is no longer tenable. Currently our healthcare institutions are cluttered with too many infectious diseases that are amenable to control if only we had public health. Imagine how much wealth is going down the drain for want of public health. Investment in public health will result in health, wealth and prosperity. T.

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||On the difficult trail of India’s most wanted||I am not an uncompromising admirer of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), despite the fact that I was once director of the crucial agency. It is an outfit which has its strong points such as talented and dedicated supervisors with a sound knowledge of the law and of unquestioned integrity. It is also an outfit with a few glaring shortcomings, such as the enormous delay taken in completing many an investigation and having in its ranks a set of black sheep who have brought ignominy to the organisation. The CBI’s performance in recent times has been a mixed bag, with its moments of glory alongside its moments of shame. The Nirav Modi, Mallya cases For example, the Nirav Modi case which was very much in the news recently is testimony to the CBI’s capacity to execute a professional job, provided it is given a free hand. The jeweller, who took Punjab National Bank for a ride, is holed up in Wandsworth Prison in London. He tried his best to demolish the CBI case to get him extradited but did not succeed because the London Westminster Court which tried him was convinced that the prosecution had a watertight case. It is generally believed that the CBI will succeed very soon in bringing him to Mumbai where he is expected to be lodged at Arthur Road jail. Fortunately, the CBI is learned to have received the unstinted support of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) of the United Kingdom, which has an enviable record of professional excellence. Extradition of accused persons who have fled India is the toughest task before the CBI. In this, we have had a few successes and many failures. I am happy that the CBI has done a thorough job in the Nirav Modi case, in ferreting out all details and presenting them before the London court. In discussing the Nirav Modi case, my mind goes back to the Bofors gun case of the 1980s-90s where an enterprising wheeler dealer, Ottavio Quattrocchi, (said to be close to a political family in India) was allowed to escape from India with the then government’s connivance, and later helped by influential persons in Delhi circles. He was never brought back to face trial in India despite overwhelming evidence against him. More recently, Vijay Mallya, the liquor baron of Karnataka, who received huge financial favours from a few banks, has been dodging imprisonment and repatriation to India. There are many stories behind his success in evading the due process of law, some credible and some not. Mr. Mallya has lost his case both before the lower court and the High Court. His fate now depends on what view the U.K Home Secretary will take. Sensing his hopeless situation, Mr. Mallya is believed to have sought asylum in that country. The CBI can rightfully gloat over its success in the Nirav Modi case. The order (February 25, 2021) of a Westminster Magistrate’s Court, London did not mince words. It confirmed that the accused had indeed committed an extraditable crime. This is a shot in the arm for the CBI investigators. This was undoubtedly the outcome of sustained investigation for two years after overcoming the many obstacles put up by an accused person with enormous influence. He was able to get the help of two former Indian judges (one of who was a former Supreme Court judge) to exploit the alleged loopholes in the prosecution story. However, this ploy did not succeed. Strategies by the accused In all cases of extradition, the ruse of the accused was mainly to dispute that he had committed an extraditable offence. The endeavour here was to prove that the offence alleged against him was not in the statutes of the country where he is living. Another stand which an accused usually takes is to allege that political considerations had weighed in the mind of the requesting country in demanding extradition. A third strategy was on trying to prove that the country seeking transfer of the offender did not fulfil human rights requirements, particularly in respect of hygiene in the prison in which he was proposed to be lodged. (A video of Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail filed by the prosecution clinched the issue.) Incidentally, this is where Mr. Mallya will also be if and when he is extradited.) The London judge rejected all three contentions put forward by Mr. Modi’s counsel, and this reflected the thoroughness with which the CBI had done its job. In the present case, the facts are fairly clear unlike Bofors where the number of players was too many and the transactions under scrutiny originated from a foreign company. Mr. Modi bought up a single employee of Punjab National Bank who was willing to do his bidding. Financial fraud is a maze A novel modus operandi was employed to hoodwink many in the top echelons of the bank in connection with the Letters of Undertaking and the bank’s core banking system. This was a new lesson to learn for bank fraud investigators and the banking industry. Talk of tightening lending procedures becomes meaningless if a bank employee decides to turn a rogue and is able to successfully hide major unauthorised concessions. This is analogous to many attacks admitted to by financial corporations across the globe during the past few decades on their computer systems, where one bad employee (who had authorised access to sensitive information) can wreck all security arrangements. A final thought. The public should be made to understand that financial crime in current times is too complicated for agencies such as the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) to unravel all the facts in quick time. What is involved here is a laborious process of identifying documents that are required to prove a case and to explore where exactly they are lodged or hidden. Many such documents, as in the Bofors case, are in other countries, in private and public recesses. There is mind boggling protocol that has to be observed in trying to procure them. Any ham-handed approach will frustrate the whole process. Other travails In all such matters, another instrument of torture for the prosecution is the so-called Letter Rogatory (LR), which the relevant court in India will have to issue to the corresponding court abroad to get hold of documents or examining witnesses in the countries involved. This is a painfully long-drawn-out process which many influential accused persons have taken advantage of. Courts in India are sometimes unfair to the investigating agencies by lambasting them for being responsible for delays, ignoring the fact that it is quite often the foreign government concerned which is dragging its feet. This is part of the huge number of travails that the prosecution faces in pinning down the guilty. Agencies such as the CBI and ED are sometimes the favourite whipping boys of the public and, unfortunately, sometimes of the judiciary. R.K.

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Coalition of compulsion||The BJP’s ability to forge alliances with prominent regional parties during Assembly and Lok Sabha elections enables it to win votes from wide segments of society with the exception of the bulk of Muslim votes. In Assam, for the coming election, the BJP gave up its alliance with the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and chose to ally with the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) apart from the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). Key leaders including the only sitting MLA from the Ganashakti Party joined the BJP.  Inability to form a counter-coalition The opposition is dominated by two major alliances. The Congress is in an alliance with the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), based mainly among Bengali-speaking Muslims; the Left parties; the Anchalik Gana Morcha; and the BPF. This alliance is expected to have a major impact in Muslim-dominated seats in Lower and Central Assam as well as in the Barak Valley. Then, a regionalist alliance of two fledgling but prominent regional groups comprising the Asom Jatiya Parishad (AJP), supported by the influential All Assam Students’ Union, and the Raijor Dal, which is backed by the left-oriented Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, may impact outcomes in the Assamese-dominated areas, mostly in Upper Assam. Despite unanimous resistance among opposition parties to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, they could not forge a pan-Assam coalition to counter the BJP. A State-wide counter-coalition would have been pragmatic given the BJP’s dominance. There are three reasons why the BJP could stitch and retain a regionalist coalition while the Congress failed to forge a State-wide counter-coalition. First, the deepening religious polarisation and consequent Hindu consolidation in favour of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had foreclosed the possibility for the AGP to expand electorally on its own. Though it could not secure a seat in the Lok Sabha in 2019, the AGP witnessed a marked increase in its contested vote share. Factionalism within the party and the gradual appropriation by the BJP of caste Hindu votes, tribal votes and the tea tribes’ votes reduced the possibilities for the AGP to expand its political base on its own. Thus, its dependency on the BJP grew. The party has been more pragmatic than ideological — it decided to be a part of the NDA while simultaneously opposing the CAA. The shift of traditional AGP voters, caste Hindus in particular, to the BJP has ensured that this dependency may continue till the time the BJP remains a dominant pole in the State. On the other hand, while the Congress-AIUDF alliance may reap electoral advantages in minority-dominated constituencies, it remains self-limiting in Upper Assam constituencies, which are marked by ethno-linguistic diversity and religious homogeneity. Second, the BJP’s strength also lies in projecting itself as representing indigeneity and the cultural identity of Assam. Its alliance with the UPPL and the fact that key leaders from the Ganashakti Party, which has a popular base among the Mising community, joined the BJP shows the national party’s aggressive alliance strategy. This not only puts it at an advantageous position but also helps it in its pursuit of cultivating an independent base among the indigenous groups. Third, the Sangh Parivar’s long-term strategy of cultivating a base among the tea tribes has significantly contributed to the BJP’s electoral stability in Upper Assam. Implementation of welfare schemes as well as negotiation of pay hikes for the tea workers have been aimed at retaining the support of this populous community. Despite the territorial concentration of a few ethnic groups, several constituencies in Upper Assam are ethnically diverse with the tea tribes’ votes having a considerable impact in the outcome of the elections. Mobilisation across sections With the BJP now dominating the landscape, its allies have become more dependent on it. This has shrunk the autonomous electoral space for the regional parties. The constitutive basis of such a compulsive coalition with the BJP can be attributed to two processes. First, the BJP appropriated the question of cultural identity and indigeneity and infused it with deeper religious meaning and symbols. Second, it further deepened the dependency of diverse ethnic groups on it through the creation of development councils and ensured representation in political bodies. Thus, religious-based mobilisation overtook the ethno-linguistic basis of political mobilisation in the State. While the opposition parties were in a dilemma over forging a counter-coalition fearing religious polarisation in Upper Assam, the NDA has maintained a pan-Assam regional alliance.

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||A robust economic relationship||Under the new U.S. administration, the economic relationship with India can be expected to be on the radar as India has enjoyed bipartisan support in the U.S. A closer economic partnership would bring gains to both sides in terms of GDP, employment, and productivity, given the complementary natures of their economies. From the industry perspective, a robust collaborative agenda would rest on a comprehensive set of actions which can take bilateral trade in goods and services to the desired goal of $500 billion. In the five years to 2019, bilateral trade grew at a CAGR of 7.7% per year to $146 billion. If we assume the same rate of growth, the $500 billion target will be achieved by 2036. To ensure this, the CAGR would need to be set at 11.9%. This is doable if the right policy actions are taken. CII has outlined key areas for collaboration. Areas for collaboration One, a collaborative response to the pandemic would contribute to global containment of the virus. Business partnerships are already taking place in the supply chain to ensure coordinated shipping, distribution, and last-mile connectivity. As India becomes the hub of global vaccine distribution, building confidence in the Indian IPR regime, reviving the U.S.-India Health Dialogue, and mutually recognising standards and approvals will help drive healthcare exchanges. Two, the macro trade architecture can be strengthened with a broad trade agreement focusing on resolving the low-hanging fruit. The U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum meetings can be revived along with a cross-sector track-2 group to look at convergence on issues such as market access. There is potential for flexibility from both sides for restoring the Generalised System of Preferences which would help lower duties for certain Indian products. The two countries should consider initiating discussions on a free trade agreement. Three, mobility of professional labour would aid trade in services. Recent regulations in the U.S. have impacted labour mobility which can be addressed through immigration reforms for employment-based visa backlogs and smooth and timely processes. The MoU on labour cooperation signed in 2011 could be updated in line with India’s recent labour regulatory changes. This may also be a good time to reconsider a totalisation agreement pertaining to social security, given that both have already entered into such agreements with many of the same partner countries. Four, defence industry ties can be stepped up in coordination with industry, as both sides benefit from U.S. technology and Indian manufacturing in this sector. A defence dialogue including the private sectors of both sides could help in co-production and co-development in the defence and aerospace sectors. Five, engagement of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can be stepped up. Smaller U.S. companies can find significant new opportunities for investments in India and sourcing from India. A U.S.-India SME CEOs Forum can be set up to catalyse such partnerships. Six, clean energy and climate change, high priorities of the U.S. administration, are also areas where India has made rapid strides. The U.S.-India Strategic Energy Partnership should be geared towards joint investments in industrial decarbonisation, carbon dioxide removal and green hydrogen. The programmes of Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Research, Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Deployment and Promoting Energy Access through Clean Energy must be relaunched. Seven, a digital economy partnership is critical. India has proved its mettle in this space with new opportunities opening up in robotics, space, AI and electric vehicles. It is also important to disseminate information on India’s IPR regime improvements and work towards taking India off the U.S. Trade Representative IPR priority watchlist. Other opportunities in the bilateral economic relationship include education, innovation and R&D, and agricultural trade and technology. Industry is confident that the relevant dialogue mechanisms will be instituted at the earliest.

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||A battle in the same vein||Tamil Nadu, which has seen tumultuous political changes in the last five years, is set for one more round of a familiar battle in the Assembly election on April 6. Its two principal parties, the DMK and the ruling AIADMK, have stitched up pre-poll alliances and taken the lion’s share of the 234 seats to be contested. Both parties have, by and large, retained their allies of the 2019 Lok Sabha election. While the Congress, which appears to be enthused by the visits of its leader Rahul Gandhi to the State, occupies the second slot in the DMK-led alliance with 25 seats, its national-level adversary, the BJP, after aggressive posturing, has had to be content with the 20 seats allotted to it in the AIADMK-led coalition. As this is the first Assembly election after the passing of Jayalalithaa and M. Karunanidhi, the AIADMK, in power for the last 10 years, and the DMK, both shorn of charismatic leaders, have thrown in offers of an unusually large number of freebies. The DMK, apart from making, in the run-up to its manifesto release, an offer of Rs. 1,000 a month to the woman-head of every family, has promised Rs. 4,000 to each pandemic-hit ration cardholder (around two crores totally); a subsidy of Rs. 100 per cooking gas cylinder and a reduction in petrol and diesel prices. The AIADMK’s assurances include Rs. 1,500 a month to the woman-head of each family, six cooking gas cylinders annually, a washing machine and solar-powered cook stove and a 50% subsidy in city bus fares for women. It is debatable how these promises will be kept as the State’s fiscal indicators, according to the Fifteenth Finance Commission’s report, have plunged, from 2012-13 to 2018-19. The parties and their allies should concentrate on substantive issues such as public health. The Commission has pointed out that the prevalence of anaemia among women and children is 55% and 50.7%, against the national average of 53.1% and 58.6%. Neither party has addressed such issues satisfactorily in their manifestos. There are other parties such as the MNM, led by veteran actor Kamal Haasan, the AMMK of T.T.V. Dhinakaran and the NTK of actor-director Seeman. Heterogenous in character, the first two are apparently positioning themselves as serious contenders, with the NTK seeking to don the role of a neo-Tamil nationalist party. Opinion polls point to the likelihood of the DMK-led front securing a comfortable majority, while the ruling party is trying to play catch-up using the governance track record of CM Edappadi K. Palaniswami. As of now, the campaign has been devoid of personal attacks. But, it would take a lot more doing on the part of the principal players to keep at bay forces thriving on parochialism, divisive politics and hate culture.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-battle-in-the-same-vein/article34087191.ece
17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Bridging the gap||A severe deficit in the number of OBC, SC, ST candidates recruited as faculty in Central institutes of higher education has been revealed by Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal in Parliament, drawing attention once again to the pallid state of reservation in some of India’s elite institutions. Some of the striking data show 62% unfilled vacancies for SC in the IIMs and 90% for OBC in the IISc, while vacant positions are on average about 38% to 52%, taking Central Universities, IISERs, IIT (non-faculty), IGNOU, and Sanskrit Central Universities into account. The data confirm that the trend seen earlier in the IIT system extends to many more institutions, highlighting a serious mismatch between the government’s equity-building goals and actual recruitment outcomes. In the case of the IITs, an official committee suggested that the way out would be to exempt these institutions from reservation, as provided for under the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act, 2019, or to dereserve lower faculty positions after a year, if suitable candidates from the beneficiary communities are not found. This cannot obviously be a salutary course for official policy, when the reservation system, envisaged as an improvement on western ideals of affirmative action, is widely seen as the shortest path to equality and equity. What could help bridge the gap is a better understanding of the lacunae in the education system, marked by a sea of deprived public schools and colleges, hyper-commercialised private universities and colleges and islands of elite institutions such as the IIMs. The failure of the Central higher education institutions to recruit faculty to all the reserved positions is usually attributed to the absence of enough qualified candidates, as the Education Ministry’s committee for IITs did. One of the forward-looking remedial measures suggested by the panel was to start government-sponsored preparatory programmes, which would both equip aspiring faculty, and create a pool of research talent. This has merit in the context of management, science and other disciplines, and in the short term, could help qualified individuals overcome the deficiencies of their preparatory years. Such courses would also make these institutions of higher learning more socially responsive, meeting the goal of addressing historical deprivation of communities based on caste. Yet, there are larger questions that need answers, and which continue to be agitated in courts. One of them is whether there should not be even greater attention devoted to the most marginalised within the reserved categories, such as SC, since trickle down quota benefits for them are scarce. The egalitarian answer would be to continue expanding the pie of opportunity in the public realm, through ever greater funding of quality universal education at all levels and aiding the deprived through affirmative action on the road to equality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bridging-the-gap/article34087192.ece

As we have more than once pointed out, the school does not now enjoy about half the popularity that it did in the days of Mr. Havell. It would appear that pure art is seriously neglected in the School, while in the matter of industrial art it has yet to establish a reputation. Mr. Hadaway, the present Principal of the School, appears to be a gentleman who prefers the Arcadian methods of education. He is an enthusiastic exponent of the doctrine that “anatomy and geometry has never yet been of real service in making an artist” and expects his students to be geniuses to blossom forth, solely by dint of hard work in drawing from figures of objects and without the adventitious aid of anatomy and geometry, into great artists. Mr. Hadaway’s position that the importance of the ability to draw accurately cannot be too strongly emphasised as a fundamental equipment of an artist is understandable, but, surely, one who sticks to mere drawing for all time to come can never become an artist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/madras-school-of-arts-from-an-editorial/article34087200.ece

17 March 2021||New Delhi,||Fuel demand has returned to pre-COVID levels: IOC’s Vaidya||India’s fuel demand, except for aviation turbine fuel, has returned to pre-COVID levels and a reflating economy will help consumption grow in the near future, the head of the nation’s top oil firm said on Tuesday. Fuel sales had fallen a record 45.8% in April when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to check the spread of coronavirus infections. Demand started to recover with the easing of lockdown restrictions, with petrol returning to normal growth first and now diesel too reaching pre-COVID levels. “Except for ATF, we have touched normal demand,” Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said. “We are back on track.” While petrol sales had reached pre-COVID levels a few months ago, diesel sales had risen 7.4% year-on-year in the first half of March. LPG sales had shown growth even during the lockdown. With airlines not operating all flights, ATF sales remain below normal. “ATF may take a quarter’s time to return to normal, maybe 3-4 months,” he said. IOC, he said, was bullish about fuel demand recovery as the economy grows. “Let’s hope for the best with the vaccine roll-out,” he added. Diesel sales in the first half of March rose to 2.84 million tonnes while petrol demand climbed 5.3% to 1.05 million tonnes. This is the first annual rise in petrol sales since October. ATF sales, which fell more than 80% in the aftermath of the lockdown, was down 36.5% in the first half of March. India’s economy returned to growth in the last quarter as real GDP is estimated to have expanded 0.4% year-on-year after two quarters of contraction. OPEC’s monthly report last week forecast a 13.6% jump in India’s oil demand in 2021 to 4.99 million barrels per day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fuel-demand-has-returned-to-pre-covid-levels-iocs-vaidya/article34087183.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Taxation slowing growth of luxury cars in India: Mercedes||India needs to review the overall taxation of premium luxury cars which is slowing the growth of such vehicles in the country, said Martin Schwenk, MD & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India. “Duties schemes, taxation is a massive burden...that is slowing the growth. So, we will have growth, but will not have exponential growth,” Mr. Schwenk said. “To come to really stronger growth, it would require more measures than we as a manufacturer can do.... we can only do so much in terms of cost,” he added. The company, which on Tuesday unveiled the new E-Class at a price starting from Rs. 63.6 lakh, is also not ‘actively thinking’ to use India as a production hub at the moment owing to the lack of domestic demand, he said. Mr. Schwenk said the company was currently producing 11 models locally and may add another one in the next few months, but would not substantially change the way it operated in India. “We have looked at the PLI scheme... the complexity for us is, any production we would set up in India would also require a strong domestic market,” he said. “And without a strong domestic footprint, it is very difficult to put investment here and then basically export into other countries because then one essential link is missing,” the MD said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/taxation-slowing-growth-of-luxury-cars-in-india-mercedes/article34087178.ece

The new framework would address issues related to delays in receipt of mandate by investors for blocking of funds due to systemic issues at intermediaries and failure to unblock the funds in cases of partial allotment by the next working day from the finalisation of Basis of Allotment, SEBI said in a circular. Other issues that would be addressed include Self Certified Syndicate Banks (SCSBs) blocking multiple amounts for the same Unified Payment Interface application. In case of delays, SCSBs would pay Rs. 100 per day or 15% p.a. of the application amount, whichever is higher, to investors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sebi-tweak-to-quicken-ipo-funds-reconciliation/article34087180.ece
17 March 2021||New Delhi,||Retailers reach 93% of pre-COVID sales: RAI||The retail industry’s business is on the brink of full recovery as it achieved 93% of pre-COVID sales in February, according to a report. Segments such as consumer durables and quick service restaurants (QSR) have shown growth of 15% and 18% respectively in February 2021, the report from the Retailers Association of India (RAI) said. “The quantum of de-growth in retail sales has reduced as most segments in retail have started to show significant improvement,” it said. Categories such as footwear, beauty, wellness and personal care, sports goods and food and grocery are showing steady month-on-month recovery. “The 13th edition of the Retail Business Survey by the Retailers Association of India (RAI) indicates sales in February 2021 were at -7% of last year’s sales on a year-on-year (y-o-y) comparison and at -18% in Q3FY21 on a y-o-y comparison,” it said. Recovery across regions was showing steady improvement, with eastern India indicating growth of 2% in February. “Southern and Northern India have recovered better with sales nearing pre-COVID-19 levels at -6% and -9% respectively (y-o-y), while Western India has progressed slower at -16%,” it said. RAI CEO Kumar Rajagopalan said retailers were hopeful of achieving pre-pandemic levels of business in the first six months of 2021. “It is heartening to see recovery across categories. We hope that the uncertainty regarding the rising cases of COVID-19 in a few States will not cast its shadow on the growth momentum with the roll-out of the vaccine,” he added. After the pandemic, it has become imperative for retailers to adopt ‘phygital’ — be it social media, messaging platforms, or digital shopping, in addition to their normal channels to align themselves with the changing consumer mindsets, he noted. Recovery would need unconventional solutions and government support, RAI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retailers-reach-93-of-pre-covid-sales-rai/article34087189.ece
17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Tackle CNG vehicle cost, bring it under GST’||India needs to bring CNG under the GST regime and tackle challenges such as high vehicle cost and limited boot space for the growth of the natural gas vehicle market, according to a report by Nomura Research Institute Consulting & Solutions India. The report on ‘natural gas vehicle (NGV) market’ stated that the CNG vehicle market has seen compounded annual growth rate of 7% to 33.76 lakh units in March 2020 from March 2016, mainly driven by passenger vehicles (cars and taxis). The demand for such vehicles, however, is concentrated in Maharashtra (30%), Gujarat (29%), Delhi (23%), Uttar Pradesh (9%), and Haryana (5%). “India has large domestic reserves of natural gas as compared to crude oil. India has explored about 5 trillion cubic metres of recoverable reserves, of which less than 0.5% is used as fuel in the current CNG fleet,” it said. High vehicle volume and favourable conditions in the Indian automotive market presented an opportunity to promote NGVs, it added.

17 March 2021||Ahmedabad,||Clinical Buttler makes short work of chase, England goes 2-1 up||A whirlwind unbeaten 52-ball 83 from Jos Buttler guided England past India by eight wickets in the third T20I here on Tuesday. Chasing 157, Buttler’s blitz at the top of the order took England past the finish line with 10 deliveries to spare. The visitors grabbed a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. Taking charge Buttler assumed control after Jason Roy was dismissed cheaply in the fourth over. Buttler was severe on leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who bowled in the PowerPlay instead of Washington Sundar. Chahal, slow through the air, was carted by Buttler for two straight sixes. Buttler’s offensive powered England to 57 for one in the first six overs, taking the air out of the Indians. Washington gave his side some hope when he had Dawid Malan stumped for 18, with a flat, 102-kmph fizzer. Next man Jonny Bairstow, however, kept Buttler safe company to finish with an unbeaten 40. Buttler recorded his highest-ever T20I score, going past his previous best of 77 not out, made against Australia last year. The Indian fielding was shoddy, with Virat Kohli dropping Buttler on 76 and Chahal giving Bairstow a life two overs later. After being put in, it took some late fireworks from Kohli (77 n.o., 46b, 8x4, 4x6) to push India to a respectable total. The England bowlers were brilliant for the most part, but succumbed to pressure at the death. Pacers Jofra Archer and Mark Wood were particularly impressive, generating great pace and steep bounce. Wood got opener K.L. Rahul with a peach, the ball cutting in late to hit the stumps. Rahul, who now has scores of 1, 0 and 0 in this series, was squared up and cut an embarrassing figure. Rohit Sharma, back from rest, was scratchy, falling to a pull for 15. Ishan Kishan, the hero of the second T20I, was dismissed in similar fashion, getting a top edge off Chris Jordan. Needless run-out Kohli and Rishabh Pant (25, 20b, 3x4) batted sensibly to put on 40 runs for the fourth wicket, before an unnecessary run out cost Pant’s wicket. Having completed a comfortable double, Pant was pushed to take the third by an eager Kohli after a fumble by wicketkeeper Buttler. Pant, who had backed up well beyond the stumps, stood no chance of making the crease at the other end. It was a most untimely dismissal, which left India at a precarious 64 for four. The home team stuttered to 100 in 16 overs — in desperate need of acceleration. Kohli answered the call, swatting Jordan over the square-leg fence. Wood faced a worse fate in the next over, being carted by Kohli for maximums over mid-wicket and long-off. At the other end, Hardik Pandya (17, 15b, 2x6) was not at his best, but managed to carve out two sixes in the point and third-man region. The pyrotechnics helped India rack up 56 runs in the last four overs, but it was not enough to tilt the match in its favour. In a surprise move, the Indian team management decided to leave Suryakumar Yadav out of the eleven, despite the Mumbai cricketer not facing a ball in his debut match on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/clinical-buttler-makes-short-work-of-chase-england-goes-2-1-up/article34087289.ece
17 March 2021||Madrid,||Messi spectacular against Huesca||Lionel Messi scored a spectacular double the same night he equalled Xavi Hernandez’s appearance record for Barcelona, the Argentinian inspiring his team to a 4-1 win over Huesca on Monday. Messi tied Xavi’s 767 games in all competitions for Barca and marked yet another milestone with a brilliant brace, a curling effort in the first half flying in off the crossbar at Camp Nou before a late shot nestled in the corner. “He’s the most important man in the history of Barca,” said coach Ronald Koeman. “Even better that he’s still with us.” Antoine Griezmann had earlier followed suit with another impressive shot into the top corner before Huesca pulled one back, Rafa Mir converting a doubtful penalty on the stroke of half-time. But Messi helped Barca pull away, sending in a cross for Oscar Mingueza to head in and then scoring his second as the Catalans moved to within four points of league leader Atletico Madrid. Messi made it 13 consecutive campaigns with 20 LaLiga goals.  Diogo Jota scored the winner against his former club as Liverpool beat Wolverhampton 1-0 in an English Premier League match that ended with Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio being carried off with a head injury on Monday.  The goalkeeper didn’t finish the game after being struck on the head in the 87th minute by the knee of teammate Conor Coady, who was running back into his area. Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo gave a positive update on Patricio’s condition after the game, saying: “He’s OK. He is conscious, he remembers what happened, he is aware. He is OK.”  The results: LaLiga: Barcelona 4 (Messi 13, 90, Griezmann 35, Mingueza 53) bt SD Huesca 1 (Mir 45+4-pen).   Premier League: Wolves 0 Liverpool 1 (Jota 45+2) .

17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||Virat Kohli’s message is clear: batsmen will be judged by intent||When India started playing One-Day Internationals, they saw the format as a contraction of five-day cricket. “We played one-day cricket like we did Tests,” admitted their first captain Ajit Wadekar years later. To be fair, there wasn’t too much to go by — the data revolution accompanying T20 cricket was many decades away. In any case, India looked at ODI with disdain, and little effort was made to understand its specific needs. History repeated itself when T20 was evolving. India won the first World Cup, but team selection and tactics were redolent of the 50-over game. The emphasis was on keeping wickets in hand for the final assault, for instance, and batsmen still had the luxury of getting their eye in. This latter is anathema to T20 cricket where, with just 120 balls to negotiate, batsmen could not be allowed such indulgence (unless you were Chris Gayle, but he is an exception). Attack is key T20 is a different sport from either of the other two formats of the game. It took India a while to realise this. For long they were happy to pick players based on “white ball” performances in formats that were distinct from each other. Now there is an acknowledgement of its main elements: attack is the platform on which batsmen build their innings, while bowlers think in terms of single deliveries (which is just over four percent of their quota) rather than overall plans. The batsman attacks, the bowler defends in an inversion of the traditional. Before the start of the current T20 series, India skipper Virat Kohli set down a mission statement: “We want to be a side that plays free cricket,” he said, “you will see guys more expressive and being much more positive (from now on).” He thus pointed to an essential truth: what is good for the individual player — playing himself in and getting a decent score — is often not good for the team as a whole. Success has to be measured in terms of attempts made and context, not necessarily runs scored. A 30 in 12 balls is more valuable than 50 in 50. Averages and strike rates paint incomplete pictures. The captain is, in effect, telling his players to attack early and not hold back for fear of lack of depth in the batting. A few things had to come together before Kohli could make the promise implied in that. Accent on younger, fitter batsmen One, the accent had to be on younger, fitter batsmen suitably trained by exposure to international trends in the IPL. Players like Rishabh Pant and now Ishan Kishan bat with a confidence and a healthy disregard for personal glory that is a departure from the old way. This in turn comes from the clear message from the management: you will occasionally be dismissed cheaply doing the right thing for the team, but that will not be held against you. Two, the conscious moving away from over-reliance on one or two players at the top and a better spread of batting skills. This allows the early batsmen to play without worry while giving the lower order opportunities to contribute and gain confidence. Few teams get dismissed in 120 balls anyway. A team could lose a wicket every 12 balls and still play out the 20 overs. Three, the jettisoning of many features of the traditional game in the pursuit of the one thing that matters — victory. When Kohli tried to play Ben Stokes down the leg side in the second T20I, he managed only to edge him for a six over third-man. There are no marks for aesthetics in T20 cricket. A badly struck boundary trumps an elegant shot for a single every time. Four, the emergence of the six-hitters. India are still six-shy relative to the other teams, but the likes of Pant, Kishan, Hardik Pandya, and lower down the order Shardul Thakur hold out promise. As tactics get more sophisticated, there could be a nominated six-hitter at No. 7 or 8. Fielders won’t matter because the batsmen are aiming to clear everything and everybody. Practising six-hitting is already part of a batsman’s drill. The technique will mature. When India lost in the semifinals of the 2016 World T20, they had made 192 batting first. The West Indies won in the 20th over, losing just three wickets. The winners struck nearly thrice as many sixes (11 to 4), and that was an important difference. Hitting the ball into the crowd is, to many, the essence of T20 cricket, and the more players in the team who can do that, the better off it is. Five, and possibly the most important, the introduction of big data which decides everything from player selection to match tactics. Coaches have got better at interpreting the data, and players at understanding them. Kohli’s message acknowledges this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/virat-kohlis-message-is-clear-batsmen-will-be-judged-by-intent/article34087185.ece
17 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Indian bowling unit needs to fire||It is a challenge for India to be efficient in unfriendly bowling conditions. India did fight without its bowling spearhead Jhulan Goswami in the fourth one-dayer. The team also posted its best total of 266 when the openers failed to fire. There are a lot of positives for the Indian team, even as it trails 1-3 in the series, having lost three matches when batting first. It is a challenge for both the teams to win a match after losing the toss. Better response There is no doubt that South Africa has responded better to the conditions, built on the luck of winning the toss. Its catching and fielding have been exceptional. The batting has fared brilliantly, with openers Lizelle Lee and Laura Wolvaardt playing a significant role. They have scored 442 runs combined in the four matches. From starting the innings with two sixes in the first over and winding up the show with two fours in the 29th over, opener Smriti Mandhana was top class in the second one-dayer when India won. Smriti, along with Harmanpreet Kaur, has the ability to help India win matches, even while batting first in these conditions. When Punam Raut scored a flawless century in the fourth game, the Indian bowling was below par and unable to extinguish the Proteas batting firepower. Onus on spinners On the eve of the fifth match, leg-spinner Poonam Yadav did concede, while addressing the media, that the spinners had the onus to stop the run flow, if unable to take wickets. The team’s best bat so far, the other Punam, had talked about the need for bowling discipline and operating to a plan. India needs to come up with an improved all-round show if it aspires to bridge the gap in the five-match series, before the three T20Is.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-bowling-unit-needs-to-fire/article34087285.ece

The English opener had special words of praise for pacer Mark Wood who starred with figures of three for 31 and set the tone, removing India’s openers. “He [Wood] had a huge impact on the game. Any time you see him get a ball in his hand, be it Tests, 50 overs or T20, he is in fantastic rhythm. He is bowling extremely quickly and together with Jofra [Archer], the pace those guys can bowl, it's quite intimidating. “To take early wickets is always a huge benefit in T20 cricket and it put India back and did not allow them to attack early on in their innings. It was a huge moment in the game, how well those guys bowled.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wood-had-a-huge-impact-buttler/article34087780.ece

Rahul, who has scored just one run in the three matches of the T20I series so far. “Anybody can have a lean phase. KL [Rahul] was our best batsman in T20s last year. He had an average of 45, with a strike rate of around 145. Three failures does not change the fact that Rahul was our best T20 batsman last year. This is the time when we need to support him as a team. One good knock will help him get back in form,” Rathour said on Tuesday. In all three matches so far, the team batting first has lost. Rathour believes that batting first at the Narendra Modi Stadium poses a challenge. “The pitch has been difficult to assess. The bounce is sticky when batting first. Today also we saw some variable bounce. It has been tough, but having already played three games here, we hope to do better in the next two matches,” Rathour said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-gets-rathours-backing/article34087782.ece
17 March 2021||Birmingham,||Sindhu & Co. chase elusive title||P.V. Sindhu will look to shrug off her demoralising Swiss Open final defeat and take advantage of a depleted field when she spearheads India’s challenge at the prestigious All England Open badminton championships, beginning here on Wednesday. Carolina though has pulled out of the prestigious tournament due to an injury. Also missing in action will be the Chinese, Koreans and Chinese Taipei shuttlers, who decided not to compete in the Super 1000 event as it is not part of the Tokyo Olympic qualification period. It affects the quality of the competition but also provides the 19-member Indian contingent an opportunity to go deep in the draw and recapture the trophy which has been won by just two Indians so far — the legendary Prakash Padukone (1980) and P Gopi Chand (2001). While former world number one Saina Nehwal had a runner-up finish in 2015, Sindhu’s best finish was a semifinal in 2018. Among other Indians, K.

Fifth seed Sindhu will kick off her campaign with a clash against Malaysia’s Soniia Cheah and is likely to face Japan’s Akane Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals. Saina has drawn in-form seventh seed Mia Blichfeldt of Denmark in her first round and might meet Scotland’s Kristy Gilmour next. In men’s singles, Srikanth will open against Tommy Sugiarto of Indonesia, while B. Sai Praneeth will take on France’s Toma Junior Popov and is likely to clash next with second seed Viktor Axelsen, who has won the two Super 1000 titles in Thailand, and the Swiss Open. P. Kashyap will open against world number one Japanese Kento Momota, who is returning to international circuit after a horrific car accident last year that saw him undergo an eye surgery. H.S. Prannoy will meet Malaysia’s Daren Liew. In men’s doubles, Satwik and Chirag will open against Eloi Adam and Julien Maio of France, while mixed doubles pair of Satwik and Ashwini Ponnappa will square off against Japanese combo of Yuki Kaneko and Misaki Matsutomo. In women’s doubles, Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy will take on Benyapa Aimsaard and Nuntakarn Aimsaard of Thailand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-co-chase-elusive-title/article34087320.ece

17 March 2021||PATIALA,||Sreeshankar jumps to new National mark, qualifies for Tokyo||For almost three years, Murali Sreeshankar had been battling disappointment, frustration and questions on his ability. On Tuesday, the long jumper silenced them all, qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics with an 8.26m jump that evoked a rare scream from the usually mild-mannered athlete on Day Two of the Federation Cup. The 21-year-old bettered his own 2018 National Record of 8.20m and admitted it was a mix of emotions. Proving a point “It’s been a long wait after 2018; 2019 was a rough year and 2020 was the COVID year. For a long time, a lot of people had been saying 8.20 was my peak and I took it personally. There was a point to prove and I am glad I did it,” said an ecstatic Sreeshankar. Through the lockdown, Sreeshankar kept training at home, within a bubble, with his cousins. “I dedicate this achievement to them. When everything was closed, they trained with me and it would not have been possible without them or my father,” he said. He was also honest in his assessment of the road ahead. “When I did 8.20 my calibre was 8-8.10m at best. But I believe my ability at the moment is 8.40m. I am slowly getting into the rhythm and having all jumps over 8m today is a great sign because the competition out there is very tough. One occasional jump of 8.26 will not be enough to sustain, I need to stay in the 8.20-plus mark consistently,” he explained.

17 March 2021||PATIALA,||Emergence of the new sprint queen Dhanalakshmi||Dutee Chand has been the undisputed Indian queen of the track in the 100m for long. But 22-year old Dhanalakshmi from Tiruchi had other ideas when she landed here for the Federation Cup. On Tuesday, she snapped Dutee’s winning streak extending back to 2015 with a scorching 11.39-second run to win the title. It was just a tad slower than her personal best of 11.38 set in the heats the previous day, a time that made people sit up and take note. Tuesday proved it wasn’t a fluke. It was a huge leap from her previous best of 11.48, set at the Tamil Nadu Open Championships in January.  “I was confident before coming here, I had prepared well for this event. I was determined to win. I knew I was competing against Hima Das and Dutee but that was the extra motivation for me. The spotlight is always on them, no one bothers about the others and I was determined to change that,” she told The Hindu after the race. It wasn’t arrogance but faith in what her coach had told her, to trust her abilities. Training under 31-year old Manikanda Arunmugam — himself a sprinter who still competes in departmental and State meets — at the Police Stadium back home, Dhanalakshmi though prefers the 200m. Gradual beginning “She and Elakkiyadasan (Kannadasan, second in the men’s 100m here) both started coming to the same ground as me 2-3 years ago. It began gradually but for the last one year I have taken a break to train them full-time. “The only reason is to ensure they do not repeat the mistakes I made and get proper guidance. I am glad it is giving results,” Arumugam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/emergence-of-the-new-sprint-queen-dhanalakshmi/article34087318.ece
17 March 2021||KOCHI,||Just the beginning for Neeraj and Sreeshankar, says Sumariwalla||Though Indian athletes are returning to the track after a long break forced by the global pandemic and though it's still early season, there have been some exceptional performances in the last few days. Apart from the national records from javelin throwers Neeraj Chopra, Annu Rani and long jumper M. Sreeshankar, there have been some stunning improvement from athletes like Amoj Jacob. The Athletics Federation of India feels that the good times, and good performances, will continue. “I don’t think it’s too early, I think it’s just the beginning for Neeraj and Sreeshankar,” said Adille Sumariwalla, the AFI president, after the second day’s action in the Federation Cup in Patiala on Tuesday evening. With news coming in that two athletes, including a leading woman quartermiler, had failed dope tests, there are many wondering how genuine the outstanding performances are. But the AFI chief had an answer for that. Zero tolerance to doping “Don't degrade the performances of athletes like Neeraj and others. We have zero tolerance to doping. If somebody is caught doping, he or she will face the consequences from WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) and NADA (National Anti-Doping Agency) and the law,” said Sumariwalla.  He also revealed that Asian Games champions and national record holders Jinson Johnson (middle distance runner) and Arpinder Singh (triple jumper) are not focusing on this July's Olympics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/just-the-beginning-for-neeraj-and-sreeshankar-says-sumariwalla/article34087529.ece

They also show that this depends on many factors such as one's past karma, single minded desire for this goal, proficiency in the sastras, adherence to truth and dharma, grace of the preceptors, and above all the grace of the Supreme Being. Just as Valmiki and Kalidasa were blessed by Devi's grace with the gift of poetic vision, the Devi Bhagavata Purana relates how one Satyavrata is conferred with jnana by Her grace at the appropriate time, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. Owing to the curse of a rishi, Satyavrata is a fool by birth though born in a reputed brahmana family. Distraught, he speaks rarely and eventually leaves his home to live in solitude on the banks of the Ganga. In due course, people are impressed by his commitment to truth, his austere way of life and his vairagya. Once, a wounded boar rushes into his hermitage and hides in the bushes. The hunter follows the boar and asks Satyavrata if he has seen it. Now, Satyavrata debates the dilemma in his mind — speak the truth and endanger the life of the boar or speak an untruth to save it. For, if speaking the truth results in loss of life, it cannot be called truth. Likewise, even untruth, when tempered by mercy for the welfare of others, becomes truth. At this moment, Devi grants him the jnana and he utters the following words filled with philosophical wisdom to the hunter, “Why are you asking me this question? That force which sees, never speaks; that force which speaks, never sees.” The hunter is disappointed and leaves knowing that he would not get any information on the boar from him. Since then, Satyavrata became a celebrated realised soul who only spoke the truth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/highest-attainment/article34087278.ece

He has such a charming smile, and Basil is such a lovely character, that I felt like I said hello to him” he says. The composer, who had long been writing music for theatre, has scored the original era-appropriate music for the Netflix film — which received five BAFTA 2021 nominations — based on the book by John Preston and on the real-life discovery of a ship from the Dark Ages in Sutton Hoo, in pre-Second World War Britain. During a video call from his home in Australia, Gregory explains how the audience appreciation around an OTT is different from that of theatre. “Millions of people watched The Dig in the first few days — that’s amazing. With theatre, the feedback is immediate. This is different because we finished it months ago and it just came out now, but I’ve had so long to sit with it and wait,” he starts. “I do a lot of work in theatre where the production is based on a novel which is turned into a script,” he reflects, “sometimes I read the original piece of work, but most of the time, it can be distracting. I did some research about Sutton Hoo because it was important for me to know the area and the landscape and the history of the time, but I didn’t read the novel, because I was scoring this project.” Gregory, for whom The Dig is his first feature film, was brought on board by long-time collaborator director Simon Stone, with whom he has worked for almost a decade. This entailed a lot of trust given there is a responsibility to the real history behind Sutton Hoo. “Initially, we talked about orchestral music of the period,” explains Gregory, “and we knew there was going to be a lot of landscape. So it made sense to start in that world. The score and instrumentation are based in tradition but it is also quite contemporary, because a lot of the filmmaking is as well; for example, the handheld shots in the field in the beginning of the film. The concert hall music of that era was going to be adapted a lot as the music has a different structure and purpose. Music, in its own way, has to tell a story.”     The film and editing has an almost dream-like quality to it...The score also felt right for it Gregory Stefan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/scoring-for-film-is-a-delicate-process/article34087494.ece

The film, due for release last year, is scheduled to hit theatres soon. “When the song was done, I liked it and I knew people would like it but not this much. My inbox is filled with covers of that song,” she says. The song is her second outing with composer Kailas Menon; she made her debut as playback singer in Edakkad Battalion 06 (2019) for which he composed music. Another song of hers that did well is ‘ Vathikkalu Vellaripravu …’ from Sufiyum Sujathayum . She has also sung the Tamil and Telugu versions of the song. Nithya landed her first song rather serendipitously when Menon called her to sing the track (dummy version of the song) of ‘Hima Mazhayayi Varu…’ in Edakkad…  “His mother came across a video of me singing; she told him about me, and that’s how he asked me for voice demos, thus leading to my first break.” Producer Sandra Thomas and Menon liked what they heard and retained Nithya’s version. Though lockdown brought the film industry to a standstill, Nithya is happy about the chances she has had. “I got to work with music director M Jayachandran ( Sufiyum Sujathayum ) and Ishaan Chabbra for Abrid Shine’s Kung Fu Master . Both were such wonderful opportunities; with Chabbra, the work was done remotely. I sang the song with Karthik and though we did not ‘sing together’, it is an experience I’m happy about.” It is not all film music; she recently sang for music director Mejjo Joseph’s single, ‘Mayathe’, along with Harish Sivaramakrishnan. She has been singing covers for her YouTube channel for a while, though she confesses that it did not have many viewers. All that changed post her playback debut. “‘Hima Mazhavayi Varu’ changed everything.” Nithya had been learning Hindustani music back home in Thiruvananthapuram; which she took up again on moving to Kochi, with Bernie of composer duo Bernie-Ignatius.   Nithya’s playback singing debut was in 2019 Malayalam filmEdakkad Battalion 06, which had music by Kailas Menon||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lucky-break/article34087496.ece
17 March 2021||March 17 2021 00:00 IST,||A tale of broken hearts||Punjabi indie artiste Dilnoor’s latest track ‘Koi Hor’ has caught the attention of music lovers — both for its catchy lyrics and the storyline adopted by its music video. The concept is broken hearts: it features a cheating husband and a heartbroken wife, but by the time the former comes to his senses, the latter is gone forever and he is filled with regret. The track, which also features singers B Praak and Afsana Khan, has been viewed over 10 million times on YouTube since being uploaded a week ago. Says Dilnoor, sharing his responses via e-mail, “The story touches everyone’s hearts as it makes people connect with reality. So, the more people find the connection, the more numbers of views ‘Koi Hor’ will have.” Edited excerpts: Is ‘Koi Hor’ the big break for you? Yes, it is. It is all because of my mentor B Praak; he has a profound role in my skill development and his training will come in handy in different stages of my career. His support has been valuable in encouraging me to work hard. The response from the industry has been amazing too.  Tell us how you conceptualised the story line for the music video...  The song would not have worked without the lyrics by Gurnazar Chattha. I feel the lyrics got us into the zone. Most of us have felt such heartbreak, and most often, we do end up feeling that our partner could have reached out to us and confessed instead of us getting to know about it through someone else. Afsana’s soulful voice is a highlight. How is it like collaborating with such names at an early stage of your career?  Its a dream to work with such top names in the industry. I made sure that I delivered a song that hit the highest standards of quality because I was working with them. What genre of music would you like to explore going forward? Is Bollywood on the anvil?  The best part of breaking up (a reference to ‘Koi Hor’) is not the making up. That rarely happens and when it does, it often leads to more breaking up. So, now is the chance for me to wear pyjama bottoms past noon and indulge in some serious self-reflection — this journey into the self can be scary, but it can make you a stronger person. So, maybe, I want to make blues music or sad-pop. About going mainstream, I look forward to seeing if my style of songs will attract Bollywood or international audiences. What are you working on next?  I can’t disclose it now, but I hope my efforts will bear fruit and enhance the lives of many people, and that God keeps me motivated to deliver more successful projects in the future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-tale-of-broken-hearts/article34087489.ece
17 March 2021||New Delhi,||Changes to NCT Act revive power tussle||Three decades after it was enacted, significant amendments have been proposed to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, bringing contradictions between the Central and Delhi governments to the fore once again.  The Hindu spoke to a cross-section of legislative officials, constitutional experts and political analysts on the impact and import of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Some were of the opinion that the new Bill would seek to render the office of the Chief Minister as a vestigial organ in the name of simplifying administration in the Capital. Others sought to argue it would iron out “needless” issues arising out of politics in a city where the Lieutenant-Governor had “always been the government”. Senior advocate at the Supreme Court Rebecca John said the Act would snatch away from the residents of Delhi the accountability and answerability they sought from the elected representatives and hand them to a nominated official. “It [the Act] would be a tragedy since Delhi has long sought statehood; that the longstanding wish of the city’s residents should fructify in this way is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution,” she said. “The will of the people cannot be thwarted in this way,” she added. Federal principles Professor Pradip Kumar Datta, an independent academic formerly associated with JNU, said the Act seemed to go against the federal principles and was a setback for popular representation. “Centralisation has been increasing in both formal and informal ways after this government came to power at the Centre. This [Act] will seemingly just speed up the pace of centralisation of power,” he said. The amendment, according to senior advocate at the Supreme Court Sanjay Hegde, would set in motion a reversal of the clock on statehood for Delhi which was the BJP’s own demand in the past. The Bill seemed to negate whatever small gains had accrued to the Delhi government after its tussle with the Centre reached the judiciary, he said. “It appears that the office of the Chief Minister [of Delhi] is being sought to be rendered as a vestigial organ,” he said. According to Manisha Priyam, political analyst and researcher, the Bill may seek to clarify who or what the term “government” meant in the city but residents may not necessarily take kindly to the exercise. Governance in a city like Delhi presented many challenges which could be confronted better through synchronised efforts at helping those among its lowest strata. “Over the last several decades, this city has tasted democracy and witnessed a robust democratic process. People may not take very kindly to losing such significant aspects of living in Delhi,” she said. “A majority of residents have tenuous lifestyles and administration here would be better handled with the deepening of democracy, not by weakening it,” she said. K.S. Mehra, a former bureaucrat who led the unified Municipal Corporations of Delhi as Commissioner, saw the step as one in the right direction. “In the [Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi] Act, 1991, it is already clear that the Lieutenant-Governor is the government. This [amendment] seems to be a positive step for the welfare of the people of Delhi,” he said. S.K. Sharma, a constitutional expert said the two governments — the Centre and the Delhi governments — were not concurrent. The first one is the actual government while the other falls under the definition of what B.R. Ambedkar called local administration. “The Delhi Assembly, as far as the larger constitutional picture is concerned, is not comparable to other legislatures because Delhi is not a State. It [the Assembly] is just a small set-up of elected representatives whom the L-G can consult from time to time,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/changes-to-nct-act-revive-power-tussle/article34087517.ece
17 March 2021||Kolkata,||No cakewalk for celeb candidates this time in Bengal||Among the many changes that Trinamool Congress (TMC) chairperson and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee ushered in in West Bengal politics was introducing actors and celebrities from the field of culture into politics. From yesteryear stars such as Moon Moon Sen to present-day actors like Dev, Ms. Banerjee successfully used their star appeal and reaped political dividends. Even in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, she sprang a surprise by nominating Nusrat Jahan and Mimi Chakraborty, who went on to become Lok Sabha MPs from Basirhat and Jadavpur respectively. However, in the bitterly contested 2021 Assembly polls in West Bengal, the situation is slightly different. Both the TMC and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have fielded a number of actors and celebrities but it is not going to be a cakewalk for them. The TMC has fielded actor Saayoni Ghosh from Asansol Dakshin, a constituency that the BJP has maintained a lead in in the past few elections. Union Minister Babul Supriyo had won the Asansol seat twice, in 2014 and 2019. The same is the case for filmmaker and well-known director Raj Chakraborty who has been nominated from Barrackpore Assembly seat. Not only will Mr. Chakraborty have to grapple with discontent in the party but he is also pitted against BJP MP Arjun Singh, who maintains his sway in this seat. Similarly, another actor, Sayantika Ghosh, has been fielded by the ruling party in West Bengal from Bankura, an Assembly constituency where the BJP had a lead of over 40,000 votes in 2019. A look at the BJP actor candidates also shows a similar predicament. Among the actors who joined the BJP, the party has nominated them in seats where the TMC is strong. Payel Sarkar has been picked for Behala Purba and Anjana Basu in Sonarpur South – both the seats are Trinamool bastions. Even for Mr. Supriyo, who has been nominated to contest elections from Tollygunj Assembly seat, it is going to be tough. The seat is a TMC stronghold where the party has nominated Minister Aroop Biswas and the Samyukt Morcha candidate is Communist Party of India ( Marxist) nominee, actor Debdoot Ghosh. Even in the Chanditala seat in Hooghly, where the BJP has nominated Yash Dasgupta, he is up against CPI(M) veteran Md. Salim.  ‘Not going to be easy’ Well-known political commentator and professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University Biswanath Chakraborty pointed out that it is not going to be easy for stars and actors in these high-stakes polls. “In difficult situations these actors can appeal across political lines and both the BJP and the TMC are experimenting this time. They want to see if their individual charisma can tide over the political divide,” said Prof. Chakraborty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/no-cakewalk-for-celeb-candidates-this-time-in-bengal/article34087510.ece
17 March 2021||Guwahati,||Clear stand on CAA, Assam students’ body asks parties||The All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) has asked all political parties in the poll-bound State to clear their latest position on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The students’ body has also decided to take out a two-wheeler rally across the State on March 20 to press for the scrapping of the controversial law and drum up support for its anti-CAA campaign. “The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) ignored the Assam Accord and prepared a blueprint to destroy Assam by dumping illegal immigrants on the State. Assam’s indigenous people and AASU had and will continue to resist it,” AASU president Dipanka Kumar Nath said. “Five people died in the anti-CAA [protests] but that did not dissuade people from protesting. AASU and the people of Assam have rejected this law and will never accept it,” he added.  ‘In conflict with accord’ The AASU says that the CAA, which seeks to protect non-Muslim immigrants who entered India from three neighbouring countries till December 31, 2014, is in conflict with the Assam Accord. This accord was signed by the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1985 and it prescribes detection and deportation of all immigrants, irrespective of faith, who entered Assam after the midnight of March 24, 1971. This was also the cut-off date for updating the National Register of Citizens of 1951. “We have not wavered from what the Assam Accord says. Accepting a set of immigrants who came post-1971 will destroy Assam’s language, culture and literature and reduce the indigenous communities to minority,” Mr. Nath said, appealing to all indigenous communities to be wary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/clear-stand-on-caa-assam-students-body-asks-parties/article34087511.ece

UPPL list of candidates The UPPL has announced a list of candidates for 11 seats in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR). The seat-sharing agreement in the first week of March had yielded the BTR-specific party eight seats. The BTR has 12 Assembly seats in four districts – Baksa, Chirang, Kokrajhar and Udalguri – administered by the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC). On Tuesday, UPPL president and BTC chief Pramod Boro announced the names of eight candidates. He had earlier announced the names of candidates for three other seats. It has now transpired that the BJP and UPPL will have friendly contests in three of these seats – Bijni, Kalaigaon and Majbat. The candidates are Phanin Boro, Kamal Azad and Ratendra Daimary respectively. The BJP has fielded Ajay Kumar Roy from Bijni, Madhu Ram Deka from Kalaigaon and Jitu Kisan from Majbat.  Paneri seat The only seat in BTR that the UPPL is not contesting is Panery, where the BJP has fielded Rajya Sabha member Biswajit Daimary, an import from the saffron party’s former ally Bodoland People’s Front (BPF). The UPPL has fielded Urkhao Gwra Brahma, a former MP and Sahitya Academy award winner, from the Chapaguri seat. The Congress and ally All-India United Democratic Front had earlier named candidates against each other for a “friendly fight” in five constituencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-ally-uppl-to-have-friendly-contest-in-three-assam-seats/article34087512.ece

17 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi govt. to release Rs. 28 cr. to DU colleges||After a meeting between Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and principals of 12 Delhi University (DU) colleges — which are fully funded by the government — to discuss the impasse on insufficient funds, the government said an amount of Rs. 28.24 crore will be released towards salaries for the employees. Stating that there had been an “unwarranted misunderstanding” and misinterpretation of the government’s intentions, Mr. Kejriwal said: “We do not oppose the pleas and concerns of the staffers. Since the last few years, we have tried to initiate talks with DU authorities and the Vice-Chancellor, but there may have been differences, political or otherwise.” “Today is a new beginning and we need dialogue to be initiated on behalf of DU authorities and the V-C to resolve several issues which are pending and acting as a bone of contention,” Mr. Kejriwal said. Mr. Kejriwal also said that in future funds will be released on directions of the court on whether funds available under different heads can be used as salaries or not. The V-C will also be invited for a dialogue with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, he said. Continuous dialogue Terming the meeting as a fruitful one, DU officials said that the CM had urged for a continuous dialogue between departments concerned to avoid similar circumstances in the future. Balram Pani, Dean of Colleges in DU said: “It was a very positive and fruitful meeting. All the principals and representatives present explained their problems and issues to the CM, which he acknowledged. If there is continuous dialogue between the departments and teachers then such issues will not arise. Earlier, a proper dialogue was lacking. He has also directed the Deputy CM accordingly and urged for continuous dialogue between the stakeholders.” said Mr. Pani. Earlier, the varsity had written to the Directorate of Higher Education stating that the 12 colleges were bound by the norms of the University Grants Commission (UGC) for budgeting and expenditure and the government could not change the pattern of assistance for releasing funds. Mr. Sisodia, however, said: “As these institutes are 100% funded by the Delhi government, the Pattern of Assistance of the Delhi government must be followed. The colleges must take prior permission from the Delhi government before appointing the staffers because the Delhi govt. is funding their salaries and expenses.”  Since the last few years, we have tried to initiate talks with DU authorities and the Vice-Chancellor, but there may have been differences, political or otherwise Arvind Kejriwal Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-govt-to-release-rs-28-cr-to-du-colleges/article34087522.ece

The BJP lost poorly in the Assembly elections in Delhi and in the recently concluded civic body byelections too, they won zero seats. Seeing the growing popularity of the AAP from Delhi to Gujarat, the BJP-ruled Centre has conspired to limit an elected government’s powers and is attempting to overturn the judgment of a Constitution Bench,” AAP Delhi in-charge Gopal Rai said. ‘Stifling growth’ Mr. Rai said that the Central government is doing all of this to “restrict” the powers of the Delhi government to stifle its growth. “Earlier also attempts were made to restrict the powers of the Delhi government. All powers were submitted to the L-G, every file would have to be routed via L-G, which had led to several files being stalled, being delayed,” he said. Mr. Rai said files pertaining to constructing mohalla clinics were “delayed” for years, and the Lieutenant-Governor’s office even “sat on files” for installing CCTV cameras across the city. “All of us, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain had sat all night at the L-G’s house just to get a file cleared. The same situation had arisen now, which had become a cause of worry for citizens of Delhi,” he added.
