27 March 2021||New Delhi,||Poll bond sale can go ahead: SC||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the sale of electoral bonds prior to the Assembly elections in crucial States such as West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. A three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, said the scheme began in 2018 and continued in 2019 and 2020 without “any impediments”. Chief Justice Bobde, who read out the judgment, said the court found no reason to stall the sale of the electoral bonds now. The judgment came on an urgent application moved by an NGO, Association for Democratic Reforms, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, to stay the sale of the bonds scheduled between April 1 and 10. The NGO, also represented by advocate Neha Rathi, voiced serious apprehension that sale of electoral bonds before elections in States, including West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, would “further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies”. The court agreed that the scheme protects the identity of purchasers of electoral bonds in a cloak of anonymity, but highlighted that such purchases happened only through regular banking channels. The State Bank of India would eventually know the identity of the buyer. “While the identity of the purchaser of the bond is withheld, it is ensured that unidentified/unidentifiable persons cannot purchase the bonds and give it to the political parties. Under Clause 7 of the scheme, buyers have to apply in the prescribed form, either physically or online, disclosing their particulars,” the court reasoned. The court rubbished the charge of electoral bonds facilitating anonymous and hefty donations from corporate houses to political parties. Anyone buying bonds will have to fulfil KYC (Know Your Customer) norms, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/poll-bond-sale-can-go-ahead-sc/article34174535.ece
27 March 2021||Kolkata,||Polling to be held under unprecedented security||Amidst unprecedented security arrangements 30 Assembly seats across five districts of West Bengal will go to polls in the first phase of elections on Saturday. The Election Commission has deployed 732 companies of central forces in the five districts that is going to polls. About 73 lakh voters that includes 37.5 lakh male, and 36.2 lakh female electorates will decide fate of 191 candidates. Of the 30 seats going to polls, nine are located in Purulia, seven in Purba Medinipur, six in Paschim Medinpur and four each in Jhargram and Purulia. According to the office of Chief Electoral Officer, West Bengal strict guidelines for COVID-19 pandemic will be implemented in polling stations. Along with thermal screening at polling booths the ECI has also provided with PPE kits or polling officers at polling stations. Polling will start at 7 a.m. and continue till 6.30 p.m. Even those with COVID-19 symptoms like fever can come and vote between 5 pm and 6.30 pm, an official said. BJP worker found dead Meanwhile, hours before the State goes to polls, the body of a BJP worker was found from Salboni in Paschim Mednipur. The BJP blamed the Trinamool Congress for the death of Lal Mohan Soren. The TMC leadership, however, denied any involvement in the death. The development also triggered tension in Salboni which goes to polls on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/polling-to-be-held-under-unprecedented-security/article34174923.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC backs Tata Sons, sets aside NCLAT order on Mistry||The Supreme Court on Friday ruled completely in favour of multi-billion salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Sons Private Ltd. by setting aside a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) decision to reinstate minority shareholder Shapoorji Pallonji group’s scion, Cyrus Mistry, as its executive chairman. Mr. Mistry was initially only removed from the post of executive chairman of Tata Sons. However, his subsequent actions, including the leaking of a confidential mail to the media to create a “sensation” and passing on information to the Income Tax authorities while claiming to be a “law abiding citizen”, was an open declaration of “all-out war” against the Tatas. These led to his removal as a director, the court said. “Cyrus Pallonji Mistry himself invited trouble,” a three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, declared in a 282-page judgment. Chief Justice Bobde said the ouster of Mr. Mistry not only as executive chairman but also director was justified. The court dismissed allegations by Mr. Mistry of oppression of minority shareholders, such as the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) group, by the Tatas, who hold majority stake. The SP group holds 18.37% shares. “It is an irony that the very same person who represents shareholders owning just 18.37% of the total paid-up share capital and yet identified as the successor to the empire, has chosen to accuse the very same Board, of conduct, oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the minorities,” the apex court snubbed Mr. Mistry’s side. The court trashed contentions by Mr. Mistry’s contention that the “oppressive” regime of Mr. Ratan Tata had led to bad business decisions for almost a decade. “It is interesting to note that at the time of his appointment in December 2012, what Mistry saw and acknowledged, was a ‘great learning experience he had under the direct guidance of Ratan N. Tata’, but at the time of departure in October 2016, what he saw was only a conduct for over 10 years, that was oppressive and prejudicial to the interests of the company and of the minority…” Chief Justice Bobde noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-backs-tata-sons-sets-aside-nclat-order-on-mistry/article34174538.ece
27 March 2021||MANGALURU,||Probe into theft that was stage-managed unravels hawala racket in Mangaluru||The arrest of five persons in connection with a theft of money that was stage-managed has unravelled a hawala racket in the city. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar gave the names of arrested as Mohammed Rifath Ali, Ashfaq, Jaffer Sadiq, Mohammed Ismail and Mayyadi . Mr. Kumar told reporters here on Friday that Abdul Salam filed a complaint with the Mangaluru South Police on March 4 that three persons, who came on a motorcycle, waylaid his scooter and robbed him of Rs. 14.2 lakh that he was carrying on February 23. Based on images from the CCTVs in the area and an inquiry of the complainant, the Mangaluru South Police arrested Rifath Ali, Asfaq and Sadiq, who were directly involved in the theft, and Mohammed Ismail and Mayyadi, who were conspirators in the crime. Further inquiry, Mr. Kumar said, revealed that the theft was stage-managed by the arrested persons at the instance of Salam, an hawala agent, working for an hawala operator in the city. Mr. Kumar said that the money that was stolen was part of the proceeds of hawala transaction and the main hawala operator had given the amount to Salam for distribution among those involved in the racket. Before stage-managing the theft, Salam conspired with Mayyadi, another hawala agent, and Ismail, a friend of the main hawala operator, to keep the cash among themselves. After the five were arrested, Salam and the main hawala operator in the city have gone absconding. A search is on for these two persons. As many as eight persons, including two from abroad, are said to be involved in the hawala racket. The value of hawala transaction that these agents and the operator were involved in was more than Rs. 1 crore, he said. The investigation, Mr. Kumar said, showed that hawala transactions were being made using cash and also by transferring amounts to bank accounts of those known to the operator and agents. The hawala operator, his agents and sub-agents operated in an organised way and did not make use of mobile phones to contact each other, he said. In a press release, the police said that Rifath Ali was an accused in four criminal cases registered in Bantwal Town, Mangaluru Rural, Ullal and Mangaluru Narcotic Crime Stations. While Asfaq was an accused in three cases registered in Mangaluru Rural and Kankanady stations, Ismail was an accused in a case registered in the Kankanady Police Station. The police recovered Rs. 98,000 in cash and two motorcycles from the arrested persons, Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/probe-into-theft-that-was-stage-managed-unravels-hawala-racket-in-mangaluru/article34174970.ece

27 March 2021||PALAKKAD,||Candidates display rare camaraderie||Three different parties, different ideologies, and different perceptions of development. The main candidates engaged in a fierce triangular fight in Malampuzha may appear to be from three corners that can never meet; yet they share a high level of camaraderie rarely seen during a heated election campaign. The Press Club here on Friday witnessed the union of A. Prabhakaran, S.K. Ananthakrishnan and C. Krishnakumar, candidates of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the United Democratic Front (UDF), and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) respectively. Exchange greetings Although rivals in the hustings, they exchanged greetings of success to each other. “However, fierce and raucous the fight gets in Malampuzha, we have decided never to assail each other. Whoever wins from amongst us, we will extend full support for the development of Malampuzha,” they said, displaying a rare gesture of bonhomie. Yet they were persistent about their viewpoints. Mr. Prabhakaran said the LDF, with solid roots in all panchayats in the constituency, was comfortably ensconced in Malampuzha. “We have little concern in Malampuzha,” he said. Criticising the Narendra Modi government for attempting to sell the remaining industries, Mr. Prabhakaran said the LDF had done its best for the development of Malampuzha constituency. “Whatever development remains, we can do it together,” he said, sending a wave of laughter through the audience. Both Mr. Ananthakrishnan and Mr. Krishnakumar focussed on the dearth of development in Malampuzha, one of the largest constituencies in the State. Mr. Krishnakumar called upon the LDF to examine its dwindling vote share in Malampuzha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/candidates-display-rare-camaraderie/article34175077.ece

Addressing a special gathering on the National Day celebrations that marked the 50th anniversary of the country’s independence, Mr. Modi said the creation of Bangladesh received support from all sections of the Indian political class. The visiting leader also said the two countries should fight jointly against terrorism. “Bangladesh is sustained by the blood of the freedom fighters of the country as well as of the Indian soldiers. This blood will create such a relation that will not break under any kind of pressure,” he said. “I pay my homage to those brave Indian soldiers who stood with the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh during the War of Liberation and gave their blood for the creation of a free Bangladesh,” Mr. Modi said at the National Day Programme in the presence of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Abdul Hamid. Recollecting the atrocities unleashed by the Pakistani military, Mr. Modi blamed the “Operation Searchlight” of March 25, 1971 for unleashing a reign of terror in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-bangladesh-must-fight-terror-together-pm/article34174532.ece

27 March 2021||New Delhi,||Coal-mining scam: CBI summons ‘mastermind’||The CBI has summoned the alleged mastermind of an illegal coal-mining scam in West Bengal, Anup Manjhi, for questioning in connection with the case on March 30, officials said on Friday. The Supreme Court restrained the agency on Thursday from arresting Manjhi till April 6. “The petitioner shall not be arrested until April 6. This order has been passed without going into the merit of the case. We clarify that this order will not restrain the investigation,” a Bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud said. The Bench, also comprising Justices M.R. Shah and Sanjiv Khanna, directed Manjhi to cooperate. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has already questioned Rujira Banerjee, wife of Abhishek Banerjee, Lok Sabha MP from Diamond Harbour and the nephew of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who wields considerable influence in the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the ruling party in the state. The agency had also questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s sister-in-law and her family members in connection with the case. The multi-crore-rupee coal pilferage scam is related to the Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) mines located in the state’s Kunustoria and Kajora areas. The CBI had registered an FIR in November last year against Anup Manjhi alias Lala, the alleged kingpin of the pilferage racket, ECL general managers Amit Kumar Dhar and Jayesh Chandra Rai, ECL security chief Tanmay Das, Kunustoria area security inspector Dhananjay Rai and Kajor area security in-charge Debashish Mukherjee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/coal-mining-scam-cbi-summons-mastermind/article34174925.ece

27 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||Will anti-CAA stir prove a storm in a teacup?||Phase 1 of elections on Saturday to the 126-member Assam Assembly is expected to test the impact of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act movement and the loyalty of ‘tea tribes’ or Adivasi voters. Political commentators say the tea plantation workers and migrant Muslims have traditionally voted en bloc. The Congress was said to be the beneficiary of both ‘vote banks’ until the BJP enticed the plantation workers in 2016 while the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) ate into the Muslim votes. The Congress and AIUDF are allies this time but Muslims are a deciding factor in only five of the 47 seats in the first phase across eastern and part of central Assam. Wages matter The voters that matter most in this phase are the tea plantation workers who call the shots in 38 of these seats. Apart from the issue of the daily wage, the Adivasis are one of six Assam communities demanding Scheduled Tribe status. Four of them — Chutia, Matak, Moran and Tai-Ahom — demanding ST status dominate several seats in this phase. “We have asked members of our community to vote wisely for a party that will give them the wages and the ST status they deserve,” said All Assam Tea Tribes Association president Stephen Lakra. “The ST issue somehow seems to have waned after the anti-CAA movement. But the movement too seems to have lost intensity on the ground, although a section of the people is aware. Cash benefits and other sops could be the reason,” Jayanta Krishna Sarmah of Gauhati University’s Political Science department told The Hindu.   While the BJP has claimed CAA is a non-issue, the Congress virtually hijacked it from the new regional front of Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Akhil Gogoi’s Raijor Dal (RD) — both spawned by the agitation. “People in Assam are largely against the CAA, and we hope they will vote accordingly,” Congress MP and the party’s campaign chief, Pradyut Bordoloi, said. The BJP and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had won 35 of these 47 seats in 2016. The allies hope to do better this time, banking partly on the perception that the Congress-AIUDF alliance would backfire in eastern Assam, where the indigenous communities are in a majority. The AIUDF is seen as catering to Bengal-origin Muslims. Shrines encroached The first phase is also crucial for the BJP’s credo of protecting Assam from ‘land jihad’, a reference to encroachment by alleged illegal immigrants on land belonging to some 300 satras (Vaishnavite monasteries) and wildlife preserves. Batadrava, the seat the BJP wrested in 2016 from the Congress, is in this phase. The constituency is named after the Batadrava Satra, birthplace of 15th-16th century saint-reformer Srimanta Sankaradeva, an icon the BJP has appropriated. While many such “threatened” satras are in western Assam, the “unthreatened” one is in Majuli, which Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal represents. The first phase also has six constituencies straddling the Kaziranga National Park, parts of which are occupied by alleged Bangladeshis, who are also accused of rhino poaching. AGP president Atul Bora is seeking re-election from one of these seats. Mr. Bora is among four party presidents whose fate will be locked in the ballot boxes on March 27. The others are State Congress president Ripun Bora (Gohpur), jailed RD president Akhil Gogoi (Sibsagar) and AJP president Lurinjyoti Gogoi (Duliajan and Naharkatiya).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-anti-caa-stir-prove-a-storm-in-a-teacup/article34174439.ece
27 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala for probe against Central agencies||The Kerala Cabinet on Friday decided to go for a judicial inquiry against the Central agencies probing the diplomatic gold and dollar smuggling cases. The Cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, decided to go for a judicial probe after Ministers are learnt to have averred that the probes were being diverted for political gains of the ruling front at the Centre and scuttling development initiatives. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said the inquiry would be subject to the approval of the Election Commission of India as the model code of conduct was in force for the Assembly elections. “If the Election Commission clears the inquiry, the requisite steps will be taken soon for initiating the inquiry or it will have to wait till the clearance is received or the Assembly elections are over,” he said. Dr. Isaac said the ongoing probes had not been able to come to any conclusions on from where the gold was smuggled and for whom it was meant. Moreover, there was a move to create proof to involve Ministers, top functionaries of parties, and others in the cases. “It is a serious issue and the aim is to destablise the government. Let all issues in connection with the gold smuggling be probed,” he added. The Cabinet is learnt to have gone for a five-point terms of reference for the judicial commission to be headed by former High Court judge V.K. Mohan. The commission will look into the ‘derailing’ of the probes by the Central agencies, the controversial audio recording of Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the gold smuggling case, letter written by co-accused P.S. Sarith, and the statements of civil police officers that there was pressure on Swapna to give statements. Both Swapna and Sarith had alleged that they were forced by investigating officials to name the Chief Minister, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan, and Ministers as having links with people involved in the diplomatic gold and dollar smuggling cases. Official sources said Chief Secretary V.P. Joy would write to Chief Electoral Officer Teeka Ram Meena seeking the nod of the commission for the judicial inquiry. M. Sivasankar, the former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister, is among those named in these cases. Besides the Enforcement Directorate, the Customs and the National Investigation Agency are inquiring into the smuggling case and the dollar case relating to alleged smuggling of $1,90,000 (equivalent to Rs. 1.30 crore) by a former finance head of the UAE Consulate in Thiruvananthapuram to Muscat in Oman. Swapna Suresh and Sarith are also allegedly involved in the dollar case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-for-probe-against-central-agencies/article34174462.ece

27 March 2021||Mumbai,||At least nine COVID-19 patients killed in Mumbai hospital fire||At least nine COVID-19 patients were killed on Thursday night after a fire swept through a mall that also housed a dedicated COVID-19 hospital in the Bhandup area of Mumbai. Two others had died of COVID-19, officials said. Officials said 68 patients were evacuated. According to officials, nine patients died of suffocation from smoke as the fire engulfed the hospital. According to Corporation officials, the fire started on the first floor of the Dream Mall near the Bhandup suburban railway station. The Sunrise Hospital is situated on the third floor and has a capacity of 107 beds. “At the time of fire, 78 patients were being treated,” an official said. Permission to run the hospital was given due to the shortage of beds for COVID-19 patients during last year’s outbreak. According to fire service officials, the fire spread from the first to the second floor and smoke engulfed the third floor. “We managed to rescue 68 patients from the hospital with the joint effort of all agencies,” the official said. Those who were in ICU and on ventilation could not be evacuated, he added. Case filed “We have filed a case with the Bhandup police station and reasons behind the fire will be probed. Police will also check as to whether all permissions and NOCs related to fire safety were obtained,” he said. The rescued COVID-19 patients were shifted immediately to the nearby COVID care centres. In a statement, the hospital said it was started under exceptional circumstances in 2020 and has helped many patients recover. “It is functioning with all due compliances such as fire licence and nursing home license. The hospital staff did a fantastic job in safely evacuating patients on wheelchairs and beds to the refuge areas and by following the fire drills,” the statement said. It added that the fire alarm was set off by the smoke, following which all patients were evacuated. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the site of the blaze, apologised to the families of the victims. Announcing a Rs. 5-lakh compensation to the kin of each of the deceased, he said, “We had given permission for temporary COVID hospitals due to the rise in the number of patients in 2020. This hospital, too, was given the permission under this category. All field hospitals and those within buildings must now undergo strict fire safety checks.” He added that the permission for the said hospital was to end on March 31, 2021. The Opposition BJP said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the BMC should take responsibility for the tragedy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/at-least-nine-covid-19-patients-killed-in-mumbai-hospital-fire/article34174495.ece
27 March 2021||Bengaluru,||FIR filed against Jarkiholi on woman’s complaint||The Bengaluru police on Friday registered an FIR against the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, BJP MLA, after the woman seen in the alleged CD scandal involving him submitted a complaint through her lawyer, Jagadish Kumar, accusing him of sexual abuse. He has been charged under Sections 376c (sexual intercourse by a person in authority), 354a (sexual harassment), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 417 (cheating) of the IPC and under Section 67a of the IT Act (publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act). In her complaint, the woman accused Mr. Jarkiholi of sexually assaulting, cheating and threatening her after promising her a government job. She alleged that the MLA had sexually assaulted her twice and even forced her to share private photos and talk to him. She further stated that he recorded videos of their interactions to defame her if she filed a police complaint. A CD of their meetings and conversations emerged earlier this month, when Bengaluru-based activist Dinesh Kallahalli submitted it to the police seeking a detailed probe. Many of the clips were widely shared on social media. By then the woman had gone into hiding, fearing for her life. She alleged that she and her family were being threatened. “I am facing a threat to my life and my family, hence I request you to take necessary action,” she said in her complaint. Mr. Jagadish Kumar said his client would appear before the police, but they should provide security to her and her family. He said he would be approaching the DG&IGP to request that security be provided to the woman as well as her family members who were in Kalaburagi. So far, the woman has released three videos, though the Special Investigation Team formed when the scandal first broke, is yet to locate her. Mr. Jagadish Kumar said that as an advocate he contacted her on Facebook assuring her legal help following which she approached him with a written complaint. Incidentally, soon after the woman released the first video, the lawyer met with Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant and submitted a requisition that the police take up a suo motu case as per Nirbhaya guidelines. In the last video message she released on Friday, the woman thanked people for their support and said without it she would not have had the courage to carry on the fight. In the clip, she said she had been living in fear for the last 24 hours, but the support of others had given her the courage to file a police complaint. Mr. Jarkiholi has been booked under sections of the IPC that are non-cognisable in nature and warrant arrest. However, sources says it is the discretion of the investigating officer to arrest him. So far, no arrests have been made. “The police as part of the investigation will conduct a spot inspection at the apartment where the alleged crime took place,” said a senior police official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fir-filed-against-jarkiholi-on-womans-complaint/article34174465.ece
27 March 2021||Hyderabad,||No lockdown to fight virus: Telangana CM||Andhra Pradesh reported close to 1,000 new COVID-19 cases and two deaths on Friday. Kerala reported 1,825 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 3.49% while the incidence was 518 in Telangana on March 25.

27 March 2021||Tezpur,||Brewing a shade of saffron in Assam’s tea gardens||Generations of her ancestors have lived the same life that Arti Munda now lives on a tea estate in Assam — earning meagre wages, denied the legal status of a Scheduled Tribe (ST) person despite being a tribal, landless and malnourished. She earns Rs. 167 for an eight-hour workday, which often gets extended, for plucking 24 kg of leaves. During every election, there is a brief spotlight on the State’s tea garden workers. The cold, black brew that she and her mostly women co-workers drink through the day used to be salted. “But no longer. We were getting sick due to high blood pressure,” she said. In 2019, the Assam government announced free sugar for tea garden workers to replace salt in tea. Like a lot of promises, that too is lost in transit. The tea is tasteless. Welfare politics In his campaign speeches, Prime Minister Narendra Modi invoked his tea-selling childhood and an alleged international conspiracy to malign Assam’s tea. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has promised to raise the tea workers’ wages to Rs. 350 a day. Tea companies and farmers said that is impossible. However, the welfare politics of the BJP government since 2016 has sweetened the life of ‘tea tribes’ — 18% of the State’s population, concentrated in Upper Assam, which goes to the polls today — just enough for the BJP to win the votes of a sizeable section of them. The BJP’s inroads into these communities is almost entirely created by one person, Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was once a key figure in the Congress. “He knows the pulse of the people,” said a bureaucrat who worked with him. Mr. Sarma was the kingpin of the Congress’s hold over tea tribes. The ancestors of the tea tribes were brought to Assam from central India as bonded labour by British planters in the 19th century — a practice that was prevalent around the world. Till date, the tea industry keeps wages at low levels. According to a study by Oxfam in 2019, supermarkets and tea brands keep 58.2% of the price paid by the retail consumer, while 7.2% goes to the workers. Big estates are on government lands leased to companies, but some are managed by farmers. “Farmers are themselves at the mercy of market forces, so what can they manage to share with the workers,” asked Raj Barooah, who owns the boutique tea brand Rujani. His business model seeks to cut down the layers between the producer and the consumer. “It will take a minimum of Rs. 500 a day for a very basic life for these workers. Now they are at starvation levels. They have very high maternal and infant mortality rates, high prevalence of anaemia and TB infections,” said Jayashree Satpute, a Delhi-based human rights lawyer who has worked on the issue. Planters said they can absorb a maximum of an additional Rs. 26 as wages per day. They argued that since workers are also provided housing, education and healthcare as required by law, the effective wages are more than double the cash payments. However, “schools, health centres and housing are substandard and subhuman,” Royal Soreng, an activist of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Tezpur, said. From hand to lotus When democracy replaced colonialism, tea tribes became a captive vote bank for the Congress, and their terms of engagement with industry changed little. “Deep in the hinterland, they remained insulated from the politics of their surrounding. They were mobilised with money and liquor a day before the elections,” said Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, a Guwahati-based researcher. Ruling politicians continue to skirt the wage issue, and resentment is brewing among the workers. The BJP government introduced a slew of welfare schemes, particularly houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and cash transfers of Rs. 2,500 each in 2017 and 2018, and Rs. 3,000 just before the election was announced. All these were designed by Mr. Sarma. “Welfare schemes have had an effect. The level of poverty is debilitating and these schemes have become largely popular,” said Mr. Soreng. Demands for ST status and homestead continue, meanwhile. Assertive or autonomous politics by one-fifth of the State population at the bottom can be unsettling for Assam’s politics and economy. “Even a marginal rise in the political awareness of these communities has not been taken lightly by authorities and companies. Reprisal is swift,” said Ms. Satpute. From the Congress to the BJP, governments have changed, but the exploitative structure of Assam’s tea economy remains intact. “The Congress network among the tea tribes has shifted to the BJP... Those who were managing it for the Congress are now doing it for the BJP. Their campaign is limited to just one point — the symbol has changed, from hand to lotus,” said Mr. Rahman.  It will take a minimum of Rs. 500 a day for a very basic life for these workers. Now, they are at starvation levels.

27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress complains to ECI about Kerala ‘bogus voters’||The Congress on Friday complained to the Election Commission of India (ECI) about ‘bogus voters’ in the electoral list of Kerala and asked the EC to clean up the list within a week to ensure ‘free and fair’ polls. The party alleged that State election officials colluded with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government and asked the EC to register FIRs against such officials as well as voters who had registered themselves fraudulently under different identities or in different constituencies. Kerala will vote in a single phase on April 6 and counting of votes will take place on May 2 along with Tamil Nadu, Assam, West Bengal and Puducherry. After the Congress delegation met the EC, party general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala held a press conference in which he pointed out three types of fraud: same voter registered in different booths; same voters with the same details and photograph registered in different Assembly constituencies; and finally photograph of the voter remains the same but the name changing in different IDs. “We have given evidence of eight constituencies,” he said.  The party urged the Commission to clean up the voter list within a week and sought action against officers who facilitated the fraud. According to Mr. Surjewala, the EC told the Congress delegation that an officer had already been suspended, written instructions had been given to clean up the list in eight constituencies and an officer had been deputed from Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-complains-to-eci-about-kerala-bogus-voters/article34174453.ece
27 March 2021||Mumbai,||Bombay HC grants bail to Deepak Kochhar||While granting bail to businessman Deepak Kochhar on Thursday, the Bombay High Court in a detailed order stated that his grave offence affected the economy of the country as a whole. A first information report was registered against Mr. Kochhar, Chanda Kochhar (former managing director of ICICI Bank) and V. N. Dhoot (managing director of Videocon Group) for causing loss to ICICI Bank by sanctioning loans to Videocon Group of Companies in contravention of the rules and policies of ICICI Bank. On September 8, 2009, Rs. 64 crore was transferred by Mr. Dhoot to Nupower Renewables (NRL) managed by Mr. Kochhar from Videocon Industries Limited through his company, Supreme Energy Private Limited (SEPL). A single Bench of Justice P.D. Naik released Mr. Kochhar on executing a bond of Rs. 3 lakh and said, “It is pertinent to note that the applicant (Mr. Kochhar) is in custody from September 7, 2020. He was arrested after the period of about 18 months pursuant to registration of Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR). Ms. Kochhar and Mr. Dhoot have been granted bail by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act court. The entire loan amount was repaid to ICICI bank.” ‘No chargesheet’ “Mr. Kochhar is in custody for more than six months. The transactions in question were for the period of 2009. The entire loan of ICICI Bank was repaid in 2012. Prior to arrest, he had appeared before the Enforcement Directorate on several occasions. His statements were recorded, and documents were tendered. The arrest was affected 18 months pursuant to the registration of ECIR. No chargesheet is filed in the CBI case,” the court added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-deepak-kochhar/article34174478.ece
27 March 2021||CHENNAI,||AMMK can upset AIADMK if it repeats 2019 performance||The Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), led by T.T.V. Dhinakaran, can upset the prospects of the ruling AIADMK in several Assembly constituencies if it repeats the 2019 Lok Sabha election performance. A perusal of the AMMK’s performance in nine Lok Sabha constituencies, covering 54 Assembly segments, reveals its average vote share was at least 10% in 22 constituencies and a little short of 10% in seven. Other than 12 Assembly segments in the Tiruchi and Thanjavur Lok Sabha constituencies in the Cauvery delta region, the remaining seats are in the southern districts. In absolute figures, the party’s highest vote tally was in Mudukulathur of Ramanathapuram district with 38,106. In terms of vote share too, this was the highest, with 20.14% of the votes polled. During the by-election to 22 Assembly constituencies two years ago, the AMMK was responsible for the defeat of the AIADMK in Andipatti, Periyakulam, Ottapidaram and Tirupparankundram, all in the southern region, as it had polled more votes than the margin of difference between the ruling party and the winner, DMK. This factor and a few other developments have compelled the AIADMK to make overtures to the Mukkulathor (“Thevar”), say two senior functionaries. They add that the AMMK got a considerable amount of support from the community two years ago. To back their contention, they refer to the conciliatory statements of Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who is seeking re-election from Bodinayakkanur, and Information Minister Kadambur C. Raju, who is pitted against Mr. Dhinakaran in Kovilpatti, towards the party’s former interim general secretary, V.K. Sasikala, who belongs to the community. They also point to the remarks of Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar, who is contesting in Thirumangalam, on the 10.5% quota for the Vanniyars. The office-bearers concede that the ground reality is such that their organisation, which has nominated 37 persons of the community, cannot win in the southern region without the support of the Mukkulathor. “They [the Mukkulathor] are among our [the party’s] traditional voters,” points out former Ramanathapuram MP A.

27 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Was Aadhaar data breached, asks HC||The Madras High Court on Friday directed the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to ascertain immediately if Aadhaar data of citizens had been compromised. The High Court asked the UIDAI to ascertain if the Puducherry unit of the BJP had been able to access mobile phone numbers of voters from the UIDAI database, as claimed by a public interest litigant. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the direction after expressing displeasure over a submission made by a Central government standing counsel, representing UIDAI, that the litigant, A. Anand, of the Democratic Youth Federation of India had not made any representation to it. The judges said the authority could have acted on the basis of information provided by the Election Commission. Passing interim orders on the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition, the first Division Bench wrote: “It is apparent that the sixth respondent (BJP) political party may have resorted to a form of campaigning (sending bulk SMS with links to join the party’s booth level WhatsApp groups) not permissible under the model code of conduct.” It added, “Unfortunately, rather than the seventh respondent (UIDAI) authority trying to ascertain how the personal details of voters may have been leaked from its system, such authority accuses the petitioner of not having brought the matter to the notice of the relevant authority. The Election Commission, however, says that it has brought the matter to the notice of the seventh respondent. The seventh respondent should immediately ascertain how such material could have been accessed by a particular political party.” The Bench also took note of elaborate submissions made by the Election Commission with respect to the action taken by it and granted it time till March 31 to file another status report. When the petitioners’ counsel complained that the bulk SMSs were being sent unabatedly even after the filing of the case, the judges said: “It is for the Election Commission to take immediate action if such is the case.” Earlier, the Puducherry Chief Electoral Officer informed the court of having issued a show cause notice to the BJP on March 7. Senior counsel G. Rajagopalan, representing the Commission and the CEO, said the BJP had not responded to the notice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/was-aadhaar-data-breached-asks-hc/article34174481.ece
27 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Vote for govt. that upholds democracy’||Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in a video message to voters in Assam, has warned that their society is being divided on the basis of religion and language and urged them to vote for a government that “believes in the Constitution and democratic principles”. He said the Congress, if voted to power, will not implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and will try its utmost to get it repealed. The Congress is committed to protecting the unique language, culture and history of Assam, Dr. Singh asserted. “You must vote for a government that upholds the principles of democracy and the Constitution. You must vote for a government that cares for every citizen, every community. You must vote for a government that will ensure inclusive growth,” the former Prime Minister said. Dr. Singh, who represented the State in the Rajya Sabha for 28 years (1991-2019), said Assam enabled him to serve the country as a Finance Minister for five years and then as the Prime Minister for 10 years. ‘Serious setback’ Recalling that the people of the State endured a long period of terrible insurgency and unrest, he said a “new beginning” towards peace and development was made under the leadership of the late Tarun Gogoi between 2001 and 2016. “However, it is now facing a serious setback. Society is being divided on the basis of religion, culture and language. The basic right of the common man is being denied. There is an atmosphere of tension and fear,” Dr. Singh noted. “Today, I am speaking as one of you. Once again, the time has come for you to the cast the ballot in the Vidhan Sabha elections. You must vote wisely,” he added. The former Prime Minister said the economy, which was already facing a challenge because of demonetisation and a badly implemented goods and services tax (GST), had become more vulnerable because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the high prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas had made the common man’s life difficult, lakhs of people lost their livelihoods and youth were looking for decent jobs, Dr. Singh said. Congress guarantees Stating that the Congress’s five guarantees were practical, Dr. Singh said “five lakh jobs will be given in the public sector and 25 lakh jobs will be created in the private sector”. Enhanced daily wages for the tea workers, free electricity up to 200 units and monthly income of Rs. 2,000 for homemakers were the other guarantees of the Congress in Assam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vote-for-govt-that-upholds-democracy/article34174487.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Jabs, AEFI deaths have no causal link’||There is no direct causal relation established between deaths and COVID-19 vaccination with adverse events reported being well within the anticipated numbers, said the expert group investigating the adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The national committee looking at AEFI examined 412 cases of severe adverse events including 79 deaths (recorded until March 13) and found “that deaths happened in cases where the person had underlying conditions including heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes”, N.K. Arora, member, National Task Force on COVID, told The Hindu . He added that of the deaths that occurred, the cause included heart attacks or brain strokes in 50% of the cases and this was also seen in 20% of hospitalised cases. “With the expansion of the vaccination cover the numbers of these adverse events is expected to get diluted. The age group that was vaccinated included 45 years and above with comorbidities and those over 60. This is an under-stress group (medically) so the numbers of adverse events that we are seeing is anticipated,” Mr. Arora said. “Some persons, who were hospitalised, also displayed symptoms including allergies and anaphylaxis (difficulty in breathing, rash on body and drop in blood pressure). These were managed at the hospital,” he added. Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan earlier this week noted that the 45-plus age group has registered over 88% deaths due to COVID with a case fatality rate for this age group being 2.85%. India started its immunisation drive on January 16 which has now been extended to all who are 45 years and above from April 1. Meanwhile India on Friday reported 59,118 new daily COVID cases in the 24 hours to 8 a.m. on Friday, the highest since October 18 when 61,871 infections were recorded, as per data released by the Health Ministry. The total active case load stands at 4.21 lakh currently. This is after touching a low of 1.36 lakh this mid-February having come down from a high of 10,17,754 cases in mid-September last year as per Ministry data. Currently three States, Maharashtra, Kerala and Punjab together account for 73.64% of the total active cases in the country, while the country’s cumulative recoveries stands at 1,12,64,637 with 32,987 recoveries registered in the last 24 hours. India has also reported 257 deaths in the last 24 hours. Again six States account for 78.6% of these deaths. Maharashtra reported 111 casualties followed by Punjab with 43 daily deaths. The number of States without any deaths in the last 24 hours has come dropped to 14 from 18, including Rajasthan, J&K (UT), Jharkhand, Odisha, Puducherry, Lakshadweep, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. According to the Health Ministry data, Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat continue to report a surge in daily new cases. Maharashtra continued to report the highest daily new cases at 35,952, followed by Punjab with 2,661.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-direct-link-between-jabs-aefi-deaths/article34174490.ece
27 March 2021||Punapani,||Where hunger trumps politics||A tube well and a few houses built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana are new additions to Punapani village in Lalgarh, which lost seven members of the Sabar community in November 2018, reportedly due to hunger and malnutrition. Election posters and flags are not visible in Sabar basti, which is part of the Jhargram Assembly seat. The members of the tribe have little interest in Saturday’s election and do not even know the names of the candidates. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had claimed in 2018 that the deaths of the Lodha Sabars, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), were due to illness and old age, and liver problems caused by excessive consumption of liquor. When this reporter visited the village, most of the women were out collecting firewood or fishing. Mithun Sabar, whose parents died in November 2018, said there wasn’t much food in the house back then. He displayed the new ration cards provided by the administration. Members of the Sabar tribe, including Mithun, are included as beneficiaries of RKSY-1 (Rajya Khadya Suraksha Yojana-1), where 5 kg of subsidised foodgrain is given to every family member. But having a card is no guarantee of grain. “Even if we are a day late, the dealer refuses to give us the ration,” Mr. Mithun said. He also said he did not have an job card under the MGNREGA scheme.  Assured livelihood Activist with the Right to Food and Work Campaign Anuradha Talwar, who had visited Punapani soon after the deaths, said that as members of the PVTG, Sabars are entitled to the benefits of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, where 35 kg of foodgrain is given to every family. Ms. Talwar, who had shared a report with the government, had also said that steady work and income must be ensured to the community. However, the lack of any guarantee of work is evident at Punapani. Sukhami Sabar complained about lack of work and said her bank accounts had Rs. 92 and Rs. 101 but she could not withdraw any money. The report, compiled by Ms. Talwar and others, had said, “By observation, we found almost all people of the Lodha Sabar Community to be stunted in growth and anaemic”. Ironically, even as the tribals are struggling to get what they are entitled to, the manifestos of all the major parties talk of food security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/where-hunger-trumps-politics/article34174435.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||40% of RTI rejections did not cite valid reason, says analysis||The Centre has only rejected 4.3% of all Right to Information (RTI) requests in 2019-20, the lowest ever rate, according to the Central Information Commission’s annual report. However, almost 40% of these rejections did not include any valid reason, as they did not invoke one of the permissible exemption clauses in the RTI Act, according to an analysis of report data by RTI activist Venkatesh Nayak. This includes 90% of rejections by the Prime Minister’s Office. Public authorities under the Central government received 13.7 lakh RTI requests in 2019-20, out of which 58,634 were rejected for various reasons. Rejection rates have fallen since the 13.9% rate in 2005-06, and have been steadily trending downwards since the 8.4% spike in 2014-15. In 2019-20, they hit their lowest level so far. The CIC’s annual report covers more than 2,000 public authorities across the Central government as well as the union territories. An analysis of CIC macro-data from Central ministries by Mr. Nayak shows that the Home Ministry had the highest rate of rejections, as it rejected 20% of all RTIs received. The Agriculture Ministry’s rejection rate doubled from 2% in 2018-19 to 4% in 2019-20. The Delhi Police and the Army also saw increases in rejection rates. The RTI Act allows public authorities to reject RTI requests on a number of grounds, ranging from information which would endanger life and safety to that which involves irrelevant personal information, Cabinet papers, foreign governments, copyrights, or sovereignty, security and intelligence matters. Public authorities are expected to cite the relevant clause of the Act to invoke the exemption. In 38.7% of rejections in 2019-20, however, public authorities failed to cite these permissible exemption clauses, and were classified under the ‘Others’ category in the CIC data. This is an increase from the 33% seen the previous year. The Finance Ministry alone rejected more than 10,000 cases (40% of its total RTI rejections) without providing a valid reason under the Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/40-of-rti-rejections-did-not-cite-valid-reason-says-analysis/article34174498.ece
27 March 2021||MYSURU,||Meet called on priests’ pay: Kota||Minister for Muzrai Kota Srinivas Poojari said here on Friday that the government would convene a meeting in April on implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations to the temple priests. He said a ‘Dharmika Parishat’ entailing officials and representatives of various bodies related to temple administration and priests had been convened on April 9 in Bengaluru to discuss the issue. There are nearly 35,000 temples under the administration of the Muzrai Department and they were classified based on their earnings. Though some of the staff and priests of the bigger temples were being paid as per the Sixth Pay Commission, there are other temples where it was yet to be implemented. The Minister said there were lacunae in the implementation of the recommendations and the parishat would rectify the anomalies on the pay issues. Mr. Poojari said the mass marriage scheme was progressing well and had received a good response from the public. It would be promoted to benefit the common people and the temple administrations had to comply with the prevailing COVID-19 norms. In reply to a question on the development of the temple infrastructure, the Minister said many of the temples were also governed by the rules of the Archaeological Survey of India which forbid any extension to the monuments and places of worship. The Minister said that his statement should not be construed to mean that this rule was an impediment to the development of the temples. “We will take the ASI officials on board in the development meeting and take up the works ensuring that their norms are not compromised,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/meeting-called-on-priests-pay-kota/article34174564.ece
27 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||No compromise on Rayalaseema LI scheme: KCR||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday assured the Assembly that the State government would not compromise its stand on Rayalaseema lift-irrigation scheme taken up by the Andhra Pradesh government to the detriment of the former. In the same way, he said, the government would not forgo even a drop of water out of its share of 15.9 tmcft in the right canal of Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme which was denied by Karnataka.  Praise on govt. Replying to the debate on Appropriation Bill, Mr. Rao lavished praise on the State government saying it took up several programmes which resulted in 1.3% growth in GSDP despite the pandemic. The main reason for this was the 17.37% growth in agriculture. The crore acre ayacut which was the dream of the government was actually heading for 1.25 crore acres. The government would add 16 to 17 lakh acres to the ayacut every year henceforth. In response to Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka’s criticism that the government had pushed the State into a debt trap, Mr. Rao said the GSDP had grown from Rs. 4.51 lakh crore to Rs. 9.78 lakh crore which was not possible without incurring a large amount capital expenditure to create assets. Telangana was in 25th place in borrowings out of 29 States, according to Comptrollers and Auditor General and Central Statistical Organisation. The RBI had also acknowledged that Telangana was among three States to utilise minimal borrowings due to fiscal prudence. The State had never resorted to overdraft. Stressing that Telangana had achieved all-round growth in all sectors, Mr. Rao said banks vied to purchase bonds issued by the State government when RBI auctioned them on Tuesdays. They eagerly waited on those days for the offers of Telangana government. Invariably, the offer was made with a repayment period of 25 to 40 years, which interested the lenders. Mr. Rao said cent per cent of land mass in the State would come under the radar of Dharani portal to identify ownership. They will be given coordiantes which can never be tampered. Already, the coverage was 1.53 crore acres of 2.77 crore acres. The transactions would be system driven to enable sale and purchase of lands, bestowing hereditary rights and execution of gift deeds. He promised investment support by government under Rytu Bandhu for podu cultivators after solving the issues in praja darbar. The government was committed to protecting their livelihoods and forest lands. Mr. Rao said he had asked the TRS leaders to meet 1.53 lakh beneficiaries of government welfare programmes in poll bound Nagarjunasagar constituency to explain the good things happening. The programmes had not stopped despite coronavirus. The per capita income, per capita power use and production of agricultural produce were on the rise. The Central Electricity Authority had announced that the State was in a position to meet a demand of 28,000 MW.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-compromise-on-rayalaseema-li-scheme/article34174844.ece

Mr. Bhalla said the country was passing through a critical juncture as the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths had been on the rise in many States and Union Territories. There was no direction for political rallies that were seeing huge crowds in poll-bound Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. The letter said that in view of the upcoming festivals such as Holi, Shab-e Barat, harvest celebrations, Easter and Id-ul-Fitr, the State governments and the Union Territory administrations should take necessary measures to regulate crowds as mandated in the guidelines issued by the Union Home Ministry on March 23. “After assessing the situation, guidelines for effective control of COVID 19 have been issued by MHA on 23.03.2021 wherein it has been emphasized that States/UTs should strictly enforce test, track, treat protocol, COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and prescribed SOPs on various activities, such as opening of schools, higher education institutions, hotels and restaurants, shopping malls, multiplexes, entertainment parks, gymnasiums, exhibitions etc. Further, States and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may impose local restrictions at district/sub district and cities/ward level,” the letter said.

27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC reserves orders on Navlakha bail plea||The Supreme Court on Friday reserved its orders on a plea for bail filed by activist Gautam Navlakha in the Bhima Koregaon violence case. A Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit heard the arguments raised by senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocates Nitya Ramakrishnan and Shadan Farasat for grant of default bail to Mr. Navlakha under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Section 43(D)(2) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Mr. Navlakha has challenged the dismissal of his bail plea by the Bombay High Court on February 8. The High Court had upheld the NIA court verdict to deny him bail “despite the petitioner (Navlakha) spending more than 90 days in custody”. “The main question that arises is whether a period of 34 days when Navlakha was in custody by way of house arrest pursuant to orders of the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court modifying transit remand order dated August 28, 2018 of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, would count as custody for the purpose of default bail,” Mr. Sibal argued. “He was subsequently in police custody for 11 days and judicial custody for 46 days. At this point, he had completed 90 days in custody and was entitled to the indefeasible right to default bail,” Mr. Sibal argued. The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches made by activists in Pune on December 31, 2017.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supreme-court-reserves-orders-on-navlakha-bail-plea/article34174476.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC puts off order on judge’s chat case as phone goes missing||In a curious turn of events, the Supreme Court postponed the pronouncement of its judgment at the last minute on Friday in an appeal filed by a former Andhra High Court judge, Justice V. Eswaraiah, after suspicions were raised that a “concerted effort” was afoot to wipe clean crucial evidence. The case concerns a WhatsApp call between the former HC judge and a suspended judicial officer, Ramakrishna. The call allegedly contained several damaging remarks about the Andhra HC and Supreme Court judiciary. The High Court had ordered a judicial inquiry by former Supreme Court judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, into the phone chat. Consequently, Justice Eswaraiah moved the apex court in appeal. He said the chat was private and Ramakrishna had recorded it without his knowledge and presented the recording before the HC in an unrelated case. A Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan was scheduled to pronounce its judgment on Justice Eswaraiah’s plea to quash the enquiry into the chat. Events however took an unexpected twist when senior advocate Kapil Sibal and advocate Vipin Nair informed the court that Ramakrishna had been arrested. Further, his phone was reported “missing” from the police station. Mr. Sibal, appearing for an intervenor, M. Bhagya Rao, said there was “an underlying conspiracy to destroy crucial evidence… it is imperative that an impartial investigative agency takes over the investigation”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-puts-off-order-on-judges-chat-case-as-phone-goes-missing/article34174466.ece

The case was originally scheduled before the Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Manikumar on Friday. However, a Bench consisting of Justice C.T. Ravikumar and Justice Murali Purushothaman considered the case as the Chief Justice was on leave. Mr. Chennithala submitted that the ECI was being grossly lethargic towards the complaint and shying away from rectifying the issue.

It had been found that 4,34,042 fake/multiple entry votes were added to the list in 131 Assembly constituencies. The fake/multiple entry voters should be restrained from participating in the poll and criminal action launched against those responsible for the entries, he submitted. Thousands of complaints had reached the ECI after the publication of the final electoral rolls on January 20, 2021, he submitted.

Anyone buying bonds would have to fulfil KYC (Know Your Customer) norms, the court said. Purchase of electoral bonds was through banking channels. It would be easy to trace the money spent on buying electoral bonds from the expense sheets of companies. Mr. Bhushan had argued that electoral bonds purchased using white money through banking channels could be re-purchased by an anonymous entity using black cash. “This contention arises out of ignorance of the scheme. Under Clause 14, the bonds are not tradeable. Moreover, the first buyer will not stand to gain anything out of such sale except losing white money for the black,” the court responded in its order. The court debunked fears that electoral bonds would help foreign corporate houses influence domestic electoral politics. It said the bonds could be purchased only by a person who was a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-refuses-to-stop-sale-of-electoral-bonds/article34174471.ece

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||SC backs Tata Sons, sets aside NCLAT order||The court dismissed the NCLAT’s observations that affairs inside Tata Sons were so “prejudicial and oppressive” that the company deserved to be wound up. “Tata Sons is a principal investment holding company, of which the majority shareholding is with philanthropic Trusts… NCLAT should have raised the most fundamental question whether it would be equitable to wind up the company and thereby starve to death those charitable Trusts, especially on the basis of uncharitable allegations of oppressive and prejudicial conduct,” the CJI lashed out. The court also upheld the votive rights of the nominee directors on the Board. It said these same nominees, now accused of prejudice by Mr. Mistry, had named him Mr. Tata’s successor. But the court said the NCLAT certainly went overboard to reinstate Mr. Mistry as chairman. “NCLAT appears to have granted the relief of reinstatement gratis without any foundation in pleadings, without any prayer and without any basis in law,” Chief Justice Bobde stated. The court said the NCLAT was acting well outside its jurisdiction to “mute” TATA Sons’ power under Article 75 of the Articles of Association to purchase the shares of any shareholder at a fair market price. “The order of NCLAT tinkering with the power available under Article 75 is wholly unsustainable... Article 75 was not an invention of the recent origin in Tata Sons. It has been there for nearly a century in one form or the other,” Chief Justice Bobde said. However, the court said the SP Group, after criticising Article 75, now depends on the same provision for an “exit option” from the Tatas. The court said the valuation of shares of SP group depends on the value of the stakes of Tata Sons. The court left it to Tatas and SP group to reach a fair compensation on the latter’s shares either by taking the Article 75 route or by any other legal means.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-backs-tata-sons-sets-aside-nclat-order/article34174473.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sonia recalls Indira Gandhi’s role in ’71 war||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday sent a video message to Bangladesh on the occasion of the golden jubilee celebrations of the country’s Independence and birth centenary celebrations of ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In her message to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Abdul Hamid, Ms. Gandhi recalled the role played by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the liberation of Bangladesh and the special bond between the people of the two nations. “Fifty years ago, the courageous people of Bangladesh scripted a whole new destiny for themselves and transformed both history and geography of the subcontinent,” she said. “Over the past five decades, Bangladesh’s remarkable achievements in social development, community participation, economic growth and other areas have been very impressive. We in India have always had a special relationship with the people of Bangladesh. This has been in very large measure because of the role Indira Gandhi played in the historic events of 1971 and the deep bonds of mutual respect, admiration and deep friendship that Banga Bandhu and she established,” the Congress president said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sonia-recalls-indira-gandhis-role-in-71-war/article34174526.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||No ‘iron curtains’ around electoral bonds, says SC||A “little effort” will go a long way in piercing the veil of secrecy about electoral bonds, the Supreme Court said in an order on Friday. “All that is required is a little more effort to cull out such information from both sides (purchaser of bond and political party) and do some ‘match the following’. Therefore, it is not as though the operations under the scheme are behind iron curtains incapable of being pierced,” a three-judge Bench of Chief Justices S.A. Bobde, Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian said. Apprehensions allayed The court dealt with apprehensions that corporate houses, domestic and foreign, could anonymously contribute hefty amounts to parties and have a stranglehold over electoral politics. The court said money spent by companies could be easily traced online on the website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Banking channels “They can also be obtained in physical form from the Registrar of Companies upon payment of prescribed fee. Since the scheme mandates political parties to file audited statement of accounts and also since the Companies Act requires financial statements of registered companies to be filed with the Registrar of Companies, the purchase as well as encashment of the bonds, happening only through banking channels, is always reflected in documents that eventually come to the public domain,” the court noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-iron-curtains-around-electoral-bonds-says-sc/article34174527.ece
27 March 2021||Pune,||Night curfew starts in Maharashtra tomorrow||In view of the spiralling number of COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday instructed authorities to impose a night curfew across the entire State beginning Sunday night. Mr. Thackeray said that the measure had been taken in an attempt to preclude congestion and curb the growing number of infections. The order issued by the State government has decreed that all shopping malls will remain closed from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m.. Mr. Thackeray warned of more stringent restrictions if people did not scrupulously follow COVID-19 safety rules. He further said that while he had permitted District Collectors to decide whether and when to impose lockdowns, he assured that there would not be any sudden State-wide lockdown and that the public would be given advance notice. Review meeting The move comes following a review meeting in which the Chief Minister interacted with all Divisional Commissioners, Collectors and other municipal and police authorities, as well as civil surgeons of all district government hospitals. “I do not wish to impose a lockdown and have no intention of doing so, but given the growing number of patients, there is a possibility of increased strain on the existing health infrastructure,” Mr. Thackeray said, adding that he had directed each district administration to focus on expanding health facilities, as well as make provision for additional beds and medicines. The Chief Minister said he had instructed the respective District Collectors to impose a lockdown where cases were rising dramatically. The State government has also urged the Christian community to observe Good Friday and celebrate Easter Sunday in a simple manner. The order has restricted the number of people attending prayers during the holy week (March 28 to April 4) in a (spacious) church to a maximum of 50 people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-to-impose-night-curfew-from-tomorrow/article34174500.ece
27 March 2021||New Delhi,||SC stays non-committal on Rohingya issue||The Supreme Court on Friday maintained a non-committal tone when its judicial conscience was tapped by advocate Prashant Bhushan about the atrocities Rohingya may face on deportation back to Myanmar. “We are not in any way called upon to condone or condemn genocide in Myanmar, though we believe genocide anywhere is condemnable,” Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde reacted to Mr. Bhushan. The Centre, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, said Rohingya who had fled persecution in Myanmar to India were deported only after the government of that country confirmed their nationality. “They are illegal immigrants. We are in touch with Myanmar. Once Myanmar confirms their nationality, they are deported,” Mr. Mehta explained. “So, you will deport only after Myanmar confirms?” the CJI verified. “Yes, we cannot deport a person from Afghanistan to Mynamar,” Mr. Mehta said. “The fear is that once they are deported, they may get slaughtered. But we cannot stop it…” the CJI remarked. Mr. Mehta said, “India is not the capital of the immigrants of the world”. “But will the word of a military government that has seized power through a coup be enough for the Indian government?,” Mr. Bhushan asked. Chief Justice Bobde said the Supreme Court could not refuse to recognise the sovereignty of another nation. “The mere fact that another country wants them [Rohingya] back and you [India] want to give them is not enough. You cannot send anybody to a place where he can be killed or subjected to torture,” Mr. Bhushan argued.  The top court reserved its order in the case. The court hearing concerns an urgent application filed by NGO, Association for Democratic Reforms, represented by Mr. Bhushan, for the release of about 150 Rohingya reportedly detained in a Jammu jail and stalling of their deportation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-stays-non-committal-on-rohingya-issue/article34174501.ece
27 March 2021||JAMMU,||India, Pak. hold brigade commander-level meet||A brigade commander-level meeting between the Indian and the Pakistani armies was held in J&K’s Poonch district on Friday, the first such meet since the February 25 joint statement by the two countries reaffirming their commitment to abide by the 2003 ceasefire agreement. An Army spokesman, in a tweet, said that post the Directors General of Military Operations Understanding 2021, a brigade commander level flag meeting was held between Indian and Pakistan armies at Poonch’s Rawalkot crossing point on Friday “to discuss the implementation mechanism as per the understanding”. The meeting comes amid a complete peace maintained by the two armies along the Line of Control (LoC). The fresh meeting between the two armies has fuelled speculations of a further widening of the scope of the confidence building measures along the LoC, which also houses two main trading points in Jammu and Kashmir. Significantly, Poonch’s Rawalkot is also a trading point, which was closed by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2019 after reports of “terror funding”. The top Indian and Pakistani Army officers’ meet comes a day after Army Chief General Manoj Naravane confirmed that silence prevailed on the LoC “for the first time in around five to six years, as not a single shot was fired in March, barring an odd incident”. However, Gen. Naravane was quick to add on Thursday that “the terror infrastructure, including terrorist launch-pads on the Pakistani side, remained intact”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-pak-hold-brigade-commander-level-meet/article34174504.ece
27 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Police detain farmer leaders in Karnataka||The State government drew the ire of protesters on Friday after the city police detained farmers’ leaders and activists who were rallying against the three farm laws brought in by the Union government. Samyukta Horata – Karnataka, a coalition of farmers, Dalits, and labour organisations spearheading protests in the State, had given a Karnataka bandh call, but later withdrew it. They announced that they would instead hold a mock funeral procession for the three farm laws, in solidarity with the Bharat Bandh call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, to mark four months of agitation in Delhi. However, the State government came under severe criticism for not allowing them to hold protests in Bengaluru. The police detained a host of protesters at Nayandahalli and Town Hall on Friday morning. “We can understand this kind of action in case of a bandh, but we had withdrawn the bandh call and were only holding a protest demonstration. In which democracy does the police not allow citizens to hold a peaceful protest?” said farmers’ leader Kodihalli Chandrashekar. He was detained at a protest in front of the Town Hall. All the activists who were detained were released later in the day. Samyukta Horata – Karnataka also condemned the arrest of farmers’ activists in the city and the arrest of SKM leader Yuddhaveer Singh in Gujarat. Meanwhile, farmers held mock funeral processions and burnt the effigy of three farm laws in various parts of the State, including in Mysuru and Belagavi. LeaderKurubur Shanthakumar said farmers had symbolically burnt the effigies of the “anti-farmer” laws enacted by the Union and State governments. Badagalpura Nagendra, another farmers’ leader from Mysuru, said, “We will never accept these laws that are a virtual death sentence to us farmers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-detain-farmer-leaders-in-karnataka/article34174456.ece

27 March 2021||Hyderabad,||Two held for online fraud||Two people from Indore in Madhya Pradesh who cheated a city-based woman to the tune of Rs. 1.20 crore on the pretext of online trading have been arrested by the Hyderabad Cyber Crime police. The accused Rahul Siraswal (29), a driver and Mahesh Dev (25), a welder are natives of Indore. The woman had approached police stating that in November last, she received notification through Facebook id ‘Sakshi Mehta’ claiming to be a consultant in stock trading with Company Central Trade Research, Vasant Kunj in New Delhi. Profits promised They called the complainant over mobile phone and asked to open a demat account for online trading and assured get huge profits. “Believing her words, the woman accepted the offer and further provided bank accounts to the complainant and asked to transfer money,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said. Initially, she transferred Rs. 5 lakh for trading. “ After that Sakshi Mehta told her that she got Rs. 88 lakh profit in the trading and to claim the profit she needed to pay the amount as per company rules,” he said. Soon, the complainant transferred Rs. 1.20 crore into the bank accounts provided by the fraudsters and later came to know that she was cheated by them on the pretext of online trading. Complaint Based on her complaint, a case was registered and the accused were arrested. Police seized two mobile phones, 12 debit cards and five credit cards of HDFC, RBL and Axis banks.

27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC relief for Mamata’s election agent||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the operation of a Calcutta High Court order to re-institute criminal cases against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s election agent in connection with the Nandigram protests against land acquisition. “Since the order which affects the petitioner (election agent) herein was passed without hearing him, we deem it appropriate to pass an interim order staying the operation of the order dated March 5, 2021,” a Bench led by Justice Indira Banerjee noted in the order. The petitioner, S.K. Supian, has challenged the order passed by the Calcutta High Court on two PILs against the withdrawal of prosecution in various criminal cases connected with the protests over the alleged improper acquisition of land by the State to create a special economic zone (SEZ) in Nandigram. Mr. Supian, represented by senior advocate Vikas Singh, has contended he was not made a party in the PILs and the reinstitution of the criminal cases has impaired his ability to discharge his functions as an election agent under the Representation of the People Act 1951. Mr. Singh alleged that a PIL was “filed by a BJP person” in the high court which passed the interim order. “By an interim order, the case was revived,” he said, adding, “I (petitioner) am the election agent of the Chief Minister and because of this order, I am virtually disabled”. Mr. Singh submitted that the plea filed in the high court was “politically motivated”. Senior advocates A.M. Singhvi and Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the State, opposed the high court’s interim order. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for a caveator who was a petitioner in the high court, said the petitions of the State and Mr. Supian should be dismissed with exemplary cost as they have “lied to this court”. Mr. Rohatgi, during the hearing, claimed that both the State and Mr. Supian have argued that only agitation cases were withdrawn but there were some cases, including those under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code also. However, the Bench said that the plea filed by the State is not before it. Mr. Singh said in Nandigram protest, there were allegations that some people had died in police firing and in some cases, allegation of murder was there. Mr. Rohatgi alleged that there are six cases against Mr. Supian and he was absconding for 13 years. “This is a shocking case where cases are withdrawn in stereotype fashion,” Mr. Rohatgi said, adding the petitioners before the high court are practising lawyers. Mr. Rohatgi said the apex court can ask the division bench of the high court to hear the matter on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-relief-for-mamatas-election-agent/article34174523.ece

27 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Row over Shivakumar’s name in clip||Hours after the city police registered an FIR against the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi for sexual abuse, a purported recording of a telephonic conversation between the victim and her family was leaked to the media where she is heard dropping the name of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar thrice in the seven-minute clip. This triggered a political storm and lent yet another twist to the case. However, The Hindu could not independently verify the veracity of this audio clip. Repeated references In the conversation that purportedly took place on the night the sex CD was leaked to television channels, the woman is heard telling a man on the other end (said to be her brother) that “DK [Mr. Shivakumar] himself” is meeting her and she had “now come near the house of D. K. Shivakumar” and was going to speak to him. She is further heard reassuring the family that she was safe and repeatedly claimed the video and audio clips aired on television were “fake, morphed and voice modulated”. She is heard promising to send a video to prove she was innocent “after D.K. Shivakumar’s people give it to her”. Days after the alleged sex video showing intimate moments of Mr. Jarkiholi came to the public domain, he alleged that a “mahanayaka” (big leader) was behind the conspiracy to defame him. The State government formed a SIT to probe this “conspiracy” and an FIR was registered against unidentified individuals for “conspiracy to defame Jarkiholi, forgery and extort money”. The audio clip will now be part of the probe, sources said. In a series of tweets BJP, Karnataka, attacked Mr. Shivakumar and demanded that the Congress should seek his resignation as party chief. “The Congress that sought to capture power misusing a woman must apologise to the people,” it demanded. The party also taunted Congress leaders who attacked Mr. Jarkiholi and the State government in the Legislative Assembly and asked “if the conspiracy was hatched in KPCC office”. ‘More to come’ Mr. Jarkiholi, speaking to presspersons on Friday evening, said he had not listened to the purported audio clip and when quizzed as to whether the “mahanayaka” he was referring to was indeed Mr. Shivakumar, he said the KPCC president had been a dear friend who had been with him through thick and thin and he only wished him well. He further claimed he would make a “big revelation” on Saturday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/row-over-shivakumars-name-in-clip/article34174454.ece

27 March 2021||New Delhi,||Will take a call on Kerala RS polls soon: EC||The Election Commission on Friday said it would take a call on conducting elections for three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala shortly, after putting off its March 17 announcement of holding the polls on April 12 on Wednesday. The ECI had announced that it would hold polls to fill the seats that are set to be vacated due to the retirement of MPs Abdul Wahab, K.K. Ragesh and Vayalar Ravi on April 21. However, on Wednesday, the day the poll notification was expected to be issued, the EC said it had put its earlier decision in “abeyance”. The EC said it had received a reference from the Ministry of Law and Justice that would be examined. With the Kerala Assembly polls on April 6 and results scheduled for May 2, the new Assembly, which elects the Rajya Sabha MPs, would not be in place by April 12, the earlier date of Rajya Sabha polls. On Friday, EC spokesperson Sheyphali Sharan said in a tweet: “CPI(M) delegation met ECI today. Decision of conducting elections to the 3 RS seats in Kerala will be shortly taken by ECI strictly within the existing legislative framework incl. provisions of RP Act,1951. M/o L&J has no remit to make recommendation on schedule of RS elections. (sic)”.  CPI(M) writes to CEC  Challenging the EC’s decision to put into abeyance the elections to the three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala because of the Assembly polls, CPI(M)’s Rajya Sabha floor leader Elamaram Kareem pointed out that the argument made by the poll panel is specious and that in 2016 too the elections to the Rajya Sabha were held though the Assembly elections had been notified. Mr. Kareem, in a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, said the Law Ministry’s interference with the election schedule is in contravention of the powers of the Commission under Article 324. Once the electoral process has begun, Mr. Kareem said, it can not be interfered with. The ECI had on March 17 announced the elections to the three seats. However, a week later, on Wednesday in a short press note it announced that it has received a reference from the Law Ministry because of which it is putting the elections in abeyance till further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-take-a-call-on-kerala-rs-polls-soon-ec/article34174451.ece
27 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,||‘BJP wants to control everything from Delhi’||The passing of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, which empowers the Lt. Governor of Delhi, reflects the “mindset” of the BJP to “centralise” governance from Delhi, said Praveen Chakravarty, chairman of the Data Analytics Department, All India Congress Committee. “What London was to the British empire, New Delhi is to the BJP. It is about controlling everything from Delhi. Only when they control from the capital can they impose their will, Hindi and their version of Hinduism, which is not real Hinduism. Only people’s power can resist the policies of the BJP,” he told The Hindu . The fight by the Congress was to protect the constitutional values and the idea of India, he said, adding, “On the one side, someone says they are against constitutional principles, and on the other, we say we will safeguard the Constitution.”  Different approaches Regarding the Congress’s different approaches in Kerala and West Bengal (in Kerala, the party fights the Left and in West Bengal, it has an alliance with the Communist parties), Mr. Chakravarty said, “This is what we try to communicate. We can’t have one rule for the people and the entire country. Kerala and West Bengal are different States, and that is what our country is all about. In Puducherry, maybe, only a small section speaks French, but that language should be given space to flourish.” On the perception of the BJP coming to power in the Union Territory after the coming election, he said, “Perception is important but the one [created] by the BJP is a manufactured perception. The best way to counter this battle is to get to the people and explain to them. The people of the Union Territory are terrified of the BJP coming to power.” If the BJP comes to power, the Union Territory would definitely lose its identity, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-wants-to-control-everything-from-delhi/article34174623.ece

27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Civic issues persist in DMK’s pocket-borough||For voters, Chepauk has always been a known name. Election of former DMK supremo M. Karunanidhi to the Assembly thrice — in 1996, 2001 and 2006 — has endowed it with a certain amount of fame. It has mostly stayed loyal to the DMK for 30 years. Chepauk merged with Triplicane post the delimitation order of 2008. In 2006, the Chepauk voters handed victory to Karunanidhi, while Triplicane voters elected Badar Sayeed of the AIADMK. However, voters of the merged Chepauk-Triplicane constituency have remained loyal to the DMK since 2011. J. Anbazhagan of the DMK was elected in 2011 and 2016. He died of COVID-19 in June 2020, and the seat fell vacant. Karunanidhi’s grandson and DMK president M.K. Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi is contesting from the seat this time. Congestion and traffic have remained the foremost concerns all these years. Residents also complain about the problem of stray cattle. Though Triplicane has two flyovers to reach Anna Salai, areas such as Dr. Besant Road, Ice House and Mirsahibpet are choked. The residents want a multi-level parking facility on the Corporation land on Dr. Besant Road. A resident R.V. Narasimhan wants space earmarked for vendors, who operate literally on the carriageway, adding to the congestion. The approach to the MRTS station at Triplicane has been shut; people take a detour to reach the station. “The Corporation says it is not its property. The area has become a den for anti-social elements because at night the street lights do not work,” says V.P. Manivannan, a commuter. Residents want the Metropolitan Transport Corporation to restore the bus services on route no. 12, 45A, 24 and 24C. T.A. Sathyanarayanan, a commuter, says the services have either been suspended or their frequency reduced. The mini-bus service from LIC to Ice House has been suspended after it was operated for just a month, he rues. “A bus bay built near Vivekanandar Illam to commemorate the centenary of Swami Vivekananda is being used by auto-rickshaws,” he says. A.V.A. Kassali of the PMK, which is part of the AIADMK-led coalition, has made Pudupet his residence for the past 40 years. “My opponent is young and people haven’t taken to him yet. He has inherited the constituency. I am of an agricultural background and a social activist. Though the constituency falls under the Central Chennai Lok Sabha constituency, very little development has happened here,” he says. Mr. Kassali says Muslims, who are predominant in the constituency, would prefer him. At Pudupet, the challenges are many. He wants to make the beaches pleasant for visitors. He believes he has an edge over Mr. Udhayanidhi. The other prominent contestants are Jayasimmaraja of Naam Tamilar Katchi, L. Rajendran of the AMMK, and Mohammed Ithris of Indhiya Jananayaka Katchi, which has tied up with Makkal Needhi Maiam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-issues-persist-in-dmks-pocket-borough/article34174620.ece

27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Suspended Special DGP appears before inquiry panel||The former Special Director-General of Police (DGP) on Friday appeared before a committee formed to inquire into a complaint by a woman IPS officer, who alleged that he had sexually harassed her when she was on duty during the Chief Minister’s visit to the districts.

27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A quiver full of degrees at 90||Years of hard work and tonnes of research go into getting a doctorate. But this has not deterred Stanislaus S., 90, of Chennai — who already has many undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and diplomas in his quiver — from obtaining one, and, that too, in law. At an age when many would love to relax and reminisce about their youthful days, he is an inspiration for many youngsters with his resolve to keep enhancing his knowledge. At his house in Nungambakkam, with books as his companion, Mr. Stanislaus spends time preparing for academic excellence. He walks almost everywhere and takes public buses to get to a destination that he cannot walk to. That he says is the secret of his energy at this age. He has post-graduate degrees in areas, including sociology, political science and law, and is pursuing one in international relations; under-graduate degrees in history and law; diplomas in civil engineering, computer applications and computer hardware; and postgraduate diplomas in criminology and forensic science. The latest is the doctorate for his thesis — Administration of Justice-Special Reference To Death Penalty. In April 2016, he enrolled as a full-time research scholar at Acharya Nagarjuna University and submitted his thesis in June 2019. He was awarded the doctorate in August 2020. “I started pursuing all this after I retired in 1989 as an engineer from the Military Engineering Service in which I served for over three decades. My wife Ranganayaki Janardhani, who passed away in 2009, was a huge support to me,” says Mr. Stanislaus, whose three children are well-settled. Asked why he continued studying after retirement, he says, “My parents died when I was young, and my elder brother Amal Dorairaj, who was in the Royal Indian Navy in Mumbai, helped me pursue education. I don’t like to keep idle. I also guide a lot of people, who approach me and help them in whichever way possible,” he says. Mr. Stanislaus has an ideal in life and he has always emphasised it to his children. “Don’t depend on me, I won’t depend on you. Only then can we rise in life,” he says. Now, he is aiming for one more doctorate in law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-quiver-full-of-degrees-at-90/article34174666.ece
27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘I was up against double standards’||Actor-politician Khushbu’s high profile seems an advantage to the BJP as she seeks election from Thousand Lights. As she walks down the streets of the constituency, women and children flock to her for a selfie and shower her with petals. She believes she has a connect with the people of the constituency where Ezhilan Naganathan of the DMK is pitted against her. She is confident this connect will help her win.  Your visibility as an actor gives you an advantage over your opponent. Is it this factor that is attracting crowds to your campaign? They love me as an actor, a woman, a politician. It is enough that they shower affection on me. I have never met any of them before. The women and children probably haven’t seen my films yet. Whatever they have seen on television matters to them. How well have you understood the problems of the people? What have the people asked of you? Their expectations are about fulfilling their basic day-to-day necessities. They are not asking for a property, car or bungalow. They say that during summers they have a severe drinking water shortage. They want us to clean the water canals and lay roads. They want the only government-run school to be cleaned so that their children can attend classes. They are demanding safe neighbourhoods. In many areas, there are no street lights. The drains get blocked frequently. In some places, drinking water gets mixed with sewage. They are looking for civic facilities that will improve their life. The DMK [MLA] did not provide these facilities. ‘Will you do it now,’ they ask me.   There is a feeling that your being a Muslim by birth could help you in Thousand Lights. As far as this constituency is concerned, they consider me as a member of their family. Be it people from minority communities or other communities, they consider me as one among their own. I am able to connect with them easily. Do you think the people who come out to see you will vote for you? Yes definitely. Otherwise, they wouldn’t react in such a way. When I meet women, they tell me, ‘We have faith that you will do good for us. We were disappointed by others.’ Has hopping from two parties to the BJP put you at a disadvantage? In 2011, for saying that a democratic party would elect leaders through general body elections, stones were thrown at my house. Basically all wanted their sons to enter politics. I was chased out because I, as a woman, was seen as a competitor to the sons. The men wanted to clear the route for dynastic rule to continue. There are those who have joined the DMK from other parties. They have not been criticised for their act. Why the double standards? Even the DMK cannot deny that I am a talented, bold person who has a lot of influence among women. Your opponent, the DMK candidate, has developed a detailed manifesto for each of the wards. What strategy are you adopting to counter it? Thousand Lights was considered the DMK’s stronghold. That they have come up with detailed programmes for each ward is a clear sign that the party has failed the people of the constituency. Dr. Ezhilan should have said, ‘We have done everything for the people and they will vote for me’. Unfortunately, he did not say that. He has only said what each ward requires.  If you get elected and the AIADMK returns to power, what kind of portfolio will you expect?  I am not expecting anything. Now, the focus is on winning. Whether I am given a portfolio or not is unimportant. I have to work for my constituency, that becomes the prime focus. It is not about the portfolio, it is about the people.   You are in charge of the BJP in Chepauk-Triplicane. How does it feel to meet Udhayanidhi Stalin, the DMK’s candidate in that constituency? Both of you are first-timers. Udhayanidhi is not a novice. He knows what elections are about. He knows what false promises are about. I present myself as what I am.   How do you manage to find time for your family amid this hectic schedule? Election comes once in five years. My kids are older now — one is 20 and the other is 18. I make sure that I meet them when I go back home by 11 p.m. However late it is, I spend time with them and we talk about what they did in school or about their classes. We watch at least one episode of some programme.  Now, the focus is on winning. Whether I am given a portfolio or not is unimportant. I have to work for my constituency||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-am-talented-bold-have-influence-among-women/article34174628.ece
27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Promise of computers is to monitor govt. functioning’||Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Friday told voters not to consider his party’s promise of providing computers to every household as a freebie, but as a tool to monitor government functioning and raise queries about pending services. Mr. Haasan was campaigning in MMDA colony, Arumbakkam, for V. Ponraj, the party’s vice-president and candidate for the Anna Nagar constituency. Mr. Ponraj, who has tested positive for COVID-19, joined the campaign digitally. “Today, due to technology, Ponraj is able to join digitally. Ours is a paperless and digital party. This will continue even after we form the government,” Mr. Haasan said. According to him, the objective behind promising computers to every household was to ensure that people can monitor and ask questions about their pending services to the government, on the basis of their right to get services. “So far such a transparent arrangement is not available and we have promised to do it. Our MLAs will disclose where the funds came from and how they are spent on the basis of right to information,” Mr. Haasan said. He reiterated that creating job opportunities alone would eradicate poverty and not freebies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/promise-of-computers-is-to-monitor-govt-functioning/article34174654.ece

It insisted that steps be taken to make sure that everyone wears masks and maintains distancing on the day to arrest the spread of the infection. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy asked the ECI to brace for the worst-case scenario and directed the State government to render all necessary assistance to the Commission. They said public awareness on the necessity to follow protocol could be created through the media. The court insisted that protocol be followed during campaigns as well. All parties and candidates in the fray must exercise a degree of responsibility and ensure that norms are adhered to during their campaigns. They must also make voters aware of the necessity to follow the directions, especially when a second wave appears to have begun, they said.

27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MMC alumni join hands to support their alma mater||Some of the senior alumni of the Madras Medical College have got together to launch a foundation to help restore the institution to its former glory. The Madras Red Fort Doctors Foundation has three signatories to the Memorandum of Association. The signatories are senior retired medical practitioners who graduated from the MMC. The aim of the non-governmental organisation is to collect funds and work towards improving the college’s image. K. Badrinath, a retired orthopaedic surgeon from the United Kingdom and alumnus of the MMC, said, “When I went to England 50 years ago, we got so much importance as we were from MMC. It is not so well-known now as it was then. Our institution is a very old college and now it has deteriorated.” The other two signatories are Paluvai R. Bharani and Subbaraya Mudaliar Vaidhianathan. The idea emerged by watching the Indian Institutes of Technology. The foundation will bring together the alumni and remain an independent body, Dr. Badrinath said. “We will assess how things are and what we can do to help the students and graduates. The present Dean is keen and enthusiastic. The funds for the college will come from the membership fee collected by the Foundation,” he said. The foundation will initially collect some amount and then it will start seeking donations, he said. It already has 49 members, mostly from Tamil Nadu. There are a few from Karnataka and from other countries such as Malaysia, Mauritius, the U.S. and the U.K. The foundation organises a monthly online meeting in which a senior alumnus is invited to speak. The meetings are held on the last Sunday of every month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mmc-alumni-join-hands-to-help-their-alma-mater/article34174661.ece
27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cong. flays BJP’s stand on NEET quota||Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Friday criticised the Central BJP government’s reported submission in the Madras High Court that the Tamil Nadu government’s decision to implement 7.5% reservation in medical education for students from government schools was not referred to it. Referring to the Union Home Ministry’s submission in the High Court during the hearing of a petition seeking to implement 10% reservation for students in the Union Territory of Puducherry, Mr. Alagiri claimed that the BJP government at the Centre had taken a stand against government school students. “Besides refusing the 10% reservation in medical education for government school students in Puducherry, the BJP government’s submission also shows that there is a danger to the 7.5% reservation being implemented in Tamil Nadu,” he contended. The BJP government’s stand was a direct attack on the students of Tamil Nadu, and this approach was against reservation and social justice, he said. “The BJP government’s submission in court is its next weapon to destroy the dreams of students from Tamil Nadu,” he added. The AIADMK government implemented the 7.5% reservation in view of the election, and the quota would be under danger after the election, he said. “The BJP and the AIADMK are playing with the future of government school students in Tamil Nadu,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-flays-bjps-stand-on-neet-quota/article34174650.ece

Velumani against non-governmental organisation Arappor Iyakkam, its convener Jayaram Venkatesan, joint convener Jahir Hussain and treasurer P. Nakeeran for continuously accusing the Minister of corruption on their social media accounts despite an interim order passed by the court on February 17. First Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy came down heavily on the Minister for having filed the contempt petition despite the February 17 court order not having gagged anyone from speaking about allegations of corruption. The judges said it was a “frivolous contempt petition that needs to be thrown away” and that it was nothing but an abuse of the process of the court. The judges also initially dictated orders imposing a token cost of Rs. 10 on the Minister for having filed such a petition. However, when petitioner’s counsel requested not to impose such costs since the contempt petition had been filed on the basis of a misunderstanding of the court order and not because of any malice, the judges accepted his request and ordered that no such costs need to be paid.

Ram. Speaking at a panel discussion of political party representatives on elections and the launch of the publication on Assembly election 2021 ‘Ippodhu’, Mr. Ram said media had the duty to discuss such issues. “A huge proportion of electoral bonds has gone to the BJP,” he said. Pointing to the Supreme Court’s ruling on the constitutional validity of electoral bond scheme ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections, Mr. Ram said the issue had to be discussed. “I am very disappointed. The freedom of speech and expression is restricted. They are misusing the institutions. It is a shameful situation,” said Mr. Ram. Bharatiya Janata Party representative Sowdhamini said many women like her had been motivated to participate in electoral politics by the leaders of the BJP and had overcome challenges in life.

27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Job scam: charge sheet filed against Senthil Balaji||The Central Crime Branch (CCB), Job Racket Wing, has filed a chargesheet against V. Senthil Balaji, DMK MLA from Aravakurichi, who was Transport Minister in the AIADMK government between 2011 and 2015, for his involvement in a scam in recruitment to transport corporations. The chargesheet names 46 other persons, including his personal assistants, former managing directors of transport corporations, junior engineers and others. Investigation revealed that during 2014-15, Mr. Balaji entered into a criminal conspiracy with then managing directors of all State Transport Undertakings (STUs) and other officers of transport corporations to obtain illegal gratification from candidates to recruit them as driver, conductor, junior tradesman, junior assistant, junior engineer and assistant engineer in the transport corporations, said the chargesheet. The final report of the CCB alleged that Mr. Balaji colluded with his close associates, B. Shanmugam and M. Karthikeyan alias Karthik, and collected data from all State Transport Corporations through managing directors and officers of the personnel section to collate complete data of the candidates. He got illegal gratification from the candidates and sent lists to the managing directors, appointing authority and personnel section officers of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation to issue appointment orders for the candidates mentioned in the said list. Investigation also revealed that appointment orders were issued to 33 candidates for the post of junior engineer, in accordance with the list illegally furnished by Mr. Balaji, the then managing director, joint MD, senior deputy manager (HR) and deputy manager, without following communal reservation. They fraudulently altered the original interview marks of candidates in the registers, the chargesheet said. The registers containing details of candidates, maintained in the personnel section, were tampered with and forged. Interview marks were fraudulently reduced for meritorious candidates. Consequently, the files, records and registers were falsely fabricated by officials, and thereby they committed offences punishable under Sections 465 (Punishment for forgery), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (Using genuine as forged) dishonestly uses as genuine and 420 (Cheating) of IPC r/w 120 (B) (Criminal Conspiracy) of the IPC and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Originally, the case was registered based on a complaint of S. Devasagayamin in 2015 alleging that C. Palani, who was working as a conductor in Metropolitan Transport Corporation, received Rs. 2.6 lakh to arrange a conductor’s job for his son.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/job-scam-chargesheet-filed-against-mla/article34174656.ece

The court said the ECI must be allowed to concentrate on the actual poll process rather than spending time on considering representations and concentrating on court cases. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy also dismissed a PIL petition that sought a direction to the ECI to close down State-run liquor shops. The judges said the ECI had better work than being distracted by busybodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-eci/article34174630.ece
27 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vijayakant||Sunitha Sekar   On Thursday, there was heavy traffic in Otteri, as DMDK founder Vijayakanth was scheduled to campaign in the area. People came together for just a glimpse of the actor. A party worker suddenly began announcing that the founder’s vehicle was almost there. At the time, The Hindu’s staffers were on duty in the area and their vehicle was diverted to the left, while all others went straight. Seeing this, the crowd mistakenly assumed that the staff’s vehicle was that of Mr. Vijayankanth, and began clicking pictures and folding hands in respect. They soon realised it was a clear case of mistaken identity and left.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vijayakant/article34174636.ece
27 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘Fulfil promises made to govt. doctors’||Objecting to the diversion of government doctors to Chennai for COVID-19 duty, the Federation of Government Doctors Association (FOGDA) demanded that the Health Department fulfil the assurances made to doctors and appoint adequate manpower for COVID-19 management. The FOGDA, at a meeting on Wednesday, said during the first wave, the government announced one-month special pay, Rs. 2 lakh ex-gratia for doctors who were infected, and Rs. 50 lakh as solatium for the families of those who died. So far, none of the assurances had been fulfilled, a press release said. During the first wave, the entire health machinery was utilised for COVID-19 work alone. Except for emergencies and casualties, all speciality elective services came to a halt. As a result, there was a backlog of non-COVID-19 cases. The workload has doubled for healthcare workers, who were exhausted both mentally and physically.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fulfil-promises-made-to-govt-doctors-says-union/article34174618.ece
27 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK trying hard to continue its winning streak in Kinathukkadavu||The ruling AIADMK is labouring hard to continue its winning streak in Kinathukkadavu constituency. While the DMK has won the constituency in 1967, 1971, 1989 and 1996, the AIADMK has won it eight times. The AIADMK has fielded former minister S. Damodaran and the DMK Kurichi Prabhakaran. The AIADMK candidate has won the seat consecutively in 2001, 2006 and 2011, while A. Shanmugam of the party won the seat in 2016. He defeated Kurichi Prabakharan by a slender margin of 1,332 votes. Sandwiched between Coimbatore and Pollachi with a substantial number of villages and town panchayats, it is largely a rural constituency. However, seven wards of the Coimbatore Corporation finds place in this constituency. The profile of the constituency is such that it is largely an agrarian economy with equal number of industries right from the outskirts of the city. The constituency has a sizeable population of Kongu Velala Gounders, Vokkaliga Gowders, backward communities and equal number of people from the listed communities in the form of farm labourers. Farmers cultivating tomato, brinjal, ladies finger, groundnut and maize have been demanding cold storage facility. Inadequate rail infrastructure and lack of frequent train services continue to be a major issue on the Coimbatore – Pollachi section, which runs through Kinathukkadavu constituency. Campaign by political parties echoes the decade-old demand for construction of more check dams across Manjapallam river, which originates near Madukkarai and runs up to Velandavazham in Kerala. Infrastructure improvement in SIDCO industrial estate including drinking water and roads, construction of a flyover at the Eachanari junction, which is proving to be an accident prone spot, are the other demands. Another issue that confronts the candidates is the unscientific waste disposal at the Vellalore compost yard, resulting in frequent fire. The public want bio mining method of waste management expedited and intensified to prevent groundwater contamination. The other issue is the dumping of bio medical and poultry waste from Kerala. People want Podanur railway junction developed as a satellite station to decongest Coimbatore Railway Junction. They also demand a railway station at Chettipalayam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-trying-hard-to-continue-its-winning-streak-in-kinathukkadavu/article34174690.ece
27 March 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Murder case convict dies||Lawyer E.T. Rajavel (53), who was serving a double life sentence in the 2011 Ammasai murder case at Coimbatore Central Prison, died on Friday after being hospitalised following a suicide attempt. Prison authorities said Rajavel was lodged in his cell at the third block of the prison. At around 11.50 a.m. on Friday, he was allegedly found attempting suicide, following which the prison staff rushed him to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. As he was admitted at the Intermediate Care Unit (IMCU), his health steadily deteriorated and he was declared dead at around 2.30 p.m., according to the authorities at Coimbatore Central Prison and CMCH. His body was kept at the hospital’s mortuary for autopsy. On November 30, 2020, the Fifth Additional District Court in Coimbatore awarded a double life sentence to Rajavel and his wife R. Mohana (45) for the murder of a 45-year-old woman named Ammasai in December 2011. He allegedly committed the murder to fake Mohana’s death as the latter was then wanted by the Odisha police in a cheating case involving Rs. 12 crore. Mohana, who was also lodged at Coimbatore Central Prison, was informed of her husband’s death on Friday afternoon, the prison authorities said. Further investigations regarding any lapse on the part of the prison staff are under way.

27 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||I will be a bridge between State and Centre: Vanathi||It was dusk. As the road users were honking their way through Mettupalayam Road, police personnel were busy ensuring that the restive crowd gathered at a temple near the North Coimbatore flyover did not slow the vehicle movement. The crowd was there to welcome Bharatiya Janata Party candidate for Coimbatore South Vanathi Srinivasan, who was scheduled to begin her campaign. After praying at the temple, Ms. Srinivasan, accompanied by former AIADMK deputy mayor Leelavathi Unni and the ward election in-charge Jayabal, got on the campaign vehicle. Focusing on the women there, she said, after the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK government under Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had done so much for women. In the manifesto too, the party had promised washing machine, Rs. 1,500 for every family and much more. The money would empower home makers, she said. Reminding voters that the AIADMK and BJP were in alliance, she said that in Coimbatore South they would have to vote by pressing the BJP symbol, lotus. Throughout her campaign in A. Ramalingam Colony and its neighbourhood, she told the voters that voting for the BJP meant voting for the AIADMK. In Bharathi Park and Ramnagar, where she campaigned during the day, she spoke about how she could be a bridge between the State and Centre and how she could leverage her party post for the benefit of people by getting increased funds for schemes connected to Coimbatore’s development. Particularly when it came to schemes for the development of MSMEs or textile sector, her role as an MLA would be helpful. This put her in an advantageous position vis-a-vis the other contestants as she was from the party that ruled the Centre. In Ramnagar, BJP star speaker and actor Namitha canvassed votes for Ms. Srinivasan. In the afternoon, in her interaction with members of the North Indian community, Ms. Srinivasan said though she lost in the 2016 election, the 33,000 votes she secured had strengthened her resolve to work for people in this constituency. She also appealed to the crowd in Hindi to vote for ‘kamal’ (lotus).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-will-be-a-bridge-between-state-and-centre-vanathi/article34174682.ece

27 March 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||Reject dynasty politics of DMK, Congress: Nadda||BJP president J.P. Nadda said it was the BJP government at the Centre which had allocated over Rs. 3,000 crore for the Chennai Metro Rail project, had allotted the AIIMS in Madurai and sanctioned 11 medical colleges in Tamil Nadu, the maximum in the country. He was addressing an election meeting in the Harbour constituency here on Friday, campaigning for the party's candidate Vinoj P. Selvam. He said the AIADMK alliance would return to power for the next five years. “Whatever money Modiji sanctioned for Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK government has utilised properly. Hasn’t the AIADMK done good work on managing COVID-19?” Earlier in the day, at a meeting in Thittakudi in support of party candidate TADA Periyasamy in Cuddalore district, Mr. Nadda unleashed a sharp attack on the DMK-Congress front, stating that the DMK stood for “Dynasty, Money and Katta Panchayat” and the Congress was a party that always ignored local issues and sentiments. Right from Kashmir to Kanniyakumari and from Gujarat to the northeast, all parties had become family parties, and the BJP was the only party with a scientific outlook, said Mr. Nadda. The BJP president asked people to remember corruption under the DMK and the Congress in the name of policy paralysis and alleged that the alliance stood for “2G, 3G and 4G”, referring to the alleged growth of corruption in two generations of the Maran family, under three generations in Stalin’s family, and under four generations in the Gandhi and Congress family. He said Mr. Modi was the first Prime Minister who visited Jaffna and made sure that houses were reconstructed. “We [the BJP] have always protected Tamil culture, language and literature. When the incident of ‘Karuppar Kootam’ cropped up, none other than the BJP came forward and started the Vel campaign,” he said. Addressing an election rally at Budalur near Thanjavur, Mr. Nadda said panchami lands would be handed back to whom those lands were assigned if the AIADMK alliance was voted to power. He was canvassing for party nominee in the Thiruvaiyaru constituency S. Venkatesan.

27 March 2021||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||MP blames Forest Minister for elephant deaths in T. N.||The highest number of elephant deaths in forests has been reported in Tamil Nadu and in the last seven years, 566 casualties have been reported, said Madurai MP Su Venkatesan here on Thursday night. He was seeking support for the CPI (M) candidate N. Pandi, who is contesting in Dindigul Assembly constituency. The MP said that the sitting MLA and Forest Minister Dindigul C. Srinivasan, who is contesting again, should feel ashamed for the highest number of elephant deaths. When this government could not save such gigantic animals in the forest, it would be wrong to expect them (AIADMK) to protect and save the common man, he claimed. In the last three months alone, 10 elephants had died in the forests, he said and added that the AIADMK government had on multiple occasions claimed to have spent Rs. 681 crore for planting of saplings. The MP wanted the public to ask the Minister for details as to where these saplings were planted in Tamil Nadu. The Tejas Express, which runs between Chennai Egmore and Madurai, was made to stop in Dindigul because of the efforts made by the MP. He said that the Forest Minister, who was also an elected representative did not demand even once with the Centre for change of stoppage of the Tejas Express from Kodaikanal Road Junction to Dindigul Railway Junction. Sensing the pulse of the people of Tamil Nadu, many AIADMK candidates contesting in the Assembly election had cleverly turned down the offer made by the BJP that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would campaign for them. This, Mr Venkatesan said, was a big victory for the secular parties led by the DMK. “This election is a fight between candidates who have self-respect and those who have behaved like puppets. By giving an opportunity to the DMK president M. K. Stalin to lead the State the people can witness a new Tamil Nadu,” he said and sought the people to vote for Mr Pandi in Dindigul Assembly constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-blames-forest-minister-for-elephant-deaths-in-t-n/article34174781.ece
27 March 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||A constituency that languishes in neglect||The hill areas of Talavadi, Hasanur and Kadambur, which house the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, Bannari Amman Temple and Dhimbam Ghat Road, occupy two-thirds of the Bhavanisagar Assembly constituency.  The constituency comes under the Nilgiris Parliamentary constituency, in which the Bhavanisagar Dam that feeds the Lower Bhavani Project canal, Kalingarayan Canal, Thadapalli and Arakankottai Canals is located. The constituencies of Sathyamangalam and Bhavanisagar were merged to form Bhavanisagar constituency during the delimitation exercise. Though Talavadi Taluk was formed in 2016, it badly needs basic amenities, better price for farm produce, ST certificate for Tribal people, improved facilities at the upgraded Government primary health centre, job opportunities and road connectivity to tribal hamlets. The taluk with over 50 hamlets has a population of over 76,000, with many hamlets located inside the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. The residents are still dependent on hospitals in Sathyamangalam or at Chamrajanagar in Karnataka, located about 60 km and 22 km respectively, for medical emergencies. Frequent accidents on Dhimbam Ghat Road interrupt movement of vehicles between the Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and also affects the transport of farm produce from Talavadi to the plains. The demand for restricting movement of heavy vehicles on the ghat road is yet to be fulfilled. The demand for laying railway track between Sathyamangalam and Mettupalayam has been strongly opposed by environmentalists. In the absence of road connectivity to many hamlets in Kadambur, people migrate to other places in search of livelihood. Students depend on private vehicles to commute to schools. Effluents from the paper processing industries in Sathyamangalam continue to pollute River Bhavani and ground water in over 20 villages. Jasmine is vastly cultivated in the region and farmers have been demanding a cooperative perfume manufacturing unit for many years now. To mitigate the acute water shortage in Punjai Puliyampatti, people have been seeking diversion of surplus water from Bhavanisagar Dam to refill water bodies in their area. While P.L. Sundaram of Communist Party of India won in 2011, S. Eswaran of AIADMK bagged the seat in 2016. Contestants in the fray are: A. Bannari of AIADMK, Sundaram of CPI, K. Karthik Kumar of MNM, G. Ramesh of Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, and V. Sangeetha of Naam Tamilar Katchi . While Mr. Bannari banks on AIADMK’s welfare measures, Mr. Sundaram has promised to improve amenities in the hill areas and the plains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-constituency-that-languishes-in-neglect/article34174804.ece

Special Correspondent adds from Tiruchi  Campaigning for DMK candidates in Srirangam and Karur, Mr. Stalin said attempts to whip up religious frenzy would not succeed in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu is a Dravidian land and ‘modi masthan’ (a pun on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a colloquial reference to black magicians) acts such as inciting religious sentiments and attempts to impose Hindi and Sanskrit would not work in the State, he said. Claiming that the AIADMK government and the BJP at the Centre had not done anything for the people, he said the two parties were only bent on criticising the DMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-ignored-western-region-stalin/article34174680.ece

27 March 2021||Karaikudi,TAMIL NADU||‘Even during pandemic, many were keen to set up factories in T. N.’||Even during the COVID-19 pandemic times, many business houses had evinced interest to set up their factories in Tamil Nadu, said Chief Minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami here on Friday. The CM, who was campaiging in Sivaganga district in support of the AIADMK and BJP candidates - H. Raja (Karaikudi), S. Marudhu Alaguraj (Tirupathur), P. R. Senthilnathan (Sivaganga) and Nagarajan (Manamadurai), said that the State was the most preferred destination because of various factors including good maintenance of law and order. Through the numerous conferences and the GIM (Global Investors Meet) held in Chennai, the government had attracted investments to the tune of Rs. 7.5 lakh crore from 304 industries. A total of five lakh people had benefited directly and another five lakh got job opportunities indirectly, he said. After seeing the way, the Health department had handled the COVID-19 cases in the State, many other States followed it and it was appreciated by the Union government, Mr Palaniswami said. The CM said that the opposition was welcome to question the initiatives or the policies of the government and “I am ready to answer..”. “But, criticising me on a personal note is unhealthy”, Mr Palaniswami said. He further said that many districts had witnessed green cover, because of the government's kudimaramathu projects. Likewise, Mr Palaniswami said that it was his government's initiative to give 7.5 % horizontal reservation to government school students, through which 435 students had benefited in 2020 in getting admissions to medical colleges to pursue medicine and dental courses. Virudhunagar Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam will face its worst ever defeat in the Assembly election so much so that it will be not able to contest any more elections in the future, said the Chief Minister while touring Virudhunagar district. Pointing to the massive turnout at the election campaign at Rajapalayam, the Chief Minister said that Mr. Stalin should look at the massive support for AIADMK. Tamil Nadu has seen development in various fields under the AIADMK regime, especially under the leadership of M. G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa. Pointing to Mr. Stalin’s statement that special courts would be set up to try corrupt Ministers, Mr. Palaniswami said that he was not unaware that the State Government has already formed special court to try cases against MLAs and MPs. “Thirteen former DMK Ministers were facing corruption charges,” he pointed out. Criminal activities will be unleashed in the State, if DMK is voted to power. He pointed out that the AIADMK has brought the 100-year-demand of a Government medical college to the district. Besides, it has brought drinking water schemes to various parts of the district. He sought votes for AIADMK candidates, Vaigaiselvan (Aruppukottai), Lakshmi Ganesan (Sivakasi), E.M. Manraj (Srivilliputtur), K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji (Rajapalayam) and S.Rajasekar (All India Moovendar Munnani Kazhagam) and Bharathiya Janata Party candidate, G.

As they started demonstrating against the Chief Minister with black flags even before he was about to arrive at the spot, the police removed 53 persons. “The AIADMK government, by giving 10.50% reservation to Vanniyars, has betrayed us (denotified communities) with 93 sub-sects. Hence, we’ll register our protest wherever he (Chief Minister) goes for electioneering. We’ll continue our agitation in Tirunelveli also on Saturday (March 27) when he is scheduled to come for election campaign,” said Chockalingam, one of the protestors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bid-to-show-black-flag-to-cm-police-detain-53-persons/article34175134.ece
27 March 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Campaign to enhance voter participation launched||The district administration on Friday launched the “Viralmai, Nam Valimai” (ink on the index finger is our strength) campaign for total voter participation at the Superintendent of Police complex here. District Collector and District Election Officer V. Jayachandra Bhanu Reddy launched the campaign with the help of over 750 volunteers from the Integrated Child Development Services. The volunteers made a human formation of the palm with the outstretched inked index finger to drive home the message of vote as both a “democratic right and a duty”. The campaign was set with the goal of spreading the message of “100% vote is the goal”. According to the district administration, the district is set to go to polls on April 6 for its six Assembly constituencies of Krishnagiri, Hosur, Thally, Vepanapalli, Uthangarai and Bargur, and the awareness campaign is part of the Election Commission’s SVEEP (Systematic Voters and Electoral Participation) initiative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/campaign-to-enhance-voter-participation-launched/article34174795.ece
27 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK is just a puppet of BJP government, says Brinda Karat||The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government is a mere ‘thalai aati bommai’ (puppet) of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre, charged Communist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat here on Friday. Canvassing votes for candidates of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led alliance contesting in Madurai city, Ms. Karat said farmers had been protesting near New Delhi for the past four months, braving extreme weather conditions, demanding repeal of three agricultural laws. “The representatives of DMK, CPI(M) and some partners of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) supported the farmers. But no member of the AIADMK government opposed these agricultural laws that are against the interests of farmers,” she said. Ms. Karat said that no other government across the globe used the COVID-19 pandemic to pass such policies and laws that affects the farmers. She condemned the BJP government’s decision to privatise public sector banks and insurance companies. “The public sector units are the spine of Indian economy. While the BJP government is trying to break this spine, the AIADMK is supporting this act," she added. Tamil Nadu has a history of struggle to preserve the heritage of Tamil civilisation, social justice, and to protect the federalism of the State, said Ms. Karat. “I have been informed that the Union Home Ministry had issued a circular to West Bengal government which said that 55% of official communication must be in Hindi language. Such a circular would have reached Tamil Nadu government too. But why is the AIADMK government not opposing it?” she questioned The election results of Tamil Nadu would reverberate beyond the State’s borders. She urged the public to vote for DMK-led alliance in the upcoming Assembly elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-is-just-a-puppet-of-bjp-government-says-brinda-karat/article34174963.ece
27 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Get President’s nod for HC proceedings in Tamil’||Lawyers Association of Madurai District Court (LAMDC) has filed a public interest litigation petition before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday seeking direction to the Centre to place a proposal letter of the State government before the President to obtain consent for usage of Tamil in the proceedings of the High Court. LAMDC secretary advocate S. Ilango said the consent should be obtained for the use of Tamil, the official language of the State, in court proceedings as stipulated under Article 348 (2) of the Constitution. He said that Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar had obtained the consent to use the official State language in court proceedings. In a proper democratic system, it must ensure the fullest participation of the vast majority of people in all affairs of the State, including judiciary. If the proceedings in the highest court of the State were conducted in a foreign / colonial language which could not be understood by the litigants, it was impossible to ensure fullest participation and transparency, he said. He said that the State government had made a proposal for the use of Tamil in court proceedings in Tamil Nadu. The proposal letter should be placed by the Centre before the President for obtaining consent, the petitioner said in his PIL petition. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi sought the response from the Centre and the State in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/get-presidents-nod-for-hc-proceedings-in-tamil/article34174964.ece

The Samayanallur police have picked up the couple from Oormechikulam for enquiry and the boy has been sent to a special home. District Child Welfare Committee member B. Pandiaraja said the district childline received an alert about the continuous physical torture of the boy by the stepfather, a mason, who had married the boy’s mother two years back, after her husband died. “There are wounds and scars all over his body. The boy would be in danger under the couple’s custody and hence we have taken him to a home,” Mr. Pandiaraja said .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mother-stepfather-accused-of-torturing-boy/article34174965.ece
27 March 2021||MAYILADUTHURAI,TAMIL NADU||Tough fight between Congress, PMK||The poll fever has just begun to rise in Mayiladuthurai constituency which has been allotted to allies by both the principal rivals AIADMK and DMK. The main contest this time is between S. Rajakumar of the Congress and Sithamalli Palanisamy of PMK. Other candidates in the fray constitute R.K. Anbarasan of AMMK, Ravichandran of MNM and Kasiraman of NTK. Last time, when there was a direct fight between the AIADMK and DMK, the AIADMK candidate V. Rathakrishnan defeated his opponent K. Anbazhagan by a margin of 4,544 votes. Mr. Rajakumar had won from here in 2006 but lost to the AIADMK-backed DMDK candidate R. Arulselvan, by a narrow margin of 3,017 votes in 2011. The PMK, which was a part of the DMK-Congress alliance in 2011 had chosen to contest alone in 2016, and ended up in the third position; its candidate A. Ayyappan could muster only 13,115 votes. The victory margin was only by a few thousands of votes in both the previous elections, and hence, the mainstream candidates are campaigning rather hard to reach out to the electorate. Now that the euphoria generated among the residents after formation of the new district with Mayiladuthurai as the headquarters has subsided, the long-term problems plaguing the constituency have gained prominence as the poll issues. After being made the 38th district in Tamil Nadu, no major announcements were made for infrastructure upgrade. The bus stand in the town is woefully inadequate to cater to the needs of the travelling public. The sewage spills in the underground drainage system has annoyed the residents, C. Senthilvel, president of Mayiladuthurai Chamber of Commerce said. The residents fear that overflowing sewage at several points in the town could easily cause health hazards if not attended immediately. Traffic snarls are daily occurrences in the absence of bypass roads. A large section of farmers is aggrieved over what they perceive as inadequate compensation given for the crops damaged by the unprecedented scale of unseasonal rainfall. Though the government had decided to write off the agricultural loans, they are still uncertain about sustaining their livelihood. Sugarcane farmers, in particular, are peeved over the absence of steps to revive the Nadippisai Pulavar K.R. Ramasamy Cooperative Sugar Mill. Nevertheless, the AIADMK leaders believe that the campaign by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the town last week had galvanised the cadre into reaching out to the electorate in right earnest. ‘The poll promises of six free cooking gas cylinders, the plan of action for upgrade of Government Hospital with more number of beds and state-of-art equipment, and washing machines have impressed the electorate,’ says the sitting AIADMK MLA V. Rathakrishnan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tough-fight-between-congress-pmk/article34174770.ece
27 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||BJP manifesto for U.T. focuses on women, students and jobs||A slew of measures aimed at empowering women, improving educational amenities for students, making the region a spiritual hub and boosting economic activity find mention in the BJP manifesto for the April 6 Assembly election in Puducherry. The BJP is contesting in alliance with the AINRC. The manifesto, released by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday, promised to provide free and quality education to girl students from KG to PG and free scooters to college girls. The party also promised to waive off loans taken by women’s self-help groups which were affected by COVID-19, free public transport for women, and 50% reservation for women employees in government institutions and in local body elections. The party also promised interest-free loans of up to Rs. 5 lakh for women SHGs, free healthcare for women and the setting up of sanitary napkin vending machines at public places, schools, colleges, anganwadis and PDS outlets. The party said it would address the long-pending demand to set up a separate school education board, which would also conduct Class 10 and 12 final exams. Kendriya Vidyalayas/Navodaya Vidyalayas would be set up in all commune panchayats, the manifesto said. In an effort to make the Union Territory a spiritual hub, the BJP promised, among other things, to remove government control over all donations given at places of worship. Restoration of the glory of the Thirunallar temple by building a temple complex, projects at the Arikamedu archeological site and historical temples, and an annual international cultural and spiritual festival were among the other promises of the party. The party said it would remove all encroachments on temple lands and set up a special fund to renovate and repair temples. It plans to develop new tourism centres and construct a 150 ft statue of poet Subramania Bharathi. It also promised to create 2.5 lakh job opportunities, set up IT parks, textile parks, an elevated rail line to Chennai via Mamallapuram, upgrade the Puducherry airport and railway station and promised a helicopter/seaplane service between Puducherry and Karaikal regions. Ms. Sitharaman said the promises reflected the will of the people as the party had prepared the manifesto after collecting suggestions from the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-manifesto-for-ut-focuses-on-women-students-and-jobs/article34174652.ece
27 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Congress govt. was ridden with fault lines, leading to its fall’||With a reputation of being a simple man who, as Chief Minister of Puducherry, would be seen riding his favourite motorcycle or having a cup of tea at a roadside stall, N. Rangasamy is credited with several welfare measures during his first stint (2001-2006 and 2006-08). After being forced to step down in 2008, he floated the All India N.R. Congress (AINRC) and returned to power in 2011. The man, who has been given sobriquets such as Junior Kamaraj and ‘ Makkal Mudhalvar’ (People’s Chief Minister) is contesting in two seats — his stronghold Thattanchavady as well as the Yanam enclave — and is also spearheading the National Democratic Alliance, comprising the BJP, the AIADMK and the PMK. While the NDA has refused to name a chief ministerial candidate, the AINRC has unequivocally declared Mr. Rangasamy the Chief Minister “for a record fourth term” should the NDA came to power. Excerpts:  There was much delay before the AINRC formally announced its decision to join the NDA. The apparent hedging on the announcement even triggered speculation that you might go it alone. Were you hesitant at any point in aligning with the NDA? What eventually led to the decision to join the alliance for the Assembly election? We joined the NDA unhesitatingly. This is not the first time that we are facing an election together. We allied with the BJP/NDA in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and 2019, as also in Kamaraj Nagar [the 2019 byelection]. Of course, there was some bargaining from all sides during discussions on the sharing of seats but other than that, we have aligned with the NDA with pleasure. We are confident of the NDA winning in a majority of seats in the April 6 election. After the Congress-DMK government collapsed on February 22 following a series of defections, do you think the rival alliance will play the victim card to its advantage by alleging that the government was brought down by the BJP and the NDA partners? I don’t think so, after what has happened. No government can survive if it fails to keep its flock together. The Congress government was ridden with so many faultlines and was such a failure to deliver on several fronts that its fall was inevitable... it was perhaps the realisation that they were on a sinking ship that led to Ministers and MLAs resigning their posts and leaving the party. In the process, the strength of the treasury bench came down, making it untenable for the government to remain in power. We had nothing to do with it. As the Opposition, we carried out our duty to seek a trust vote. How do you respond to fears that the Centre’s control over three nominated MLAs can be weaponised for or against a government in the future? The practice of nominating MLAs is a long-standing tradition. In my time, it was a convention for the Chief Minister to recommend names and get them approved from the Ministry of Home Affairs. This, the previous government failed to do. And, in terms of the stability of a government that is not aligned politically with the Centre? We are allies with the BJP, which is ruling at the Centre... I am confident that if we come to power, we can run the government in an efficient way and serve the people of Puducherry well. You have criticised former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy for being ever-confrontational with the Lt. Governor and the Centre that eventually resulted in the hold-up of several welfare schemes and important decisions. Given that you too as Chief Minister in the 2011-16 term had spats with the then L-G Virendra Kataria, what is your view on navigating through this duality of power centres? The Chief Minister must be clear about his powers... at least he is expected to be aware of the limits and limitations of his agency, especially because Puducherry as a Union Territory is directly dependent on the Centre. If a file is held up at the Raj Nivas, what stops a Chief Minister from going the extra mile and having a discussion [with the L-G] and making a convincing case for approval for a proposal. It is entirely on Mr. Narayanasamy that differences that would normally have been negotiated [between the government and the Raj Nivas] were escalated to the level of the Supreme Court, which ruled in favour of the Lt. Governor and the Centre, whether it is upholding the DBT instead of rice distribution or the nomination of MLAs. It appears that Statehood is the only route to greater autonomy for Puducherry. You had even mooted the idea of political parties boycotting the election as pressure tactic to attain the goal. Is there a better chance of Puducherry getting statehood if the NDA wins as it will be in power here and at the Centre too? We will persist with the demand for statehood. With our ally, the BJP at the Centre, I think that the path to statehood can be less cumbersome. Finally, given the unique identity of Puducherry as a city of Franco-Tamil confluence, its liberal outlook and vibrant night life... all of which make it a favoured destination for tourists... ISs there any basis for fears among some sections that all these attributes could come under threat from fringe elements advancing a radically traditionalist view? As a regional party that is keenly aware of, and sensitive to, the aspirations of the people, we will be steadfast in our commitment to preserve the cultural identity of Puducherry. There is no place for any worry over the subjugation of Puducherry’s identity in any way.  No government can survive if it fails to keep its flock together||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-govt-was-ridden-with-fault-lines-leading-to-its-fall/article34175086.ece
27 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Nirmala hits out at non-BJP-ruled States over welfare schemes||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday slammed the practice of non-BJP-ruled States, including Puducherry, of not implementing the welfare programmes of the Centre to deny credit to the BJP-led Central government even at the cost of hurting the people. Addressing a public meeting of the BJP Mahila Morcha to seek support for BJP candidates, Ms. Sitharaman said it was unfortunate that schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana that envisaged housing for all by 2022, the Stand-Up India scheme for small businesses and the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana had not been properly implemented in non-BJP-ruled States, like West Bengal and Puducherry. She urged the voters to think about whether “they needed such narrow-minded leaders who would block Central welfare schemes from reaching the people only to deny credit to the Centre, and especially Mr. Modi”. Hailing Puducherry for its tradition of choosing national parties while simultaneously revelling in its regional identity, Ms. Sitharaman contrasted the various schemes introduced for the welfare of all sections of society by the BJP government at the Centre against the Congress, “which solely served the interests of one family”. She urged the electorate to follow its “stream of national consciousness” by voting for the BJP/NDA, which was focused on inclusive development, and spurning the Congress, which stood for the welfare of one family. Unlike the previous Congress government, which had not fulfilled even a single promise from its 2016 manifesto, the NDA would be committed to fulfilling all its poll promises, Ms. Sitharaman said.  She urged the voters to spurn the Congress, saying it stood for the welfare of one family alone||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nirmala-flays-non-bjp-ruled-states-over-welfare-schemes/article34174641.ece

27 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||AINRC-led alliance is strong, says Rangasamy||The National Democratic Alliance, led by the All India N.R. Congress, is “very strong” and will emerge victorious in the Puducherry Assembly election scheduled for April 6, AINRC president and former Chief Minister N. Rangasamy said here on Friday. Launching his campaign from the Thattanchavady constituency, he said there was no confusion over the Chief Minister’s post in the NDA. “Thattanchavady [from where he is contesting, apart from Yanam] will choose the Chief Minister of Puducherry,” Mr. Rangasamy said. The aim of the NDA and the AINRC was to give a good government that would cater to the needs of people, he said. The misrule by the Congress during its tenure had taken the Union Territory backward. The onus would be on the new government to bring about all-round development, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ainrc-led-alliance-is-strong-says-rangasamy/article34175087.ece

27 March 2021||Ramanathapuram,TAMIL NADU||A big push is all that it needs||This is the land of the late President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam who dreamed of a country developed in all spheres. But Ramanathapuram constituency, where he was born and brought up, remains how he saw in his childhood. Even after sending its representative to the legislative Assembly 15 times since independence, this vast segment still waits for things as basic as underground drainage system in big towns and potable water in every village. The AIADMK has won six times, the DMK four times, Congress three and Manithaneya Makkal Katchi and an Independent once each from this constituency. The coastal district generates a revenue of Rs. 3,000 crore per annum through exports of marine products. And though considered arid, Ramanathapuram region records a substantial agricultural output of paddy, coconut, chilly and minor millets. It is also known for its good jaggery. Of late, shedding its dry belt image, Ramanathapuram is witnessing a silent transformation. The State government, since 2016, has undertaken kudimaramathu work by desilting tanks and ooranis at a cost of Rs. 40 crore. The results are showing. There is good storage in tanks and groundwater table has risen, especially after the rains. Afforestation programme of the Forest department and rejuvenation of farm ponds,, with the help of NGOs, has resulted in expansion of area under cultivation. DMK vs. BJP The DMK has fielded its own candidate here after 25 years. In 1996, former minister Rahman Khan was the winner. Since then, the DMK had given the ticket to its alliance partners. Now, the party’s district coordinator Kadarbasha Muthuramalingam is the candidate. Mr. Muthuramalingam, though a resident of neighbouring Mudukulathur, is banking on the votes of Muslims and his Mukkulathor community. The BJP has fielded a seasoned politician Kuppuram, an advocate, who has a long innings in the RSS and had worked closely with stalwarts like L. K. Advani and Ashok Singhal. The AMMK has fielded Muniasami who is expected to split the Mukkulathor votes of the DMK and BJP. In the last election, AIADMK’s Manikandan won with a margin of over 10,000 votes, defeating Jawahirullah. Neglected This region is home to renowned places of worship that attract a huge number of devotees throughout the year. Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameswaram, temples in Uthirakosamangai and Tiruppulani and Yerwadi dargah are some of them. “Though these places draw a huge pilgrim crowd, the successive DMK and AIADMK governments have not given due importance to Ramanathapuram on the infrastructure front,” says Dhanapal, a retired teacher. Though Ramanathapuram town has underground drainage system, it is faulty and sewage water overflows on streets. Rameswaram and Keelakarai municipalities do not have UGD facility at all. The ruling AIADMK hopes to garner votes by showing the medical college and hospital and law college to the region. Its opponents hope to cash in on anti-incumbency and intra-party feud in the AIADMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-big-push-is-all-that-it-needs/article34174784.ece
27 March 2021||Rameswaram,TAMIL NADU||Sri Lanka releases 40 fishermen||Sri Lanka on Friday released 40 of the 54 Tamil Nadu fishermen who were detained by the Navy there. On Wednesday, 20 fishermen from Thangachimadam in Rameswaram, 20 from Nagapattinam and 14 fishermen from Karaikal region had ventured into the sea for fishing.  Three locations At three different locations, they were held by the Sri Lankan Navy personnel in the early hours of Thursday and detained in three islands. They were informed that after the quarantine period, they would be produced before a court and sent in for judicial custody. On Friday, the All Fishermen and Mechanised Boat Operators’ Unions met at the Rameswaram jetty under the leadership of its president R. Sagayam seeking their release. Jesu Raja, a fishermen leader, warned that if the Indian government did not intervene to get them released, the fishermen would boycott the April 6 Assembly election in Tamil Nadu. By 6.30 p.m., the 20 fishermen of Thangachimadam returned after being released by Sri Lankan authorities. The development came following intervention of India through its High Commission officials in Colombo. The fishermen, who were relieved to be back, said that they were thankful to the authorities and the Indian government for swift action. They said the 20 fishermen from Nagapattinam were also released. The 14 fishermen from Karaikal would return home in a day or two, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sri-lanka-releases-40-fishermen/article34174662.ece

District Election Officer and District Collector S.A. Raman said that 5,142 ballot units, 5,142 control units and 5,740 voter verified paper audit trails (VVPATs) were already sent to 11 constituencies and will be used in 4,280 polling stations. 207 contestants A total of 207 contestants are in the fray for the election in all the constituencies. Since more than 16 candidates are contesting in each of the six constituencies, there is a need for using second ballot units for polling. Hence, randomisation was completed and additional EVMs were sent to the constituencies in the presence of representatives from the recognised political parties. The constituencies that received the additional ballot units were: Edappadi - 484 units, Sankari 467, Salem (West) - 508, Salem (North) - 477, Salem (South) - 458 and Veerapandi - 425.

27 March 2021||Sankarankovil,TAMIL NADU||Trash ‘corrupt, anti-Tamil’ AIADMK: Vaiko||The electorate of Tamil Nadu should trash the “corrupt” AIADMK government for pushing the BJP’s anti-Tamil schemes in Tamil Nadu and for being a slave to the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre, MDMK general secretary Vaiko has appealed. Canvassing votes for DMK candidate for Sankarankovil (Reserved) Raja at Thiruvenkatam near here on Friday, Mr. Vaiko said the Edappadi K. Palaniswami-led Tamil Nadu Government, which was implementing the Narendra Modi-led Central Government’s anti-Tamil agendas in Tamil Nadu, had rendered jobless over 90 lakh youth while allowing NEET to kill the medical dreams of Tamil students. “ Even though she could score 1,175 out of 1,200 in Plus Two, Scheduled Caste student Anita could not get admission in a medical college due to NEET and this drove her to commit suicide,” he pointed out. Those who protested against the Sterlite Copper in peaceful manner were crushed and in the police firing 13 persons were killed mercilessly. Though this case would be heard in a court, the people’s court should render justice for the blood that soaked Thoothukudi in the upcoming Assembly election, he said. Even as a few hundred women were sexually assaulted by a group in Pollachi, a senior woman police officer had to recently face sexual harassment by a top police officer. “Though a series of corruption charges are surfacing everyday against the ruling AIADMK Government and the DMK has submitted a memorandum to Governor Banwarilal Purohit seeking comprehensive probe into these charges, no action has been taken as this government is an obedient slave of Mr. Narendra Modi’s Government. This government has failed to ensure the safety of its people. Hence, the electorate of Tamil Nadu, with their votes, should overthrow this government on April 6,” Mr. Vaiko appealed. Recalling his association with Thiruvenkatam over the past 57 years, Mr. Vaiko, who is from nearby Kalingapatti, informed that he had released Rs. 25 lakh from the Local Area Development Fund for the construction of a bridge at Aavudaiyaarpuram for the benefit of 15 villages, a 40-year-old demand and another Rs. 10 lakh for sinking a borewell and laying pipes for ensuring drinking water supply to Kurinjaakulam Adi Dravida Colony. Mr. Vaiko also campaigned at Sankarankovil, Kadayanallur and Surandai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trash-corrupt-anti-tamil-aiadmk-says-vaiko/article34174785.ece
27 March 2021||SIVAGANGA,TAMIL NADU||Breakthrough in Kalayarkoil double murder case||In a major breakthrough, the Sivaganga police have cracked the double murder case reported in July 2020 when two women - the mother and wife of a jawan, were murdered at their house near Kalayarkoil and gold jewels were missing. The killers had left untouched a six-month-old baby sleeping by the side of her mother. Police said five special teams examined more than 100 suspects, but could not achieve any breakthrough since there were no fingerprints at the scene of crime. The murders happened on the night of July 13, 2020. Rajakumari, 61, and her daughter-in-law Sneha, 30, were asleep at home. Stephen, 32, the jawan, was away in north India, and his father Santiago, 66, an ex-serviceman, had gone to a farm in the neighbouring village. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram raised the issue in arliament saying there was no progress in the case. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami directed the police to intensify the probe. At this juncture, the teams obtained a vital clue and based on the confession of two suspects, they cracked the case by arresting four more accomplices - Muthumurugan of Pattukottai in Thanjavur district, Chellamuthu of Theni district, Poochikannan of Thoothukudi district, Venugopal of Kalayarkoil, Rajagopalakrishnan and Mukesh Raja of Paramakudi in Ramanathapuram district. The police recovered jewellery weighing 58 sovereigns, an autorickshaw and a two-wheeler used for the crime. A police officer said that the gang members, who had a history of criminal cases, had met each other in the prison. The gang targeted women with no male company at home, besides locked houses. Venugopal is said to have spotted the house of Stephen where there were only two women at home. The culprits had confessed that they had bludgeoned the two women to death using thick sticks with nails.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/breakthrough-in-kalayarkoil-double-murder-case/article34174777.ece
27 March 2021||Sivaganga,TAMIL NADU||Two policemen killed in road accident||In a tragic incident, two policemen, including a special sub-inspector, were killed when a TNSTC bus proceeding to Thayamangalam dashed against them here on Friday. The bus driver sensing trouble is said to have escaped from the spot. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the two policemen were part of a flying squad team led by Tahsildar Ashok Kumar. As the staff were on duty from 6 a.m. at Uthikulam, on Illayankudi Road near here, they had planned to go for breakfast at around 9 a.m.. As the policemen were waiting to get inside their vehicle, the speeding bus rammed into them. Anti-Land Grab Wing SSI Karnan (51) of Tirupachethi, Armed Reserve Police constable Balasubramanian (32) of Ladanendal, Santhanakumar (32) of Avarankottai and Karl Marx (31) suffered grievious injuries. While SSI Karnan and Balasubramanian died, the police said that the other two were undergoing treatment at Sivaganga GH and Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital. Karnan is survived by his wife, son and daughter. Balasubramanian leaves behind his wife and a daughter. A special team was formed by DSP Ramakrishnan to hunt for TNSTC bus driver Kumar. Sivaganga police have registered a case. After the post-mortem, the bodies were handed over to the family members. Sivaganga Collector P. Madhusudhan Reddy, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Ramanathapuram Range) Mylvaganan and Sivaganga SP Rajarajan paid homage.

27 March 2021||SIVAKASI,TAMIL NADU||Fireworks industry suffered under BJP rule, says Moily||Fireworks industry had lost the opportunity to export Rs. 20,000 crore- worth goods in the last six years under the BJP rule at the Centre, said Congress leader M. Veerappa Moily. Addressing reporters here on Friday, Mr. Moily said that the labour-oriented industry had suffered under the Modi government and the AIADMK government in the State had failed to take up their cause. There was job loss everywhere in the country and it had not spared fireworks industry. “The industry should have been treated like a special economic zone. But, it lost Rs. 20,000 crore-worth exports,” he charged. Among the various reasons that stalled exports was the faulty Goods and Services Tax policy. While the GST implementation had led to the loss of 12 crore jobs, demonetisation had resulted in 8 crore job losses, he added.  ‘Threat to Tamil identity’ The former Union Minister said that if Jayalalithaa were alive, she would have walked out of the BJP alliance. He said that Tamil identity was threatened. Tamil was made a classical language by the Congress-led UPA government. The BJP was, on the contrary, upholding ‘Hindu, Hindi and Hindustan’ slogan to divide the people of the country. Stating that Tamil Nadu’s voice was always the first whenever there was a threat to federalism or the rights of the State, Mr. Moily said that when the State of Jammu and Kashmir was made into two Union Territories, the AIADMK government remained silent. The AIADMK had voted for the three farm laws and also in favour of the Citizenship Amendment Act. “The AIADMK’s 11 Rajya Sabha votes helped the BJP pass the bill. However, now it says that it would oppose the Act. The AIADMK is afraid of the BJP,” he said. Stating that jobless educated youth would take a revenge on the AIADMK and vote it out of power. While the Congress and the UPA had helped build public sector units, the BJP was bent upon selling them and depriving the people of jobs, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fireworks-industry-suffered-under-bjp-rule-says-moily/article34174789.ece
27 March 2021||T HANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Panchami lands will be retrieved if AIADMK is voted to power’||Panchami lands would be retrieved and handed back to whom those lands were assigned if the AIADMK-led alliance was voted to power again, said BJP president J.P. Nadda here on Friday. The BJP president gave the assurance at an election rally held at Budalur where he solicited votes in favour of party nominee to Thiruvaiyaru Assembly constituency S.Venkatesan. Mr. Nadda said that 12 lakh acres classified as Panchami lands in Tamil Nadu would be retrieved and handed over to Dalits to whom those lands were assigned under the Panchami Land Act. Under the “vocal for local” motto, the party aimed to create opportunities for local trades such as pot making, doll making and other handicrafts to build a brand image for these products at national and international levels. This could be achieved with ease by the BJP-AIADMK combine since the AIADMK was a party with regional aspirations clubbed with national vision, he observed. Hailing the AIADMK government for its deft handling of the COVID-19 pandemic situation and the ongoing vaccination exercise, Mr. Nadda claimed that by electing the BJP-AIADMK alliance, people could put an end to the “DMK’s menace of land-grabbing and corrupt practices” by keeping it out of power. It was during the rule of the Congress-DMK coalition, the UPA, that jallikattu was banned and killing of fishermen by the Sri Lankan in the sea was a regular occurrence. “It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had ensured that jallikattu was revived legally and put a full stop to Sri Lankan firings on fishermen,” he added. The BJP president also assured that temples would be relieved from the control of the government and handed over to the local representative committees, comprising saints and scholars. Union Ministers of State G. Kishan Reddy and V.K. Singh also attended the rally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panchami-lands-will-be-retrieved-if-aiadmk-is-voted-to-power/article34174768.ece
27 March 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Users of temple lands to support DMK, says association||The All Religious Institution Property Users Association has declared that it would support the DMK alliance in the forthcoming Assembly elections. In a press release, its State organiser S. Natarajan has announced that for several decades many families reside or have taken on lease land belonging to the temples, mutts, charitable trusts, Wakf Board and churches for cultivation. They have been facing severe hardships during the last few years as the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department had effected a steep hike in the rent/lease amount to be remitted by the users and was insisting that the increased amount should be remitted at once. The department had even gone to the extent of exercising the powers granted to it under Sections 78 and 79 of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act which was challenged by the association legally. At this juncture, the ruling AIADMK government passed a government order for the issuance of ‘free pattas’ to the users of temple lands in the State. However, those belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party and other Hindutva organisations had obtained an interim stay against the said G.O. at the High Court, he said. The association organised a conference in Chennai to highlight the plight of the temple land users and to seek political support for their demands. The DMK and its allies in the Democratic Progressive Front attended the conference and extended their support to the association. They had also included an assurance in their respective election manifestos that the problems faced by the TNARIP Users Association would be solved once they were elected to power. So, the association has decided to back the DMK-front in the forthcoming elections, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/assn-announces-backing-for-dmk-this-election/article34174622.ece

In his complaint, M. Neethipandian said Mr. Udhayanidhi Stalin, while canvassing votes for his party’s candidate in Vilaathikulam on Thursday, showed a brick, claiming that he had taken it from the AIIMS premises. Since he had stolen it from the government project under construction, it was a punishable offence under Section 380 of the IPC, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/udhayanidhi/article34174634.ece
27 March 2021||TIRUCH,TAMIL NADU||Kulithalai town lacks civic amenities||Situated on the banks of the Cauvery, the largely agrarian constituency of Kulithalai has a definite place in the electoral history of the State as it was from here that the former Chief Minister M.Karunanidhi began his long journey as a legislator in 1957. Although the two major Dravidian parties have held sway here in alternative elections over the past few decades, the constituency has hardly witnessed any development down the years. In the absence of any industries, agriculture sustains the rural economy here. Besides paddy, banana, sugarcane and betelvine are raised on this fertile belt. Floriculture cultivation is also taken up in some parts of the constituency. While farmers in the constituency are faced with an array of issues as elsewhere in the State, lack of employment opportunities locally has been forcing youths to migrate to other districts. A large number of semi-skilled workers from the constituency are employed in Karur, a major hub for manufacture of handloom textile made-ups. Kulithalai town, which lies between Karur and Tiruchi, sorely lacks in civic amenities. Topping the list of poll issues, as in the past few decades, has been the need for establishing a proper bus terminus in the town. “There is no proper bus stand in the town. It has been an unfulfilled demand pending for decades now. It is time a proper site was identified to establish a bus terminus,” regrets A.V.Gopala Desikan (86), a farmer-activist of the town. A proposal to establish a new terminus, drawn up some time back, is yet to see the light of the day. “A piece of land belonging to Kadambavaneswarar Temple was identified for establishing the bus stand. But the proposal ran aground due to litigation,” says R.Nandakumar, an advocate and resident of Kulithalai. The town has hardly have proper civic amenities, says Mr.Desikan. The seven irrigation channels which are passing through the town have heavily silted up and irrigation has been affected for over 560 acres. This has also resulted in stagnation of sewage making them breeding grounds of mosquitoes. The depleting groundwater table is another concern for farmers, he added. “There is hardly any industrial development in the constituency; this is another major issue. Agro-based industries, especially for banana, could be established here. But elected representatives of the constituency in the past have been largely ineffective,” observes Mr.Nandakumar. In the absence of an elected urban local body, civic problems have not been addressed. Sand mining on the sly by some youths operating on two-wheelers is going on some parts of the constituency, he says. The DMK has denied a ticket to the sitting MLA, E.Ramar, and brought back R.Manickam, who won from the constituency in 2006 though he lost in 2011. The AIADMK has retained N.R.Chandrasekar, who lost the 2016 elections to Mr.Ramar. V.Nirosha, AMMK, Seeni Prakasu, NTK, S.Manikandan, IJK, and M.Shivakumar, Puthiya Tamilagam, are among the 18 contestants in the constituency. It remains to be seen whether the constituency voters would maintain their record of choosing candidates of AIADMK and DMK alternatively in elections since 1991.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kulithalai-town-lacks-civic-amenities/article34174759.ece
27 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘Modi masthan’ acts will not work, says Stalin||Attempts to whip up religious frenzy will not succeed in Tamil Nadu, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader M.K. Stalin said on Friday. Tamil Nadu is a Dravidian land and ‘modi masthan’ (a pun on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a colloquial reference to black magicians) acts, such as inciting religious sentiments and attempts to impose Hindi and Sanskrit, would not work in the State, Mr. Stalin said. He reiterated that the DMK was not opposed to any religious faith and would uphold social harmony and protect the honour of all religions. ‘No tangible work’ The Assembly election was not just about ushering in a change of guard in Tamil Nadu, but also about protecting the self-respect and retrieving the lost rights of the State, he said, campaigning for party candidates in Srirangam and Karur. Claiming that the AIADMK government and the BJP at the Centre had not done anything tangible for the people, Mr. Stalin said the two parties were only bent on criticising the DMK. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised that the Centre would provide jobs to two crore people per year but never fulfilled it. Similarly, Mr. Modi’s promise of doubling the income of farmers too had not materialised. The AIADMK government too failed to deliver on the slew of promises it made, including free distribution of farm inputs. Mr. Stalin said the party, while in power, had implemented various schemes for the development of western region. ‘Betrayed people’ Campaigning for DMK and other ally candidates, he said the Kongu Vellalar Gounder community is dominant in the region and had been demanding reclassification as a Backward Class since 1955. “The then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi fulfilled their demand by issuing a Government Order on May 16, 1975,” he added. The opposition leader said that by accepting the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), three farm laws, eight-lane expressway project, protecting the accused in the Pollachi sexual assault case, approving pipeline projects that pass through farmlands, collecting water charges and awarding tenders only to relatives, and benami, the AIADMK government had betrayed the people in the region. Irregularities and corruption pervaded all sectors under the current regime. The BJP and the AIADMK have now joined hands seeking support for them, Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/modi-masthan-acts-wont-work/article34174648.ece
27 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Transgenders are highly disappointed||Transgenders have sought employment opportunities, housing facilities, among other requirements from political parties ahead of elections. Reservation in government jobs would help remove the stigma in society and pave way for their development, they said. Some transgenders had submitted a petition to party leaders demanding the inclusion of their needs in their election manifestos but did not receive a response, they claimed. P. Kajol, a former member of, the Tamil Nadu Transgender Welfare Board said that she had written a letter seeking a meeting with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. ‘I wanted to hand over a list of demands consolidated after consultation with other members of the community but was ignored,’ she said. Meanwhile, the needs of transgenders have not seen a mention in the manifestos of most parties. VCK has mentioned reservation in education and jobs would be made, while accommodations would be readied for transgenders in their manifesto, Kajol said. The small number of transgenders may be the reason for their ignorance, another transwoman requesting anonymity said. Rs. 1000, provided by the state government as COVID-19 relief too, was given only after there was pressure from the community, she added. According to Kajol, there were 7,000 registered transgenders in the state. In the letter to the CM, transgender women sought reservation in government jobs. .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transgenders-are-highly-disappointed/article34174771.ece
27 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Delay in construction of permanent campus for KV||The Kendriya Vidyalaya at Golden Rock, sanctioned in 2014 and functioning since 2016-17 from a temporary building provided by the Railways, continues to function with limited student strength due to delay in establishment of a permanent campus by the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan. After about 6.5 acres of land provided on long lease to the KVS was found suitable, a request was made by the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan to the Central Public Works Department in 2016. However, till date the request is said to be still in planning stage. There is enormous demand for admission in this school owing to its location in the city limits. Almost all seats under MP quota are filled in the Kendriya Vidyalaya, Golden Rock, which has 452 students - 225 boys and 227 girls - under rolls from classes I to IX, as per official records. The school has only single section for each class though the demand was that there can easily be two sections, according to parents. ‘The onus is on Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan to ensure project execution without any further delay by prevailing upon the Union Education Ministry for sanction of funds,’ Devarajan, founder, Tiruchi KV Parents Association, said. The demand for admissions in the school has been on the rise under all the five categories in the order of preference. Heavy demand  The first preference is for children of transferable and non-transferable central government employees and children of ex-servicemen, followed by children of transferable and non-transferable employees of autonomous bodies/ Public Sector undertaking/ institute of higher learning of the Government of India; children of transferable and non-transferable State government employees; children of transferable and non-transferable employees of autonomous bodies/ Public Sector undertakings/ institute of higher learning of the State governments; and children from any other category including the children of foreign nationals who are located in India due to their work or for any personal reasons. Of the 452 students in the school, 333 are in the first category, 12 in second, 31 in third, just one in fourth category, and 75 in the fifth category. There are limitations in increasing the strength in the temporary campus. “The very purpose of starting the school - to provide educational opportunities to as much deserving families as possible - will be defeated if steps are not taken for creation of the permanent campus,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delay-in-construction-of-permanent-campus-for-kv/article34174756.ece
27 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Defence employee federations question legality of corporatisation move||Federations of employee unions have questioned the move by the Department of Defence to proceed with its decision for corporatisation of Ordnance Factory Board. A few thousands of employees in the Ordnance Factory, Tiruchi, and the High Energy Projectile Factory were among the 80,000-strong workforce of 41 production units across the country to observe Save Ordnance Factories Day earlier this month, opposing the move to convert the OFB into multiple corporations. Pending conciliation settlement, continuing with corporatisation of OFBs was a violation of Industrial Disputes Act 1947, C. Srikumar, general secretary of All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF) said, citing legal experts. The three federations, AIDEF, Indian National Defence Workers’ Federation, and Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh, had deferred the indefinite strike they had planned from October 12, 2020, only after the Department of Defence Production had agreed that during the pendency of ongoing conciliation proceedings, it will abide by the provisions of Section 33(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947. The law states that during the pendency of any conciliation proceeding, no employer shall alter, to the prejudice of the workmen concerned, the conditions of service applicable to them immediately before the commencement of such proceeding; or discharge or punish, whether by dismissal or otherwise, any workmen concerned in such dispute. ‘As central government employees, the workers will never accept the status of employees in a corporation. For, it will be a clear violation of the Contract of Appointment. In the case of Ordnance Factories, the employees will have a strong case if the Government issues a notification for corporatisation pending the conciliation settlement with the federations,’ Mr. Srikumar said. The ordnance factories that had stood the test of time for 220 years were not established to mint profit, but to manufacture equipment and weapons required to defend the country, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/defence-employee-federations-question-legality-of-corporatisation-move/article34174773.ece

Seeking votes for party candidate for Tiruppur North Assembly constituency Eswaran, he said “Only governments change [every five years] but the system and governance remains the same”.

Palaniswami. Campaigning in Virudhunagar district, the Chief Minister said DMK president M.K. Stalin was making false charges against the AIADMK. “Mr. Stalin has been saying that the AIADMK will disappear after this Assembly election.”  Tamil Nadu has seen development in various fields under the AIADMK, especially under the leadership of M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa. “It was because those leaders loved the people. But DMK leader M. Karunanidhi and his son Mr. Stalin loved only their family and furthered their self interests,” he said. On Mr. Stalin’s statement that special courts would be set up to try corrupt Ministers, Mr. Palaniswami said he was not unaware that the State government had already formed special courts to try cases against MLAs and MPs. “As many as 13 former DMK Ministers were facing corruption charges,” he pointed out. Taking credit for the maintenance of law and order, Mr. Palaniswami said DMK had not been in power for the past 10 years, and even then it had not changed. Criminal activities would be unleashed in the State if the DMK is voted to power, he added. In addition to the Government Medical College, the AIADMK brought drinking water schemes to various parts of the district, he said. The AIADMK had fulfilled not only all the poll promises, but also implemented welfare schemes that were not promised during election. “We have given Rs. 4,500 welfare assistance to the poor and needy between the last two Pongal festivals,” he said. The people should put an end to the dynastic politics of the DMK, he reiterated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-will-face-its-worst-ever-defeat-says-cm/article34174644.ece

27 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||With rise in cases, many private schools suspend physical classes||Students were slowly getting back into the groove of attending classes on campus when Bengaluru witnessed a second wave of COVID-19 cases. In the wake of a steep rise in positive cases over the last week, especially in Bengaluru, many private schools have decided to suspend classes on campus, and continue only with online sessions. School managements also decided to take this decision after attendance on campus started to drop with worried parents choosing to keep their children at home as a precaution. According to Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, Delhi Public Group of Schools, when campuses welcomed back students from classes VIII to XII, attendance was as high as 60%. However, it has now dropped to around 30%. “As parents are also not keen to send their children to school, we plan to revert to online classes,” he said. A parent, Praveen S., said he had stopped his son from attending classes on campus as he was worried about the health of his elderly mother who lives with them. “Children will recover quickly. But if they catch the infection, they are likely to pass it on to the elderly who may not recover from COVID-19,” he said. Schools in Karnataka closed in March 2020, and only started reopening their doors in phases to students from classes VI to XII from January 1, 2021. Nooraine Fazal, founder-director of Inventure Academy, said they stopped conducting offline classes last week. “Only science laboratory sessions are being conducted on campus. The school had started physical classes for students in standards IX and XII, which have now been suspended,” she said. Exam schedules D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said schools had been directed to conduct examinations for classes VI to IX and XI by April 15. “But now, because of the second wave, we are asking them to wrap up examinations by the first week of April,” he said. He added that conducting examinations during summer was not a feasible option, particularly for students in north Karnataka because of summer heat levels. Parents too are relieved as they do not want their children to venture out of their homes with the rise in the COVID-19 cases. Anushree S., whose son studies in class IX, said, “The school when it restarted physical classes had given our children the option of continuing with online classes. But my son was pestering me to send him to school as his classmates were attending classes. I will be glad if the school management itself suspends physical classes,” she said. However, none of the government and aided schools in the State has decided to suspend classes yet.Currently, physical classes for students from standards VI to second year pre-university are being conducted on campus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/with-rise-in-cases-many-private-schools-suspend-physical-classes/article34174574.ece

27 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||In Belagavi, BJP embraces dynastic politics||By nominating Mangala Suresh Angadi, wife of Union Minister the late Suresh Angadi, for Belagavi Lok Sabha bypoll, the BJP appears to be embracing dynastic politics, which it has traditionally scoffed at. In fact, in December, Nalin Kumar Kateel, BJP State president, lost his cool while reprimanding party workers who had put up “Suresh Angadi Fans’ Association” banners and lobbied for someone from the family to be named for the bypoll. The BJP leaders had always maintained that the party was against dynastic politics and nepotism. Party workers point out that factors like the Congress fielding Satish Jarkiholi, a seasoned politician, and the reduced role of Ramesh Jarkiholi in the wake of allegations against him, played a major role in BJP’s choice of Ms. Angadi. Paucity of strong leaders from the region and the and the strategy to pitch a Lingayat candidate against the AHINDA strategies of the Congress were other reasons, they say. “Around 80 persons wanted to contest the bypoll and the district committee collected 46 biodatas to be sent to the State committee. Around 10 were shortlisted. However, all the strong candidates were from Chikkodi parliamentary constituency and not Belagavi,” said a BJP leader. Serious contenders Mahantesh Kavatagimath, MLC, and Ramesh Katti, former MP, were from Chikkodi constituency. Tough fight The BJP leaders believe that Congress candidate Mr. Satish would put up a tough fight. They also suspect that Mr. Ramesh and Balachandra Jarkiholi, his brothers, who are busy in damage control mode, would not be in the forefront of campaigning. However, dynastic politics is not new to Belagavi district. Ms. Angadi joins a long list of dynastic politicians from the district. Among the five Jarkiholi brothers, two are in the BJP and two in the Congress. Bhimshi Jarkiholi, the youngest, has contested as a BJP candidate in the past, though he has kept out of party politics lately. Their children are entering politics from different platforms. Amarnath Jarkiholi, Mr. Ramesh’s son, is a KMF director. Mr. Satish’s daughter Priyanka and son Rahul are joining his campaign rallies and addressing various meetings in Gokak and Yamakanmaradi. Annasaheb Jolle, Lok Sabha member from Chikkodi, is the husband of Shashikala Jolle, Minister for Women and Child Welfare. Vishwanath Katti, father of Umesh and Ramesh Katti, was a veteran Janata Parivar leader, cooperative sector leader and former Minister. Former Minister A.B. Patil’s father Basangouda Patil was a Minister in the ‘70s. Mahantesh Koujalagi, Bailhongal MLA, is a third-generation legislator. His father Shivanand Koujalagi was a Minister in J.H. Patel Cabinet. His father H.V. Koujalagi was a MP in 1963. Anand Mamani, Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, is a MLA from Saundatti. His father Chandrashekar Mamani served in the same position in the ‘90s. B. Shankaranand, the trusted follower of Indira Gandhi, served as Central Minister in the ‘80s. His son Omprakash Kanagali was a Minister in the Veerappa Moily Cabinet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/in-belagavi-bjp-embraces-dynastic-politics/article34174585.ece
27 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No need to apply for payment of gratuity: HC||The High Court of Karnatala has held that the payment of gratuity would not depend upon the employee filing an application before the employer demanding gratuity but it will have to be paid immediately on cessation of the employment. The gratuity will have to be paid immediately by the employer on cessation of employment in terms of Section 4 of the Payment Gratuity Act, 1972, irrespective of the demand by the employee, the Court said. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while rejecting the contention put forward on behalf of two companies – Varma Industrial Pvt Ltd., Bengaluru, and IBC Knowledge Park Pvt Ltd., Bengaluru – that an employee is required to make application for payment of gratuity. While Varma Industrial had paid gratuity to P.N. Janakiraman Shetty, who had retired in 2002, only after he made an application in 2015. The competent authority established under the Act had issued a direction to the company in 2017 to pay the interest for delay of 13 years for paying gratuity. The authority had also directed IBC Knowledge Park, in which Mr. Shetty worked for a few years, also to pay gratuity along with interest. Both the companies had questioned imposition of interest on the gratuity amount while contending that they were not at fault while blaming the employee for the delay in making application. “The argument that gratuity becomes payable to an employee only on application being made to the employer becomes a figment of imagination” in view of the clear mandate in the Act to pay gratuity within 30 days of the employee’s cessation of service and interpretation Act by the apex court and various other High Courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-need-to-apply-for-payment-of-gratuity-hc/article34174594.ece

Under the KLLAD scheme, each of the 225 MLAs and 75 MLCs get Rs. 2 crore annually to take up local development, which amounts to about Rs. 600 crore in total. “The issue of non-utilisation due to legislators’ disinterest was brought to the notice of the Planning Minister during a review meeting,” department sources said, adding that legislators harp on funds, but do not utilise it. Old works It has been proposed that as many as 15,815 works that are more than two years old be closed. These works had been taken up at an estimated cost of Rs. 615 crore of which about Rs. 260 crore had been spent. According to the internal document circulated for the review meeting, the move is expected to save the government Rs. 359.62 crore. “Several works have been going on for years and it was felt that it is better to stop them,” an official said. The data shows that of the total 12,579 works taken up at an estimated cost of Rs. 502.51 crore from the MLA funds, Rs. 209 crore had been spent. Similarly, as many as 3,236 works have been taken up at an estimated cost of Rs. 113 crore from the MLC funds of which about Rs. 51 crore had been spent. In all, about 50,000 works have been approved since 2014 at an estimated cost of around Rs. 2,000 crore. Meanwhile, about Rs. 403 crore that had been provided for construction of anganwadi, hospitals and schools among others in 2017 remains unspent over the years. The decision was taken to not start these works, an official said. Minister K.C. Narayan Gowda is learnt to have threatened to withdraw the funds for works that have not been started yet, despite being approved over two years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/only-32-of-mla-funds-utilised-this-financial-year/article34174592.ece

27 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kidnapped youth rescued in less than seven hours||In less than seven hours after he was kidnapped, the East Division police rescued a 22-year-old student and arrested seven people. The gang had allegedly kidnapped the son of the owner of a Bengaluru nursing college and demanded Rs. 2 crore for his safe release. The youth, Rabeez Arafath, was abducted from a shop near his house in HBR Layout where he went to have juice on Thursday afternoon.When eye-witnesses saw the accused manhandling the victim and forcing him into a car, they tried to intervene. “But the kidnappers said they wanted to question him as he had molested a girl. They attacked a passer-by when he attempted to rescue Arafath,” said a police officer. Two hours later, the victim’s father, Arifulla, received a call from the kidnappers demanding Rs. 2 crore if he wanted to see his son alive. They allegedly threatened to physically harm his son if he alerted the authorities. In panic, Arifulla approached the police for help, who formed a special team led by S.D. Sharanappa, DCP (East). The police obtained CCTV camera footage and analysed call record details before tracking the accused down to an abandoned shed at Banaswadi. To avoid raising suspicion, the police team disguised themselves as labourers and used tractors to surround the area. They rescued Arafath and arrested all the seven kidnappers — Abdul Fahad, Zabiulla, Korewel Salman, Thufeeq, Goutham, Kiran, and Thouheed Pasha. “All of them had taken huge loans that they were unable to pay.

A Division Bench comprising Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order while disposing of a petition filed by Mr. Sharath. It was pointed out in the petition that CAT had heard the arguments on his plea challenging the transfer and so far had not delivered the order despite reserving the verdict on December 22, 2020. Citing Rule 105 of the Central Administrative Tribunal Rules of Practice, 1993, it was contended that CAT should have delivered the verdict within three weeks from December 22 as the rules prescribe that “when the orders are reserved, the date for pronouncement not later than three weeks shall be fixed. And the date so fixed shall not be changed except due notice to all parties/counsel”. “The tribunal is requested to decide the matter as expeditiously as possible within a time framework as provided under Rule 105 of the CAT Rules, 1993. As in the present case the time period provided under the rules is already over, the tribunal shall decide the matter positively within two weeks from the date of receipt of the certified copy of this order,” the High Court said in its March 22 order. Mr. Sharath had moved CAT questioning the Government Order of September 28, 2020, transferring him from the post of DC, Mysuru, and posting IAS officer Rohini Sindhuri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decide-on-ias-officers-plea-in-two-weeks/article34174589.ece

27 March 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||A bid to stop jumbo march||The Forest Department has put up railway barricades for about 4.5 km in Alur range of Hassan district to avoid the movement of elephants. The 2.1 m tall barricades, made of used railway tracks, have been installed between Nagavara Elephant Camp and Bharatur in Alur taluk. This is the area wherein elephants from Kattepura forest in Kodagu district move towards Alur range crossing the backwater of Hemavati Reservoir located at Gorur. People of Hassan have been dealing with the elephant menace for decades. As many as 70 lost their lives in the conflict in the district since 1991. Similarly, 63 elephants have died so far. Besides solar fencing and elephant-proof trenches (EPT), the department has taken up the installation of railway barricades as a solution to avoid conflicts. K.N. Basavaraj, Deputy Conservator of Forests, on Friday, took a team of journalists to Nagavara Elephant Camp to show them the barricades. “We keep learning how to avoid conflicts. Now, the installation of railway barricades is considered to be the effective system to minimise the conflicts,” he said. Chandrashekhar, a contractor from Mysuru, has bagged the contract to put up barricades for 4.5 kms at a cost of Rs. 4.65 crore. He procured 750 tonnes of the used tracks from the Ministry of Railways at an open auction. “The barricades are 2.1 m above ground level. They have been erected with the support of concrete 1.5 m below the ground. Two horizontal barricades are such that neither a cub nor adult elephant could cross them. We have learnt from the past experiences where elephants died while attempting to cross the barricades,” the officer said. The purpose is to avoid the entry of elephants from Kodagu to Hassan. In 2014, the department captured 24 elephants and relocated them, resulting in a decrease in man-animal conflict for a brief period. “However, the number of elephants increased gradually, as many crossed the Hemavati backwaters. Now, we are plugging the hole so that elephants’ entry from Kodagu is restricted,” the officer said. The department plans to extend the barricade for 40 km covering the boundary points. In Kodagu, the elephants that raid coffee estates could be driven back to forest areas easily, while in Hassan it was not possible. The herds keep moving from one estate to another damaging the crop, the officer said.  Opposition from farmers Farmers of Nagavara and surrounding villages in Alur taluk have opposed the railway barricades alleging that these would force the elephants to camp in their estates for a long period. Rangaswamy, a resident of Nagavara, said, “No doubt the barricades restrict elephants coming from Kodagu. What about those elephants already in the boundaries? Now, they cannot go back to Kodagu because of the barricades and continue to remain in the estates located close to the barricades.” Mr. Basavaraj, DCF, reacting to the allegations, said the barricades had been put up just now. The officers would analyse the elephants’ movement and take appropriate action whenever necessary. “We have plans to extend the barricades for 40 km. As of now, we have a system to open the barricades at key points to let the elephants go back to their places,” he said. He further clarified, “The path that we are blocking is not considered to be the natural path of the elephants. Only in the recent years, they have begun to tread this path.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-bid-to-stop-jumbo-march/article34174596.ece
27 March 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Farmers stage protests||Pro-farmer organisations staged protests in Shivamogga and Hassan extending support to the Bharat Bandh call given by the Bharatiya Kisan Union on Friday. The union had called for a nationwide bandh to mark the completion of four months’ protest in Delhi against the anti-farm laws. The organisations did not observe bandh in these districts. The protesters burnt copies of the farm laws and raised slogans against the Central government. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader H.R. Basavarajappa, who led the protest in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Shivamogga, said the Centre had been ‘adamant’ on the issue. The farmers had been on the streets for the last four months. “We have burnt the copies of the anti-farm laws. Our protest is symbolic to suggest that if the farmers’ demands were ignored the BJP government would also collapse”, he said. The protesters also demanded the State government withdraw the cases registered against BKU leader Rakesh Tikait. K.L.Ashok of Komu Souharda Vedike and others participated in the protest. In Hassan, representatives of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Karnataka Pranta Raitha Sangha, Dalit Sangharsha Samiti, CITU and AITUC participated in a protest in front of the Hemavati statue.

27 March 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||A teacher goes the extra mile for students||A teacher of the Government Higher Primary School at Nulliggere in Hosanagar taluk of Shivamogga taluk has won the hearts of people in the taluk for her unique initiative to attract students to her school. In the last seven years, Rekha Prabhakar has deposited Rs. 1,000 each in the name of 63 students and issued them bonds which will mature when they complete class X. Ms. Prabhakar, a native of Shankaranarayana village in Kundapur taluk, got the job as teacher at Nulligere in 2010. In her initial years, the school had a strength of over 100. Gradually it decreased. She thought of offering Rs. 1,000 per student taking admission for class I. “I started this in 2014 and since then every year I have been depositing the amount in the names of those joining class I. Most of them are from a poor background. The amount will be helpful for their college studies,” said Ms. Prabhakar. With her initiative, the students’ strength also improved. “It could be co-incidental. The collective efforts of colleagues in providing quality education improved the strength. Besides that, we have been supported by local donors and members of the school development and monitoring committee,” she said. Appreciating her gesture, a donor has sponsored tables for the Nali-Kali classes. A couple of people have offered notebooks and sh  oes to the students. “When we teachers go beyond our regular work, the public also recognize it and extend their helping hand,” she said. This year so far 13 students took admission to class I. She has deposited money in their accounts at the Canara Bank branch at Nagara. After 10 years each student will get around Rs. 2,400. So far, she has spent Rs. 63,000 from her savings. “I am also from a poor family. I could study because of the support of many people. As I have received help from society, now it is time to pay back,” said Rekha. She has been supported by her husband Prabhakar Kulal, an officer with the Forest Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-teacher-goes-the-extra-mile-for-students/article34175013.ece

27 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 negative report must for passengers from outside||Considering the steady increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Dharwad district in the last one week, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil has issued an order making RT-PCR test negative report mandatory for passengers entering the district from other States. Chairing a review meeting of the district health task force and other officials in Dharwad on Friday after a video conference with the Chief Secretary, Mr. Patil said that as a large number of passengers were entering the district from neighbouring States by both government and private buses, carrying a COVID-19 negative (RT-PCR test) report has been made compulsory. Mr. Patil said that if any passenger without a negative report entered the district, he would be medically examined at the destination and made to undergo a COVID-19 test. “If private bus operators continue to dodge the administration and ferry passengers without negative report, their vehicles will be seized,” he said. Referring to the alleged violation of COVID-19 guidelines at coaching centres, paying guest facilities and libraries, he said that the administration would give an ultimatum to all paying guest facilities, coaching centres and 24 x 7 libraries to follow safety protocol failing which such centres will be locked permanently. “We will also book criminal cases against the owners of such centres,” he said. Despite extensive awareness drive by the administration and also by the media, people have been negligent towards following the safety protocol. “If there is no change in the behaviour of the general public, steps will be taken for the strict enforcement of the guidelines and penal action will be taken against those violating the protocol,” he said. Mentioning that various teams had been formed comprising officials and personnel from the departments of health, police and municipal corporation to keep strict vigil round the clock, Mr. Patil urged the teams to be vigilant failing which action would be taken against team members. Clarifying that there would be no holiday for the health staff for the next two months, he said that they should continuously sensitise people on getting the vaccine to fight the pandemic. Mr. Patil directed the health staff to go to mango stalls along the bypass road and getting tests done for traders, agents and mango growers. He said that in the wake of the mango season, traders and agents from other States would be visiting Dharwad for purchases and they should be tested on regular basis to prevent any spread of the infection. Chief Executive Officer of Zilla Panchayat Susheela B. said that village level teams led by panchayat development officers had been constituted to sensitise people on the inoculation programme. Additional Deputy Commissioner Shivanand Krale, Assistant Commissioner Gopalkrishna B., KIMS Director Ramalingappa Antaratani and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-negative-report-must-for-passengers-from-outside/article34174812.ece
27 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Lukewarm response to bandh call||The call for Bharat Bandh by farmers organisations seeking repeal of the three new farm laws received lukewarm response from the people of various districts in North Karnataka with support being restricted to only demonstrations at important junctions. In both Hubballi and Dharwad and also other places in the region, members of various farmers organisations took out protest marches and in some places,, the police outnumbered the protestors. The farmers were joined by leaders of Opposition parties, including the Congress, the Janata Dal(S) and Left parties in some districts. In Hubballi, only a handful of protestors gathered at Hosur Circle early in the morning in a futile bid to stop bus services. After staging a dharna on the road, they moved to Kittur Chennamma Circle to hold a similar protest. After a while there, the protestors, led by Janata Dal(S) leader Siddu Teji, were forcefully evicted from the landmark junction following an altercation with the police. Mr. Teji said that the police were acting like agents of the BJP and were not allowing a peaceful protest to go on. A little later, members of various organisations, including the former MLA N.H. Konaraddi, Congress leaders Babajan Mudhol, Rajashekhar Menasinakai, Mohan Hiremani, Deepa Gouri, members of Left parties, including B.A. Mudhol, and others, staged a protest. The protest was restricted to going around Kittur Chennamma Circle raising slogans against the Union government and seeking repeal of the farm laws. Another group of protestors also staged a similar protest on Hubballi-Dharwad Bypass Road near Gabbur for a while. Meanwhile, life went on as usual with vehicles, public transport buses, autorickshaws and private vehicles operating on the roads without any hassles. Shops and commercial establishments functioned as they do on any normal day. It was only because of the precautionary measures taken by the police, including barricading the roads leading to Kittur Chennamma Circle, that motorists had to take circuitous routes to reach their destinations. In almost all the districts of North Karnataka, similar scenes were witnessed with protestors staging demonstrations in support of the bandh call, while life remained unaffected. In Dharwad too, demonstrations were held by members of the Raita Hitarakshana Parivar and other organisations. Meanwhile, the indefinite dharna by Raita Hitarakshana Parivar crossed 50 days and every day, farmers from different places are participating in the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lukewarm-response-to-bandh-call/article34174816.ece
27 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Farmers stage protest against land acquisition in 14 villages||Farmers from 14 villages of Dharwad district took out a protest in Dharwad on Friday opposing the State government’s decision to acquire their farmland under Suvarna Karnataka Corridor project. Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) has been entrusted with the task of acquiring land under the project and land has been identified in these 14 villages, the protestors said. The protest was carried out under the aegis of Bhoomi Ulisi Horata Samiti and Raita Krishi Karmikara Sanghatane (RKS). Holding red flags and placards condemning the government’s move to acquire land from the farmers, the protestors marched to the Deputy Commissioner’s office covering the thoroughfares of the city. Addressing the protest meeting in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office, advisor for the samiti and district secretary of SUCI (C) Ramanjanappa Aldalli said that following the government plan to acquire land, KIADB had begun the process and already, several farmers had received notice regarding their land being identified for acquisition. Mr. Ramanjanappa took exception to the move and said that the government, which had taken away the little savings that they had through lockdown and post-lockdown restrictions, now wanted to snatch away their small land holdings too. He said that it was clear that the government had not taken into consideration the plight of farmers and their future before identifying their land for the project. The government had least regard for farmers and food security, he added. Mr. Ramanjanappa gave a call to farmers to not part with their land and put up a united fight against the government move if they had to save their farmland. State treasurer of RKS V. Nagammal strongly objected to the acquisition process and said that the farmland was the only source of income for farmers, especially for those with small holdings. “And, it is a highly insensitive move by the government to take away their lone source of livelihood, that too when they are yet to recover from the hardships caused by COVID-19 situation,” she said. District president of RKS Lakshman Jadagannavar termed the land acquisition plan as highly unscientific and undemocratic and if the government failed to respond to the farmer’s plea and continued with the process, then they would be forced to intensify the agitation. Leader of the samiti Vittal Peergar and others spoke Memorandum Receiving a memorandum, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil told the protesting farmers that he was not aware of any such land acquisition process. He assured them that he would get details from the KIADB officials and then hold a meeting with them. Meanwhile, an official from the KIADB informed the Deputy Commissioner that they had issued notice as per the direction of the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-stage-protest-against-land-acquisition-in-14-villages/article34174814.ece

According to Superintendent of Police B.M. Laxmi Prasad, the three were among the members of D gang operating in Kasaragod, Paivalike and Miyapadavu of Kerala. Earlier, they opened fire at the police in Miyapadavu of Kerala when the latter tried to catch the group after a case of firing at a bar there on Thursday night. A tip-off by the Kerala Police alerted the Dakshina Kannada Police at the three check-posts on the borders with Kerala through which group could enter the district. At about 4 a.m., the group was seen approaching the check-post in Kodange by car. The group opened fire at the policemen just as it came near the check-post.

27 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Support comes for Pejawar Mutt seer’s stand on marriage||Backing a recent statement of Udupi Pejawar Mutt seer Vishwaprasanna Tirtha, that Brahmin women should marry only within the community, the Paryaya seer of Udupi Sri Krishna Mutt who is also the swamiji of Admar Mutt, Ishapriya Tirtha, said on Friday that it [advice] would only help uphold a system and values practised by the elders. Addressing presspersons in Udupi, the Admar Mutt seer said that children should not hurt their parents in their old age. It is in this context that the Pejavar seer had said that Brahmin women should keep away from inter-caste marriage. Going against the wish of parents is not right. “Following the ethos set out by the elders will make good for society,” he said. The Admar Mutt seer said that some youths ignore their families during their marriage by taking their own decision. This affects family life. Parents have the right to stop their children, if [they are] found going on the wrong path in life. “At times, a decision taken in a hurry ends in disaster. The younger generation should be careful while taking decisions,” he said, supporting the statement of Pejawar seer who is also one of the trustees of Sri Ramjanmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. The Admar Mutt seer said that the Pejavar seer’s statement has been blown out of proportion and out of context. He [the Pejawar seer] has great concern for society. The Pejawar seer’s recent statement is being discussed widely on social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/support-comes-for-pejawar-mutt-seers-stand-on-marriage/article34174976.ece

27 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Biker’s death: ‘Truth will come out’||Commissioner of Police Chandragupta on Friday said the police would come up with its account of the recent incident where a motorcyclist was killed on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Hinkal flyover junction only after the inquiry into the episode was done. An officer of the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police was probing the case looking into various contradicting interpretations and explanations, including the complaint of deceased biker Devaraj’s family and the version of his friend Suresh who claimed to be riding pillion, and came to a conclusion on what actually happened on that day. The biker’s death triggered protests with the public accusing the traffic police checking vehicles for the accident in which a tipper-truck hit Devaraj’s bike killing him instantly. A strong mob later attacked policemen and also damaged their patrol vehicle. So far, 13 people have been arrested in this connection. The incident also sparked protests from locals and criticism in social media against the police for the alleged harassment of motorists in the name of vehicle checking and slapping of fines. The police came under flak over the episode from A.H. Vishwanath, MLC, who lashed out against the Commissioner of Police for issuing “appreciation letters” to the policemen following the biker’s death. At a meet-the-press programme organised by Mysuru District Journalists’ Association (MDJA) here, the Commissioner faced a volley of questions from reporters on the incident while clarifying that the traffic policemen had no role to play since they were checking vehicles 250 metres away from the accident site. He also refuted claims that the biker fell off after a policeman threw a lathi or a stick to stop him from evading checking. “The inquiry is based on the complaints and also what eyewitnesses saw. All versions are being looked into. The truth will come out. The police would be in a position to narrate its account only after the probe,” he told reporters. Defending “appreciation letters” he gave to the policemen after the incident, Mr. Chandragupta said, despite the mob attacking on-duty traffic policemen, other policemen rushed to the spot and shifted the victim and injured to hospital. The letter was intended to boost their morale, appreciating their commitment to duty knowing the risks. “Imagine what will happen if policemen refuse help fearing mob attacks and do not shift injured in such cases to hospitals,” he asked On Mr. Vishwanath’s criticism, he said, “He (the MLC) could have called me and clarified on this. I would have explained to him why I gave letters of appreciation.” Replying to questions on the swift action by the police in the case with immediate arrests, he refuted the allegations of retribution and said the police acted as per the law. MDJA President S.T. Ravikumar, General Secretary Subramanya, Secretary Rangaswamy and Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Sandesh Kumar were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bikers-death-truth-will-come-out/article34175002.ece
27 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Majority of car parking slots occupied by shopkeepers on Devaraj Urs Road||A study conducted by the Mysuru City Police had found that a majority of the four-wheeler parking slots on D. Devaraj Urs Road in the city have been occupied by shopkeepers. When asked by the reporters at a press conference in the city on Friday about the undue delay by the authorities in introducing Pay and Park system on the road, Commissioner of Police Chandragupta said the police carried out a study to find out who was occupying the 230 car parking slots. “We conducted a survey to find out whose vehicles were being parked everyday – whether it was the shopkeepers or the public….A majority of them are shopowners”, Mr Chandragupta said. He said the police tried to free up the road for traffic and create parking space for the customers visiting the shops. When the shopkeepers are not interested in freeing up the parking space on the road and attract customers, it becomes a deadlock, he said while laying the blame for the parking woes at the doorstep of the shopkeepers. The City police had a series of meetings with the representatives of shopkeepers to resolve the issue. The shopkeepers are now demanding parking space elsewhere for their vehicles, Mr Chandragupta said. The Mysuru City police referred the demand to the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC). The MCC has now identified a few places for the purpose and hoped that the shopkeepers will park their vehicles there. Hoteliers’ demand Mr. Chandragupta also referred to the demand put forward by the Mysuru City Hotel Owners’ Association to permit parking on certain roads, where the same is not allowed due to lack of space. The hotel owners contend that the they need to promote their business, which had been seriously hit due to COVID-19, by offering parking space in front of their establishments. Without parking space, they claim that their business will suffer badly. Mr .Chandrugupta said it was a “Catch-22 situation” for the police. “If we allow parking, it will lead to a road block. If not, they complain their business has been hit”, the City Police Commissioner rued before arguing that the police can permit parking only if there is space. “We have to put the vehicles somewhere…”, he said before making an appeal to the public to begin using cycles more and more. “If people come walking or start using bicycles, we will have space”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/majority-of-car-parking-slots-occupied-by-shopkeepers-on-devaraj-urs-road/article34175004.ece

More than 60 cameras had been installed at various junctions to catch the offences round-the-clock, and the police have proposed to strengthen invisible policing by adding more number of cameras. The police were finding it difficult to collect penalties with vehicle owners changing their homes and addresses not matching with the records available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fines-unpaid-since-2013/article34175005.ece
27 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Traffic policing to be ‘friendly’, ‘transparent’||With questions raised over Mysuru traffic police’s ‘eagerness’ to penalise motorists during vehicle checking, especially after the recent death of a motorcyclist on the Ring Road, the police have now proposed some changes to make policing ‘friendly’ and transparent’. They are all set to avoid drives during peak hours to sidestep any inconvenience to the public. Hereafter, there won’t be vehicle checking in areas having high-traffic density. An order in this regard from the office of Commissioner of Police was expected in a day or two. Commissioner of Police Chandragupta told reporters in Mysuru on Friday that vehicle checking would be conducted between 10.30 a.m. and noon and 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday. Weekends would be confined to collecting unpaid fines for traffic violations caught on camera. The respective traffic police stations would announce schedule of checking in their limits and it would be confined to one particular violation; it could be helmetless driving or insurance checking and so on. However, in all accident zones, the checking would be carried out as usual. The Commissioner said only policemen with a single star of the rank of assistant sub-inspector and above were eligible to check vehicles and collect fines. Action will be taken if ineligible policemen did so and they would be shifted out of traffic enforcement. Mr. Chandragupta said he has told the officers not to carry out vehicle checking unless they were wearing body-worn cameras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/traffic-policing-to-be-friendly-transparent/article34175006.ece

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Belagavi LS byelection: AICC finalises Satish Jarkiholi’s name||The Congress has finalised the candidature of former Minister and incumbent MLA Satish Jarkiholi for the byelection to the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency, which will be held on April 17. In a press release on Friday, AICC said that Congress president Sonia Gandhi has approved the name of Mr. Satish as the party’s candidate. With this, Mr. Satish is all set to take on Mangala Suresh Angadi, wife of former Union Minister the late Suresh Angadi, who is making an electoral debut as BJP candidate. Known to be a soft-spoken person, Mr. Satish, 58, currently represents the Yamakanmardi reserve constituency (ST) in Belagavi district, which falls under Chikkodi parliamentary constituency in the Legislative Assembly. A few days ago, he visited Delhi and held consultations with the Congress high command. He served as Minister in the previous coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy and the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government prior to it. Mr. Satishi’s brothers Ramesh Jarkiholi and Balachandra Jarkiholi are BJP MLAs. Mr. Ramesh is currently in the news for his alleged involvement in the sex CD scandal, where he is accused of sexually exploiting a woman after promising her a job. While the Special Investigation Team has been investigating the “conspiracy” angle based on Mr. Ramesh’s complaint, the woman on Friday filed a complaint accusing him of exploitation. Poll pitch This issue is expected to be pitched in the poll campaign in the constituency to embarrass the BJP, though it is being watched with curiosity how it will be framed given that the accused is the brother of the candidate. The Congress had demanded a Karnataka High Court Chief Justice-monitored probe into the CD scandal but the BJP government rejected it outright. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Suresh Angadi defeated V.S. Sadhunavar of the Congress with a margin of 3.91 lakh votes in the constituency spread over eight Assembly constituencies. Out of eight constituencies, the Congress has MLAs representing two constituencies, while the rest are held by the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-ls-byelection-aicc-finalises-satish-jarkiholis-name/article34174591.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||DKS’ name gives a new twist to row||However, The Hindu could not independently verify the veracity of this audio clip.  In the conversation that purportedly took place on the night the sex CD was leaked to television channels, the woman is heard telling a man on the other end (said to be her brother) that “DK [Mr. Shivakumar] himself” is meeting her and she had “now come near the house of D. K. Shivakumar” and was going to speak to him. She is further heard reassuring the family that she was safe and repeatedly claimed the video and audio clips aired on television were “fake, morphed and voice modulated”. She is heard promising to send a video to prove she was innocent “after D.K. Shivakumar’s people give it to her”. Days after the alleged sex video showing intimate moments of Mr. Jarkiholi came to the public domain, he alleged that a “mahanayaka” (big leader) was behind the conspiracy to defame him. The State government formed a SIT to probe this “conspiracy” and an FIR was registered against unidentified individuals for “conspiracy to defame Jarkiholi, forgery and extort money”. The audio clip will now be part of the probe, sources said. In a series of tweets BJP, Karnataka, attacked Mr. Shivakumar and demanded that the Congress should seek his resignation as party chief. “The Congress that sought to capture power misusing a woman must apologise to the people,” it demanded. The party also taunted Congress leaders who attacked Mr. Jarkiholi and the State government in the Legislative Assembly and asked “if the conspiracy was hatched in KPCC office”. ‘More to come’ Mr. Jarkiholi, speaking to presspersons on Friday evening, said he had not listened to the purported audio clip and when quizzed as to whether the “mahanayaka” he was referring to was indeed Mr. Shivakumar, he said the KPCC president had been a dear friend who had been with him through thick and thin and he only wished him well. He further claimed he would make a “big revelation” on Saturday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dks-name-gives-a-new-twist-to-row/article34174817.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||FIR registered against Ramesh Jarkiholi||She alleged that the MLA had sexually assaulted her twice and even forced her to share private photos and talk to him. She further stated that he recorded videos of their interactions to defame her if she filed a police complaint.  A CD of their meetings and conversations emerged earlier this month, when Bengaluru-based activist Dinesh Kallahalli submitted it to the police seeking a detailed probe. Many of the clips were widely shared on social media. By then the woman had gone into hiding, fearing for her life. She alleged that she and her family were being threatened. “I am facing a threat to my life and my family, hence I request you to take necessary action,” she said in her complaint. Mr. Jagadish Kumar said his client would appear before the police, but they should provide security to her and her family. He said he would be approaching the DG&IGP to request that security be provided to the woman as well as her family members who were in Kalaburagi. So far, the woman has released three videos, though the Special Investigation Team formed when the scandal first broke, is yet to locate her. Mr. Jagadish Kumar said that as an advocate he contacted her on Facebook assuring her legal help following which she approached him with a written complaint. Incidentally, soon after the woman released the first video, the lawyer met with Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant and submitted a requisition that the police take up a suo motu case as per Nirbhaya guidelines. In the last video message she released on Friday, the woman thanked people for their support and said without it she would not have had the courage to carry on the fight. In the clip, she said she had been living in fear for the last 24 hours, but the support of others had given her the courage to file a police complaint. Mr. Jarkiholi has been booked under sections of the IPC that are non-cognisable in nature and warrant arrest. However, sources says it is the discretion of the investigating officer to arrest him. So far, no arrests have been made. “The police as part of the investigation will conduct a spot inspection at the apartment where the alleged crime took place,” said a senior police official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fir-registered-against-ramesh-jarkiholi/article34174582.ece

27 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||‘Deal’ charge hangs over BJP, CPI(M) here||The battle for Chengannur has been touted as the one to watch out for. As all three major political fronts - LDF, UDF and NDA - were readying for a pitched battle in Chengannur, known as the Gateway of Sabarimala, came an angry outburst. The denial of the BJP ticket to RSS ideologue R. Balashankar and his subsequent allegations of a suspected tacit deal between the BJP State leadership and CPI(M) have given a new dimension to the electoral battle there. While the LDF candidate and sitting MLA Saji Cherian of the CPI (M) is seeking continuity, the UDF has fielded veteran Congress leader M. Murali to wrest the seat, once its stronghold. The NDA has given the ticket to BJP Alappuzha district president M.V. Gopakumar. The constituency, which had witnessed direct battles between the UDF and the LDF and often sided with the former, changed its dynamics in the 2016 Assembly polls when K.K. Ramachandran Nair of the CPI (M) emerged victorious. That election saw the BJP vote share jumping exponentially to 42,682 from 6,062 votes in 2011. Two years later, the constituency stood with the LDF in the Assembly byelection necessitated following the death of Ramachandran Nair. The BJP remained a force, finishing third, with its candidate garnering 35,270 votes.   Considered an ‘A’ class constituency by the BJP, the party was expecting to make it an intense triangular contest this time. However, the suspicions raised by Mr. Balashankar are sure to create some impact on the poll prospects of the saffron party. “Lack of a strong BJP candidate” is also expected to change the poll arithmetic in the constituency where the road to victory lies in the consolidation of religious and caste votes. It is home to a large number of Nair, Ezhava and Christian voters. The Nairs and Christians with almost identical vote share form more than 50% of the total voters. The Ezhavas and Scheduled Castes come to around 35%. Like in the bypoll, the LDF is hoping for the consolidation of Christian, Ezhava and Muslim votes in its favour along with a portion of the Nair votes.  Church issue But the LDF may find it hard to repeat the performance of the byelection given its poor relationship with the Orthodox faction of the Malankara Church which makes the majority of the Christian voters in the constituency. With the NSS too at odds with the LDF and BJP not fielding a strong candidate, the UDF expects to influence the Nair community along with the Christian votes. Although a section of the Orthodox faction seemed to be cosying up to the BJP, especially to Mr. Balashankar after his intervention prevented the demolition of a centuries-old church at Cheppad, now which way they will vote is to be seen. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the UDF had upper hand in the segment. The LDF won the majority of the grama panchayats and the BJP emerged top in two local bodies in the polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/deal-charge-hangs-over-bjp-cpim-here/article34174866.ece

27 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Electioneering peaks in the traditional Cong. stronghold||The winding paths leading to the sleepy Parambussery are bordered by lush vegetation. A senior citizen who seemed to have just come out of his slumber was eager enough to show the way towards the inaugural point of the UDF election campaign on Friday. The 8-km drive from Athani junction in Nedumbassery came to a halt around 8.30 a.m., as enthusiastic Congress workers helped in spotting a parking space. The face of a 13-year-old standing close to the announcement vehicle brightened up when campaign managers offered T-shirts with the portrait of the UDF candidate printed on them. As crackers burst, Congress candidate and sitting MLA Anwar Sadath took charge of the microphone. “I had the opportunity to take the lead in constructing nearly 40 homes under the Ammakilikoodu housing project for the needy. The Aluva constituency has witnessed development worth Rs. 600 crore since 2016. Development and care will be our motto,” he says. Expecting a hat-trick win, Mr. Sadath climbed the steps of his open campaign vehicle before seeking the blessings of an aged woman. It is 10.15 a.m., and anxious LDF workers at Chengal in Kanjoor panchayat are busy calling up their comrades accompanying the candidate while reminding them not to stretch the schedule. “The campaign team should have been here by 9.30 a.m.,” one of them says. A local LDF leader turns eloquent as he rides on the pre-poll surveys and achievements of the Left government. A few minutes later, Shelna Nishad, the Independent candidate of the LDF, arrives in an open vehicle. “Please do not forget that football is my symbol. Your vote will help me in shaping up a new Aluva,” she says. At Keezhmadu, the campaign vehicles of the BJP candidate are neatly parked. After over three hours of meeting voters, party candidate M.N. Gopi and his team are having a short break. “Party workers are upbeat, and we hope to improve our vote share,” says Mr. Gopi. The pilot vehicle is on its way to the next campaign point as the announcer unleashes his anger against the Left government. “They [government] came with a promise of making everything right. At the end of the day, nothing has changed,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/electioneering-peaks-in-the-traditional-cong-stronghold/article34174904.ece
27 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||HC moved against poll postponment||S. Sarma, MLA, and Secretary of the Kerala Legislative Assembly S.V. Unnikrishnan Nair have filed separate writ petitions challenging the decision of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to keep in abeyance the election for three Rajya Sabha seats in the State. The Kerala High Court has posted the case for Monday, while seeking the view of the commission. Mr. Sarma submitted that the decision to keep the election in abeyance was incorrect and opposed to the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and Constitution of India. The decision was unsustainable as the election process was announced, the Returning Officer appointed and the election programme finalised and published, he submitted. The Left Democratic Front legislator pointed out that his right to elect the Rajya Sabha members would be denied due to the decision of the commission. The new members of the Assembly would assume office during the first week of May and the existing members, who were elected in 2016, would demit their offices. It is during the tenure of the existing members of the Assembly that the term of the three members has expired. The election for the vacancies from Kerala is the right of the existing members and any delay in conducting the election will take away their right, he submitted. Mr. Nair submitted that the decision to keep the election in abeyance following a reference from the Union Ministry of Law and Justice amounted to external interference of the Union Executive on the ECI. The decision, on a reference from the Ministry, amounted to the subservience of the commission to the Union Executive in violation of its independence, which is guaranteed by the Constitution. The commission has not disclosed the reference it received from the Ministry. It is impermissible for the commission to delay the discharge of its constitutional mandate to conduct the election on time, he submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mla-moves-hc-against-postponment-of-rs-poll/article34174884.ece

Among them, 561 used the bicycles at least once. The most preferred option is the monthly rental scheme, which 56.7% of people have opted for. Another 32.5% have chosen the weekly rental mode and 10.8% the daily rental option. The users include cycling enthusiasts, says an official release. Docking stations have been installed on either side of most metro stations and at major locations in the city, depending on technical feasibility. Trends show that the stations at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium and Kadavanthra, Vyttila, Edappally, Amenity Centre, CUSAT, Panampilly Nagar walkway, and the Town Hall metro station are high in demand. A total of 800 rides have been recorded from metro stations and 230 from other locations. The usage pattern of cycle rides indicates that the people are using the cycles not only for first- and last-mile connectivity but also for leisure and exercise. A mobile application is used to unlock and ride the cycles. MYBYK, the operator, coordinates the redistribution of bicycles as per demand, which is monitored through an app. At present, around 300 cycles are in use, and an additional 100 cycles will be deployed by month-end. Earth Hour A women’s cyclothon from the Vyttila metro station at 6 a.m., a live drawing competition from 7.30 p.m., and a public gathering at 6 p.m. on the open-air stage developed by KMRL at Jos Junction will be the highlights of Earth Hour that KMRL is observing on Saturday in association with JCI Cochin.

27 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Planning a poll boycott||The Chellanam-Kochi Janakeeya Vedi, a group that has been protesting against the absence of any concrete measures to protect the eroding coastline, decided at a convention on Friday that they would boycott the Assembly election. The people’s convention was organised at Thoppumpady, raising the question of who the people should vote for and why they must vote. The refusal to vote is a mark of protest against political parties that make promises on addressing the issue of sea ingress every election season, but fail to implement any work, betraying the electorate in the process, according to the protest group. The manifesto of different political fronts prioritise projects to deal with sea ingress, but such assurances are forgotten soon after the election, the group said. P.A. Pouran of the People’s Union for Civil Liberties inaugurated the convention. Vested interests are attempting to monetise the coastline, ignoring the well-being of the people living in the area, he said. Pengal Otrumai leader Gomathi also spoke at the convention, pointing out that if the past few years had, in fact, seen any development, people would not have to resort to protest. “People continue to fight for basic rights. Power has been held by the two major political fronts, but with no significant changes for people,” she observed. The rehabilitation project announced for people living along the coastline is an attempt to clear residents from the area and monetise it, said V.T. Sebastian, convenor of the Samyuktha Samara Samiti, a larger protest group comprising the Janakeeya Vedi and a few merchants’ and fish workers’ groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chellanam-residents-to-boycott-assembly-polls/article34174894.ece

The police had in 2015 seized fake certificates/mark lists of several universities from the group, said a communication from the ED on Friday.

He had sold various diploma certificates of his institute to jobseekers and students without conducting any course at his institute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ed-attaches-property/article34174885.ece
27 March 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Development is the poll plank of fronts||Rival candidates seem sticking to a common refrain during their campaign trail in Kundara as they all consider the Assembly polls crucial. J. Mercykutty Amma, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and one of the two women Ministers in the Left Democratic Front Cabinet, repeats it in front of a motley crowd flocking her. “When the world came to a standstill during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Left government handled it efficiently and made sure that the people are well taken care of. We are urging the people of Kerala to take up the historic mission and re-elect the LDF,” she says. The Fisheries Minister, who has represented the segment three times, also lists out a spate of projects implemented in her constituency. She reiterates that Kundara has seen unprecedented development in the past five years and ticks off all positive changes in the sector while addressing cashew workers. “Six thousand labourers were newly inducted into government-run factories, gratuity arrears were disbursed, and private processors were given interest-free loans to start afresh,” she says.  Livelihood issues Livelihood issues to gaps in infrastructure and the recent deep-sea fishing row that rocked the State, United Democratic Front candidate and Congress leader P.C. Vishnunath covers a wide range of issues on the campaign front. He observes that the world outside hardly has any idea of the plight of cashew workers, the majority of them women. “With six railway gates that remain shut 20 times a day, the area is suffocating,” he says. The candidate also points out that all emergency services, including the Fire and Rescue Services and hospitals are on the other side, causing inconvenience to residents. A native of Kottarakara, he is also keen on reacting to the ‘outsider’ comments of his opponents. “Instead of serious political discussions on the problems of cashew workers, fishers or the water scarcity in the constituency, they are indulging in such frivolous subjects,” he says. Vanaja Vidyadharan, Bharath Dharma Jana Sena district president and National Democratic Alliance candidate, says she has noticed an anti-incumbency wave in the segment. Voters are not in favour of the other front either, she says. “Cashew labourers, who constitutes a major chunk of the population here, are in dire straits. The LDF government did not keep its promises and they are forced to remain in pitiable working conditions. I come from Punalur where cashew factories are not common and I was shocked to see the suffering of the labourers. Do you believe in the kind of development that doesn’t improve the living standards of commoners,” she asks. The candidate says the NDA is definitely looking forward to making a solid headway in Kundara. “Voters want a change and only the NDA can provide that,” she adds. The Kundara Assembly constituency, which includes Kottankara, Kundara, Elampalloor, Nedumbana, Perayam, Perinadu, and Thrikkovilvattam grama panchayats, has stood with both the LDF and the UDF in earlier elections. Though it is considered a Left bastion after back-to-back wins since 2006, unpredictable currents in voting pattern can influence the electoral verdict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/development-is-the-poll-plank-of-fronts/article34174864.ece

27 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||As COVID threat continues, poll campaigns turn decentralised||With the continuing COVID-19 threat and the health protocol in place, the usual scenes of people crowding around candidates during electioneering are missing in many rural areas of Kozhikode. A decentralised mode of campaign giving more priority to small, local gatherings is seemingly the most convenient strategy adopted by a majority of campaign leaders. “A big road show or a crowded public meeting is not possible these days. What we do instead is to arrange a number of smaller meetings and reach out to voters with our manifesto,” said Rasheed, a Muslim Youth League (MYL) worker who was part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate’s campaign in Koduvally constituency on Friday. He said the idea was working well, as local activists were keen to arrange such venues and do the necessary groundwork. Considering the health risks, the participation of senior citizens who often assume key roles in local political activities is less in rural areas. According to campaign leaders of various political parties, senior voters are mostly invited to neighbourhood or family gatherings where the candidates meet them personally. “The toughest part is to identify our voters during outdoor campaigns. As all wear masks now, it is quite difficult to identify even familiar faces or talk to them in an effective way,” said a local campaigner of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Koduvally. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) campaigners from Thiruvambady Assembly constituency said the number of roadshows organised to support candidates was brought down in view of the pandemic threat. They said the roadshows would be taken out only to mark the culmination of the ongoing door-to-door campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/as-covid-threat-continues-poll-campaigns-turn-decentralised/article34174870.ece
27 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||K.M. Abhijith tops list of Kozhikode candidates with criminal cases||Kerala Students Union (KSU) State president K.M. Abhijith, at 26 years of age, is probably the youngest candidate among the main political parties in the State. However, he has the highest number of criminal cases – 29 – among the candidates in Kozhikode district. But, most of them pertain to protests against policies of the State government and the Centre. His main opponent in Kozhikode North, former Mayor Thottathil Raveendran, faces no criminal charges. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State general secretary M.T. Ramesh, who is giving a triangular fight in the segment, has three cases registered against him. In Kozhikode South All the three main candidates in Kozhikode South are free from any cases. The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has fielded Noorbina Rasheed in the constituency, the Indian National League (INL), Ahamed Devarkovil and the BJP, Navya Haridas. In Beypore, all three contestants — P.A. Mohammed Riyas of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)], P.M. Niyas of the Congress and K.P. Prakash Babu of the BJP — have criminal cases registered against them. Mr. Babu faces 19 criminal charges, while Mr. Riyas has eight and Mr. Niyas three. In Elathur Rivals A.K. Saseendran of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Sulfikar Mayuri of the Nationalist Congress Kerala (NCK), in the fray from Elathur, have no cases registered against them. However, the BJP nominee, T.P. Jayachandran, has eight cases. Actor Dharmajan Bolgatty contesting on a Congress ticket in Balussery has no cases against him. But his competitors, Sachin Dev of the CPI(M) and Libin Bhaskar of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) have six and five cases respectively. In Vadakara, United Democratic Front-backed Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) candidate K.K. Rema has two cases registered against her. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) and NDA contenders — Manayath Chandran and M. Rajesh Kumar — have no cases against them. Congress nominee N. Subramanian running from Koyilandy has no cases against him, while Kanathil Jameela of the CPI(M) and N.P. Radhakrishnan of the BJP, have one case each. IUML legislator M.K. Muneer, who has been fielded by the party to wrest the Koduvally seat, has 13 cases registered against him. At the same time, Koduvally legislator Karat Razak, the LDF-supported Independent, faces no criminal charges. NDA candidate T. Balasoman has five cases. UDF-backed Independent nominee in Perambra, C.H. Ibrahim Kutty, has no criminal cases. Here, CPI(M) candidate T.P. Ramakrishnan has one case registered against him, while BJP contestant K.V. Sudheer has four cases. In Kunnamangalam, legislator P.T.A. Rahim has no cases, while UDF-backed Independent Dinesh Perumanna and BJP contender V.K. Sajeevan have three and eight cases respectively. IUML legislator Parakkal Abdulla, in the fray again from Kuttiyadi, has three cases. Here, CPI(M) candidate K.P. Kunhamed and BJP nominee P.P. Murali have one case each. In Nadapuram In Nadapuram, incumbent MLA of the CPI, E.K. Vijayan, faces no charges, while K. Praveenkumar of the Congress has two cases and M.P. Rajan of the BJP has one. IUML and BJP candidates in Thiruvambady, C.P.

27 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Muraleedharan’s absence hits Cong. campaign||The Congress party may have fielded K. Muraleedharan, who was called a giant killer by its leaders, to win back Nemom, the only Assembly seat held by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the State. But his absence is hugely impacting the electioneering of the Congress in his home district of Kozhikode. Poll managers of the United Democratic Front (UDF) strongly feel hat his presence would have significantly boosted the tally of the front in Kozhikode where it has just two legislators, and that too from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). Already, the Assembly polls have been proving a tough electoral challenge for the Congress party which has no legislator from the district for the past three terms. Had Mr. Muraleedharan been in Kozhikode, he would have galvanised the grassroots workers and electrified the campaign scene just as he entered the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, they say. Bipolar fight In the previous parliamentary elections, Mr. Muraleedharan, who had emerged as a consensus candidate to take on CPI(M) strongman P. Jayarajan, had set the stage for a sharply bipolar and highly charged electoral battle in Vadakara. However, like this time, when the party was looking for a prominent leader to fight the polls from Vadakara parliament seat, the leadership choose the Vattiyoorkavu legislator. Then Mr. Muraleedharan was able to rise over the factional politics of the Congress to trounce Mr. Jayarajan by a margin of 84,663 votes. RMP support Though multiple factors had worked in his favour, Mr. Muraleedharan had been able to muster political support, especially that of the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP). In the run-up to the three-tier local body polls, he was instrumental in forging an alliance with that splinter group of the CPI(M) in Vadakara region. His idea to field K.K. Rema, wife of slain RMP leader T. P. Chandrasekharan, as a common candidate with the backing of the UDF from the Vadakara assembly segment also became a reality. Both the Congress candidates — K. Praveenkumar and N. Subramanian — who had unsuccessfully contested the polls from Nadapuram and Koyilandy, are in the fray now. They believe that the presence of Mr. Muraleedharan would have increased their chances of romping home this time and would also have a ripple effect in neighbouring segments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/muraleedharans-absence-hits-cong-campaign/article34174875.ece
27 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Call for firm resolve to implement policies||Two sons of an industrialist in Kozhikode have each chosen to set up their businesses either overseas or in neighbouring States. The reason: despite the tall claims of single window clearance for new business ventures, Kerala is barely business- or investment-friendly, claim some of the businessmen in the city. “The atmosphere in Kerala is not suitable for business. Officials are not friendly and often claim ignorance of some of the projects aimed to help the business community,” A.M. Sherif, Executive Director, Business Network International, says. “There is a policy that small industries need no licence for three years. But officials will not allow any business to function in that manner,” says Zubair Kolakkadan, president of the Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “Policies alone make no change. Governments should be determined to implement them as well,” he says. Dr. Sherif says the government has taken the business community for granted. Vice president of the Malabar Chamber of Commerce M.P.M. Mubashir points out the huge setback faced by the business sector in the aftermath of COVID-19 and suggests that the next government should offer support to all kinds of businesses that suffered due to the pandemic.  This is despite the businesses going out of the way to support society, they claimed. “The business sector provides maximum employment, tax, and investment,” says Dr. Sherif said. “Businessmen were in the forefront to help people during floods and COVID,” says Mr. Kolakkadan, complaining that they need action and not mere declarations. Dr. Sherif suggests a separate Ministry for commerce to deal with business. Mr. Kolakkadan urges the next government to ensure the development of the small scale industries and start-ups for only they can revive the State economy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-firm-resolve-to-implement-policies/article34174860.ece

A meeting chaired by District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao, who also heads the District-level Disaster Management Authority, here on Friday expressed serious concern over the alleged reluctance of people to get vaccinated. The officials, who attended the meeting, claimed that the negligence was leading to a spike in the number of fresh cases and the increased test positivity rate in Kerala. Considering the chance of a second wave, the meeting called upon the police to take spot action on noticing violations. Based on the latest official instructions, the organisers of political events would be held accountable in case of noticing any health protocol violation during the election campaigns. At the meeting, a decision was also taken to focus more on reverse quarantine measures and the vaccination of all eligible persons above 45 years old.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/collector-orders-strict-enforcement-of-protocol/article34174871.ece

27 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Pinarayi driving a car without fuel: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi whipped up passions of United Democratic Front (UDF) supporters in the district by taking out a roadshow from Palakkad to Thrithala on Friday. Greeting supporters, Mr. Gandhi shook hands with them and took selfies at many places along the route. Addressing the crowds, he said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was trying to drive a car without fuel. “With no funds to fill fuel, the State’s economy has gone down. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government is trying to drive the car with an empty tank instead of trying to salvage the State’s economy,” he said. Helping the indigent Mr. Gandhi called upon the people to come forward to stall the LDF’s attempt to push the State into further debts. He said the UDF, if returned to power, would find financial resources to help the indigent get Rs. 6,000 a month, adding that the resources would be found by giving a fresh thrust to the industrial and agricultural sectors. “Youngsters will never have to roll on the ground for employment in front of the Secretariat,” he said. Youthful candidates Mr. Gandhi said that the Left Democratic Front would not be able to find a solution to the problems faced by the State. Exuding confidence that the UDF would return to power, with more than 55% of its candidates in their youthful years, Mr. Gandhi exhorted the people never to let any force divide Kerala. The Congress leader reached Palakkad by helicopter from Coimbatore. District Congress Committee president V.K. Sreekandan, UDF candidates Shafi Parambil (Palakkad), Sumesh Achuthan (Chittur) and S.K. Ananthakrishnan (Malampuzha) accompanied him in an open car during the roadshow. Receptions for the leader were arranged at several places, including Parali, Pathiripala, Ottappalam, Vaniyamkulam, Kulappulli, Vadanakurissi, Ongallur and Pattambi. At Ottappalam, UDF candidate P. Sarin joined the roadshow. Large crowds had gathered on both sides of the road even as people jostled to shake hands with Mr. Gandhi.  With the UDF in power, youngsters will never have to roll on the ground for employment in front of the Secretariat||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pinarayi-driving-a-car-without-fuel-rahul/article34174918.ece
27 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||‘State will pay dearly if LDF gets another shot at power’||Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) organising secretary E.T. Mohammed Basheer has warned the people of Kerala that they would have to suffer the worst if the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government led by Pinarayi Vijayan is given a chance to come back to power. “The country is going through a critical phase with fascist agenda being imposed on the nation. The LDF-BJP link in implementing this fascist-communal agenda has come to light. If Kerala cannot resist it now, it will have to pay a heavy price,” Mr. Basheer told The Hindu . In a candid chat, the IUML leader said that it would be a disaster for the State. “The LDF government has been trying to appease people by reaching out to them with emotional things like food kits, even while neglecting wide areas of major, fundamental issues. The entire State’s development is at stake now,” he said. High corruption Mr. Basheer said that the State had plunged into depths of corruption like never before. “None of the corruption issues raised by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala was found false. The government had to admit them all sooner or later. The government is trying to blind people by creating a false narrative in which it is Enforcement Directorate vs Kerala government,” he said. Mr. Basheer, who was former Education Minister of Kerala, said that nothing worthwhile was done to take the State ahead in higher education in the last five years. “The government has realised that the people of Kerala would be happy with the flippant, facile things they do as well as the emotional exercises they make,” he said. According to Mr. Basheer, the LDF has succeeded in spreading a lot of false things. “Look at the State’s development scene. The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) is a failure. Its accountability has been questioned. And the government continues to show an indifferent attitude,” he said. He said the facilities the State currently enjoy were the result of the previous UDF government. “We implemented many development projects. And the LDF in the last five years was busy scuttling them all.” PSC issue He criticised the LDF for its shameless handling of the Public Service Commission (PSC) and the youth. “The credibility of the PSC has been shattered. They (the government) threw all norms to the winds by giving permanence to temporary appointments. Thus, by giving jobs to unqualified people, they were harming the State in an unexplainable manner,” the IUML leader said. Mr. Basheer said that the LDF government toed the line of the Centre by working against the traditional fishing people. “They were trying to help the big shots.” He blamed the government for trying to create an eye-wash through advertisement blitzkriegs. “They failed miserably in handling crises. Through advertisements, they were trying to cover their failures,” he said. The IUML leader said that the LDF government had badly managed such disasters as Ockhi and the floods of 2018 and 2019. “Even the way the government handled COVID-19 was shoddy. In order to gain global attention, they resorted to publicity stunts unheard of in the State’s history.”  The facilities being enjoyed by the State now were the result of the previous UDF government||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-will-pay-dearly-if-ldf-gets-another-shot-at-power/article34174868.ece
27 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Young guns fight it out here||An intense three-cornered electoral battle is on in the capital’s upcountry Vattiyurkavu segment. The contest for the seat, which has seen candidates entering the fray in contrasting manner, has captured public imagination. It is a constituency that is known to be unpredictable at the hustings. The Left Democratic Front had wrested the seat from the United Democratic Front in the 2019 byelection. It has its task cut out with caste and community equations dictating the poll outcomes here. Development plank The CPI(M)-led coalition has fielded former Thiruvananthapuram Mayor and incumbent MLA V.K. Prasanth who rode on a development plank last time to upset all political calculations to snatch an improbable victory. On the other hand, the UDF and the National Democratic Alliance are betting on Youth Congress State secretary Veena S. Nair and BJP district president V.V. Rajesh respectively to cash in on the dominant Hindu Nair vote base. Selection problem Candidate selection had been riddled with much consternation for both the UDF and the NDA. While Rajya Sabha member Suresh Gopi had been widely tipped to be the BJP candidate, the party chose to field Mr. Rajesh, who tasted electoral success recently when he won from the Poojappura ward of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation in the local body elections. Identifying its nominee for the constituency turned out to become a Herculean task for the Congress, despite the seat having been its stronghold since 2011. The party’s initial plan to field Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary K.P. Anil Kumar had run into rough weather with several local party workers threatening mass resignation. The opposition towards “importing candidates” continued until the party zeroed in on Ms. Nair, a Sasthamangalam native. Contours The core areas of the constituency were parts of the erstwhile Trivandrum II constituency from 1957 to 1977 and later Trivandrum North until 2011. The region is known to have sent former Chief Minister Pattom Thanu Pillai to the State legislature in 1957 and in 1960. Following the delimitation of 2008 that saw parts of Kazhakuttam, Vattiyurkavu and Kudappanakunnu grama panchayats becoming part of the constituency, Congress leader K. Muraleedharan won twice in 2011 and 2016. The 2019 byelection that was necessitated by him vacating the seat swung the constituency towards the Left. Voting pattern The UDF vote share fell by 12.38% in 2016 and a further 5.23% in 2019. Contrastingly, the BJP’s vote share jumped from 11.98% in 2011 to 31.87% in 2016 and 37.58% during the 2019 general elections to the Lok Sabha. However, its vote share fell when former district president S. Suresh could garner only 22.16% of the votes in the byelection. While emerging victorious in 2019, Mr. Prasanth had won 44.25% of the votes and led in 23 of the 24 Corporation wards that formed the constituency. Only 12 wards During the recent local body elections, the LDF could only win 12 wards, while the NDA won nine and UDF three in the region. The Vattiyurkavu constituency has an electorate of 2,08,118 votes, including 1,08,787 women, 99,323 men and eight transgenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/young-guns-fight-it-out-here/article34174950.ece
27 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Raid at KIIFB against federal principles, says CM||Decrying the Income Tax (IT) Department ‘raid’ at the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) headquarters here a day ago, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has lashed out at the Centre for undermining federalism by unleashing its enforcement agencies for petty political gains. While accusing the BJP-led Central government of violating Constitutional decorum, Mr. Vijayan said that its continuing attempts to malign the financial institution had backfired. Unethical act “KIIFB had furnished all information that had been sought by the Income Tax Department earlier. In spite of that, the Central government resorted to a raid that violated federal principles. The unethical act is the handiwork of the Centre that sought to misuse its authority and trample upon the powers of State governments. Nonetheless, KIIFB will remain unaffected. On the other hand, the Centre and its agencies have portrayed themselves in bad light through their act,” the Chief Minister said while addressing an election convention at Neyyattinkara on Friday in support of LDF candidate K. Ansalan. At another convention held at Kumarichantha for LDF candidate in Nemom and Thiruvananthapuram V. Sivankutty and Antony Raju respectively, Mr. Vijayan stepped up his offensive against the Centre by accusing it of shielding communal forces. ‘Perpetrators protected’ Bemoaning the harassment of a group of nuns and postulants on a train in Uttar Pradesh, the Chief Minister alleged that the perpetrators were being protected from punitive action. Drawing parallels with the murder of a 16-year-old Muslim youth who was killed by a mob on a train in Haryana in 2017, the Chief Minister said such incidents were linked to a growing animosity triggered by the Sangh Parivar towards various communities. Referring to the recent exit of Congress workers from the party, Mr. Vijayan said the Congress could no longer claim to be the flag-bearers of secularism in the country. The Chief Minister later addressed another gathering at the Greenfield Stadium at Karyavattam as part of LDF candidate in Kazhakuttam Kadakampally Surendran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/i-t-raid-at-kiifb-is-against-federal-principles-says-cm/article34174961.ece
27 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Now, federalism is a poll plank||With the Assembly election campaign rapidly heading to a close, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government on Friday upped the ante in the political stand-off with the BJP-led Central administration. It ordered a sweeping judicial inquiry into the alleged jurisdictional overreach and the pronounced “political bias” of the Central agencies probing the UAE gold smuggling case. The government required the Election Commission of India’s permission to set the judicial probe in motion. The commission’s terms of reference and the agencies that would come under the ambit of its investigation were not immediately known. Nevertheless, the decision has arguably accorded the LDF a believable political prod to push the Centre’s alleged trespasses against the State’s rights to the forefront of the electoral debate. Last straw The Income Tax Department’s inspection of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) on Thursday seemed to be the last straw. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan portrayed the “unwarranted examination” as an attack on federalism and an invasion of the State’s right to raise money for infrastructure development. The LDF hoped the voters would find the line of argument persuasive. The order on judicial inquiry comes barely two weeks after the Crime Branch booked unnamed Enforcement Directorate officials on the charge of conspiring to implicate Mr. Vijayan in the smuggling case dishonestly. The Custom’s “revelation” in court that gold smuggling suspect Swapna Suresh had “stated with clarity about the smuggling of foreign currency at the instance of Chief Minister (Pinarayi Vijayan) and the Speaker (P. Sreeramakrishnan)” had caused an all-time low in Centre-State relations early March. A pre-poll showdown with the Central agencies had been in the making since the Central Bureau of Investigation booked LIFE Mission officials on the charge of violating the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act last year. Case’s provenance The CBI case had its provenance in the Customs probe in the gold smuggling case. Soon, Mr. Vijayan withdrew the general consent accorded to the CBI to operate in Kerala voluntarily. At a stroke, the LDF also found common political cause with other non-BJP-ruled States that had banned the CBI. The BJP said the bogey of the judicial probe and Crime Branch investigation would not deter the Centre from pursuing the truth.

27 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Tourism industry yet to come out of the blues||Though the tourism sector has been fully opened and Kerala Tourism has been organising promotion campaigns to increase tourist footfall, restrictions imposed in line with the COVID-19 protocol continue to be a hurdle to the industry’s revival. Insistence on COVID-19 negative certificate for tourists from outside the State and RT-PCR test 48 hours prior to their arrival or upon arrival has been cited as a major impediment to stepping up tourist inflow. Besides, 12 States are insisting on the negative certificate on the basis of the RT-PCR test from those returning from Kerala. Footing the bill The latest setback for the tourism industry after opening up in October last has come after domestic tourists started trickling in by January and February this year. “There is no business and hotels and resorts have been deserted this month. Many running hotels, resorts and travel agencies are wondering how to foot the salary bill of staff who were recalled,” says Anish Kumar P. K. of a leading city-based tour agency. For many, payment of building and property tax, vehicle insurance and repayment of loans are turning to be liabilities. Some are even mulling closing down units. Restrictions on domestic tourists arriving in the State and those returning have been painting a negative image about the State. The curbs had been imposed at a time when Kerala Tourism is participating in national tourism fairs such as SATTE Delhi, OTM Delhi and TTF Ahmedabad by spending Rs. 1.32 crore. It is also currently hosting the online campaign ‘My First Trip’ under Kerala Blog Express. Industry stakeholders are of the opinion that there is “no logic” in imposing the restrictions as COVID-19 cases have been on the decline since last October. E.M. Najeeb, chairperson of the Confederation of Kerala Tourism Industry, says stakeholders of the industry, which generated Rs. 48,000 crore during 2019-20, cannot accept the Health Department’s rationale for disallowing easy travel. Revenue loss The estimated loss is approximately Rs. 32,000 crore for 2020-21. Unless the tourism industry is allowed to function in full swing soon, they say even 50% of the revenue target for 2021-22 cannot be achieved. The stakeholders are also demanding hassle-free travel in the State for COVID-vaccinated persons, reduction in the cost of COVID tests and vaccination of all persons working in the hospitality sector on priority.

Everyone should observe Earth Hour at home and in their locality by switching off lights from 8.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. on March 27, by maintaining COVID-19 safety protocols,” Renjan Mathew Varghese, State Director (Kerala), WWF India said. Poster design contest As a run-up, WWF-India organised poetry writing and poster design competitions, which received overwhelming response. Fifteen experts from Kerala shared one-minute videos in which they ‘speak up for nature’ on 15 pressing topics relevant to the State. Cyclothon “On Saturday, Earth Hour Cyclothon will be organised by Indus Cycling Embassy and a candlelight vigil will be held from 8.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. on the Museum and zoo premises in the State capital. Three restaurants (Ambrosia, Ovenly and Khazak) are joining this venture,” the director said. Besides urging to switch off all non-essentials, Earth Hour is also asking citizens to shift to renewable energy, give up single-use plastics, and to avoid wastage of food, water and energy. ‘Speak up’ Ravi Singh, secretary general and CEO of WWF India, said ‘citizens should speak up for nature and lend their support as we strive for a greener, sustainable and a healthier planet.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/earth-hour-to-be-observed-today/article34175124.ece
27 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Congress has not missed the starting gun: Parameshwara||As the Assembly election campaign races to a close, G. Parameshwara, the AICC observer for Kerala, has denied the Congress has missed the starting gun. Speaking to The Hindu , he said bickering over candidate selection and argument with coalition partners over seat-sharing were usual in politics. Such initial hiccups would have no bearing on electioneering or poll results. Dr. Parameshwara slammed the surveys that gave an advantage to the LDF. He said the pollsters had concluded the surveys ahead of the Congress candidate selection and publication of the party's election manifesto. The random sampling had not even skimmed the surface of public opinion. The Congress had no tacit alliance with any fundamentalist outfit. The CPI(M) charge that the Congress had covertly aligned itself with the Jamaat-e-Islami in Kerala was false. Some persons might have met leaders of such outfits at an individual level. But such audiences have no relevance for the Congress as a national party. The Congress swore by national integration. It had lost leaders to acts of terrorism. Dr. Parameshwara said the Congress had not stressed on total prohibition because socio-economic priorities had shifted. Ideologically, the party was against the sale and consumption of liquor. It would strive for a liquor and substance abuse-free society. But currently, the concept was too utopian to implement as policy. Karnataka's third-biggest revenue stream was excise duty from liquor sales. ‘More women’ The Congress would ensure that more women qualified for political office. Its candidate list has factored in the generational shift and caste and community demographics. However, the chance of securing a win has trumped other determinants. He said Rahul Gandhi's presence in Kerala was a game-changer. His campaigning had swung the Lok Saba elections in 2019 in favour of the UDF in Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-has-not-missed-the-starting-gun-parameshwara/article34175120.ece

Thomas Isaac has lashed out at the Income Tax (I-T) Department for Thursday’s inspection at the headquarters of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) here and dared the I-T Department to register a case against the funding agency. Addressing a press conference here on Friday, the Minister, who is also vice chairperson of KIIFB, said the 12-hour inspection by 15 I-T officials was a “classic example of hooliganism” and an attempt to “derail the development initiatives” funded by KIIFB. The inspection was on the issue of TDS (tax deducted at source) on the payment to contractors who were entrusted with KIIFB-funded works by the special purpose vehicle (SPV). Altercation Dr. Isaac said KIIFB Chief Executive Officer K. M. Abraham and the fund manager were questioned and their statements recorded. I-T Commissioner Manjit Singh took over questioning at 9.30 p.m. and Mr. Abraham and Mr. Singh got into an altercation during the raids. The KIIFB officials briefed the I-T sleuths on the project and finance management system. “The offer to share password for the systems was rejected by them. We will give other details by March 29,” he said. Dr. Isaac said the I-T team came without doing proper homework and was acting on the basis of the “orders of masters in Delhi.” The Centre intended to defame KIIFB as it was implementing development projects in Kerala. “This is not the last (move). We are expecting the ED before the Easter holidays. We will take up the issue politically and to the people,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/isaac-dares-i-t-dept-to-register-case-against-kiifb/article34174909.ece
27 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State gears up to vaccinate 45+||With COVID-19 cases on an alarming rise in all States, and reports of widespread transmission due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the Health Department has asked everyone over 45 years to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The department has made elaborate arrangements for vaccinating all persons above 45 years in the State from April 1 with facilities created in all Central-State health institutions, designated private hospitals and public vaccination sites, a statement issued by the Health Department said. New waves likely Getting as many people vaccinated as soon as possible is an important strategy for COVID-19 containment in Kerala, the State Medical Board has recommended, especially as the sero prevalence survey conducted by the State in February has shown that a significant proportion of the people are still un-immune, after one year of COVID-19. The serosurvey report said that only 10.7% of the State’s population has been exposed to the virus so far. Hence it is highly likely that COVID-19 cases will continue to be reported, with new waves or local outbreaks likely in many parts of the State. The Health Department has pointed out that as school reopening may lead to further surge in transmission, it is imperative that all people above 45 years are vaccinated before that. The benefits All COVID-19 vaccines protect the vaccinated individual against serious disease, hospitalisation and death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination can also break disease transmission in the community. In Kerala, so far, 29,33,594 doses of vaccine have been administered. A total of 4,70,643 healthcare workers have received the first dose of vaccine, while 3,11,594 have received the second dose too. Among front-line workers, 1,07,661 persons have received the first dose while 63,063 have received both the doses. While 3,13,406 poll officials have been administered the first dose of vaccine, only 4,564 of them have received the second dose. Among senior citizens and those above 45 years with co-morbidities, 16,62,663 have received at least one shot of the vaccine. Vaccine details The Health Department said that as per the revised guidelines issued by the Union Health Ministry, the second dose of Covishield vaccine will be administered from 42 to within 56 days of receiving the first dose of the vaccine. In the case of those who have received Covaxin, the second dose may be taken after 28 days and within 42 days of the first dose.  A serosurvey conducted by the government in February says that only 10.7% of the State’s population has been exposed to the virus||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-gearing-up-to-vaccinate-45/article34174888.ece

Vijayaraghavan has said a victory for the LDF in the Assembly elections will strengthen the movement for secularism and the resistance against pro-corporate policies across the country. Speaking at 'Janavidhi 2021’, organised by the Kesari Memorial Journalists Trust here on Friday, he said more people were waiting to join the LDF. “Over the past few days, we have heard some Congress leaders claiming that a weakening of the Congress here will lead to the growth of the BJP. However, secular-minded Congress leaders such as P.C. Chacko and K.C. Rosakutty have joined the LDF. The reason for the current state of the Congress is their soft Hindutva stand and alliances with organisations such as the Jamaat-e-Islami. The LDF, on the other hand, has taken a strong stand against communalism. Now P.C. Thomas, who was part of the NDA, has joined the UDF, which is part of moves to cement the alliance with the BJP. Their leadership has not yet given a convincing explanation for this,” he said. Mr. Vijayaraghavan said the large crowds that had thronged Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's campaign programmes pointed to the LDF's continuance in power after the elections. He lashed out at veteran Congress leader A.K. Antony over his statement that the LDF's continuance in power will spell doom for the State. Mr. Vijayaraghavan said he was glad that Mr. Antony had finally broken his silence. He also accused the Income Tax Department of staying clear of tax defaulters while targeting an agency such as KIIFB, which funds developmental activities in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-win-will-strengthen-secularism-says-cpim/article34174915.ece

Addressing Janasabdam, a meet-the-press programme organised by the Thrissur Press Club on Friday, he said the development score of the State in the past five years was zero. “When each government steps down from power after five years, there will be some major development projects to its credit. For example, Nedumbassery airport, Kaloor stadium, and Goshree bridges during K. Karunakaran’s tenure. Overbridges and other development projects in Thiruvananthapuram by A.K. Antony. But the LDF can’t claim any such projects. They even couldn’t finish the projects initiated by the previous UDF government,” he said. Responding to the LDF claims about kits and other welfare measures, Mr. Chandy said it was the UDF that first introduced free kits during festival seasons and free ration for BPL families. The LDF, which stopped free ration when it came into power, had reintroduced them recently ahead of the elections, he alleged. Best Cong. team “The Congress has the best team of candidates this time with 55% youth and new faces,” he said. When asked about opinion polls that predicted continuation of the LDF rule, he said he had faith only in people’s verdict. Referring to a question about the Crime Branch report in the solar scam, Mr. Chandy said he was not much concerned about the case as he had not done anything wrong. BJP flayed The statement by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders that if they get 35 seats they could form the government was a challenge to democracy. “It is shocking that they dare to make such a statement in a State like Kerala. They are ready to try any dirty trick.”\  Responding to former MP P.C. Chacko’s allegation that the Congress was not effectively resisting the BJP surge, he asked who could resist the BJP better than the Congress. The Left parties and the V.P.

Interacting with mediapersons, Mr. Yechury said that the BJP government at the Centre had been misusing its machinery to destabilise non-BJP governments in the country. “The BJP is wielding the trishul (trident) against its political enemies. The first spear of the trident is money power, which it uses to reverse people's verdicts by buying elected representatives. We have seen it in many States. The second spear is the Central investigating agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, for making bogus cases against those who refuse to succumb to its money power. The third is the Enforcement Directorate (ED), to harass and destabilise elected governments,” he said. Condemns EC Condemning the Election Commission’s decision to postpone the polls for the Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala following recommendation from the Union Law Ministry, Mr. Yechury said the Centre had even been manipulating the EC. “In the last five years, the Centre has been hostile towards the non-BJP governments. This hostility has been particularly sharp towards Kerala, where even the disaster assessment after the floods were not done properly. But the LDF government withstood all this,” he said. Mr. Yechury said a pro-Left climate is prevailing in the State. People want to break the chain of alternative governments. Their positive assessment is due to the good governance, welfare measures and pro-people policies of the LDF. They have seen the strong stand taken by the LDF government in the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, farmers’ agitation and privatisation of public sector firms. Kerala is the first State to declare a minimum support price for vegetables. It has put forward a pro-people alternative policy, he added. On Sabarimala issue Mr. Yechury made it clear that there was no conflicting stand between the central and State leadership of the CPI(M) on the Sabarimala issue. “Sabarimala is a non-issue now. It is under consideration of a larger Supreme Court Bench. Let the court come up with its verdict.”  Responding to a comment by senior Congress leader A.K. Antony that a second term for the LDF would be disastrous for the State and for the party, Mr. Yechury said the former did not know about the functioning of the CPI(M).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-must-win-for-states-constitutional-rights-yechury/article34174907.ece

Raja has said. Addressing Janasabdam, a Meet the Press programme organised by the Thrissur Press Club on Friday, Mr. Raja said the Bharatiya Janata Party government had been acting vindictive against non-BJP governments. “The BJP government is misusing central agencies. It tries to undermine the judiciary. It is trying to destroy the federal system in the country. The result of the coming Assembly elections in five States will have far-reaching implications in national politics,” he said. He said the trend and mood of the voters were in favour of the Left Democratic Front. “People look at the LDF due its remarkable performance, especially during floods and the pandemic. It strengthened the public distribution system and made sure nobody starved during the period of pandemic.” “The primary objective of the Left is to stop the BJP surge. The BJP is known for manipulation. It uses money power. It has amassed funds through electoral bonds and corporate money.” Citing the attack on nuns in Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, he said such incidents had been happening against Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis too.  “The BJP is mum about the much hyped Gujarat-model now. The Gujarat model was exposed when the government built a wall during the then American President Donald Trump’s visit to hide the slums.” PSUs privatised “Modi government is pursuing disastrous economic policies. He first dismantled the Planning Board. Now he is privatising the public sector. Our public sector units are made up of flesh and blood of common man. Now they are being sold to crony capitalists.”  Mr. Raja said the United Democratic Front lacked vision and mission.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A political film that fails to hit the highs||Films with political themes evoke much curiosity in Kerala even in normal circumstances. Now, at the doorstep of an all-important election, the interest is bound to be even more, especially to spot similarities with the happenings in the real world. Though there were such speculations, Santosh Viswanath’s One stays clear of these so much so that it would be hard to draw parallels to real-life figures except for a couple of recent developments being included in the script. In fact, Bobby-Sanjay’s script is so much a sanitised version of a political film that there is no mention of any party name or ideology or even a visual with political flags. Due to this, it is at times hard to distinguish between the ruling and Opposition MLAs, which also happens to be the message that the film seeks to convey, of one honest, righteous, do-gooder amid a cesspool of corrupt, self-serving politicians. Even though it is a star vehicle, the protagonist takes quite some time to make his entry, with the initial half hour used to build up the anticipation. A college student (Mathew Thomas) writes a Facebook post against Chief Minister Kadakkal Chandran (Mammootty), after his security staff assaults the youth when entering a hospital where his father is admitted, while the CM is visiting. The post kicks up a political storm with the Opposition led by Jayanandan (Murali Gopy) targeting the CM. However, this is just a starting point, with the script skirting aimlessly from one issue to the next, to rest on the core theme of Chandran’s quest to cleanse politics by championing a ‘right to recall’ Bill. Far from reality Santosh Viswanath, who debuted with the spoof film Chirakodinja Kinavukal , attempts to create a contemporary political film, but the outcome is something which is far away from reality. In fact, some of the scenes betray a peripheral understanding of politics in the State. As for the politics that it stands for, it presents the kind of ideas glorified by the ‘India Against Corruption’ movement, which in hindsight had many pitfalls. It invests its trust in an all-perfect individual without any failings, with the rest seen as bad apples. The script, which manages to build the anticipation, never quite hits the highs expected of such a high-voltage mainstream film. It also fails to build on some interesting plot points, like Chandran’s periodic memory lapses. The plot often returns to the college student, and to how the CM comes to his rescue time and again. The script gave a nice touch to the relationship between Chandran and the party chief (Joju George), yet the same cannot be said of the obligatory family relationship scenes of the CM. In the end, it is Mammootty’s towering screen presence which holds the film together, even when the script falters. One is yet another political film in Malayalam with a somewhat apolitical message.

Yet, by the time Kala (Weed) ends, one is left ruing the fact that the warning in that advertisement was not taken seriously, for it delivers what it promises. At the centre of it all is Shaji (Tovino Thomas), a man who revels in his masculinity and competes in ferocity with his pet dog of an exotic breed. He survives mostly on his father’s (Lal) money. We get enough hints that Shaji has already wasted quite a lot of it in unsuccessful ventures. The events in the film happen over the course of a day, when Shaji’s father is out for a medical check-up and his wife (Divya Pillai) is away at her parents’ house. Alone at home with a few workers who have been hired to harvest the vast arecanut plantation attached to the plot, Shaji comes face to face with someone who is out to seek revenge for an event from his past. Rohith.V.S, who debuted with the quirky Adventures of Omanakuttan and went on to do Iblis , returns with a film that is unlike his past works. In Kala , he has chosen to do a dark, violent drama, where just quite a lot of blood is spilled. While that consistent habit of experimentation is laudable, this work sorely lacks in substance and seems to yearn for appreciation for its technical output, most notably the fast cuts, which are overdone in some places, and the visuals. In the initial half, the eerie background tone and visuals are used to create a sense of foreboding. Vagueness is the hallmark of the film all through. It is almost the opposite of some films that over-explain things. This vagueness can be seen in how the characters are written and in how the narrative plays out. Right from the exact reasons for the fear and mental pressure that Shaji’s wife talks about, to Shaji’s past, and the reasons for his peculiar nature are painted in broad strokes, leaving too much to our imagination.

27 March 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Alla: sting operations meant to ‘cover up scam in Amaravati’||Reiterating that Telugu Desam Party leaders were spreading false propaganda in the name of sting operations only to cover up their wrongdoings, YSRCP leaders said that all such operations are not for doing justice to Dalits, but to safeguard themselves and bluff people. Speaking to the media at the party central office here on Friday, Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy said that TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu had violated POA and POT Acts and deceived Dalits by tactfully grabbing their lands in the name of Amaravati land pooling. In regard to this, he alleged that the CID had already taken statements from all the victims and the TDP leaders were only intimidating the victims through their sting operations. He questioned why Mr. Naidu and former Minister P. Narayana got a stay without giving any clarification and said that all the facts would come out in the trial. The MLA alleged that Mr. Naidu and his men had looted over 4,000 acres of Dalit lands, including those that were distributed by British in 1920. Besides these, he said, the previous government had allocated 90 acres of embankment lands in Amaravati region, which were prohibited under Section 22A. He said the YSRCP has been fighting for justice from 2014 onwards and said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy would always stand by the dalits who lost their lands. Meanwhile, MP of Bapatla Nandigam Suresh said that the previous TDP government made Thullur as a capital after their benamis purchased lands in Thullur. He slammed Mr. Naidu for deceiving the public in the name of constructing world-class capital like Singapore and looting valuable lands from the poor. Recalling the land pooling days, the MP said that Mr. Narayana and Jayabheri owners were there and tactfully snatched the lands from Dalits by engaging brokers to pay Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sting-operations-meant-to-cover-up-scam-in-amaravati-says-mla/article34175151.ece
27 March 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Naidu brought LPS only to benefit his benamis’||Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had intentionally brought the land pooling scheme (LPS) to benefit his benamis and close associates, Adviser (Public Affairs) , Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy alleged on Friday. “The scam runs into more than Rs. 1 lakh crore, and part of it is the illegal transaction of assigned lands,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy told the media at the party central office here. “Mr. Naidu’s aides had made agreements on lands by threatening the poor that compensation would not be given,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy alleged. Pointing out that G.O. 41 had been issued by the TDP government by amending the Land Pooling Act, he alleged that the intention was to benefit those who illegally grabbed the assigned lands from poor. The G.O. also had the signature of Mr. Naidu, who was also the Chairman of CRDA, and former Municipal Administration Minister P. Narayana, the YSRCP leader said, and alleged that “Mr. Naidu is A-1 and Mr. Narayana A-2 in the case.” “The TDP government had revealed about the capital in January 2015. But even before the official announcement, the TDP leaders and their aides had acquired lands in the region. Later, amendments were made to the Land Pooling Act in February 2016 by issuing G.O. 41, betraying the poor,” he alleged. “If Mr. Naidu is not involved in the scam, he should cooperate with the CID, or be prepared to face penal action. Mr. Naidu’s interest was real estate and not capital. Had he been really keen on developing the capital city, he should have built it between Vijayawada and Guntur,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-brought-lps-only-to-benefit-his-benamis/article34175060.ece

To make the project more attractive, the officials are giving the building a ship-like look. “The tenders were finalised recently and awarded to a company. We have prepared the report and sent to committee for final evaluation. The five-member State-level committee, which includes officials from various departments, will go through the report and approve it. This will take a day or two. We will reveal the name of the company to whom tenders were awarded once the committee approves the report,” said VMRDA Commissioner P. Koteswara Rao. According to the plan, the five-floor building will have three floors of cellar parking also.  Beach view Parking facility will be provided at five floors, three floors of cellar (G-1,G-2,G-3), first floor and second floor. According to the estimate, these five floors of parking facility can accommodate 450 cars and 300 two-wheelers. Rest of the three floors including ground floor will be used for commercial purpose after an auction. Officials will be constructing ramps in those floors allotted for parking. All the floors will have a beach view.  The project is being set up at an estimated cost of Rs. 80 crore and aims at addressing the growing parking problem in the city. Being one of busiest junctions in the city, Siripuram consists of major venues like VMRDA Children's Arena, Gurajada Kalakshetram, a few banks and commercial establishments. The area generally reports parking problem during weekends. With an aim to meet the future needs, the VMRDA has come up with the project two years ago and had prepared the detailed project report (DPR) last year. The project is likely to take one-and-half-year to two years for completion, once the works begin. However the VMRDA officials are optimistic that the project might be completed by the end of 2022. This is going to be the second MLCP in Vizag after the MLCP at Jagadamba junction being set up by the GVMC, as part of smart city project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vmrda-finalises-tenders-for-car-parking-project-at-siripuram/article34175159.ece

27 March 2021||ONGOLE/NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||South coastal A.P. shuts down for bandh||The Bharat bandh called by Samyukt Kisan Morcha and trade unions in protest against the ‘anti-farmer’ and ‘anti-labour’ policies of the Centre, evoked a good response in south coastal Andhra Pradesh on Friday. Buses stayed off the road till 1 p.m. in both Prakasam and Nellore districts as the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) extended its support to the stir demanding withdrawal of the three farm laws and reversal of the privatisation of Public Sector Units (PSUs). Shops and business establishments remained closed during the bandh, which passed off peacefully. Educational institutions declared a holiday for their students. Activists forced closure of Central and State government offices as well as commercial banks. Except the BJP and its ally Jana Sena Party, all parties extended support to the bandh. In Ongole, the protesters led by All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee’s Prakasam district convener Ch. Ranga Rao held a massive rally on the arterial Trunk Road. Activists cutting across party lines took part in the rally and raised slogans in support of their demands, including statutory backing to Minimum Support Price (MSP) and scrapping of the Electricity Amendment Bill which they alleged was aimed at phasing out power subsidy to farmers. “We will continue with our struggle till the Centre abolishes the farm laws and halts privatisation of public sector units,” CPI(M) Prakasam district secretary P. Anjaneyulu said. In Nellore, activists led by Communist Party of India district secretary Ch. Prabhakar and CPI (Marxist) district secretary M. Ramesh took out a rally from the Atmakur bus stand to the Gandhi Bomma centre and enforced the bandh. They raised slogans against the Centre’s decision to privatise not just Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) but also public sector banks, insurance companies, and telecom firms. It’s business as usual Special Correspondent adds from Tirupati The Bharat bandh called to protest the farm laws and ‘anti-people measures’ of the Centre drew a lukewarm response in Tirupati on Friday. Barring the first two hours of the day, retail and commercial outlets remained open for the entire day. As the Tirupati Chamber of Commerce (TCC) had given a call to its members to express solidarity with the national bandh call by keeping their outlets closed for half a day, the impact of the bandh was evident only for a couple of hours. Frontal organisations of the CPI and CPI(M) were prominent in enforcing the bandh, but other parties were hardly sighted. Even the demonstrations and sparsely-populated rallies by the Left parties failed to make much of an impact, according to locals. The bandh call evoked a mixed response in Kadapa district. Left parties gathered at prominent city centres and took out a rally to enforce the bandh,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/south-coastal-ap-shuts-down-for-bandh/article34174543.ece

27 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Widespread support for bandh called by farmers||The 12-hour Bharat bandh call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of farmers’ unions, passed off peacefully in the State on Friday. The YSR Congress Party extended support to the bandh, while the Opposition TDP, Left parties and Congress leaders hit the road and trade and commercial establishments voluntarily downed their shutters. Traffic came to a grinding halt with the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation officials keeping the fleet of their buses confined to the depots till 1 p.m. and members of the Lorry Owners’ Association, which has been supporting the farmers’ agitation from the beginning, ensuring their trucks remained off the road. Schools and colleges remained closed and no untoward incident was reported from any part of the State. The farmers’ call for bandh received support from all quarters in the State. In Vijayawada, the Left parties, the Congress and others held a demonstration at the Pandit Nehru Bus Station and raised slogans against the “Modi-Shah” duo. They denounced the Centre's “anti-farmer and anti-worker” policies. Communist Party of India State secretary K. Ramakrishna said nine Left parties had combined to make their voice heard by the Modi Government at the Centre. Besides repeal of the three farm laws, they also demanded roll back of the CAA and condemned the attack on students in JNU. The Congress representatives said the BJP at the Centre was out to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims. VSP stir “Roll back or step down”, demanded leaders of the Left Parties, trade unionists and employees of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, who formed a common platform of Aikya Karya Charana Samiti. Demanding immediate withdrawal of the Centre’s move to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, they said there was no question of going back on their agitation till the Centre reversed its decision. The samiti had organised a massive protest earlier on March 5 also and its representatives have represented the VSP case to the Centre, besides meeting Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to seek his support for the cause. Members of the Ukku Parirakshana Samithi took out a rally, declaring their resolve to protect the steel plant under any circumstances. In Guntur, leaders of Left parties and rythu sanghams squatted in front of the bus station and raised slogans in support of the farmers protesting on Delhi borders. They said instead of strengthening the agriculture sector, it was unfortunate that the BJP-led government at the Centre was out to harrass the farmers. In Tirupati, TDP candidate for Tirupati Lok Sabha elections Panabaka Lakshmi participated in the agitation along with the party leaders and workers. She slammed the Modi government at the Centre for its decision, which she said were hurting the self-respect of the Telugu people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/widespread-support-for-bandh-called-by-farmers/article34175068.ece

27 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Upper Bhadra project in Karnataka opposed||The Union government’s nod for the Upper Bhadra project in Karnataka is worrying the farming community and YSRCP leaders in the State. The Rayalaseema region and the Tungabhadra basin will be worst-hit if the Upper Bhadra project becomes a reality, they fear. Farmer leaders are apprehensive of the prospect of the Rayalaseema region going dry if there is deficit rainfall. There will not be accountability in water utilisation if the structures for lift irrigation are allowed in the upper riparian State, they say. “The upper riparian State (Karnataka) will not release water until all its reservoirs are filled through the lift irrigation (LI) schemes,” the farmer leaders fear. “The YSRCP government should put its foot down and oppose the Upper Bhadra project. The Karnataka government is going ahead with the LI schemes and projects despite the fact that the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal award is yet to be implemented,” the leaders contend. “The project will adversely affect the Tungabhadra basin. The Union government is harming the interests of Andhra Pradesh by allowing the project in Karnataka,” alleges YSRCP farmers’ wing leader M.V.S. Nagi Reddy. ‘Centre’s double standard’ “The estimated cost of the Upper Bhadra project in 2012-13 was Rs. 12,340 crore. The cost has escalated to Rs. 21,450 crore. Now, the Ministry of Jal Shakti has given its nod for conferring national project status on the Upper Bhadra project. Why cannot the same principle be applied for the Polavaram project in Andhra Pradesh? Why is it that the cost escalation for Polavaram not being considered?” questions Mr. Nagi Reddy. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should oppose the project if Rayalaseema has to develop on a par with the Krishna delta,” says Bojja Dasaratha Rami Reddy, president of the Rayalaseema Saguneeti Sadhana Samithi. Appeal to BJP “Also, the BJP, which is promising to develop Rayalaseema, should mount pressure on the Centre to stop the project,” he says. “A high level project at a different location can be designed in place of the LI schemes (in Karnataka) for the benefit of both the States,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/upper-bhadra-project-in-karnataka-opposed/article34175054.ece
27 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP opposes ordinance route for State budget||The TDP has opposed the State government’s move of taking the ordinance route for the approval of State budget. Addressing the media on Friday, senior TDP leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said this was the second year in a row that the YSRCP was resorting to it. Calling it “escapism,” the TDP leader said it only reflected the government’s “utter disregard for the legislative bodies, the opposition parties and the people of the State.” He said the government was trying to use the impending by-election to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat on April 17 as an excuse to do away with a full-fledged Assembly session. “Last year too, the government did not convene the budget session and, instead, promulgated an ordinance for the vote-on-account for three months,” he said, and added that no other State where elections were held had resorted to this “unhealthy practice.” “Andhra Pradesh is the only State where the Chief Minister is getting the budgets passed through ordinances,” Mr. Ramakrishnudu said, and urged Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan not to approve the ordinance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-opposes-ordinance-route-for-state-budget/article34175066.ece

27 March 2021||hyderabad,TELANGANA||Mecca Masjid staff worried over outsourcing plans||As many as 30 employees of the two most important mosques in the city — the historic Mecca Masjid and Shahi Masjid in Public Gardens — are worried as the nature of their employment will be changed to outsourcing on a yearly basis from March 31. The move has prompted superintendent of the Mecca Masjid M. A. Qadeer Siddiqui to request the State government to regularise their appointments on the basis of heavy footfalls and the need to better maintain these spaces, and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi to write to the Chief Minister describing it an ‘injustice’ to the employees of the two mosques. The 30 employees include different services such as those of the khateeb, one who delivers sermons, imams, those who lead prayers, muezzins, those who give the call to prayer, the superintendent, and others such as electricians and sweepers. While 23 staff are posted at the Mecca Masjid, another seven are at the Shahi Masjid in Public Gardens. In his letter, Mr Owaisi stated that the employees working at the two mosques are getting a consolidated pay of between Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 17,000, and that the khatibs and imams, though being qualified, are being paid less than home guards. He noted that while despite several requests of employees to make them eligible for pensions and increments, among other benefits, these were not accepted, and those from other departments were ‘getting benefits’. “Taking into account the totality of the factors mentioned above, I request your good self to kindly consider the desirability of issuing instructions to the concerned department not to implement the scheme of contract and outsourcing of the employees of the Makkah Masjid and Royal Mosque till their request for regularisation and other demands are implemented,” Mr Owaisi wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mecca-masjid-staff-worried-over-outsourcing-plans/article34174839.ece
27 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No lockdown in Telangana again, says Chief Minister||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday ruled out imposition of lockdown in the State under any circumstances and asserted that the State government would not take any hasty steps in efforts to curb COVID 19. In his reply to the debate on Appropriation Bill in the Assembly, Mr. Rao said there would be no more lockdown or closure of industries. The government would take all steps to check the spread of infection. He appealed to the public not to panic on reports of lockdown while assuring them that the government would keep a watch on the situation till May. Narrating the appreciation received by government that the State was one of the best performers in checking COVID 19, Mr. Rao recalled that even the decision to close down schools and colleges was taken with pain but it was a temporary measure. About 10.85 lakh people had been vaccinated in the State so far and the rest of the programme was in Cetnre’s hands. In this context, he expressed the hope that the State would receive its share of vaccine doses as the Centre was distributing them proportionately all over the country. The direct and indirect loss of revenue to the State government was Rs. 1 lakh crore on account of COVID. Mr. Rao announced several initiatives to continue developmental programmes despite the coronavirus. One of them was completion of all irrigation and infrastructure projects. The next one year would see establishment of vegetarian and non-vegetarian markets in all the 141 municipalities of the State. The Chief Minister Dalit Empowerment Programme with a budget of Rs. 1,000 crore which was announced in the present budget will be implemented in addition to the SC sub-plan. The Junior Panchayat Secretaries who were recruited two years ago and were working on probation would get salaries equal to regular Panchayat Secretaries from next month but their probation period wuill be increased from three to four years. At the back of hike in salaries for government employees recently, Mr. Rao announced the same for road transport corporation staff also. The government will also implement the TRS promise of unemployment allowance. It could not be done earlier due to COVID. The government was studying models in other States to identify unemployed. On problems faced by Scheduled Castes to transfer assigned lands, Mr. Rao said the government would consider why not give all rights to assignees in the matter. He recalled that the SCs were not able to sell their lands and as a result the big real estate sharks knocked them off. So, some decision involving all parties will be taken and, if need be, the law would also be changed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-lockdown-in-telangana-again-says-chief-minister/article34174842.ece
27 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CAG raises doubts on water board’s sustainability||The Comptroller and Auditor General’s report for the year ending March, 2018 presented in the State Legislature on Friday raised serious doubts about the financial sustainability of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board. The report attributed the precarious financial position of the Board to the increasing burden of non-collection of dues, non-revision of tariff in the domestic category, and water cess waiver previously offered by the Board, besides lack of discretion in water supply management. The Board had continuously incurred expenditure in excess of income during the period 2013-17, due to which accumulated losses stood at nearly Rs. 967 crore as on March, 2017. The Board had to resort to loans of Rs. 300 crore in 2014, by mortgaging its buildings including headquarters to pay its power dues, which compromised the maintenance of its transmission and distribution pipelines. Waiver of water cess dues to the extent of Rs. 441.46 crore in 2016 had its adverse impact on the revenues. Water cess dues had increased from Rs. 861 crore in March, 2013 to Rs. 1210 crore in March, 2018, and to Rs. 1,351 crore by July in 2018. GHMC defaulting in payment of 15% share of Water Tax subsumed into the Property Tax to the water board, as mandated by the government, had a severe impact on the Board’s revenues. As on March, 2017, dues from GHMC to the water board accumulated to Rs. 762 crore. Dues on deposit contribution works from other agencies including GHMC added Rs. 64.55 crore more to the losses. Discontinuation of drawing of drinking water through gravity from Himayatsagar reservoir and Singur Phase-IV, and very minimal quantity drawn from Osman Sagar reservoir during the audit period, have increased the burden of power bills phenomenally. The Board had to rely on water pumped from Godavari river instead, thus incurring avoidable pumping charges of Rs. 141 crore per annum. Further, the Board’s precarious financial position caused delay in payment of electricity bills, which resulted in late payment charges of Rs. 139 crore. The report indicted water board for faulty planning of storage reservoirs, wherein the consultant agency had under-reported the existing capacities, and inflated the required capacities. Against the required storage capacity of 202 million gallons, the Board had planned for 217 million gallons. The report found fault with the management of the drinking water supply projects, wherein the Board has paid in excess for the contractor for the execution of intake channel from the foreshore of Yellampally barrage. Despite the higher invert level allowed by the Irrigation department which reduced the excavation work, no deductions were made in amount payable to the contractor. In another instance, the contractor was given undue double benefit due to addition of Value Added Tax component twice, the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cag-doubts-water-boards-sustainability/article34174847.ece
27 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Limited impact of bandh in twin cities||The Bharat Bandh call given by a clutch of trade unions and farmers’ organisations had a limited impact in Hyderabad. Public transport, including TSRTC buses, Hyderabad Metro Rail, cabs and autorickshaws continued to ply. Government offices reported normal attendance. Most infotech companies remained unaffected as they are still in work-from-home mode. A protest rally by a rainbow of organisations from Sundaraiah Park to YMCA Narayanaguda disrupted traffic flow from 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. A few hundred protesters affiliated to AITUC, CITU, SFI, KVPS, CPI, Intuc, CPM, DYFI, TNTUC, IFTU and AIKS raised slogans against the central government. “This protest is just a beginning. We will not call off this agitation till the three farm laws are scrapped by the central government,” said a union leader standing on the road divider near YMCA. The colours of flags waved by the protesters ranged from predominantly red of Left organisations to yellow, blue and green. “We are against the privatisation of public sector enterprises. This will lead to mass dismissals of staff and it is only to help a few businessmen,” said a CPI(M) activist carrying a poster of LIC with a slogan against privatisation. A few shops pulled down their shutters for a short duration when the protesters marched from Sundarayya Park towards Narayanaguda. “There are widespread protests and they have been going on for quite some time. It is time the Centre withdraws the three laws which threaten the livelihood of farmers across the country,” said Narayana of CPI as he juggled his mask speaking to reporters. Normal traffic remained unaffected except for a gridlock during morning hours near Lakdi-ka-Pul as the Telangana Assembly is in session leading to increased security and restrictions on traffic flow in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/limited-impact-of-bandh-in-twin-cities/article34174852.ece

27 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CAG raps Telangana on irrigation projects||The Comptroller and Auditor General of India has said that delays in completion of irrigation projects by Telangana government during the years 2014-19 not only adversely impacted the quality of expenditure but also deprived the State of intended profits and economic growth. Out of 26 ongoing projects, 20 projects were delayed for periods ranging from three months to eleven years and led to escalation of projected cost of Rs. 1.87 lakh crore. A sum of Rs. one lakh crore was already spent on these incomplete projects so far. The State government did not disclose the financial results of any of the irrigation projects, a report of CAG tabled in the Assembly on Friday said. Cash balance The State government maintained the mandatory minimum daily cash balance of Rs. 1.38 crore with RBI for only 197 days during 2018-19. The government depended on Special Drawing Facility (SDF) for 168 days to raise Rs. 5,606 crore, Ways and Means Advances (WMA) for 135 days for Rs. 13,616 crore and Over Draft (OD) for 32 days for Rs. 2,599 crore for maintaining the minimum balance with RBI. In monetary terms, however, the SDF and OD decreased by Rs. 1,099 crore (five per cent decrease) in 2018-19 over 2017-18. However, it still indicated increasing dependence of government on WMA. The interest payment on WMA , including SDF and OD during 2018-19 was Rs. 15.44 crore as against Rs. 13.82 crore in 2017-18 which was 12 per cent increase. The report said Telangana focussed more on development expenditure and capital expenditure during the year. The focus on education was comparatively lesser across years from 2015-16 to 2018-18. Agriculture got the top priority with 97.82 per cent increase in per capita expenditure over previous year due to Rytu Bandhu scheme. There was a considerable increase of 12.41 per cent on health and family welfare over previous year. There was a considerable dip in per capita expenditure in respect of transpor, education, sports, arts and culture. Committed expenditure The burden of committed expenditure measured as a percentage of revenue expenditure of the State which was steadily rising during the previous years declined by six per cent from 61 per cent of revenue expenditure in 2017-18.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cag-raps-telangana-on-irrigation-projects/article34174846.ece
27 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Steady rise in passenger footfall at HIAL||The Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), which just celebrated its 13th anniversary, has been witnessing a steady growth in passenger footfall.The number has touched the 11-lakh mark, with more than 10 lakh domestic travellers and nearly 90,000 international passengers using the facility at Shamshabad here. The number of flights, too, has been increasing with domestic schedules crossing 90,000 whereas the international flights are close to 1,000 a month. The rise has been observed despite full-fledged flight services not yet having started in view of another wave of the pandemic within the country and elsewhere, pointed out senior officials on Wednesday. In December, the international flights numbered 853 and passengers a little above 76,000 even as the statistics for domestic passengers and flights was more or less the same for the past three months. The airport used to handle more than 60,000 passengers and 550 flights daily before the pandemic put brakes on every activity. First greenfield airport The international airport was commissioned in a record 31 months with an initial capacity of 12 million passengers per year and 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of handling capacity per annum in 2008. It was the first greenfield airport under the public-private partnership model marking the GMR group’s maiden foray as an airport developer. Work is currently on to double the airport capacity with the construction of the second terminal and expanding the existing terminal, more cargo handling facilities and other related works to handle up to 25 million passengers per year. Future plans The plan is also to further expand the capacity to handle 34 million passengers per annum to meet the projected demand. The airport was shut during lockdown and opened only towards May-end with strict COVID-19 safety and deep sanitation protocols. Since inception, the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport has had several innovative technological innovations such as having the first integrated and centralised Airport Operations Control Center (AOCC), first to offer e-boarding facility for domestic flights offering 100% ‘stamping-free’ travel to its passengers, and first to offer ‘Express security check’ for passengers travelling with only hand-baggage.  Multi-stakeholder Hyderabad Airport is operated by a joint venture company promoted by the GMR Group (63%) in partnership with Airports Authority of India (13%), Government of Telangana (13%) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (11%).

While addressing the probationers, he welcomed the National Police Academy move to send IPS probationers to poll-bound states of West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu to understand the election process at the ground level. “Conduct of elections in the world’s largest democracy is an exercise unprecedented in scale and complexity. I am sure that this would be a wonderful learning experience for all of you and you would make the best use of this attachment with the field election machinery,” Mr. Arora said. ‘Spirit of service’ The Chief Election Commissioner also said that it is this spirit of service which should act as a veritable lighthouse for all in the discharge of one’s duties. “This so-called ‘common man’ is the most important stakeholder for all of us in public service. And this common man is the most uncommon in the way she/he has the ability to spring the most pleasant surprise or the nastiest of shocks to political entities of all hues every five years,” he said. Referring to the IPS probationers, Arora said they would soon be working in a very complex ecosystem. Policing is no longer confined to law enforcement or safeguarding life and property, the former bureaucrat said. Several challenges In a rapidly changing environment, policing faces several contemporary challenges including left wing extremism, Cybercrime and economic offences. “These require the force to be extremely agile, tactile and well equipped to respond to these new challenges,” the Chief Election Commissioner of India. Earlier, he paid tributes to Sardar Patel.

27 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SC urged to lift 50% cap on quota||The Telangana government has written to the Supreme Court to lift 50% upper limit in reservation as decided in the landmark judgment of Indira Sawhney vs Union of India in 1992. The government requested the apex court to leave it to the State legislatures to determine the quantum of reservation depending upon the particular circumstances existing in each State and how they evolved over time. Sources said the judgement of the court needed a relook by a larger bench to review the cap of 50%. This view of the Supreme Court could not be cast in iron as there were several special circumstances in different States like some of the north eastern States which had more than 50% tribal population or Other Backward Class communities in some other States. Secondly, the social circumstances also changed over time in view of different population growth rates among different communities. The Constitution did not have any provision related to upper limit on reservations. The 102nd Constitutional amendment resulting in insertion of Article 342 (A) took away the powers of the legislatures to include deserving communities from time to time in the list of OBCs and, thereby, enhance the reservation percentage beyond 50 % as fixed by the Supreme Court in Indira Sawhney judgment. Earlier, the issue of reservation figured in the Assembly on Friday when Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MLA Mohammed Moazam Khan raised it in the debate on Appropriation Bill. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao replied that fixing reservation was not in the hands of State government. He said the State government had asked the Centre to allow raising the quota beyond 50% like in the case of Tamil Nadu which enjoyed 69% quota. “There are some anomalies in the system and we have informed Centre that it is not right to cap the limit at 50%. The Supreme Court is seized of the matter”, he said. Mr. Rao assured Mr. Khan that the government will ask the Centre to leave reservation to States. It was conveyed to the Centre in the past also. Four years ago, the Telangana government had passed a Bill hiking the reservation of Muslims from 4 to 12% and Scheduled Tribes from 7 to 10% , taking the overall reservation in the State beyond 50%. The government had sent the Bill to the Centre with a request to include it in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution as was done in the case of Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sc-urged-to-lift-50-cap-on-quota/article34174821.ece
27 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Keeping airport landscape green||Every year, the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) at Shamshabad procures about 60,000 flower seedlings and nurtures them till they attain the flowering stage, saving on the cost of purchasing a ready flowering plant priced about eight times more. And, a captive composting plant converting two tons of food waste into one ton of manure per day, along with the cloud-based central irrigation system controller is responsible for maintaining the green landscape on the right from the 8.5 km entry with its array of palm trees, informed airport officials. The landscape covers more than 350 acres bordering on a hot semi-arid climate with soil type being mostly red gravel with low carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content. So, it has been a challenge to keep the greenery intact. Careful planning in selection of plant species, periodic soil sampling and nutrient management programmes has not only led to the eye-pleasing landscape, but also help garner awards in the last few years. Irrigation system The fully-automated cloud-based irrigation system using both treated and ground water consists of 120 km of pipe network, 390 km of drip network, 72 km of automation cabling, 6,600 sprinklers backed by 29 water sources and 12 sumps equipped with 46 submersible and 20 centrifugal pumps pumping in 1,800 kilo litres of water per day, they explain. Summer months The system has helped airport officials deal with the harsher summer months as well as the pandemic-induced lockdown phase last year. The greenery can be traced back to the captive nursery of ornamental plants grown way back in 2007 on an area of five acres. Diverse varieties of plant species were procured from all over the country — deciduous trees, flowering plants, foliage plants, creepers, succulents and bulbous plants. Establishment of a modern nursery with poly house covering 2,080 sq. metres with mist irrigation system and shade houses have also helped the landscape team propagate trees and shrubs plus create a tree bank for green belt development. Butterfly population, too, is thriving, thanks to the abundance of flowering plants and favourable flora, they said. The entire airport landscape of streetscapes, rotaries, central park is a four-tier design concept — grass swathes followed by green ground cover of up to 30 cm; one metre high shrubs and then the trees giving a ‘green frame’ along the approach road and ancillary buildings. The irrigation system covers 90% of the entire landscaped area across the 80 acres of landscape spread along the spine road.

27 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||State in debt trap: Bhatti||Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka has charged the government with pushing the State into a debt trap with the loans likely to touch R. 6 lakh crore by 2023-24. This was a scary financial situation that the State faced and the government seemed to be little bothered about it and did want to even discuss the seriousness of it, he said. This year alone Rs. 50,000 crore was being raised as loans, he claimed. Speaking to reporters at the Gun Park along with MLAs D. Sridhar Babu and Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy after the Assembly sessions, he said the government had made the Assembly proceedings a mockery with just six days for the budget sessions that should have ideally been held for 30 days for members to make suggestions to the government. A budget of Rs. 2.30 lakh crores was passed without any proper discussion and most of the time the ruling party members confined themselves to please the Chief Minister than contributing anything concrete for such important sessions. Mr. Bhatti also alleged that even during those six days opportunity was not given to the Congress members to raise issues of public interest and the ruling party did not even take into consideration the suggestions made by the Congress. “The way the budget was passed reflected a tyrannical rule than any respect for democracy,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-in-debt-trap-bhatti/article34175113.ece

27 March 2021||Khammam,TELANGANA||Bandh hits normal life in undivided Khammam dist.||Normal life was hit in many parts of the old undivided Khammam district on Friday as the TSRTC buses stayed off the roads and shops downed their shutters for most part of the day owing to the Bharat Bandh called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) in protest against the Centre's new farm laws. Cadres of the CPI (M), the CPI, the CPI (ML-ND), the Congress, among a host of other organisations laid siege to the bus stations and depots in Khammam, Kothagudem, Bhadrachalam and elsewhere in the former composite Khammam district at the crack of dawn. Members of various unions representing farmers, labourers, and people from various walks of life joined the protests expressing their solidarity with the ongoing farmers’ protest against the new farm laws at the Delhi borders, which entered the 120th day on Friday. They blocked the movement of the buses, following which most of the buses of the public transport entity’s total fleet of around 600 buses of the Khammam region confined to the bus depots/bus stands across both Khammam and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts. However, the TSRTC sources claimed that the inter-district and inter-State bus services resumed by afternoon. In Bhadrachalam of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, senior CPI(M) leader and former Bhadrachalam Member of Parliament Dr Midiam Babu Rao led a protest near the bus stand in the temple town. Activists of the party and its frontal organisations squatted on the main road demanding urgent repeal of the Centre’s three farm laws, withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill and plans to privatise several public sector undertakings. In Khammam, artistes of the cultural wings affiliated to the Left parties hogged the limelight during the protest at the bus station on Friday morning. They turned the deserted premises in front of the bus station into a virtual street theatre to amplify the voices of protesting farmers. Clad in their traditional stage attire, the artistes pepped up the spirit of the demonstrators by presenting a folk art demonstration. They sang songs eulogising the ongoing farmer’ protest at the Delhi’s borders, hailing it as a historic and resilient movement against “anti-farmer” and “pro-corporate” policies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bandh-hits-normal-life-in-undivided-khammam-dist/article34175118.ece
27 March 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||‘BJP’, TDP candidates file nomination||In a surprise development, Kankanala Niveditha Reddy, Bharatiya Janata Party’s candidate for Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency in an earlier election, filed nomination on Friday. However, “There was no go-ahead for her from the State leadership. A complaint has been filed against her action,” senior party leaders in the district told The Hindu . BJP district president K. Sridhar Reddy, also her husband, did not respond to phone calls. BJP, ever since the death of sitting TRS MLA Nomula Narsimhaiah in December 2020, has been contemplating allotting the seat to a member from a Backward Classes community, particularly a Yadava, whose votes make a crucial contribution to any candidate’s victory. It was also an embarrassment and talking point when Ms. Reddy and another party candidate Kadari Anjaiah Yadav, both vying for the party’s candidature, ran their individual saffron campaign vehicles. The candidates printed their separate flags and campaign material. The surprise, whether unsettling or impressive, was out in the open on Friday with Ms. Reddy filing her nomination, as ‘BJP’s candidate’. With just one day, the last day for filing of nominations on March 30 (Tuesday), and the three days before that declared holiday, Telugu Desam Party’s candidate Arun Kumar Muvva also submitted his nomination for the contest on Friday. The day witnessed 10 nominations, highest since the opening date for nominations on Tuesday, a total of 23 nominations till date. On the other nad, big guns in the Congress and TRS candidates are yet to file their nominations. Pre-declared, K. Jana Reddy will attend Congress ‘Nagarjunasagar Jana Garjana’ public meet along with party seniors at Haliya on Saturday and file the nomination on the last day. Last but not the least, the ruling TRS continues is yet to declare its candidate for the contest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-tdp-candidates-file-nomination/article34175111.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||An entertaining romantic comedy||A story of a boy and girl who grow up as neighbours and ultimately find love in each other has been told in many different ways in mainstream cinema. Director Venky Atluri presents a fresh take on it, narrating a boy-meets-girl story with a lot of humour. Some of this humour is in a sticky zone, with the risk of ending up politically incorrect or insensitive. But slowly the tables turn and some of these sticky issues get addressed, while the fun quotient stays intact. Even when things seem like they could get emotional and sappy, enough cheer pervades through Rang De . And Venky has on board a good set of actors who keep us invested in the romantic comedy drama. Arjun (Nithiin) is the apple of his parents’ (Naresh and Kausalya) eye until Anupama (Keerthy Suresh) arrives in the neighbourhood with her mother (Rohini). He’s glad to be in her company until she, being innately better than him, begins to get all the appreciation. Arjun compares this to Rajesh Khanna being upstaged from his superstar status with the arrival of Amitabh Bachchan! From childhood till college, Arjun unwittingly bears the brunt of Anu’s actions, to hilarious effect. It’s bad enough he is chided for drunk driving. She then brings up the fact that he has flunked in exams. To top that, she announces that she has scored 95%. As Arjun’s friends (Suhas and Abhinav Gomatam) keep reiterating, ‘she did it again’. The initial portions are a roller coaster ride of fun but underneath all that laughter, Venky shows us several fault lines in the relationships. Anu’s love for Arjun and Arjun’s jealousy and hatred for her are only one part of the drama. There’s also the strained relationship between Anu and her mother. The mother has no qualms funding Arjun’s exam malpractices, but refuses to support her meritorious daughter’s dream. When we begin to wonder if everything, including a loveless marriage, will be masked with comedy, Venky turns the tables to reveal a Tom and Jerry scenario between Anu and Arjun. New characters are introduced every now and then, all adding to the humour. The stretch involving Brahmaji and his coaching institute (you can’t miss his posters with Obama and Modi) are fun. When the superstitious Vennela Kishore arrives, it sets the ball rolling for yet another fun ride. As Anu and Arjun figure out where their relationship is headed, gender issues also get addressed. Keerthy Suresh is a treat to watch and Nithiin matches her at every step. Devi Sri Prasad’s music and the visual canvas, with cinematographer P C Sreeram being at the helm, also work hugely for the film. I wish the story had also addressed the issues with the parents — the tendency of a parent to constantly compare an under-performing child with a smarter one; and another parent who doesn’t make an effort to understand her daughter’s dreams. A few missteps aside, Rang De is entertaining and sensitive where it needs to be.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||The jungle giants deserved better||Imagine a boardroom full of powerful men, drawing up plans to build a sprawling, plush township surrounded by verdant greens. The irony is, they aim to do this by encroaching on a reserve forest zone. Director Prabhu Solomon’s trilingual film ( Aranya in Telugu, Kaadan in Tamil and Haathi Mere Saathi in Hindi) is a relevant tale that has the potential to resonate with similar threats to ecologically sensitive zones in different parts of the country. The film is also an indirect hat tip to Jadav Payeng, considered the Forest Man of India. Like Payeng, the on-screen jungle man is credited to have planted several thousand trees. Barring that similarity, the protagonist’s journey here is a fictional one. His real name, Narendra Bhupathi, is mentioned fleetingly. He’s better addressed as Aranya. Having grown up in the lap of nature, he understands every call of a bird or animal and his conversations with the flora and fauna are fun. The jungles are familiar terrain to Solomon. His earlier film Kumki ( Gajaraju in Telugu) was a heartwarming story of a bond between a man and an elephant. The opening scenes of Aranya are in a similar space, drawing us into the dense forests and their many sights and sounds. Ashok Kumar’s camera and the sound design by Resul Pookutty set the stage for a visual and aural delight. Solomon draws the battle lines between Aranya and the vested forces without wasting time. A minister (Ananth Mahadevan), a real estate firm and their many subordinates want to invade a reserve forest zone. Elephants are at the risk of losing their access to their most fundamental need — water. The forester will have none of it. For a battle that’s so clear cut, the happenings are long drawn. Some things work — like the characterisation of the jungle man. Rana plays the rugged forester, owning the peculiar gait and looking believable even in a gravity-defying Tarzan-like sequence. However, the film loses momentum quickly, embarking on a lopsided narrative of one man against all the hammy antagonists who bay for the elephants’ blood. Sure, there’s the Naxal woman (Zoya Hussain) and reporter Arundhati (Shriya Pilgaonkar) who want the jungle to be protected, but their roles are limited. The film has its moments. You can guess when an elephant will come in harm’s way and yet, when it happens, it shakes you up. When a herd of elephants go in search of water, it’s a desperate call for survival. But there are several loose ends. The subplot of romance between the partly-silly-partly-corrupt mahout Singha (Vishnu Vishal) and Zoya’s character is done away with after a point. A few characters that stay on, aren’t even made to do the most predictable things. Why does it take that long for an independent journalist to harness the power of social media? Rana singularly tries to hold things together, trying to save the elephants as well as the film. There’s a dialogue where Rana says that animals know where to look for food and water according to the season, human beings don’t. The giants are superior creatures, and their cause deserved a better film.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/the-jungle-giants-deserved-better/article34174833.ece

27 March 2021||FARIDABAD,||Nikita case convicts get life imprisonment||Both the convicts in the Nikita Tomar murder case, Tosif and his friend Rihan, were sentenced to life imprisonment and imposed over Rs. 20,000 fine on different counts by the District and Sessions Court here on Friday. Nikita’s father Moolchand Tomar, however, said that he was “deeply hurt” by the quantum of sentence since he expected the convicts to be awarded death sentence. He said that it was “incomplete justice” and he would fight till the end to seek “complete justice” for his daughter. Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said the government would study the judgment and would move Punjab and Haryana High Court, seeking the death sentence for the two men. Earlier, Additional Sessions Judge Sartaj Baswana, announcing the quantum of sentence, awarded life imprisonment to the two convicts and imposed a fine of Rs. 20,000 each for the murder charges. In case of default of fine, the two will have to undergo one year rigorous imprisonment each. Criminal conspiracy Besides, the two were sentenced to five years imprisonment and Rs. 2,000 fine each separately on charges of criminal conspiracy and kidnapping to compel a woman for marriage. The two will have to undergo two months rigorous imprisonment each in case of default of fine. Tosif, also convicted under the Arms Act, was sentenced to four years imprisonment and Rs. 2,000 fine, said Public Prosecutor Sunil Kumar Parmar. He added that the sentences awarded to the two convicts would run concurrently. Earlier, Defence Counsel P.L. Goyal, opposing the death penalty for convicts, argued that the crime did not fall in the category of “rarest of the rare” since the perpetrators did not inflict any brutality on the victim. He also argued that the convicts were young, in their early 20s, and had no criminal record. Mr. Goyal said there were many “loopholes” in the prosecution’s case and they would move Punjab and Haryana High Court against the conviction. Tosif and Rihan were held guilty on March 26. The third accused, Ajrudeen, was acquitted. Nikita was coming out from the college with her friend after taking an exam when Tosif and Rihan shot her and fled in a car. She later died during treatment.  I was deeply hurt by the quantum of sentence.

27 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Don’t charge more than Rs. 11 per person for subsidised ration’||Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, on Friday asked the Delhi government not to charge more than Rs. 11 per person for subsidised ration being provided to it by the Central government under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Any attempt to charge more than this from the poor sections of the society will face strong protests from the BJP and its cadres, he said. The Centre, the LOP said, clearly states that wheat should be supplied to the poor, but the Delhi government wanted to supply flour instead of wheat.There was, Mr. Bidhuri said, no clarity on the quality of flour, who will pay for the extra expenses and there was no transparency in the whole exercise, making it reek of corruption, he alleged. “We will not allow the government to charge even a penny from the people of Delhi. This will face a strong protest from the BJP and the Opposition will hit the streets and it cannot allow the exploitation of the poor,” he said. “The NFSA has been passed by Parliament under which ration is being supplied to the poor. It is incumbent upon the Delhi government to run this as a Central government scheme and give it due credit,” he also said. Meanwhile, Imran Hussain, Minister of Food and Civil Supplies, said that the Delhi government had immediately complained to the Centre about the rotten ration received from it during the COVID-19-induced lockdown last year, apart from returning the rotten ration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/dont-charge-more-than-rs-11-per-person-for-subsidised-ration/article34174733.ece

His appointment has been questioned by the JNU Teachers’ Association on the grounds that he had been appointed by Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar and there was no Executive Council (EC) meeting to deliberate on the matter. The teachers’ body called it an “overreach of the powers of the V-C”. The JNU administration, in a statement, said: “The EC approved an action taken by the V-C to appoint Mr. Chakraborty, to take care of the duties of the office of the Registrar of the university taken in accordance with the Statute 8(2) of JNU.” It said that the V-C, under JNU Statute, is authorised to take decisions on matters of urgency and report to the Executive Council, and thus he approved the appointment of Mr. Chakraborty on March 17. “He will be taking care of the office of the Registrar until a new Registrar is appointed for which an advertisement has been issued. It is unfortunate that a few faculty members of JNU have tried to manufacture a controversy over an appointment, which is otherwise a routine process,” the statement said. The EC also approved the recommendation of JNU Finance Committee to explore the possibility of offering some services in hostels through Facility Management System.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/jnu-ec-approves-appointment-of-former-dean-for-registrar-role/article34174732.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Crime Branch files FIR on phone tapping complaint||An FIR has been registered by the Crime Branch unit of Delhi Police on the complaint of Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in connection with an incident of tapping his phone conversation, officials said on Friday. A controversy over phone tapping had erupted last year after audio clips purportedly having telephonic conversation between the Minister and Congress leaders surfaced. Congress leaders of the Ashok Gehlot camp had alleged that BJP leaders were involved in horse trading to topple the State government. A complaint was filed at Tughlaq Road police station on March 20 by Mr. Shekhawat, who is currently the Minister for Jal Shakti, against Lokesh Sharma, who is serving as the Officer on Special Duty of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, and others for commission of offences of criminal conspiracy and unlawfully intercepting telegraphic signals (telephonic conversation), they said. “The complaint was transferred to the Crime Branch of Delhi Police,” a senior police officer said. Based on the complaint, an FIR was registered on Thursday under relevant Sections of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, Information Technology Act and Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 120 B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, police said. According to the FIR, the complainant has alleged that on July 17, 2020, various prominent media houses and news channels had aired some telephonic conversations, allegedly between Sanjay Jain, Bhanwar Lal Sharma, a Member of Legislative Assembly, Rajasthan and the complainant, which were illegally leaked to the media houses and news channels by Lokesh Sharma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/crime-branch-files-fir-on-phone-tapping-complaint/article34174737.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Hand over Ansari to U.P. Police within 2 weeks’||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the Punjab government to hand over the custody of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to Uttar Pradesh Police within two weeks. A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R. Subhash Reddy said Punjab had denied Uttar Pradesh the custody of Ansari on trivial grounds. Ansari, an MLA from Mau constituency, is currently lodged in a Punjab jail. The apex court said a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be a helpless bystander when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity. The court, in a judgment, ordered Ansari to be lodged in District Jail, Banda, in U.P. Justice Reddy, who authored the 56-page verdict, said it was open for the special court, constituted for MPs/MLAs at Allahabad, to continue him either in the District Jail at Banda or shift to any other prison in the State. Medical facilities “There shall be a direction to the Superintendent of Jail, District Jail Banda, Uttar Pradesh, to extend the necessary medical facilities to the 3rd respondent (Ansari). It is made clear that if any speciality treatment is required to the 3rd respondent, the Jail Superintendent of District Jail, Banda, Uttar Pradesh, shall take necessary steps to extend such medical care also, by following the Jail Manual,” the judgment read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hand-over-ansari-to-up-police-within-2-weeks/article34174739.ece

The report ‘Capital Gains-Clean Air Action in Delhi NCR: What next?’, lays down a roadmap on what the national capital and NCR towns should be doing to curb air pollution in the region.The measures to be taken range from changes in cropping patterns to reduce cultivation of paddy and from minimising stubble burning to scaling up pedestrianisation in high footfall areas to create low emissions zones. “Delhi has seen it [PM2.5] drop by almost a quarter. But even after this drop, Delhi has to reduce the three-year running annual average of PM2.5 by yet another 60%,” it said. Talking about industrial pollution, the report said that Delhi has seen more progress, but that is partly because a lot of industries could be shifted out of Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/report-lauds-citys-effort-to-curb-pollution/article34174735.ece
27 March 2021||Mumbai,||FIR filed over leak of confidential report||A day after the Maharashtra Chief Secretary submitted a report to the Chief Minister ruling out wrongdoing in the transfers of police officers, an FIR was registered on Friday against unidentified persons for leaking confidential documents. The FIR was registered on a complaint by the State Intelligence Department and invoked Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923, Section 30 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and Sections 43(b) and 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2008. The Cyber Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police is conducting further probe into the case. Earlier this week, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis alleged a transfer scam citing a report prepared by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla. Mr. Fadnavis on Friday denied that he leaked the confidential report and said he only waved the covering letter of the report before journalists. He accused Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and State Minister Nawab Malik of leaking the report. Mr. Fadnavis also claimed that the Chief Secretary’s report was prepared by NCP ministers like Jitendra Awhad and Mr. Malik. “I don’t believe that the report was prepared by a straight-forward officer like Sitaram Kunte. It was given to him by the ministers as it is full of errors. The report has not mentioned that phone tapping is allowed by law in case of ‘incitement of commencement of offence.’ This means the report is being fabricated,” Mr. Fadnavis said. The Anti-Corruption Bureau also undertakes phone tapping citing this law, he added. However, the NCP ministers refuted Mr. Fadnavis’s allegations. Mr. Awhad said the BJP leader is demoralising the bureaucracy by rejecting Mr. Kunte’s report. “But I must thank him for accepting that I can write a report,” Mr. Awhad said. Mr. Malik said Mr. Fadnavis was acting out of fear. “He is scared as an FIR has been registered over the leak of confidential reports. He was using Rashmi Shukla to destabilise the government. Not a single questionable transfer took place. He has to save his face now,” the NCP leader said.  Fadnavis was using Rashmi Shukla to destabilise the government.

27 March 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Man arrested for molesting minor daughter||The NRI Coastal police have arrested a 48-year-old resident of Ulwe for molesting his 13-year-old daughter. The accused, a driver by profession, was arrested on March 24 based on a complaint filed by the daughter. The accused has been arrested under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. According to the complaint, the accused started molesting the daughter in January this year. She told the police that the accused followed her around the house and found ways to harass and molest her. The accused threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed the abuse to anyone. The police said the girl’s mother died when she was one-year-old. On March 15, she screamed for help when the accused molested her while she was sitting in the main hall of the house. Her two elder sisters, who were working in the kitchen, came running to her side hearing her cries for help. When she confided in her sisters, the accused, in a fit of rage, got hold of a stick and assaulted her. On March 21, she left her home and went to stay at her friend’s house in Ghatkopar. By then, her father had filed a missing person’s complaint with the police. Senior police inspector Ravindra Patil said, “The friend called the accused and told him that the daughter was staying at her place. When the girl was brought to the station, she told us she did not want to go home with her father and narrated her ordeal to us.” The girl was then taken to the children’s home in Sanpada, where she gave her statement to the magistrate over video call. The accused has been remanded in police custody till March 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/man-arrested-for-molesting-minor-daughter/article34174749.ece

27 March 2021||Pune,||Ajit Pawar to decide on Pune lockdown on April 2||With the alarming surge in COVID-19 cases and fatalities making Pune the worst-hit district in India, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and District Guardian Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday hinted at a possible lockdown unless there was a dramatic improvement in the pandemic situation. Mr. Pawar said the decision on whether or not to impose a lockdown would be taken at the next review meeting on April 2. Till then, the present shutdown orders on all schools and other educational establishments in Pune would be extended till April 30.   “The COVID-19 situation in Pune is getting grimmer by the day. If it continues to deteriorate, then we shall be left with no alternative but to take stern measures. Even now, with heightened case spikes reported each day, I find people roaming about the streets without any fear, flouting rules with impunity by not wearing masks. Such errant behaviour must stop,” Mr. Pawar said after a review meeting with all elected representatives of the district as well as top officials. While exams for Classes X and XII exams, as well as the remaining papers of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission would proceed as scheduled, the Guardian Minister said all political programmes would be banned in the district from April 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ajit-pawar-to-decide-on-possible-pune-lockdown/article34174752.ece
27 March 2021||Chittagong,||Bangladesh protest turns violent, 4 dead||Four supporters of a hardline Islamist group were shot dead in Bangladesh on Friday in violent demonstrations over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tour to Dhaka, officials said. It comes as Bangladesh marks 50 years of independence from Pakistan with celebrations focused on its economic achievements, which activist groups say have been overshadowed by rights abuses. Police said four bodies of members of Hefazat-e-Islam, a hardline Islamist group, were brought to Chittagong Medical College Hospital after violence erupted at Hathazari, a rural town where the group’s main leaders are based. “We got four bodies here. They are all hit with bullets. Three of them are madrasa students and another a tailor,” Alauddin Talukder, a police inspector at the hospital, said. He said at least four other demonstrators were critically injured. Ruhul Amin, the government administrator of Hathazari town, said up to 1,500 supporters of Hefazat attacked a police station chanting anti-Modi slogans. “They attacked us all of a sudden,” he said, without confirming whether any protesters were killed. Hathazari is home to one of Bangladesh’s largest madrasas and is the headquarters of the Hefazat, which was formed in 2010 and is believed to be the country’s largest hardline Islamist outfit. Hefazat spokesman Mir Idris accused the police of “opening fire” at their “peaceful” supporters. “There were some 5,000 protesters. They were all Hefazat supporters and they were mostly madrasa students. They were protesting Mr. Modi’s visit and police actions against demonstrators in Dhaka,” he said. He was referring to other smaller clashes at the compound of the country’s largest mosque in central Dhaka after Friday prayers when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at brick-throwing Islamist supporters. Hefazat is known for its nationwide network and large-scale protests demanding blasphemy laws in Bangladesh. In 2013, police clashed with tens of thousands of Hefazat supporters in Dhaka, leaving nearly 50 people dead. Hefazat aside, a diverse range of Bangladeshi groups — including students, leftist and other Islamist outfits — have been staging protests over the last few days against Mr. Modi’s visit. They accuse Mr. Modi of stoking religious tensions and inciting anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002. On Thursday, more than 40 people were injured, including four police officers, during a student demonstration. At least 33 people were detained for violence. Celebrations hit Clashes also occurred at Dhaka University on Thursday evening, when pro-government student activists allegedly beat dozens of anti-Modi student protesters. The violence has overshadowed Bangladesh’s celebrations for 50 years of independence from Pakistan. The former East Pakistan emerged as a new nation in 1971 after a brutal war involving India marked by horrific abuses that Bangladesh says killed as many as three million and displaced many more.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bangladesh-protest-turns-violent-4-dead/article34174449.ece
27 March 2021||London,||Beijing sanctions Britons over Xinjiang||China slapped sanctions on several British politicians and organisations on Friday after the U.K. joined the European Union and others in sanctioning Chinese officials accused of human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region. The U.K. responded by accusing China of violating human rights on an “industrial scale.” China sanctioned four British institutions and nine individuals, including prominent lawmakers who have criticised the treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. It said they would be barred from visiting Chinese territory and banned from having financial transactions with Chinese citizens and institutions. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the censure imposed earlier this week by the EU, the U.S., Britain and Canada was based on “lies and disinformation, flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China’s internal affairs, and severely undermines China-U.K. relations.” “China does not stir up trouble, but China is not afraid when others do,” Yang Xiaoguang, China’s charge d’affaires in London, said at a news conference. “China is not the first to shoot, neither will we be passive and submissive to threats from the outside,” he said. “Today’s world is not the world of 120 years ago. The Chinese people will not be bullied.” Johnson slams move British Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Beijing’s move, saying the sanctioned individuals “are performing a vital role shining a light on the gross human rights violations being perpetrated against Uighur Muslims. “Freedom to speak out in opposition to abuse is fundamental and I stand firmly with them,” he tweeted. At a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying unleashed a string of accusations against the U.S., the U.K., allied nations and portions of the Western media, saying they had been collaborating to subvert China’s unity and development. “For a lengthy period of time, the U.S., U.K and others have felt free to say whatever they like without allowing others to do the same,” Ms. Hua said. Those days are over and the West will “have to gradually get used to it,” Ms .Hua said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/beijing-sanctions-britons-over-xinjiang/article34174443.ece
27 March 2021||Suez,||Egypt races to dislodge giant vessel blocking Suez Canal||Tugboats and a specialised suction dredger worked on Friday to dislodge a giant container ship that has been stuck sideways in Egypt’s Suez Canal for the past three days, blocking a crucial waterway for global shipping. The Ever Given, a Panama-flagged ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, ran aground in the narrow canal that runs between Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. It got stuck in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about 6 km north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. The ship, owned by the Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK, has blocked traffic in the canal. Around 10% of world trade flows through the canal. The closure also could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. At least 237 ships were waiting for the Ever Given to be cleared.  A team from Boskalis, a Dutch firm specialised in salvaging, started working with the canal authority on Thursday. The rescue efforts have focused on dredging to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the vessel’s bow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/egypt-races-to-dislodge-giant-vessel-blocking-suez-canal/article34174444.ece
27 March 2021||Washington,||Georgia passes restrictive voting law||The U.S. State of Georgia passed a law on Thursday, making ballot access more restrictive as Republicans across the country consider similar moves. Democrats and other critics of the law said it was targeted against Black voters and reminiscent of the Jim Crow (segregation) era. Several activist groups have mounted legal challenges to the law. The new law’s controversial provisions include a cut in the number of weeks during which people can ask for absentee mail in ballots, restricted locations for ballot drop-boxes, outlawing the provision water to those standing in line at the polls, a prohibition on ballot counters taking breaks during counting. Crucially, the law increases the control the State legislature has over the election machinery. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed the Bill into law within two hours of the GOP-controlled State Assembly and Senate passing it along party lines. Mr. Kemp tweeted that the law would make Georgia’s elections “secure, fair and accessible”. “Jim Crow 2.0 is represented in that picture,” Georgia lawmaker Donna McLeod told CNN . Since former U.S. President Donald Trump’s defeat at the polls last year, Republicans have proposed more than 250 Bills limiting voter access, according to a Reuters report. Mr. Trump and his team had unsuccessfully litigated claims of voter fraud in multiple lawsuits across the country. President Joe Biden, then a candidate, won Georgia, flipping the State after nearly two decades. The Democrats also flipped both Georgia seats in the U.S. Senate in run-offs held in January this year. At his first press conference since assuming office, Mr. Biden, on Thursday, called the law “sick” and “ un-American” and said he would do everything with allies in Congress to stop the law from moving forward. “The Republican voters I know find this despicable… Republican voters, the folks outside this White House,” Mr. Biden said. “I’m not talking about the elected officials. I’m talking about voters.” One State lawmaker, Georgia Park Cannon, who is African American, tweeted a video of her being arrested for knocking on the Governor’s door. Later, she tweeted that she had been released from jail. “I am not the first Georgian to be arrested for fighting voter suppression. I’d love to say I’m the last, but we know that isn’t true,” she said. The video shows two White officers handcuffing Ms. Cannon. Recently elected Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff tweeted out his support for Ms. Cannon, suggesting she was charged with a felony unfairly, “For ‘knocking on Gov. Kemp’s office door’ as she tried to observe the cowardly closed-door signing ceremony for the voter suppression law.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/georgia-passes-restrictive-voting-law/article34174441.ece
27 March 2021||Addis Ababa,||Eritrea will pull out troops from Tigray: Ethiopian PM||Eritrea will pull its troops out of Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Friday, a potential breakthrough in a drawn-out conflict that has seen atrocities carried out against civilians. The announcement comes as Mr. Abiy, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, faces mounting pressure to end fighting, in which both Eritrean and Ethiopian troops stand accused of abuses, including mass killings and rapes. Mr. Abiy sent troops into Tigray on November 4 after accusing the region’s once-dominant ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), of attacks on Army camps. For months both Addis Ababa and Asmara denied Eritrean troops were in Tigray, contradicting accounts from residents, aid workers, diplomats and even some Ethiopian civilian and military officials. Meeting with Afwerki Mr. Abiy finally admitted Eritrea’s role in an appearance before lawmakers on Tuesday, then flew on Thursday to Asmara to meet with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. During that visit “the government of Eritrea has agreed to withdraw its forces out of the Ethiopian border,” Mr. Abiy said in a statement on Twitter. “The Ethiopian National Defense Force will take over guarding the border areas effective immediately.” Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Gebremeskel did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. In a statement on Friday, his office made no mention of any deal on a troop withdrawal, saying only that the two sides “agreed to hold follow-up consultative meetings” in Addis Ababa. But the country’s Ambassador to Japan, Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “as of today” Eritrean forces would “hand over all posts” that were “vacated” by Ethiopian troops when the conflict began. Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war beginning in 1998 that left tens of thousands dead and resulted in a two-decade stalemate. Mr. Abiy won his Nobel in large part for initiating a rapprochement with Mr. Afwerki after taking office in 2018, but Eritrea and the TPLF remained bitter enemies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eritrea-will-pull-out-troops-from-tigray-ethiopian-pm/article34174446.ece
27 March 2021||Berlin,||‘Brazil virus deaths biggest genocide in our history’||Brazil’s over 3,00,000 deaths from the coronavirus amount to the “biggest genocide” in the Latin American country’s history, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Friday in a scathing attack on current leader Jair Bolsonaro. “On Tuesday, 3,158 people died of Covid in Brazil. It’s the biggest genocide in our history,” Mr. Lula told Germany’s Der Spiegel weekly, adding that Mr. Bolsonaro had lied to the Brazilian people about the pandemic. “We must save Brazil from COVID-19,” the former President added, saying that “Brazil will not withstand it if this man continues to govern in this way”. As Brazil surpassed 3,00,000 deaths from the virus on Wednesday, Mr. Lula called on Mr. Bolsonaro to apologise to the families of victims. More than 12 million people have been infected in Brazil, including the virus-sceptical far-right President Bolsonaro. Mr. Lula, 75, led Brazil through an economic boom from 2003 to 2010 as head of the left-wing Workers’ Party before being sentenced to 26 years in prison on charges of taking bribes in 2017. After the corruption conviction against him was annulled earlier this month, recent opinion polls suggest that he is the best-placed politician to challenge Mr. Bolsonaro in next year’s elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/brazil-virus-deaths-biggest-genocide-in-our-history-lula/article34174442.ece

The country has been in uproar since the military ousted the Nobel laureate in a lightning putsch on February 1, triggering an uprising demanding a return to democracy. Her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), has been in disarray since the coup, with some of its elected MPs in hiding. At about 4 a.m. on Friday, an attacker hurled a Molotov cocktail at its Yangon HQ, causing a brief fire. “When the residents nearby knew about the fire, they called the fire service department to put it out... it was under control by around 5 a.m.,” Soe Win, an NLD member, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/firebomb-attack-at-nld-headquarters/article34174447.ece

Mr. Trump told Fox News that law enforcement was “persecuting” the Capitol rioters, while “nothing happens” to left-wing protesters. He did acknowledge that those who stormed the Capitol “went in and they shouldn’t have done it.” But he added: “Some of them went in and they’re, they’re hugging and kissing the police and the guards. You know, they had great relationships.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Dormant Parliament, fading business||The Budget session of Parliament ended on Thursday, two weeks ahead of the original plan, as many political leaders are busy with campaigning for the forthcoming State Assembly elections. This follows the trend of the last few sessions: the Budget session of 2020 was curtailed ahead of the lockdown imposed following the novel coronavirus pandemic, a short 18-day monsoon session ended after 10 days as several Members of Parliament and Parliament staff got affected by COVID-19, and the winter session was cancelled. As a result, the fiscal year 2020-21 saw the Lok Sabha sitting for 34 days (and the Rajya Sabha for 33), the lowest ever. The casualty was proper legislative scrutiny of proposed legislation as well as government functioning and finances. While COVID-19 was undoubtedly a grave matter, there is no reason why Parliament could not adopt remote working and technological solutions, as several other countries did. No Bill scrutiny An important development this session has been the absence of careful scrutiny of Bills. During the session, 13 Bills were introduced, and not even one of them was referred to a parliamentary committee for examination. Many high impact Bills were introduced and passed within a few days. The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which is the Bill to change the governance mechanism of Delhi — shifting governance from the legislature and the Chief Minister to the Lieutenant Governor — was introduced on March 15 in the Lok Sabha, passed by that House on March 22 and by Rajya Sabha on the March 24. Another Bill, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2021, amends the Mines and Minerals Act, 1957 to remove end-use restrictions on mines and ease conditions for captive mines; this Bill was introduced on March 15 and passed by both Houses within a week. A Bill — The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) Bill, 2021 — to create a new government infrastructure finance institution and permit private ones in this sector was passed within three days of introduction. The Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2021, the Bill to increase the limit of foreign direct investment in insurance companies from 49% to 74% also took just a week between introduction and passing by both Houses. In all, 13 Bills were introduced in this session, and eight of them were passed within the session. This quick work should be read as a sign of abdication by Parliament of its duty to scrutinise Bills, rather than as a sign of efficiency. Consulting House panels This development also highlights the decline in the efficacy of committees. The percentage of Bills referred to committees declined from 60% and 71% in the 14th Lok Sabha (2004-09) and the 15th Lok Sabha, respectively, to 27% in the 16th Lok Sabha and just 11% in the current one. Parliamentary committees have often done a stellar job. For example, the committee that examined the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code suggested many changes to make the Code work better, and which were all incorporated in the final law. Similarly, amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act were based on the recommendations of the Committee. Money Bill classification The last few years have seen the dubious practice of marking Bills as ‘Money Bills’ and getting them past the Rajya Sabha. Some sections of the Aadhaar Act were read down by the Supreme Court of India due to this procedure (with a dissenting opinion that said that the entire Act should be invalidated). The Finance Bills, over the last few years, have contained several unconnected items such as restructuring of tribunals, introduction of electoral bonds, and amendments to the foreign contribution act. Similarly, this year too, the Finance Bill has made major amendments to the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956. As this is a Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha cannot make any amendments, and has only recommendatory powers. Some of the earlier Acts, including the Aadhaar Act and Finance Act, have been referred to a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. It would be useful if the Court can give a clear interpretation of the definition of Money Bills and provide guide rails within which Bills have to stay to be termed as such. During this session, the Union Budget was presented, discussed and passed. The Constitution requires the Lok Sabha to approve the expenditure Budget (in the form of demand for grants) of each department and Ministry. The Lok Sabha had listed the budget of just five Ministries for detailed discussion and discussed only three of these; 76% of the total Budget was approved without any discussion. This behaviour was in line with the trend of the last 15 years, during which period 70% to 100% of the Budget have been passed without discussion in most years. The missing Deputy Speaker A striking feature of the current Lok Sabha is the absence of a Deputy Speaker. Article 93 of the Constitution states that “... The House of the People shall, as soon as may be, choose two members of the House to be respectively Speaker and Deputy Speaker….” Usually, the Deputy Speaker is elected within a couple of months of the formation of a new Lok Sabha, with the exception in the 1998-99 period, when it took 269 days to do so. By the time of the next session of Parliament, two years would have elapsed without the election of a Deputy Speaker. The issue showed up starkly this session when the Speaker was hospitalised. Some functions of the Speaker such as delivering the valedictory speech were carried out by a senior member. The deterioration in Parliament’s functioning is not a recent phenomenon. For example, the Monsoon Session of 2008 had set some interesting records. That session went on till Christmas, as the government wanted to use a parliamentary rule that a no-confidence motion could not be moved twice within a session; instead of a winter session, the monsoon session was extended with breaks. That session also saw eight Bills being passed in the Lok Sabha within 17 minutes. The following Lok Sabha (2009-14) saw a lot of disruptions to work, with about a third of its scheduled time lost. Some things have improved: over the last few years, we have seen most Bills being discussed in the House and have had less disruptions. However, the scrutiny of Bills has suffered as they are not being referred to committees. Parliamentary scrutiny is key Parliament has the central role in our democracy as the representative body that checks the work of the government. It is also expected to examine all legislative proposals in detail, understand their nuances and implications of the provisions, and decide on the appropriate way forward. In order to fulfil its constitutional mandate, it is imperative that Parliament functions effectively. This will require making and following processes such as creating a system of research support to Members of Parliament, providing sufficient time for MPs to examine issues, and requiring that all Bills and budgets are examined by committees and public feedback is taken. In sum, Parliament needs to ensure sufficient scrutiny over the proposals and actions of the government. M.R.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Israel’s democracy is facing a stress test||Israel is past its fourth election in less than two years, is in search of political stability and, once again, faces the crisis of not having a leader who can form a coalition government and survive a full term. The election results now have highlighted a fractured mandate where there are 13 parties, most with single digit seats; it is only the Likud party (right-wing, nationalist and neo-liberal) led by Benjamin Netanyahu that has 30 seats out of 120 seats of Parliament. Mr. Netanyahu has lost his political magic but Israel is unable to go beyond him. Coalitions are the reality The Likud party could very well be in a position to get to 61 seats with its meagre 30 seats by forming a coalition with other smaller parties that share the same ideological leanings and have the usual partners such as Shas (Haredi religious party with nine seats), Yamina, the new right with seven seats, Religious Zionist Party with its six seats, and United Torah Judaism with its seven seats. Single party majority is a mirage in Israel, while a coalition government is the reality. Yet, the Likud plus these do not ensure that the figure of 61 can be reached and this is where Mr. Netanyahu is an issue. Parties led by second-rank leaders such as Yair Lapid, Benny Gantz or Gideon Sa’ar are opposed to him as he is the first Israeli Prime Minister on trial for three criminal cases — bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Benny Gantz formed a coalition with Mr. Netanyahu in the last election, in 2020, even when he campaigned on a single agenda, which was ‘No Netanyahu’. It was a political calculation that affected his seat tally. In the last three elections, he got seats in the order of 35-33-33, respectively. Weak spots in the system The Prime Minister in Israel does not have to resign when charged and indicted in court — any other Minister or the President of state has to step down. This strange legal loophole has given a very long rope to Mr. Netanyahu who not only is in office but could contest election after election. Israel does not have a full drawn Constitution; it does not have an institutional mechanism therefore to uphold public trust and the legal dignity of the highest political office. For a decade it has been Mr. Netanyahu who could form multiple alliances and coopt smaller parties (ultra-religious, economic liberals, nationalist, settlers, etc.) behind his strong leadership. Since 1996 (the year Mr. Netanyahu became Prime Minister for the first time), governments in Israel have lasted for an average 2.3 years. Once a unifier and a decisive leader, he has now become the dividing figure in Israeli domestic politics. The last four elections, (in April and September 2019, March 2020 and now on March 23, 2021) have pushed the limits of Israeli electoral politics to new levels. Israel is now a leading democracy in the world with the most frequent national elections, a phenomenon which has exposed its deep-seated internal weakness. Israel does not have a basic common agenda any more. For a long time, the issue of its conflict with neighbours and the Palestinians has served as a catalyst for national politics. But now, societal cleavages and ideological and cultural divisions have resulted in an offensive and antagonistic politics. Israel stands deeply divided and exposed. Disintegration of society The Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), a Tel Aviv-based think tank, published its annual as well as a decade-long forecast of Israel’s security at the end of 2020. The INSS is a highly ranked think tank that works very closely with the state. An inevitable war with the Hezbollah and Iran’s nuclearisation are the two top threats to Israel’s national security projected in 2021-2030. The third issue that has posed another existential threat is the internal disintegration of Israeli society, leading to the loss of its social cohesion and its identity as a Jewish and democratic state. The long phase of dysfunction in the Israeli government (during the last decade when Mr. Netanyahu has been leading the most number of governments), is one of the greatest threats. This is the first time that the INSS’s report points to internal domestic issues (not the conventional threats from outside) as being a major threat to the country’s strategic situation. Israeli society was divided from the country’s inception, but Zionist labour was successful in working a common consensus.  In-gathering of exiles, having the desert bloom and reviving the land of milk and honey were some of the threads used to weave a story that could unite culturally diverse and multiple ethnic groups among Jews. After the rise of right-wing nationalist parties and a religious revival, post the 1967 war, there has been no common story to work with. Domestic schisms became aggravated and the multiple crises during COVID-19 did not help strengthen the fragile socio-economic fabric. All this affects the stability and the shared values that have characterised Israeli society and the way of life. Meanwhile, Israeli governments mirror the Indian phenomenon of the ‘ aaya ram, gaya ram ’ kind of  coalition woes. The President of Israel, Reuven Rivlin, has been expressing his anguish over this situation for a long time now. While the last government failed to complete even a year and collapsed, he said “there is a pressing need to revive the trust between the citizens of Israel and the state. That trust was damaged in the past year — seriously, maybe even critically”. India must take note The inner political crisis of Israel is a wake-up call for Indian democracy. There are many in India who look up to the Israeli model of a military-led national security, its abilities to retaliate and carry out surgical strikes as well as its aggressive pursuit of power. This model may not serve Indian national security in the long run as the Israeli story unfolds. Strong nations are often those with social cohesion, common values and an inner-capacity for dialogue and compromise. Many of my students are surprised that Israel is also a weak, vulnerable, deeply divided society — contrary to what they gather from stories of the Israeli Army, Mossad and television series such as Fauda . Israel may not have a new stable government soon and there is already a situation developing — of a deadlock that might push Israelis to a fifth election. It is indeed a defining moment for Israeli democracy. Khinvraj Jangid is Associate Professor and Director, Jindal Centre for Israel Studies, Jindal School of International Affairs, O.P.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Deadly trail||Firefighters keep reminding people that fire is a good servant but a bad master, and the blaze that engulfed a private COVID-19 hospital in Mumbai’s Bhandup area on Thursday night comes as a reminder of how true that axiom is. At least nine people died as flames and smoke spread through the facility housed in a mall. Coming soon after the fire that snuffed out the lives of infants in Bhandara, again in Maharashtra, the tragedy focuses attention on the failure to make fire safety a systemic imperative in public buildings. There is no clarity on where the inferno originated, and whether the hospital housed in a commercial building under ‘extraordinary circumstances’ for COVID-19 patients was equipped for the purpose. The majority of patients were evacuated and admitted to other hospitals. A solatium for the families of the victims has been announced by the State government, and predictable promises to investigate the incident have been made. These steps, though welcome, do little to change the image of decrepitude that marks policies on public safety in the country, and the generally ineffectual nature of inspections and certifications. Fire may be an accident, but the idea of protocols is to prevent it from having a devastating effect on lives and property. It should be pointed out that after a fire in Rajkot last November, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognisance of the incident and issued directions, one of which was to task an officer with fire safety for each COVID-19 hospital. States have only themselves to blame, if their officers ignore such guidelines, and avoidable fires claim lives. Hospital fires are a distinct entity in the literature on safety, since the presence of incapacitated patients, oxygen-suffused environments, plenty of air-conditioning and lack of sufficient physical space creates a devastating combination when disaster strikes. The National Disaster Management Guidelines of 2016 issued by the NDMA address these characteristics, with recommendations on infrastructural and systemic improvements — from comparative to ultimate safety — to reduce the risk of deadly fires. Yet, it is clear that even some of the basic recommendations, such as the availability of open space to move patients in an emergency, are beyond the scope of legacy buildings created for other purposes. What is feasible is for experts to assess the quality of infrastructure, specifically electrical installations, ensuring the retrofitting of structures with flame retardant materials and triaging of patients to reduce crowding. Recurring infernos should also convince States that they must create scientifically designed public health facilities that meet the needs of populous cities, reversing the policy of leaving this crucial function largely to for-profit entities where the imperative to cure is often pitted against cost and profit concerns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/deadly-trail/article34174418.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||In-house secrets||The Supreme Court has dealt with a grave matter concerning issues of judicial propriety with characteristic opaqueness. It has dismissed a complaint from Andhra Pradesh CM Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, containing explosive allegations against CJI-designate Justice N.V. Ramana, but declined to disclose the findings of an in-house inquiry. The rejection was disclosed on the Court’s website on the day CJI S.A. Bobde recommended Justice Ramana as his successor. Going by procedure, a committee of three judges must have inquired into the charges. The lack of transparency is based on a 2003 judgment of the apex court that any inquiry under this procedure is meant only for “the information and satisfaction” of the CJI, and is not meant for the public. However, this may be an instance when not many will agree with the confidentiality norm. The allegations came from a person holding the high office of CM, and the crux of his grievance was that the A.P. High Court was hostile to him and his regime due to the influence wielded by Justice Ramana. Further, he accused the judge of proximity with Mr. Reddy’s political rivals and alleged involvement of his family members in a land scam that involved prior knowledge that Amaravati was to be declared the State’s capital and speculative buying of land there. There is little to commend the requirement of confidentiality in a probe of this nature, as the dismissal of the complaint ipso facto means that a serving CM has levelled false and motivated charges against a senior Supreme Court judge as well as those in the High Court. Mr. Reddy is surely in contempt of court if the committee found no merit in the allegations that he raised in a signed affidavit. Should the confidentiality rule always hold the field? Is it possible to dismiss the allegations without disclosing who were heard as witnesses and what material was considered as evidence? Was Mr. Reddy given an opportunity to substantiate his charges? And, does he get to know the conclusions? The unsavoury charges are bound to come up in some form or the other again. The A.P. government has appealed against a High Court judgment that stayed a police investigation in the Amaravati land issue. Mr. Reddy faces prosecution in corruption cases himself. A key allegation against him is that his animosity towards Justice Ramana arises from an order that a Bench headed by the latter had passed, that cases involving elected representatives be expedited. In a separate development, the High Court had also ordered a CBI probe into social media posts targeting judges. The charges being bandied about are overtly political, and the episode has become unpleasant. Notwithstanding the confidentiality norm laid down for in-house probes, it behoves the Court to demonstrate that justice was both done and was seen to be done.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-house-secrets/article34174419.ece
27 March 2021||New Delhi,||Tata group stocks gain after SC verdict||Tata group stocks gained up to 6% on Friday after the Supreme Court set aside the NCLAT order restoring Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman of the conglomerate. Tata Steel jumped 6.05%, Tata Communications rose 4.11%, Tata Motors went up 3.78% and Tata Power Company increased 4.92% on the BSE. Among others, Tata Consumer Products went up by 2.04%, Tata Investment Corporation by 2.65%, Tata Chemicals by 1.77%, Tata Metaliks by 3.08% and Tata Steel Long Products climbed 2.58%. In a victory for the Tata Group, the Supreme Court on Friday set aside the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order that had restored Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of the conglomerate. A bench of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian said it is allowing the appeals filed by the Tata group. “The order of National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dated December 18, 2019 is set aside,” the bench said. In a statement, Tata Sons said, “The judgment... vindicates the position of Tata Sons and upholds the governance standards adopted by the Tata Group over the years.” On December 17, the Shapoorji Pallonji Group had told the top court that the removal of Mr. Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons in a board meeting held in October 2016 was akin to an ambush, and was in ‘complete’ violation of the principles of corporate governance and pervasive violation of the Articles of Association in the process. The Tata group had opposed the allegations and said there was no wrongdoing and the board was well within its right to remove Mr. Mistry as chairman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tata-group-stocks-gain-after-sc-verdict/article34174412.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Japan to fund A&N, metro expansion||In the first-ever official development assistance (ODA) project in Andaman & Nicobar (A&N), Japan has approved grant aid worth ¥4.02 billion, or Rs. 265 crore, to improve the power supply in the islands, stressing the strategic geopolitical location of the islands for an open Indo-Pacific. Japan has also extended yen loans worth ¥229.5 billion, or Rs. 16,186 crore, for executing four projects, including Delhi Metro’s Phase 4 and Bengaluru Metro’s Phase 2 expansion plans for which loan agreements were signed between the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the government on Friday. “This is the first-ever ODA project in the strategic islands of Andaman & Nicobar (apart from humanitarian emergency assistance),” said a Japanese embassy official. “Due to its geopolitical location, the islands play a crucial role in our shared vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.” “Cooperation between Japan and India on these crucial islands demonstrate the commitment of both countries to realising a stable, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” he added. The grant would be used to procure 15MWh batteries as well as power system stabilisers to allow better utilisation of solar power generated in South Andaman. Metro projects The Rs. 8,390-crore loan for Delhi Metro’s fourth phase would help build three priority corridors — the extension of Line 7 (Mukundpur – Maujpur/12.56 km), Line 8 (Janakpuri West – R.K. Ashram/28.92 km) and a new corridor spanning Aerocity – Tughlakabad (23.62 Km), an official statement said. Following the completion of this phase, Delhi’s metro rail network span over 400 km, more than twice the Tokyo Metro, the official said. Similarly, a Rs. 3,717 crore loan has been approved for developing 80 km of metro lines under the Namma Metro’s second phase in Bengaluru. This would cover Line R6 (Nagawara – Gottigere, 22 km), Phase 2A (Silk Board – K R.Puram, about 20 km) and Phase 2B (K R.Puram – Kempegowda International Airport Terminal, 38 km). A loan of Rs. 807 crore was extended for crop diversification in Himachal Pradesh and Rs. 3,272 crore in loans to rural water supply with a focus on mitigating fluorosis in Rajasthan’s Jhunjhunu and Barmer districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/japan-to-fund-an-metro-expansion/article34174402.ece
27 March 2021||MUMBAI,||IL&FS wins Gurgaon Metro case||IL&FS on Friday said that the Supreme Court had ruled in its favour in the Gurgaon Metro Project case. As part of the judgment, the Supreme Court directed the Haryana Shehari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) to deposit 80% of total ‘debt due’ (more than Rs. 2,400 crore), amounting to Rs. 1,925 crore, within three months, into the escrow account. IL&FS had bagged the two-phased Gurgaon Metro Project developed through its subsidiary SPVs — Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon Ltd. (RMGL) and Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon South Ltd. (RMGSL) — in 2009 and 2013 respectively. “Due to multiple unmet obligations by the authority [HSVP], IL&FS SPVs had terminated the concession agreements in September 2019 and demanded certain termination payments due to them under the agreement,” IL&FS said. HSVP, however refuted the contention of IL&FS SPVs and challenged the matter in High Court of Punjab and Haryana. “The High Court, after hearing both the parties, ruled in September 2019 that operations and maintenance of the metro link be handed over to HSVP, and directed the CAG to carry out financial audit of total debt due,” IL&FS said. “HSVP was told to pay 80% of debt due [as determined by CAG] in the escrow account within 30 days of submission of CAG report,” the infrastructure and lending firm said. The project was handed over to HSVP in October 2019 as per court orders. Auditors appointed by CAG submitted their report on the debt due and determined the same at Rs. 2,407 crore. Despite the CAG submitting the audit report, HSVP had refused to meet its obligations and pay the compensation as ordered by the HC. IL&FS SPVs then moved the SC in January 2021.

27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Move health to Concurrent list’||Health should be shifted to the Concurrent list under the Constitution, and a developmental finance institution (DFI) dedicated to healthcare investments set up, Fifteenth Finance Commission Chairman N.K. Singh said on Friday. Making a case for enhancing government spending on health to 2.5% of GDP by 2025, Mr. Singh said primary healthcare should be a fundamental commitment of all States in particular and should be allocated at least two-thirds of such spending. Bringing health into the Concurrent list would give the Centre greater flexibility to enact regulatory changes and reinforce the obligation of all stakeholders towards providing better healthcare. Addressing the NATHEALTH summit, he said the health sector was in dire need of a DFI similar to the one being set up to stimulate infrastructure investments. “Such a DFI would increase healthcare access in tier-2 and tier-3 cities and also come in with technical assistance that ensures proper usage of funds,” he said. He also emphasised the importance of universalising healthcare insurance as a large section of the society still remained uncovered. “While the PMJAY covers the bottom two income quintiles, commercial insurance largely covers top-income quintile, thereby creating a ‘missing middle’ class in between. “This refers to people in the middle two income quintiles, where the population is not rich enough to afford commercial insurance and not poor enough to be covered under government-sponsored health insurance schemes,” the Commission’s Chairman pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/move-health-to-concurrent-list/article34174407.ece

27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Suez Canal blocked, India eyes Cape of Good Hope||With $200 billion of India’s trade flows with Europe, North America and South America at risk due to the blockage of the Suez Canal, the Department of Commerce has worked out an action plan to cope with the crisis, including possibly re-routing shipments through the Cape of Good Hope. More than 200 vessels are waiting on the North and South sides of the Suez Canal and about 60 vessels are joining this queue daily, officials said. “If two more days are taken before the efforts result in clearance of the canal (digging on both sides, extra barges being added on every high tide, tugboats, etc. to straighten the stuck vessel), the total backlog created would be about 350 vessels,” the Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement, estimating this backlog alone would take about a week to clear. Export promotion agencies have been asked to identify cargo with perishable items that need priority movement. Container Shipping Lines Association was advised to explore the option of re-routing ships via the Cape of Good Hope. “Such re-routing usually takes 15 additional days’ time,” officials were informed at a meeting. Shipping firms have promised to honour existing freight contracts, while ports have been advised to be ready for a bunching up of vessels once the canal is unblocked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/suez-canal-blocked-india-eyes-cape-of-good-hope/article34174409.ece

27 March 2021||PUNE,||Bairstow, Stokes pummel India into submission to force decider||Despite being billed as vital cogs across all the formats, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes had had a quiet, if not ordinary, tour coming into the penultimate game in India. The duo couldn’t have asked for a better occasion than the must-win second ODI to make a sizeable contribution. Such was the audacity of the onslaught from Bairstow and Stokes that England overhauled a stiff target of 337 without any fuss to level the series with a memorable win. It was a pity that the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium wore a deserted look because of the pandemic. But the handful of host association officials, security guards and scribes who witnessed the action were left awestruck by the dazzling stroke-play of Bairstow (124, 112b, 11x4, 7x6) and Stokes (99, 52b, 4x4, 10x6). Laying the foundation Bairstow and Jason Roy (55, 52b, 7x4, 1x6) laid a solid foundation for the chase, but the game was in the balance when Roy was run out, thanks to Rohit Sharma’s brilliance at short mid-wicket in the 17th over. At 110 for one, Stokes took guard. Bairstow didn’t let the pressure of the scoreboard mount, continuing to find gaps at will. There was hardly any dew, but the Indian bowlers were left dumbfounded as the pair mounted a brutal assault. Seldom did the batsmen play a slog. In fact, the feature of their clean hitting was that most of the duo’s sixes — 17 between them — were struck in the ‘V’. Bairstow and Stokes sealed the deal between overs 31 and 35, pounding an astounding 87 runs, as England soared to 281 for one. It was sheer carnage. Kuldeep Yadav suffered the most. The left-arm wrist-spinner was clobbered for 37 runs in two overs, while Stokes hammered 26 runs, including three sixes and a four, off left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya in the 34th over. Bhuvneshwar Kumar bounced Stokes out, the batsman gloving a hook to Rishabh Pant. It triggered a mini-collapse, with three wickets falling in nine balls, but debutant Liam Livingstone and Dawid Malan had little trouble in completing the formalities with 39 balls to spare. Stokes and Bairstow’s pyrotechnics meant the efforts of K.L. Rahul (108, 114b, 7x4, 2x6) and Pant (77, 40b, 3x4, 7x6) earlier in the day, which offered an ideal birthday gift to India batting coach Vikram Rathour, went in vain. Final flourish India added a whopping 126 runs in the last 10 overs, thanks largely to Pant and Hardik Pandya (35, 16b, 1x4, 4x6), after Rahul and Virat Kohli had steadied the ship earlier. While Kohli (66, 79b, 3x4, 1x6) failed to convert another fifty into a hundred, Rahul went on to do just that. But in the end, England ensured that it not only won the game convincingly but also the mini-battle of range-hitting — tallying 20 sixes to India’s 14 — to set up an enticing decider on Sunday.  If you look at the first game, we were ahead of the curve before a couple of wickets fell. That was something we identified and worked on Bairstow   Bairstow and Stokes sealed the deal between overs 31 and 35, pounding an astounding 87 as England soared to 281 for one||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bairstow-stokes-pummel-india-into-submission-to-force-decider/article34174517.ece
27 March 2021||London,||Greece fights back to hold powerhouse Spain||European giants Germany, Italy and England all got off to a winning start in World Cup qualifying, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked his return to international soccer with an assist to help Sweden to victory on Thursday. There was disappointment for Spain, however, as it was held to a 1-1 draw at home by Greece. In Granada, Alvaro Morata put Spain ahead in the first half but the visitors equalised with a penalty converted by Anastasios Bakasetas early in the second period in one of the team’s few scoring chances. Spain coach Luis Enrique brought Youngsters Pedri and Bryan Gil on to improve the team’s attack but they couldn’t do much to change the game’s outcome. The 39-year-old Ibrahimovic, who last played for Sweden at the 2016 European Championship, set up Viktor Johan Anton Claesson’s first-half goal in a 1-0 win over Georgia. He set up the goal after receiving a pass on his chest and scooping the ball into the middle of the area for Claesson’s close-range shot in the 35th minute. Human rights Germany coach Joachim Low began his farewell tour with a 3-0 win against Iceland in Duisberg. Germany lined up before kickoff wearing T-shirts over its national-team jerseys bearing the message “HUMAN RIGHTS.” It was an apparent statement about human rights abuses in Qatar, which is under scrutiny because of its discriminatory laws and conditions for the migrant workers who are helping to build infrastructure for the World Cup. Later on Friday, world football’s governing body FIFA said it will not sanction the German national team. Comfortable There was also a comfortable opening win for England, which beat San Marino 5-0 at Wembley. After failing to qualify for the last World Cup for the first time in six decades, Italy got its campaign off to a positive start with a 2-0 win over Northern Ireland.  The results: Group B: Sweden 1 (Claesson 35) bt Georgia 0; Spain 1 (Morata 33) drew with Greece 1 (Bakasetas 57-pen).   Group C: Bulgaria 1 (Despodov 46) lost to Switzerland 3 (Embolo 7, Seferovic 10, Zuber 12); Italy 2 (Berardi 14, Immobile 39) bt Northern Ireland 0.

27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||India adds two gold; Silver for Vijayveer||World junior champion Vijayveer Sidhu claimed silver, as he missed the rapid fire pistol gold, in the shoot-off to Peeter Olesk of Estonia, in the shooting World Cup at the Dr. Karni Singh Range on Friday. India won two gold medals on the day. In the mixed rifle 3-position, it was through Sanjeev Rajput and Tejaswini who beat Serhiy Kulish and Anna Ilina of Ukraine 31-29 in a thriller. Olympian Sanjeev stood up to the task and delivered the winning hit with a 10.8 in standing. There was also the men’s 50-metre rifle team gold. India surged further on top of the medals table with 12 gold, seven silver and six bronze. The second-placed US had three gold, three silver and a bronze.

27 March 2021||Kolkata,||A three-way contest for title||Gokulam Kerala FC, Tiddim Road Athletic Union (TRAU) FC, and Churchill Brothers SC figure in a three-way contest for the title making the concluding round of the Hero I-League’s championship leg a virtual final. The three teams have 26 points each but Gokulam is leading the race on account of having better statistics in terms of head-to-head results as compared to the other two. The Kozhikode-based side will take on Imphal’s TRAU at the Kishore Bharati Stadium while the other match will see two-time champion from Margao, Churchill Brothers, meeting another former champion RoundGlass Punjab FC (Mohali) at the Salt Lake Stadium. Simultaneous start Both matches will start simultaneously at 5 p.m. Both Gokulam and TRAU have been quite impressive in the championship leg where each has remained unbeaten while winning three and drawing one match respectively. The calculation is straight for Gokulam— it just needs to beat TRAU to secure its maiden I-League crown. Cannot relax “This is a final for us, and we need to win this game. We are too excited, we cannot relax. The mood is fine, but we have just one thing on our mind and that is to win this game,” said Gokulam Kerala coach Vincenzo Annese on Friday. The Malabarians had beaten the Imphal side 3-1 in the first phase and the result could spur the former to go for another successful outing. TRAU also needs a win, which will keep it ahead of Churchill Brothers statistically in case of a tie on points.   The tie-breakers  Gokulam, TRAU and Churchill Brothers are in contention for the trophy with 26 points each Gokulam will be champion if it beats TRAU, as it leads Churchill, which takes on Punjab FC, on head-to-head A draw will also do for Gokulam if Churchill loses to Punjab FC TRAU will take the title if it beats Gokulam as it has a superior goal-difference to Churchill in the event that the later beats Punjab FC||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-three-way-contest-for-the-title/article34174700.ece

27 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Not an official Tokyo Paralympic trial: Deepa||The 19th National Para athletics championship does not qualify as a Tokyo Paralympic selection trial, Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) president Deepa Malik stated on Friday. The championship, which concluded here on Friday, was initially thought to be a Paralympic qualification trial. A day before the championship began, the PCI had stated in a press release that “these events would be deemed as selection trials for the athletes to compete in the forthcoming Tokyo Paralympic Games and few mandatory IPC International Championships.” As it turns out, even if an athlete attains the Paralympic Minimum Qualification Standard (MQS) in this championship, it does not count for a Tokyo berth. A few athletes, who believed that this meet was indeed a Paralympic selection trial, expressed surprise at the latest announcement. No IPC observer “This is not an official Tokyo Paralympic selection trial, as this is not an IPC (International Paralympic Committee) event. “We did not have an IPC observer here. We had requested IPC observers to be present, but due to the COVID-19 situation, nobody could come,” Deepa said here on Friday. “However, results in this meet will help us identify athletes who are in the best position to attain MQS. We can select and send these athletes to the limited IPC events, which will help India gain Paralympic quota spots,” she added. A final Tokyo selection trial will be held in May or June, with support from the Sports Authority of India, Deepa stated. “For the final selection trial, we will have the best of facilities,” she said. Haryana is champion Haryana emerged as the overall champion of the national championship, with 33 gold, 24 silver and 15 bronze. Delhi (13 gold, 14 silver, 15 bronze), Tamil Nadu (8 gold, 7 silver, 9 bronze) and Karnataka (6 gold, 5 silver, 7 bronze) finished second, third and fourth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/not-an-official-tokyo-paralympic-trial-says-deepa/article34174556.ece

In just his third Test, the 32-year-old Bonner further enhanced an already burgeoning reputation as a middle-order batsman with considerably more substance than style.

It ensured his team comfortably saved the match at 236 for four, having been set the unlikely target of 375.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||A divine drama||Pamban Swamigal was an ardent devotee of Lord Muruga, and wanted to take up sanyasa in Pazhani. While his friend asked him if he had received a command from Lord Muruga regarding this, Swamigal nodded his head in assent. But he had not received any such command from the Lord. Later that day, the Lord appeared before him and said that because he had lied, he should not come to Pazhani. Muruga said that until he received an order from Muruga Himself, Swamigal should not visit Pazhani. And till the end of Swamigal’s life, such an order did not come from Muruga. So, now we may ask, “Why is it that when so many people visit Pazhani, Swamigal was denied this joy? After all, did a small lie matter so much?” But we must not assume that Lord Muruga punished Swamigal. It was just a divine drama, said T. Rajarathinam in a discourse. After all, Muruga did appear before Swamigal. How many of us are blessed with such a boon? The Lord wanted Swamigal to write explaining Subramania tattva to the world. There was a lot he had to do for the cause of Saivism. That being the case, Muruga felt Swamigal should not hastily assume sanyasa. It was in 1891 that Muruga appeared before Swamigal and told him not to come to Pazhani. In 1894, in Peerapan Valasai, when Muruga gave upadesa to Swamigal, He came in the same form which He has in Pazhani. So from this, it is clear that His anger against Swamigal was not serious. In 1902, Swamigal visited Kasi. When he stayed in Kumaragurupara Swami math, his clothes suddenly vanished. The official of the math offered him the ochre robes of a sanyasi, and it was finally at Kasi that Swamigal’s desire to renounce the world was fulfilled. So, we can infer that it was Muruga’s intention that Swamigal should become a sanyasi in Kasi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/a-divine-drama/article34174505.ece

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Have you done a salsa lately?||I like the word salsa, and all that it denotes, from dance and music to food. That explains, to an extent, why Mexican food appeals to me. It is, after all, a glorious mix of fluid and tonal flavours. It is also the cuisine that a talented young chef called Noah Barnes has been focusing on. I’d had some delicious Mexican food at his restaurant Arriba some years ago, and still remember the taste of the habanero-smoked pork skewers, flavoured with honey and served with a hot chilli sauce. The chef now runs a new restaurant called Miss Margarita (Ph no 8920331591; M block market, GK 2), which specialises in Mexican food. Chef Barnes, who learnt the nuances of Mexican cooking from the former ambassador of Mexico in India, and a visiting master chef at the embassy, prepares various kinds of tortillas, quesadillas, tacos and more. Mexican food has a spicy edge that appeals to the Indian palate. Some of the flavours — such as cilantro — are used in both cuisines. We love our tomatoes and onions; so do they. A lot of what we eat – think corn on the cob or peanuts – came to our shores from distant Mexico. I love all their open and closed wraps. The tacos that he prepares, with different toppings are superb. His Street-styled grilled chicken and chilli bean taco (Rs. 475) consisted of grilled chicken strips, a sweet paprika drizzle, refried beans, rocket, and smoked tomato salsa, topped with fresh tomato and onions. The dish I really loved was the diablo prawn (Rs. 725). With a pressed tomato and coriander drizzle, it had a tamarind and habanero glaze and came with burnt garlic and lime. The prawns were first grilled and then tossed in the sauce. The tart flavours of the tamarind went well with the sharpness of the chillies. The prawn — soft inside and crunchy outside — had soaked in the flavours. The cheesy jalapeno chicken chipotle quesadilla (Rs. 625) was just that — hot with a sharp taste of cheese, while the charred sweet potato and crispy cauliflower taco (Rs. 395) was a spinach tortilla, also topped with a hot sauce. The problem with the latter was that I didn’t really get the taste of cauliflower or the sweet potato, as it had been overwhelmed by the sauce. The pork carnitas tacos, however, were superb. Soft pork belly had been topped with a potato, pineapple and jalapeno salsa, smoked tomato salsa and refried beans (Rs. 575). The chicken enchilada, the chef said, was a dish of chargrilled chicken, mixed with peppers and cheese, rolled in tortilla bread and topped with home-made fermented hot sauces, baked with cheese. Chef Barnes takes pride in his “Fresh Guacamole Bar”, where guacamole is prepared at the table with avocado, tomatoes, jalapeno, onion, coriander and lime, and served with chips. There is a smoked chicken guacamole, too. There is a lot else on the menu: blackened Cajun fish taco (Rs. 475), gondhoraj flavoured lime shrimp fajita (Rs. 975) and a chicken casserole consisting of crispy, skinned chicken and spiced pilaf (Rs. 775). I ended the meal with my favourite churros, eaten with chocolate and chilli chocolate sauce (Rs. 425). It is a simple dish — fried dough dusted with sugar and cinnamon, but it is the sauce that gives it its singular taste. I dipped the churros in the chilli chocolate sauce and thought that was a blend worth a salsa.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Now streaming what readers want||Bollywood, sex, rich and famous weddings, controversy, Sabyasachi, royalty, saris, self-affirmation, what to buy, eat, where to go. That’s what (Indian) readers want. From lifestyle magazines. Broken down in different elements, of course. Celebrity curiosity will keep shifting. As it has from little Taimur Ali Khan (to the great relief of reporters on his beat) to Priyanka Chopra-Jonas’ book and beauty line. It will desert Kangana Ranaut’s theatrics for actor Sonu Sood’s new roles. When airport looks were grounded, Covid-19 masks took over. Currently, if sex is what Bombay Begums are having on Netflix, last month we had the Sex and The City reboot to fret about. A new controversy on tattered jeans replaces an old one on Tandav . Sprinkle some highly searched words like sustainability, depression, Mumbai police, TRP scam, race and religion, throw in spring/summer fashion trends and you have “content”. A good story, unlike this one, does not start with answers. It first builds context. The reader, however, may not care. For, a decade into what is described as the news revolution — ever since our laurels were about page views, likes and “going viral” — unless we tumble out some magnetic words to noose you in less than 30 seconds, dear reader, we will lose you to the next click. The next bait. But this is sheer exaggeration, you argue. Right. That’s exactly the point. “Simplify, then exaggerate,” as Geoffrey Crowther, former editor of The Economist would tell his editorial team. Now we do this inadvertently because we have no idea what you may find “epic” tomorrow morning. Last week, my article Who k illed the e xclusive in these pages, brought back a stack of feedback. Most came from the PR industry. Though a jewel of an observation from a reader raised the bar. “The algorithm that decodes what matters most (for readers presumably) is missing,” it said. This piece attempts to go into the circuitry of daily “content” compared to stories that promise quality, depth, fairness and accuracy, the hallmarks of good journalism. Does the reader know or care for the difference?  The ‘not serious’ tag  The pervasive assumption is that most readers prefer Priyanka Chopra-Jonas’s starry frocks, to why it took two months for Nodeep Kaur of Mazdoor Adhikar Sangathan to get bail after her arrest at the farmers’ protest in Delhi. Metaphorically and literally. Some of you also remind us lifestyle writers that we have no business comparing our work with serious stories. You expect us to stay in the “back of the book”. On the other hand, social media analysis builds on the contention that followers swarm around a “Twitter faceoff” or a trending Facebook story. The journalist is completely incidental. People follow us if our ideas are “endorsed” by influencers and fashion is featured on filmstars. We must follow your digital instincts — which increasingly point towards click bait — for you to follow us. So instead of information, insight and analysis, we must toil over catchy, SEO-friendly headlines. This is creating Instagram-pro content for social media spectators. For those who do not read. As a digital editor who pores over metrics (consumption data, reader analysis and the like) every week, I can tell you that this many fangled debate — whether readers determine the fate of journalism or whether proprietors of publications are the real culprits given falling revenues — is a chicken and egg one. Do you even care if what you read is PR mandated or an authentically reported story? Does it bother you that a shopping list in a fashion magazine is paid for by the brands being recommended? Probably not because it brings you well-curated information anyway.   Finding r elevance   In the maddening spin between paid stories, “networked” content and Bollywood obsession, the digital reader (not the social media skater) is only partially understood. The lifestyle journalist even less. While I have no statistics to counter that Bollywood drives attention, because it indeed does, there is enough data to prove that stories on Indian handlooms and crafts with photographs from the field perform equally well. This has been a consistent take back in my last two jobs. A photo story almost always does better than written pieces — says something about diminishing attention spans? It surprises me that one of my stories, The Kalakshetra s ari as a c ultural d estination , is the most read of all my work over the last three years at The Voice of Fashion . It is not a “trending” subject. But readers like stories on woven saris, wedding leh e ngas and new web series where clothes play big roles. Bridgerton , Queen’s Gambit , Masaba , Emily in Paris are instances. Data also supports that a majority engage with stories that concern the Northeast and Kashmir, including themes of strife, gender politics and resilience. This narrows the intellectual gap pointed out between print and digital readers. Those who consume content that intersects between fashion, art, culture, art, society, dress and identity fall in the 25-35 age group. Hyderabad and Bengaluru are ahead of Delhi yet behind Mumbai in the consumption of unusual content around fashion. Men and women are almost equally interested in fashion and design writing. ‘Where can I buy this or that’ is a failsafe tactic especially if it is about a beauty product but so is anything to do with designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee as many editors will tell you.   A l ifestyle w riter’s t rap   To return to a sore issue, the reader bias against lifestyle journalists is perhaps disproportionate. First, most such writing is whittled down to fashion, celebrity lives, cars and restaurants. This gets labelled as elitist, which is true to some extent as we omit interviewing millennials among Dalit and OBC communities about dating, depression or shopping, We never ask adult children of artisans for their views on lipsticks, blue jeans, pre-wedding shoots or smart phones. All the same, during the pandemic, lifestyle reporting brought out the underlying fragility of fashion retail in India. Of migrants employed in manufacturing units and export houses. Fashion journalism followed up promises of artisan funds. The cadence changed. The migrant, the rebel, the gender fluid influencer, the body positive model became our protagonists. Block chain technology, worker welfare, water and waste in manufacturing and circular fashion that optimises resources and innovation took the lead because readers respond to them. That’s why when someone asks me who your reader is, I often say, the one who I can read.  Shefalee Vasudev is editor of  The Voice of Fashion. This is a follow-up to last week’s article on how lifestyle journalism has changed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/now-streaming-what-readers-want/article34174385.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Centella’s beauty mark||Repair and heal are the new buzzwords in beauty. As lasers, retinols, acids, and microneedling become increasingly popular, there is high demand for products that calm irritated skin. Centella asiatica, prized for its wound-healing ability, tops the list, being the hero ingredient in cica creams prescribed by dermatologists to restore the skin’s barrier. But while the ingredient is extremely popular in modern beauty routines, its benefits go beyond just skincare. It is an ancient herb, mentioned in texts such as theSushruta Samhita, dating back to around 6 century BCE. Interestingly, it is prized for its soothing abilities in both modern and traditional medicine, even though the applications are different. Ayurvedic roots In Ayurveda, centella asiatica is known asgotu kolaormandukaparniand is prescribed to comfort the mind. “It improves cognitive function, reduces stress and anxiety, and purifies the blood,” says Dr Gunvant Hari Yeola, ayurvedic physician and principal of the DY Patil College of Ayurved & Research Centre in Pune. “It’s often confused withbrahmior seen as its substitute, though it is cooler in nature.” Indeed, if you read the fine print of mostbrahmisupplements or teas, you’ll find that the ingredient is centella asiatica, not bacopa monnieri, the scientific name forbrahmi. In the last century, scientists isolated active ingredients from the herb for topical application, which propelled it to its current position of a skin soother. “In the 1990s, the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research, run by the famous Professor Albert Rakoto Ratsimamanga, developed medicines based on local plants, the most emblematic of which is Madecassol, a wound-healing product made from this plant,” says Delphine Bouvier, Head Open Innovation, Sustainable Platform, L’Oreal. The cosmetic giant is now harvesting it in Madagascar to produce a variety of ‘green centella’ that guarantees traceability, fair wages, better extraction (thus consuming very little energy), and generating lesser greenhouse emissions. A pinch will do I can personally attest to this herb’s wound healing abilities as I use cica cream after an overzealous tretinoin application or a microneedling facial. If my job didn’t entail trying new skincare then I would only have three products in my beauty cabinet — tretinoin to refine, cica cream to soothe, and sunscreen to protect. Strangely enough, when I mix raw centella powder into a DIY mask it has an opposite, stimulating effect, which gives the skin a gentle flush. This means that you only need to use the tiniest amount (about a pinch) in a face mask. It just shows that despite its popularity, we are only just discovering its wide scope of benefits. Centella asiatica has become very popular also because it is antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, says dermatologist Dr Simal Soin, founder of New Delhi’s Aayna Clinic. “We have realised that inflammation impacts everything — it is the root cause of both metabolic disease and skin ageing. Therefore centella has become more relevant than ever before.” Dr Soin prescribes the herb for both internal and external benefits. “If someone asks me for an overall supplement I give them something with centella, if someone has rosacea or does laser, I give them a cica cream.” Because the ingredient is healing in nature, she says that it can be used safely by all skin types. After Korea, the world Though the ingredient has been around for decades, it became popular being part of several cult Korean products including Dr Jart’s Cicapair and the now notorious Purito Centella Green Level Sunscreen, currently under the scanner for its dubious SPF. Even though the ingredient is native to Asia, Korean skincare popularised it around the world. The fact that companies such as L’Oreal are investing in centella is testament to its healing potential and will help preserve this ancient herb for futuristic cosmetic applications.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Andolan jeans||As always, Dear Reader, I bring you yet another exclusive story that very few people (other than me) know about. It begins with a hush-hush conversation that took place in the early 1870s in the city of San Francisco between two gentlemen (and I use the term loosely), a certain Jacob W Davis and a Levi Strauss. ‘You know,’ said Strauss. ‘In the 21st century, the ancient, all-knowing land of India will become a superpower. And we can’t let that happen, can we?’ ‘ Oy gevalt , we can’t,’ responded Davis, popping a crisp golden-brown latke into his mouth. ‘And I know exactly how to stop them.’ ‘How? How?’ exclaimed Strauss, clapping his hands. ‘Let us invent jeans!’ said Davis. The two evil villains then took large sips of their Manischewitz, and roared with laughter like a Jewish Joginder and a Yiddish Yama. And thus began the slow erosion of our pristinely protected, Alok Nath-curated, jean-free culture. Mind you, far-sighted men of our land saw what was coming — like they always do when it comes to the welfare of their sisters and mothers. And they kept warning us from time to time about the pernicious effect this evil garment would have on our demure, god-fearing naris were it left unchecked. For example, a few years ago, legendary singer KJ Yesudas was among the first to raise an alarm about this toxic garment’s evil influence on our hitherto obedient mol és . ‘Women should not wear jeans and trouble others,’ he said at a public gathering to rousing applause. ‘Whatever should be covered, should be covered. We appreciate what’s concealed, and that’s our culture.’ But did we pay heed? No, sir. Our betis continued falling into the diabolical low-rise denim trap. Around the same time, then Urban Administration & Development Minister Babulal Gaur fearlessly highlighted the evil nexus between alcohol, dancing and jeans. ‘Women in foreign countries wear jeans and T-shirts, dance with other men and even drink liquor,’ he said. ‘But that is their culture. It’s good for them, but not for India.’ Sigh. Still nothing changed. Women continued wearing jeans and dancing suggestively at non-Shivaratri, non-Garba events. Union Minister Satyapal Singh weighed in, too, about bridal eligibility and jeans. ‘No boy will marry a girl who comes to mandap in jeans,’ he said, as culture-loving single Indian boys all over the world nodded in vigorous agreement. But when a young mother (accompanying her children) was seen in public, attired not just in jeans, but ripped ones, it took Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat to step up to the culture plate. ‘If such women go out, what kind of message are we giving out to society, to our kids?’ he lamented, looking skywards. ‘It all starts at home. A child who is taught the right culture at home, no matter how modern he becomes, will never fail in life.’ If at all anyone has atoned for their sins in this matter, it’s Akshay Kumar. Back in 2009, when an as yet unenlightened Akshay Kumar was walking the ramp at a fashion show, intoxicated by the hallucinogenic vapours of this corrupting garment, he made his wife, not yet anointed Smt Hasya Haddi, unbutton his jeans in full public view! Look at him today. He is on the cover of Forbes , the second holiest book in our land. He regularly drinks gaumutra by his own admission. And he is producing and starring in Ram Setu . Follow him, ladies, and change. From those evil jeans into nine-yard saris with bulletproof pallus . And declare, in one voice, Messrs Strauss and Davis andolan jeevis .  Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/andolan-jeans/article34174333.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||What’s needling you?||“Guys, not a soul here,” wailed the message on one of my WhatsApp group chats as I was en route to the new Sequel restaurant in Bandra Kurla. “Isn’t that good?” I quickly typed back, adding, “Safe during Covid.” “Not when I’m decked up! I wore my Gucci shoes!” came the reply. Sigh. With Covid-19 cases in Mumbai climbing day by day, dining out is so risky. Going anywhere is fraught with tension. People want to go out, but are weary of seeing crowds. Empty is bad, but full is worse. I love Sequel, which, with its plethora of vegan, organic fare, is amongst the city’s most healthy dining addresses. It clearly has a fan following since Vanika Choudhary, the owner, now has three outposts. The latest edition, which opened at the end of last year, and to which I was headed, has been designed by celebrity architect Ashiesh Shah. I had suggested it not only because it was new but because everyone in our group was on some sort of Ayurveda diet, thanks to Dr Uppoor, the Goa-based doctor who is advising multiple friends. (Sometimes I feel like I belong to a wellness cult.) Upon arriving, I found that my friends had been exaggerating — the place was hardly empty. There were occupied tables and one person at the bar. “They came after we arrived,” explained Gucci Glamazoid, seemingly placated. “And we ordered drinks!” But it’s definitely a buzz kill when you step out to eat only to find municipal authorities turn up to do surprise Covid checks, which is what happened when I went to Bastian, another recently-opened restaurant. The inspectors came to ensure there was only 50% occupancy and that the tables were spaced apart. But they did all this while making the establishment turn off the music. Odd because no scientific study indicates that the virus spreads through music. When it comes to the pandemic, there is no logic. Which is why the world is topsy turvy. Even as much of the world suffers economically comes news that two obscure Singapore-based Tamilians, with no prior history of art collecting, have bought digital art for $69 million! In this instance, most of us can relate to Warren Buffet, who famously said he didn’t invest in technology companies because he couldn’t understand what they did. That analogy applies to NFTs aka Non-Fungible Tokens. A few nights ago, I sat opposite a physics prodigy who tried to explain it all to me, including bitcoins and blockchain. My head hurt at the end of it, and no, it had nothing to do with the wine. Forget auction houses like Christie’s selling crypto-art. Even fast food chains like Taco Bell sold NFTs for $1 to celebrate the return of a potato dish ( Business Insider reports that they are being resold for $3,000). Call me old fashioned but I would much rather track indulgences like jewellery or IT bags that may be equally fungible but are at least tangible. Right now, the ultimate luxury is the vaccine. Not since Botox has a needle generated so much excitement. Given that our roll out has been painfully slow, and Indians are hard wired to jump queues, impatient rich desis of a certain age, and who have residencies and paperwork to prove it, have been hopping over to Dubai, London (prior to the shortage), and even the US to get the jab. People are obviously hush hush about it — come to think of it, isn’t that just like getting Botox? Everyone does it but no one admits it. The foibles of the rich was best summed up by something hilarious forwarded to me by my pal Binita Putcha. She sent advertising whiz Freddy Birdy’s post: “The ultimate Insta cliché would be to get a picture of yourself eating avocado on banana bread getting vaccinated in Business Class with the Maldives below you.” Covid-19 may rob us of our sense of smell and taste, but it can’t steal our laughs.  This fortnightly column tracks the indulgent pursuits of the one-percenters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/whats-needling-you/article34174375.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The widow who wouldn’t cry||There is a constant in Sanya Malhotra’s performances — her impish smile. But the actor has not repeated a type of character in her six films. She has played, among other roles, a young wrestler in Dangal , a quarrelling sister in Pataakha , a shy student in Photograph , and an uncertain girlfriend in her 2020 release, Ludo . Malhotra, it is fair to say, has escaped typecasting. “People used to ask me what kind of roles I would do and I would tell them ‘I want to try everything’. Because I’m not a trained actor, I'll only learn if I do all sorts of roles.” The timing of her entry into Hindi cinema was important, too. Subjects and characters that were offbeat are now mainstream, allowing talented actors like Malhotra to flourish. Pepsi, please? In her upcoming film, Pagglait (a derivative of crazy), she plays a young widow, Sandhya Giri. Her husband has died and she is unable to grieve, so much so that when her mother wails, Sandhya asks her to stop crying. Later, when the mother offers her tea, she asks for Pepsi. When a friend, in the middle of a consolatory hug, tells Sandhya she found out about her husband’s death through her sister’s Facebook post, the latter drily observes, “Yes, the post has 235 comments.” Those close to Sandhya feel she is abnormally normal. Her friend asks, “Why are you behaving like nothing has happened?” Her response: “You know, when I was a kid, we had a cat. She got run over by a car. I cried a lot. And I didn’t eat for three days.” She knows she can feel grief; she just can’t feel it now. Riding solo While Malhotra, 29, has starred in other OTT projects such as Ludo and Shakuntala Devi , Pagglait — written and directed by Umesh Bist, known for films like O Teri  — is the first film in which she plays the sole protagonist. It has a considerably big cast that includes Sayani Gupta, Shruti Sharma, and Ashutosh Rana. But the film revolves around Sandhya. It was a tightrope walk, having to convince the audience she is void of sorrow as well as make them empathise with her. “I doubted if I could do it,” says the actor, adding, “But Umesh and Guneet [Monga, the producer] were convinced that I could pull it off. And I had so many wonderful actors around me. That gave me confidence.” Being Sandhya Bist’s writing helped. While Malhotra says “the script was wonderful”, she did not strictly stick to it. As filming progressed, she gradually accessed the character’s mind. “There was a scene where Sandhya was supposed to cry. But this was the 30th day of the shoot and by then I was familiar with her. So, I felt she wouldn’t cry in that situation. I am grateful that Umesh allowed me to intervene and was open to what Sandhya wanted to tell him.” Malhotra, in a way, became a conduit for Sandhya and Bist. The director agrees. “Sanya didn’t perform; she lived the character,” he says, lauding her subtle performance. “The artist is not attempting comedy ‘in the tea-Pepsi’ scene. She is just trying to catch the right note. [The performance] is like playing an instrument. The tune of a sitar changes, for instance, depending on the emphasis you apply on a note. It’s the same with acting.” Pagglait is now streaming   on Netflix.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Fashion job most wanted: filmmaking||A simple video made a lasting impression at the first digital Lakmé Fashion Week (LFW) show last October. Produced by New Delhi label 11.11/eleven eleven, it showed an artisan’s busy hands up close — spinning raw fibre into yarn, dying it indigo, knitting a sweater. The ASMR experience drew attention not only to the sustainable label’s ethos, but also to how a video can make for innovative storytelling. It highlighted the labour involved for one garment, the expertise, even the tactility of the piece (unexpected in a digital medium). And an NFC (Near Field Communication) button affixed on the sweater merged tech and design — ensuring wearers could virtually see what went into its making. One of the few positives of 2020 was how the pandemic helped boost the digital space. In the world of fashion, one of the biggest industries globally, this meant the growth of the fashion film. What was once looked upon as a BTS (behind the scenes) exercise, especially in India, was evolving for virtual fashion weeks and for social media. The films showcase collections, but are also answering questions: what life do garments have when they get off the runway, what can clothes denote outside of couture? Internationally, filmmakers such as Nick Knight and Gus Van Sant made an impact with their productions for Maison Margiela (an experimental documentary) and Gucci (slice of life films) respectively. Closer home, Indra Joshi’s film for Ekaya, the Banaras handloom brand, explored colour and movement through psychedelic frames, while Pretika Menon addressed migration and assimilation through her film for Gundi Studios. Challenges — such as replicating IRL tactility — are offset by more layered narratives, with sound, imagery and messages. But are fashion films being taken seriously? Shreya Dev Dube, cinematographer for Raw Mango’s LFW film Moomal , told The Voice of Fashion recently that she believes fashion and “serious” filmmaking are worlds apart. “I come from a world of social documentation rooted in realistic cinema; fashion is beautiful but it is still frivolous,” she said. Not everyone agrees. “This space is constantly evolving; there is no one direction,” says Neha Suri of Artfoto Studios. “Fashion films can range from relatable to out-of-the-box formats; it is constantly being defined by the creatives and the viewers collectively.” That said, sometimes it can be a crowded set with the fashion designer, the creative director, the art director and stylist, each offering inputs. Then there is the habit of referencing something from abroad. Gina Narang of the popular modelling and photography agency, A Little Fly (ALF), insists fashion filmmakers can be creative and original. “But you need to give them the time and space to convey their vision,’’ she adds. We speak with five filmmakers on how they are pushing the boundaries.  Inputs fromSurya Praphulla Kumar, Nidhi Adlakhaand   Aparna Narrain   Continued on page 3                                     Indra Joshi|26   Mumbai Joshi’s videos have an electric vibe that comes from creative cinematography and edgy editing. “When I was shooting Gaurav Gupta’s Name is Love Couture 2021 film [at a mill in New Delhi], I was inspired by lights,” he says, recalling that he had just finished reading a piece on Dutch cinematographer Robby Müller’s use of lights. “So I explored how it falls, where it touches, the shadows it creates.” The young filmmaker doesn’t storyboard much; he trusts the mood of the project instead because “so much changes on sets”. For his recent film for Bodice (for the grand finale of FDCI x LFW), the brief was to have fun in chaos. So Joshi says he “moved like a monkey on set” and focussed on projection mapping. “Similar to video mapping and spatial augmented reality, I work with overlays that create a kind of melting effect,” he explains. Having created films for brands such as Yavi, Ekaya, Cord and Koovs, he believes the future of fashion is on screen. “We are running slightly late, but I believe it will grow in India.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/fashion-job-most-wanted-filmmaking/article34174359.ece

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Decoding fractional ownership||The times are changing for the luxury resorts and vacation homes market in India. Previously the exclusive domain of HNIs capable of shelling out huge sums, this market may now attract a new set of buyers with a yen for owning a luxurious beach-facing property or mountain vacation home at a fraction of the total cost. The latest twist to timeshares — a popular concept from the the 1960s — fractional ownership gives a cost-effective option with a lot more bang for the buck. Fractional ownership is already fast catching up across various asset classes, including Grade A commercial spaces and luxury residential real estate. The concept opens doors to middle-income retail investors keen to diversify and set up multiple income channels at lower investment budgets. Various start-ups now use technology to popularise this concept in India after it has already been successfully implemented in Europe and the US. In the West, commercial properties or high-worth destinations and vacation homes are the most popular categories. In the newly-forged post-pandemic world, fractional ownership of such assets can potentially gain popularity for all the right reasons. COVID-19 has left many deep impressions on urban home owners. It is a viable option for occasionally escaping the claustrophobic city and its virus containment areas — or to rent out the home if travel is not possible, with the proceeds being shared among the co-owners. In fact, one of the unique features of fractional ownership is that a property can be used as well as rented out. How does it work? In fractional ownership, multiple investors come together to hold combined ownership of a single asset. Each owns a fraction (or a small percentage) of the property. The ownership can be split among as many investors as desired, thus enabling entry even for those with smaller budgets. Fractional ownerships enable investors to secure a piece of prime property in high-demand city centres or popular vacation destinations. All investors reap a level of benefit proportional to their investment — in terms of rental yield, capital appreciation and, in the case of vacation homes, duration of personal use of the property. The arrangement for the latter usually involves the allocation of property usage rights based on a certain period. Interestingly, the fractional owner is not responsible for the routine upkeep of the property. Abroad, fractional ownership has often proved to be a win-win for hoteliers. The trend is quite vibrant in Western vacation home markets, with resorts pricing their fractional offerings based on factors such as property, location, and amenities. India’s new market Various organised players have already forayed into this business model, with various differentiating factors but fundamentally offering a safe and viable investment opportunity. Besides commercial real estate, fractional ownership in the residential sector is also gaining popularity. In the last few years, luxury property players have started to warm up to this concept with the assistance of established players and specialised start-ups. BRIKitt is one of the leading proptech companies offering fractional ownership within the premium residential and vacation home segments. Similarly, Fracsn, Propertyshare, Strata, Myre Capital, Assetmonk, Grip and RealX also operate in the fractional ownership space. These companies amalgamate real estate, finance and technology and create a platform where retail investors can participate in a property — with a foreseeable exit strategy. Typically, these platforms take care of several critical aspects of investing — from discovery to even liquidation as and when needed. Moreover, they help investors with all preliminary processes such as due diligence, research related to the best options, procurement of the title document of the asset, and overall asset and peer group comparison. Fractional ownership platforms attract investors interested in not just building future income (in case of commercial or even residential properties) but also in accessing the property (resorts or vacation homes) personally for a specific period — from a few weeks in a year. In a situation wherein a pandemic has eroded most of the charms of inner-city life and raised the aspiration to escape it, especially with the benefit of working from anywhere, the appeal of such a model cannot be understated. Fractional ownership vs. REITs REITs in India are, so far, limited to commercial properties and are yet to make inroads into the residential segment. In fractional ownership of commercial properties, multiple investors hold combined ownership of a single asset — while in REITs, investors own a portfolio that is invested in several assets. In fractional ownership, investors can cherry-pick the assets; in REITs, individual selection of invested assets is not possible as there are multiple assets in one portfolio. Both REITs and fractional ownership are fairly new in India, but the former is a tried-and-tested risk-free investment option across major developed nations. In India too, they have received a very favourable response since their formal launch in 2019 and are yielding very favourable returns. A word of caution While various start-ups are operating in this space, the fact is that fractional ownership is still very much a new game in town. There are no really established players, and specific rules and regulations specific to this segment are yet to be formulated and announced. Also, there are no standardised processes to depend on. At both the entry and exit levels, multiple investors can give rise to disputes regarding the division of usage of the property, expenses incurred on the property, etc. For a vacation home, there may be an overlap of usage of the property while the division of the upkeep and maintenance expenses needs to be carefully arrived at. Individual defaults also tend to be higher in a challenged economy, and this affects all co-owners. Nevertheless, fractional ownership is an exciting emerging asset class. Amidst the volatility of the stock markets and low interest rates on FDs, it provides an opportunity for smaller retail investors to participate in valuable commercial or even residential assets. As proper processes are eventually put in place, it will become a very viable investment model soon.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Mumbai-Pune Expressway: the new development lifeline||Areport published by Oxford Economics states that India will have most of the world’s fastest-growing cities between 2019 and 2035. Strangely, Pune is not included in the list of 17 cities where Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai are mentioned prominently. But perhaps this is not surprising since the research is based solely on GDP growth. The fact is that Pune is very much among the fastest-growing cities in India and even the COVID-19 pandemic has not changed this fact. The city’s economy generates a lot of jobs which attract people from across the country. Pune remains a dominant employment generator in India because it is driven by three major industries — manufacturing, IT/ITeS and services. These jobs attract people from other cities and rural areas, which in turn creates demand for housing. The only fitting response to this demand is real estate development. When it comes to defining the growth parameters of a city, while it is definitely important, GDP is not the first aspect which comes to mind. The way most of us define growth is in terms of geographical expansion. The reason why cities expand is due to the inward migration of people from other parts of the country.  Inward migration Trends indicate that about 25-30 Indians are migrating to Indian cities every minute. Pune and Mumbai draw the most inward migration in the state of Maharashtra, which is the third largest Indian state in terms of area. Pune’s city limits have been constantly expanding to accommodate this migration. Mumbai, on the other hand, has very little capacity for expansion. If you have been wondering why Pune’s developers kept building more housing projects even though the market has been slow over the last 2-3 years, the main reason is inward migration. Absorption may have been slow because of the disruptions caused by policy interventions like RERA, but the demand for housing in Pune is growing constantly. In reality, developers are building for the city’s future, not its present. Expressway to growth The biggest thrust of Pune’s development has been towards the financial capital of Mumbai. These two cities in many ways have a shared economy, causing a constant shuttling of goods, people and resources between them every day. Also, Pune sees a lot of housing demand from Mumbaikars who have business interests in Pune. The city’s persistent growth towards Mumbai has been made possible by the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, which has reduced the travel time between the two cities to less than 95 km. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway has been the single-largest catalyst for economic exchange between the two cities. No other highway in India has opened up as many opportunities for the economic growth of two cities. Not surprisingly, areas closest to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway have been witnessing a real estate boom. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has already announced its intention to open up 1,000 acres along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway for development. Builders with historic land holdings in these locations are now actively developing them and seeing a tremendous response. Adjoining areas Moreover, areas adjoining the Expressway have become hotbeds for real estate development. Employees not only from the nearby MIDC manufacturing belt but also from Hinjewadi IT Park have responded to the opportunity of owning homes in areas like Ravet and Punavale. Now, even the serene location of Urse, located right along the Expressway, is seeing real estate development in the form of a large integrated township. According to Anarock, Urse (within a 3 km radius) witnessed new launches of more than 7,100 units between 2013 and 2020 with average property prices presently hovering at Rs. 4,100 per sq. ft. In comparison to 2015, average property prices here have increased by more than 11%. Trends further indicate that out of the total new supply since 2013, a whopping 75% is already sold out while over 65% is ready-to-move-in. Besides affordable prices and future growth prospects, housing demand has so far been driven by people working in nearby industrial areas. The locality is also home to few logistics and warehousing options because of its proximity to Mumbai-Pune Highway. However, the profile of Urse is changing with the arrival of a luxury golf-themed township. In the future, the area is bound to see more high-end real estate options being made available. Gurugram-based realty portal zricks.com confirms that Urse is attracting many investors due to the availability of various different property options in the locality. The presence of social infrastructure facilities such as transportation, education, healthcare, shopping and entertainment facilities in and around the area is an added advantage. As a result, Urse is seeing robust real estate growth and this trend will pick up pace as Pune and Mumbai grow closer to each other via the Expressway. Beyond numbers Economic performance or GDP of a city is obviously an important factor for geographic expansion, but only because GDP is the result of the city's ability to generate jobs, which in turn generate demand for real estate. Pune has been able to expand to accommodate the increasing demand. This is the essence of the growth of a city. This pattern of expansion has also been seen in the National Capital Region (NCR). However, there is a massive problem of oversupply in Delhi-NCR because it has expanded away from — rather than towards — its main employment hubs. While Pune is expanding in many directions, the most critical direction is obviously towards Mumbai. The important task at hand now is to open up more and more areas along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway for good quality real estate developments. This process is underway and is constantly bringing the two cities closer together.

The realisation of the value freshwater holds is evident as early as 10,000 years ago, during the first known permanent urban settlement of Jericho (a Palestinian city in the West Bank)which was located near springs and other freshwater sources. We all know that our existence is highly dependent on the freshwater we have available. However, over the last century, our consumption rate of the resource has gone up rapidly. As the world’s population continues to increase, we can expect the demand for freshwater to further rise. This will exacerbate water stress and the risk of water scarcity given the fact that the global freshwater availability is limited. Only 3% of the earth’s water is freshwater out of which less than 1% is accessible for our use. In our densely populated cities, the level of available freshwater is decreasing and the amount of waste water that we are letting out is increasing, which ends up polluting whatever available freshwater we are left with. We need to be mindful about the amount of water we use and play our part to ensure this resource lasts us for a long time. There are a few measures we can all take to reduce or minimise domestic water use. Here are a few: Reduce our water consumption by using fixtures and taps that allow for a lower water flow rate  Treat our wastewater and reuse the treated water as appropriate  Ensure 100% of the rainwater (which is fresh, clean) that falls on our property is being collected for use or being percolated into the ground to increase the ground freshwater table.  Install water meters as they provide us with a measure of our actual consumption of water. An awareness of how much water we are actually consuming is one of the first steps in ensuring mindful water use. Other than water used for domestic purposes, there is a lot of freshwater utilised in other sectors, construction being one of them. One way to minimise water usage during construction is to avoid unnecessary plastering. The use of a plaster is mostly seen as an additional layer to cover up imperfections in masonry work. If the joints in the external masonry can be pointed well using waterproofing compounds, a plaster cover can be avoided. Such exposed masonry walls speak of the history of a building and also stand testimony to the skill involved in masonry coursework. This is just one of several ways in which water use in construction can be reduced. A mindful and judicious use of freshwater without taking its availability for granted will go a long way in ensuring water security.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Building a stronger, greener future||Material cost accounts for roughly two-thirds of the total cost of a typical building. Construction involves the preponderant use of materials such as sand, stone (as aggregates), soil for bricks and limestone for cement. All these are in short supply and the Indian construction industry is likely to face serious material supply problems if the predicted growth in demand continues. Supply bottlenecks are already starting to impact prices and construction schedules in most parts of the country. The need is therefore being felt to find alternative materials and bring about resource efficiency and a low life cycle cost of buildings, which can also ensure better health of and productivity from inmates. There appeared to be consensus on these points among experts who gathered at the recently-concluded ‘Concrete: Panorama and Deminar’, a two-day international seminar organised by the Indian Concrete Institute, Bengaluru, in association with BMS College of Engineering. The event was aimed at finding new materials and applying innovative technologies to meet the challenges posed by the growing resource crunch and to bring down the carbon footprint from the construction industry. In numbers Setting the tone for the seminar, Shailesh Kumar Agrawal, Executive Director, Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC), said building activities consume 40% of energy, 25% of water and 40% of resources and contribute towards 50% of air pollution, 42% of GHG (greenhouse gases) emissions, 50% of water pollution and 48% of solid waste generation. He said the Council, set up under the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA), has shortlisted 54 new construction systems with the objective of adopting alternative materials and building techniques. These will simultaneously improve the pace and quality of work currently taken up under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) which is working to achieve the goal of ‘Housing for All by 2022’, he said. The new systems fall under six broad categories of precast construction, hot and cold form steel construction, large formwork system, sandwich panel construction, and factory-made prefabricated system. They are being showcased by the MoHUA at six centres in the country — Indore, Rajkot, Chennai, Ranchi, Agartala, and Lucknow — under ‘Light House Projects’ (LHP) scheme under which 1,000 houses are being built in each of these cities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the projects on January 1 this year. The Prime Minister has given a call for these projects to be taken up as incubation centres by faculty members as well as students of engineering colleges, technical universities, professionals, engineers, planners, and architects. The urban effect According to Agrawal, 31% of people were already living in cities and towns in a fast urbanising India which is projected to have 590 million and 815 million people by 2030 and 2050 respectively. “In order to provide shelter and ensure a decent living standard for them, India has to build 600 to 800 million square metres of urban space every year till 2030 which roughly translates to the addition of a city like Chicago every year,” he said. India is the second largest producer of cement in the world with the production currently pegged at 335 million tonnes (2020 figures) annually, which accounts for 8% of the total world production. “Cement production has quadrupled between 1996 and 2010 and India faces the prospect of running out of limestone (the key ingredient in cement production) by 2060 at the current growth rate.” Hari Prasad Rao, Head-Technical Services, JSW Cements, said the company has come up with Portland Slag Cement (PSC), one of the most eco-friendly varieties, by using slag, which is obtained from blast furnaces during the separation of iron from iron ore. He said slag comes from the company’s own steel plants. “PSC is currently produced at plants in Vijayanagar (Karnataka), Nandyal (Andhra Pradesh), Dolvi (Maharashtra) and Salboni (West Bengal). Though it has been a late entrant into the sector, with an annual production of 14 million tonnes, it is fast becoming a force to reckon with. Besides being a green product, the PSC enhances durability, is less vulnerable to cracking, and improves resistance to acid, chlorides and sulphate and fires,” he pointed out. Slag could be a replacement for river sand which is mined from the river beds damaging the ecosystem, he added. GH Basavaraj, MD, Chetana Exponential Technologies, introduced EC-BC-DC (External Core-Beamless Ceiling-Dry Construction) technologies which, he said, could be the direction for design and construction of buildings. He pointed out that the technologies have found application in a 50-storey residential tower in Bengaluru. The seminar drew a large number of experts from the industry and teaching faculty. LR Manjunath, Chairman, ICI; Aviram Sharma; R.L. Ramesh, Secretary, ICI; and Muralidhara, Vice-Principal, BMS College of Engineering, also spoke at the seminar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/building-a-stronger-greener-future/article34174387.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Encroachment of a car park||I bought a flat from a developer and its cost included a covered car parking slot. While registering the construction agreement, the apartment’s plan and a plan of the car park was also registered. In the latter, a specific number was earmarked for the parking and the flat was handed over to me with these details. The flat remains unoccupied and, due to the pandemic, I did not visit it for the last year. When I recently paid a visit, I noticed that my car park has been converted into two areas that have been sold to a new owner. The site manager is offering me another car park which is not acceptable to me. How do I proceed? Can place a police complaint against the builder and the current occupier? Will TNRERA be helpful? Visakamurthysanthanam Chennai If the earmarked car parking slot is allotted to you under the document, you will have a right over the same and no other person will be entitled to sell, convey or transfer it without your consent. If the project has been registered under RERA, you can file a complaint before the authority constituted under the Act. Else, you can approach the consumer redressal forum. I am planning to buy a house in Noombal, Chennai. The total plot size is 1,400 sq.ft. and the builder has constructed two individual houses on this land. I plan to buy one of these houses (700 sq.ft.). As per the patta, the total land size is 1,076 sq. ft. but as per the latest Field Measurement Book (FMB) sketch, it measures 1,400 sq.ft. The builder says that if I were to purchase this house, the patta will be as per the latest FMB sketch. Do you suggest I go ahead with the deal? Will I get a patta for 700 sq.ft. or do I need to ask the builder to make the necessary changes in the current patta?  Sundarram Chennai If the current patta is erroneous, the same has to be corrected in the name of the present owner. The process would be to survey the land, compare the same with FMB sketch and come to a conclusion as to the correct extent of land. If two houses are built on a single approval, each of the buyers would only get an undivided share of land and not a defined extent of 700 sq.ft., as stated in your query. Both house owners can jointly get a patta for the actual extent of land as per survey report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/encroachment-of-a-car-park/article34174391.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The residential recovery||Residential sales in Q1 (Jan-March) 2021 recovered to more than 90% of the volumes witnessed in Q1 2020 (pre-Covid) across the top seven cities, according to the recently-released JLL Q1 Residential Market Update. Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Pune surpassed the sales volumes of Q1 2020. Overall sales increased by 17% on a sequential basis. Importantly, sales either improved or stayed at similar levels (in Q1 2021 when compared to Q4 2020) in a majority of the residential markets under consideration. Mumbai has consistently been the largest contributor to sales in the last four quarters. In Q1 2021, Mumbai accounted for 23% of the sales, followed by Delhi NCR with a share of 21%. However, Kolkata saw the maximum increase in sales activity in Q1 2021 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020. “The sustained growth in sales presents clear signs of demand and buyer confidence coming back to the market. This has been on the back of historically low home loan interest rates, stagnant residential prices, lucrative payment plans and freebies from developers and government incentives such as the reduction of stamp duty in states like Maharashtra and Karnataka (for affordable housing). The ease of lockdown restrictions and the commencement of the vaccination drive have further aided in bringing buyers back to the market,” says Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head Research and REIS, JLL. The first quarter of 2021 witnessed new launches of 33,953 residential units, a jump of 27% over the last quarter of 2020. Hyderabad continued to dominate new launches and accounted for more than a fourth of the overall launches during the quarter. Bengaluru, which formed more than 16% of the new launches followed. The markets of Delhi NCR and Chennai witnessed a substantial increase in launch activity during the quarter. New launches are still at 84% when compared to the pre-Covid levels of Q1 2020. Developers across the markets under review remain focused on the completion of under construction projects and clearing their existing inventory. Development focus on mid and affordable segments continues in Q1 2021 with 69% of the new launches in the sub Rs. 10 million categories. In the coming quarters, the focus on these price segments is expected to continue with developers trying to reap the benefits of strong pent up demand in these segments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/the-residential-recovery/article34174389.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Andolan jeans||As always, Dear Reader, I bring you yet another exclusive story that very few people (other than me) know about. It begins with a hush-hush conversation that took place in the early 1870s in the city of San Francisco between two gentlemen (and I use the term loosely), a certain Jacob W Davis and a Levi Strauss. ‘You know,’ said Strauss. ‘In the 21st century, the ancient, all-knowing land of India will become a superpower. And we can’t let that happen, can we?’ ‘ Oy gevalt , we can’t,’ responded Davis, popping a crisp golden-brown latke into his mouth. ‘And I know exactly how to stop them.’ ‘How? How?’ exclaimed Strauss, clapping his hands. ‘Let us invent jeans!’ said Davis. The two evil villains then took large sips of their Manischewitz, and roared with laughter like a Jewish Joginder and a Yiddish Yama. And thus began the slow erosion of our pristinely protected, Alok Nath-curated, jean-free culture. Mind you, far-sighted men of our land saw what was coming — like they always do when it comes to the welfare of their sisters and mothers. And they kept warning us from time to time about the pernicious effect this evil garment would have on our demure, god-fearing naris were it left unchecked. For example, a few years ago, legendary singer KJ Yesudas was among the first to raise an alarm about this toxic garment’s evil influence on our hitherto obedient mol és . ‘Women should not wear jeans and trouble others,’ he said at a public gathering to rousing applause. ‘Whatever should be covered, should be covered. We appreciate what’s concealed, and that’s our culture.’ But did we pay heed? No, sir. Our betis continued falling into the diabolical low-rise denim trap. Around the same time, then Urban Administration & Development Minister Babulal Gaur fearlessly highlighted the evil nexus between alcohol, dancing and jeans. ‘Women in foreign countries wear jeans and T-shirts, dance with other men and even drink liquor,’ he said. ‘But that is their culture. It’s good for them, but not for India.’ Sigh. Still nothing changed. Women continued wearing jeans and dancing suggestively at non-Shivaratri, non-Garba events. Union Minister Satyapal Singh weighed in, too, about bridal eligibility and jeans. ‘No boy will marry a girl who comes to mandap in jeans,’ he said, as culture-loving single Indian boys all over the world nodded in vigorous agreement. But when a young mother (accompanying her children) was seen in public, attired not just in jeans, but ripped ones, it took Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat to step up to the culture plate. ‘If such women go out, what kind of message are we giving out to society, to our kids?’ he lamented, looking skywards. ‘It all starts at home. A child who is taught the right culture at home, no matter how modern he becomes, will never fail in life.’ If at all anyone has atoned for their sins in this matter, it’s Akshay Kumar. Back in 2009, when an as yet unenlightened Akshay Kumar was walking the ramp at a fashion show, intoxicated by the hallucinogenic vapours of this corrupting garment, he made his wife, not yet anointed Smt Hasya Haddi, unbutton his jeans in full public view! Look at him today. He is on the cover of Forbes , the second holiest book in our land. He regularly drinks gaumutra by his own admission. And he is producing and starring in Ram Setu . Follow him, ladies, and change. From those evil jeans into nine-yard saris with bulletproof pallus . And declare, in one voice, Messrs Strauss and Davis andolan jeevis .  Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/andolan-jeans/article34175017.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Now streaming What readers want||Bollywood, sex, rich and famous weddings, controversy, Sabyasachi, royalty, saris, self-affirmation, what to buy, eat, where to go. That’s what (Indian) readers want. From lifestyle magazines. Broken down in different elements, of course. Celebrity curiosity will keep shifting. As it has from little Taimur Ali Khan (to the great relief of reporters on his beat) to Priyanka Chopra Jonas’s book and beauty line. It will desert Kangana Ranaut’s theatrics for actor Sonu Sood’s new roles. When airport looks were grounded, COVID-19 masks took over. Currently, if sex is what Bombay Begums are having on Netflix, last month we had the Sex and The City reboot to fret about. A new controversy on tattered jeans replaces an old one on Tandav . Sprinkle some highly searched words like sustainability, depression, Mumbai police, TRP scam, race and religion, throw in spring/summer fashion trends and you have “content”. A good story, unlike this one, does not start with answers. It first builds context. The reader, however, may not care. For, a decade into what is described as the news revolution — ever since our laurels were about page views, likes and “going viral” — unless we tumble out some magnetic words to noose you in less than 30 seconds, dear reader, we will lose you to the next click. The next bait. But this is sheer exaggeration, you argue. Right. That’s exactly the point. “Simplify, then exaggerate,” as Geoffrey Crowther, former editor of The Economist would tell his editorial team. Now we do this inadvertently because we have no idea what you may find “epic” tomorrow morning. Last week, my article Who k illed the e xclusive in these pages, brought back a stack of feedback. Most came from the PR industry. Though a jewel of an observation from a reader raised the bar. “The algorithm that decodes what matters most (for readers presumably) is missing,” it said. This piece attempts to go into the circuitry of daily “content” compared to stories that promise quality, depth, fairness and accuracy, the hallmarks of good journalism. Does the reader know or care for the difference?  The ‘not serious’ tag  The pervasive assumption is that most readers prefer Priyanka Chopra Jonas’s starry frocks, to why it took two months for Naudeep Kaur of Mazdoor Adhikar Sangathan to get bail after her arrest at the farmers’ protest in Delhi. Metaphorically and literally. Some of you also remind us lifestyle writers that we have no business comparing our work with serious stories. You expect us to stay in the “back of the book”. On the other hand, social media analysis builds on the contention that followers swarm around a “Twitter faceoff” or a trending Facebook story. The journalist is completely incidental. People follow us if our ideas are “endorsed” by influencers and fashion is featured on filmstars. We must follow your digital instincts — which increasingly point towards click bait — for you to follow us. So instead of information, insight and analysis, we must toil over catchy, SEO-friendly headlines. This is creating Instagram-pro content for social media spectators. For those who do not read. As a digital editor who pores over metrics (consumption data, reader analysis and the like) every week, I can tell you that this many fangled debate — whether readers determine the fate of journalism or whether proprietors of publications are the real culprits given falling revenues — is a chicken and egg one. Do you even care if what you read is PR mandated or an authentically reported story? Does it bother you that a shopping list in a fashion magazine is paid for by the brands being recommended? Probably not because it brings you well-curated information anyway.   Finding r elevance   In the maddening spin between paid stories, “networked” content and Bollywood obsession, the digital reader (not the social media skater) is only partially understood. The lifestyle journalist even less. While I have no statistics to counter that Bollywood drives attention, because it indeed does, there is enough data to prove that stories on Indian handlooms and crafts with photographs from the field perform equally well. This has been a consistent take back in my last two jobs. A photo story almost always does better than written pieces — says something about diminishing attention spans? It surprises me that one of my stories, The Kalakshetra s ari as a c ultural d estination , is the most read of all my work over the last three years at The Voice of Fashion . It is not a “trending” subject. But readers like stories on woven saris, wedding leh e ngas and new web series where clothes play big roles. Bridgerton , Queen’s Gambit , Masaba , Emily in Paris are instances. Data also supports that a majority engage with stories that concern the Northeast and Kashmir, including themes of strife, gender politics and resilience. This narrows the intellectual gap pointed out between print and digital readers. Those who consume content that intersects between fashion, art, culture, art, society, dress and identity fall in the 25-35 age group. Hyderabad and Bengaluru are ahead of Delhi yet behind Mumbai in the consumption of unusual content around fashion. Men and women are almost equally interested in fashion and design writing. ‘Where can I buy this or that’ is a failsafe tactic especially if it is about a beauty product but so is anything to do with designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee as many editors will tell you.   A l ifestyle w riter’s t rap   To return to a sore issue, the reader bias against lifestyle journalists is perhaps disproportionate. First, most such writing is whittled down to fashion, celebrity lives, cars and restaurants. This gets labelled as elitist, which is true to some extent as we omit interviewing millennials among Dalit and OBC communities about dating, depression or shopping, We never ask adult children of artisans for their views on lipsticks, blue jeans, pre-wedding shoots or smart phones. All the same, during the pandemic, lifestyle reporting brought out the underlying fragility of fashion retail in India. Of migrants employed in manufacturing units and export houses. Fashion journalism followed up promises of artisan funds. The cadence changed. The migrant, the rebel, the gender fluid influencer, the body positive model became our protagonists. Block chain technology, worker welfare, water and waste in manufacturing and circular fashion that optimises resources and innovation took the lead because readers respond to them. That’s why when someone asks me who your reader is, I often say, the one who I can read.  Shefalee Vasudev is editor of  The Voice of Fashion. This is a follow-up to last week’s article on how lifestyle journalism has changed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/now-streaming-what-readers-want/article34174922.ece
27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Centella’s beauty mark||Repair and heal are the new buzzwords in beauty. As lasers, retinols, acids, and microneedling become increasingly popular, there is high demand for products that calm irritated skin. Centella asiatica, prized for its wound-healing ability, tops the list, being the hero ingredient in cica creams prescribed by dermatologists to restore the skin’s barrier. But while the ingredient is extremely popular in modern beauty routines, its benefits go beyond just skincare. It is an ancient herb, mentioned in texts such as theSushruta Samhita, dating back to around 6 century BCE. Interestingly, it is prized for its soothing abilities in both modern and traditional medicine, even though the applications are different. Ayurvedic roots In Ayurveda, centella asiatica is known asgotu kolaormandukaparniand is prescribed to comfort the mind. “It improves cognitive function, reduces stress and anxiety, and purifies the blood,” says Dr Gunvant Hari Yeola, ayurvedic physician and principal of the DY Patil College of Ayurved & Research Centre in Pune. “It’s often confused withbrahmior seen as its substitute, though it is cooler in nature.” Indeed, if you read the fine print of mostbrahmisupplements or teas, you’ll find that the ingredient is centella asiatica, not bacopa monnieri, the scientific name forbrahmi. In the last century, scientists isolated active ingredients from the herb for topical application, which propelled it to its current position of a skin soother. “In the 1990s, the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research, run by the famous Professor Albert Rakoto Ratsimamanga, developed medicines based on local plants, the most emblematic of which is Madecassol, a wound-healing product made from this plant,” says Delphine Bouvier, Head Open Innovation, Sustainable Platform, L’Oreal. The cosmetic giant is now harvesting it in Madagascar to produce a variety of ‘green centella’ that guarantees traceability, fair wages, better extraction (thus consuming very little energy), and generating lesser greenhouse emissions. A pinch will do I can personally attest to this herb’s wound healing abilities as I use cica cream after an overzealous tretinoin application or a microneedling facial. If my job didn’t entail trying new skincare then I would only have three products in my beauty cabinet — tretinoin to refine, cica cream to soothe, and sunscreen to protect. Strangely enough, when I mix raw centella powder into a DIY mask it has an opposite, stimulating effect, which gives the skin a gentle flush. This means that you only need to use the tiniest amount (about a pinch) in a face mask. It just shows that despite its popularity, we are only just discovering its wide scope of benefits. Centella asiatica has become very popular also because it is antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, says dermatologist Dr Simal Soin, founder of New Delhi’s Aayna Clinic. “We have realised that inflammation impacts everything — it is the root cause of both metabolic disease and skin ageing. Therefore centella has become more relevant than ever before.” Dr Soin prescribes the herb for both internal and external benefits. “If someone asks me for an overall supplement I give them something with centella, if someone has rosacea or does laser, I give them a cica cream.” Because the ingredient is healing in nature, she says that it can be used safely by all skin types. After Korea, the world Though the ingredient has been around for decades, it became popular being part of several cult Korean products including Dr Jart’s Cicapair and the now notorious Purito Centella Green Level Sunscreen, currently under the scanner for its dubious SPF. Even though the ingredient is native to Asia, Korean skincare popularised it around the world. The fact that companies such as L’Oreal are investing in centella is testament to its healing potential and will help preserve this ancient herb for futuristic cosmetic applications.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The widow who wouldn’t cry||There is a constant in Sanya Malhotra’s performances — her impish smile. But the actor has not repeated a type of character in her six films. She has played, among other roles, a young wrestler in Dangal , a quarrelling sister in Pataakha , a shy student in Photograph , and an uncertain girlfriend in her 2020 release, Ludo . Malhotra, it is fair to say, has escaped typecasting. “People used to ask me what kind of roles I would do and I would tell them ‘I want to try everything’. Because I’m not a trained actor, I'll only learn if I do all sorts of roles.” The timing of her entry into Hindi cinema was important, too. Subjects and characters that were offbeat are now mainstream, allowing talented actors like Malhotra to flourish. Pepsi, please? In her upcoming film, Pagglait (a derivative of crazy), she plays a young widow, Sandhya Giri. Her husband has died and she is unable to grieve, so much so that when her mother wails, Sandhya asks her to stop crying. Later, when the mother offers her tea, she asks for Pepsi. When a friend, in the middle of a consolatory hug, tells Sandhya she found out about her husband’s death through her sister’s Facebook post, the latter drily observes, “Yes, the post has 235 comments.” Those close to Sandhya feel she is abnormally normal. Her friend asks, “Why are you behaving like nothing has happened?” Her response: “You know, when I was a kid, we had a cat. She got run over by a car. I cried a lot. And I didn't eat for three days.” She knows she can feel grief; she just can’t feel it now. Riding solo While Malhotra, 29, has starred in other OTT projects such as Ludo and Shakuntala Devi , Pagglait — written and directed by Umesh Bist, known for films like O Teri and Hero — is the first film in which she plays the sole protagonist. It has a considerably big cast that includes Sayani Gupta, Shruti Sharma, and Ashutosh Rana. But the film revolves around Sandhya. It was a tightrope walk, having to convince the audience she is void of sorrow as well as make them empathise with her. “I doubted if I could do it,” says the actor, adding, “But Umesh and Guneet [Monga, the producer] were convinced that I could pull it off. And I had so many wonderful actors around me. That gave me confidence.” Being Sandhya Bist’s writing helped. While Malhotra says “the script was wonderful”, she did not strictly stick to it. As filming progressed, she gradually accessed the character’s mind. “There was a scene where Sandhya was supposed to cry. But this was the 30th day of the shoot and by then I was familiar with her. So, I felt she wouldn’t cry in that situation. I am grateful that Umesh allowed me to intervene and was open to what Sandhya wanted to tell him.” Malhotra, in a way, became a conduit for Sandhya and Bist. The director agrees. “Sanya didn’t perform; she lived the character,” he says, lauding her subtle performance. “The artist is not attempting comedy ‘in the tea-Pepsi’ scene. She is just trying to catch the right note. [The performance] is like playing an instrument. The tune of a sitar changes, for instance, depending on the emphasis you apply on a note. It’s the same with acting. The pauses, breaths… if you can concentrate on and control these things, the emotions can significantly change.” Pagglait is now streaming   on Netflix.

27 March 2021||March 27 2021 00:00 IST,||What’s needling you?||“Guys, not a soul here,” wailed the message on one of my WhatsApp group chats as I was en route to the new Sequel restaurant in BKC. “Isn’t that good?” I quickly typed back, adding, “Safe during Covid.” “Not when I’m decked up! I wore my Gucci shoes!” came the reply. Sigh. With COVID-19 cases in Mumbai climbing day by day, dining out is so risky. Going anywhere is fraught with tension. People want to go out, but are weary of seeing crowds. Empty is bad, but full is worse. I love Sequel, which, with its plethora of vegan, organic fare, is amongst the city’s most healthy dining addresses. It clearly has a fan following since Vanika Choudhary, the owner, now has three outposts. The latest edition, which opened at the end of last year, and to which I was headed, has been designed by celebrity architect Ashiesh Shah. I had suggested it not only because it was new but because everyone in our group was on some sort of Ayurveda diet, thanks to Dr. Uppoor, the Goa-based doctor who is advising multiple friends. (Sometimes I feel like I belong to a wellness cult.) Upon arriving, I found that my friends had been exaggerating — the place was hardly empty. There were occupied tables and one person at the bar. “They came after we arrived,” explained Gucci Glamazoid, seemingly placated. “And we ordered drinks!” But it’s definitely a buzz kill when you step out to eat only to find municipal authorities turn up to do surprise COVID-19 checks, which is what happened when I went to Bastian, another recently-opened restaurant. The inspectors came to ensure there was only 50% occupancy and that the tables were spaced apart. But they did all this while making the establishment turn off the music. Odd because no scientific study indicates that the virus spreads through music. When it comes to the pandemic, there is no logic. Which is why the world is topsy turvy. Even as much of the world suffers economically comes news that two obscure Singapore-based Tamilians, with no prior history of art collecting, have bought digital art for $69 million! In this instance, most of us can relate to Warren Buffet, who famously said he didn’t invest in technology companies because he couldn’t understand what they did. That analogy applies to NFTs aka Non-Fungible Tokens. A few nights ago, I sat opposite a physics prodigy who tried to explain it all to me, including bitcoins and blockchain. My head hurt at the end of it, and no, it had nothing to do with the wine. Forget auction houses like Christie’s selling crypto-art. Even fast food chains like Taco Bell sold NFTs for $1 to celebrate the return of a potato dish ( Business Insider reports that they are being resold for $3,000). Call me old fashioned but I would much rather track indulgences like jewellery or IT bags that may be equally fungible but are at least tangible. Right now, the ultimate luxury is the vaccine. Not since Botox has a needle generated so much excitement. Given that our roll out has been painfully slow, and Indians are hard wired to jump queues, impatient rich desis of a certain age, and who have residencies and paperwork to prove it, have been hopping over to Dubai, London (prior to the shortage), and even the US to get the jab. People are obviously hush hush about it — come to think of it, isn’t that just like getting Botox? Everyone does it but no one admits it. The foibles of the rich was best summed up by something hilarious forwarded to me by my pal Binita Putcha. She sent advertising whiz Freddy Birdy’s post: “The ultimate Insta cliché would be to get a picture of yourself eating avocado on banana bread getting vaccinated in Business Class with the Maldives below you.” Covid-19 may rob us of our sense of smell and taste, but it can’t steal our laughs.  This fortnightly column tracks the indulgent pursuits of the one-percenters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/whats-needling-you/article34174921.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers block entry points at Singhu||Protesting farmers at the Singhu border on Friday blocked the entry points to the site, which earlier saw traffic movement, to observe Bharat Bandh. Allow essential services They also made repeated appeals from the main stage to not block ambulances and essential services during the period. Four months into the agitation against Centre’s new farm laws, the protesters recounted the hurdles they had to cross, including tear gas, water cannons and trenches, before reaching Delhi’s borders. The farmers who have been camping at the Capital’s borders since November 26, demanding a legal guarantee of minimum support price and a repeal of the three farm laws passed by the Centre last year, reiterated that they would not vacate the protest sites till their demands are met. Kulwant Singh, 70, from Punjab’s Gurdaspur district, said: “Our demands are the same as they were on the day we started our journey to Delhi. We had to overcome water cannons, lathis, trenches and tear gas to reach the border. In the first couple of days, we did not even have proper food to eat. Farmers have overcome so much to reach this point and now it is a given that they are not returning without the laws being repealed.” He said that the movement was getting bigger by the day. “Our leaders are now spreading the word across the country and asking people to not vote for BJP as the party only goes against the interests of common people. There is sympathy on the international level as well,” he added. Harjit Singh, a farmer from Fatehgarh Sahib district, added: “It’s been four months and even we want to return to our villages. But that can only happen if the laws repealed. It’s high time the government listens to us else we will continue to wait here. Four months later we have nothing more to say.” 120 days on... Stating that the Centre had continued to neglect the ones who feed the country, Balwant Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Moga, said: “It has been 120 days and instead of paying heed to our demands, those in the government have only called us names. There have been 11 meetings with the government but none of the Ministers have been able to give us any concrete answers.” Claiming that big movements had the power to overthrow governments, Mr. Singh added, “Ideally a ruler should be worried about the interests of the people, but we have a ruler who is not bothered. People of the country, across professions, have stood by us. The Prime Minister should realise that things are not as bad yet and there is still time to rectify and repeal the laws. If needed, we are ready to march to the Parliament as well.” Heavy police deployment was seen at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur border in the view of nation-wide protest called by the farmers on Friday. ‘No violence reported’ “We have deployed extra police force at borders to avoid any law-and-order situation. There was no incident of violence reported,” said an officer. In the morning, Delhi Police had closed both carriageways of NH-24 passing through Ghazipur border in view of Bharat Bandh. The restrictions remained till the late evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmers-block-entry-points-at-singhu/article34174728.ece

27 March 2021||GURUGRAM,||Traffic hit as protesting farmers block tracks, roads in Haryana||The rail and road traffic in Haryana was hit on Friday with farmers, including women in large numbers, holding blockades at multiple points across the State in response to the call for “Bharat Bandh” from Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a coalition of farmer unions. The protests, however, remained peaceful, said the police. The 12-hour “Bharat Bandh” in protest against the three farm laws, among other demands, also coinciding with the completion of four months for the sit-in agitation along the Delhi borders evoked strong response across the State. The protesters came out early in the morning to hold blockades at railway tracks and roads, including State and national highways. The agitating farmers sat on the railway tracks at eleven points across the State affecting the movement of around a hundred trains, a Haryana Railway Police officer said. Women protesters It included the blockades at the railway stations in Sirsa and Bahadurgarh, Fatehgarh in Charkhi Dadri, Jualni village in Jind and Bhiwani-Rohtak railway track at Kaluwas village in Bhiwani. Besides, Hisar, Yamunanagar and Fatehabad were also impacted. In Julani, women sat on the railway tracks in large numbers to stop the traffic. “The farmers, Khaps, workers, traders and government employees came together to make ‘Bharat Bandh’ a success. Besides blockades on the railway tracks, the protesters also sat on the roads at several points in Charkhi Dadri including Loharu Chowk, Badhra, Kadma and Chirya Mor,” said local farmer leader Raju Maan. Director General of Police, Haryana, Manoj Yadava, told The Hindu that the bandh was “fairly strong” with around half-a-dozen blockades in each district on an average. Two national highways, Delhi-Hisar and Delhi-Ambala, were also affected, but mostly the blockades were on the internal roads and the State highways. “It was incident free. The protesters held peaceful demonstrations. The police also had strong presence on the ground,” said Mr. Yadava. ‘Bandh successful’ Haryana All-India Kisan Sabha vice-president Inderjit Singh claimed that the bandh was a “success” and the number of blockades on the roads and railway tracks were many more than the earlier occasions. The farmers holding a sit-in agitation at Palwal blocked the Delhi-Agra highway for around five hours. Farmers also blocked the Delhi-Jaipur highway in Rewari causing traffic snarls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/traffic-hit-as-protesting-farmers-block-tracks-roads-in-haryana/article34174742.ece
27 March 2021||Patna,||Bandh paralyses life in Bihar||Train services and road traffic were disrupted at several places across Bihar during the bandh call given by the Opposition Rahstriya Janata Dal to protest the farm laws, unemployment and the forceful eviction of Opposition legislators agitating against the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, from the State Assembly on March 23. The bandh call was supported by the Congress and the three Left parties, the CPI, CPI(M) and CPI (Marxist-Leninist). Bandh supporters blocked the national highways and disrupted train movement at several places like Vaishali, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Aurangabad, Jamui, Lakhisarai, Siwan, Bhojpur and Patna. CPI-ML supporters disrupted movement of vehicles on the Patna-Ara road. The party’s State secretary Kunal called the Bihar police bill a “Black Law” to suppress the voice of anyone who would dare to speak out against the government headed by Nitish Kumar. “We’re also protesting against government’s anti-democratic and autocratic style of functioning,” he told media persons as he led a procession of bandh supporters.  Vital bridge blocked RJD leaders and supports blocked the Mahatma Gandhi Setu bridge, which connects Patna with north Bihar, for several hours causing a long traffic jam. “We’ve called for the bandh to protest the police brutality against Opposition members of the Assembly who were exercising their democratic right and agitating against the new Bihar police Bill. The police misconduct against the Assembly members, I believe, was not on the directions of the Speaker, but the Chief Minister,” alleged Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, who was participating in the funeral of his uncle Mahavir Rai, who died on Thursday. Mr. Rai was the elder brother of Mr. Yadav’s father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav. Opposition legislators had, earlier, demanded an apology from the Chief Minister. “Until he apologises, we may not attend Assembly,” they said. Business establishments and offices in Patna, however, remained open during the bandh amid heavy police deployment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rjd-bandh-paralyses-normal-life-in-bihar/article34174743.ece

Imposing directions on people of Gurugram, District Magistrate Yash Garg, in the exercise of the powers vested in him under various sections of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, ordered that public celebrations, gatherings and congregations would not be allowed during Holi at public places, grounds, markets, religious places, malls, etc. from March 26 to 29. The Police Commissioner, Sub-Divisional Magistrates, Municipal Corporation and Committees will be responsible for the implementation of the direction, said the order.

27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Three of a family trapped in building fire rescued in GK||In a joint operation, the Delhi Police and the Fire Department rescued three of a family trapped in a building fire in south Delhi’s Greater Kailash-1 on Friday morning, said officials. Two policemen climbed to the third floor of the building to rescue the three persons — Amit Sudhakar [56], his wife Shalini [48], and mother Sudha [87]. A senior officer said they got a call at 6.55 a.m. that a fire had broken out at second and third floors of the building. DCP (South) Atul Kumar said: “The balcony, in which the family was trapped, was covered with iron grills.” Greater Kailash police station SHO Ritesh Sharma said a member of an RWA, Lalit, called him and informed him about the fire. The fire department said they got the call at 6.53 a.m. and immediately reached the spot. The fire started at the second floor of the building and soon reached the upper floor, Mr. Sharma said. “After the call, I immediately reached the spot with my team. We saw that a massive fire had broken out on the second floor of the building. We checked and found that there was no person on it and also on the lower floors of the building. Only one caretaker was on the second floor, but he had left the building timely. However, we were informed that some persons were shouting for help from the back side of the building,” Mr. Sharma said. We then saw a family of three trapped in a balcony on the third floor. “We first asked them to stand on the opposite side in the balcony from where the smoke was coming. There were grills at every floor. The first major issue was an electricity pole near the building. There was only two feet gap between the pole and the building, and the personnel passed through the narrow area to climb up. Head constable Munni Lal and constable Sandeep climbed to the third floor of the building,” he said. Mr. Sharma added that other personnel too wanted to climb but “we feared that the grill might fall due to weight of too many persons”. “Lal and Sandeep tried to break the grills but could not succeed,” he said, adding that after the the fire tenders doused the blaze, the three persons were rescued from near the stairs. The reason for blaze unclear, said officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/three-of-a-family-trapped-in-building-fire-rescued-in-gk/article34174725.ece

27 March 2021||JAIPUR,||BJP names candidates for bypolls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sought to play an emotional card by fielding former Minister Kiran Maheshwari’s daughter from the Rajsamand seat, which is among the three Assembly constituencies going to by-elections in Rajasthan on April 17. The Opposition party released the list of its candidates late on Thursday night.  Veterans, novice The BJP’s candidates for bypolls are a mix of veterans and a novice, as the party has fielded former Ministers Ratanlal Jat from Sahara (Bhilwara) and Khemaram Meghwal from Sujangarh (Churu). Rajsamand is the only constituency among the three where the BJP candidate had won in the 2018 Assembly election. Rajsamand candidate Deepti Maheshwari, 34, who expects to win riding on the sympathy wave, is the daughter of Ms. Kiran Maheshwari, a three-time MLA, former MP and former State Minister, who died due to COVID-19 infection in November last year. The late BJP leader served as the party’s national secretary in 2011 and national vice-president in 2013. The BJP has opted for veteran leader Khemaram Meghwal, 55, from Sujangarh, which fell vacant following the death of Congress MLA and Minister Bhanwarlal Meghwal. Mr. Khemaram has been a two-time MLA from Sujangarh as well as a Minister of State, having a three-decade-long experience in politics in the State’s Shekhawati region. Two-time MLA Ratanlal Jat, 73, who was the Higher Education Minister in the Bhairon Singh Shekhawat government, is also an experienced leader. He was elected an MLA twice from Sahara and was later appointed Zila Pramukh of Bhilwara and chairperson of the Rajasthan State Seeds Corporation. He is at present a member of the BJP’s State working committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-names-candidates-for-rajasthan-bypolls/article34174744.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. honours 98 schoolteachers, principals for their contribution||Ninety-eight schoolteachers and principals were honoured for their contribution to education at the State Teachers Award ceremony organised by the Delhi government on Friday. Speaking at the event, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia implored teachers to rethink strategies on assessment and learning. “We need to build correct approaches and develop 360-degree assessments for our students. The premise of rote-learning evaluated through an end-of-year 3-hour exam is an injustice to our students and teachers,” he said. He added that the challenge is to eliminate rote-learning practices, and this is why govt. is at the juncture of establishing the Delhi Education Board. “Our Delhi Education Board will develop continuous and comprehensive assessments augmenting a holistic learner profile of students and enabling teachers to refine their instruction,” Mr. Sisodia said. He said that the education system was badly hit by the pandemic as school closures left everyone clueless. “Our teachers and principals really stepped up to the occasion and showed unparalleled grit and determination in responding to this situation,” Mr. Sisodia said. Of all those who were honoured, 69 teachers were from Delhi government schools, 18 from private and 11 from civic bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-honours-98-schoolteachers-principals-for-their-contribution/article34174724.ece

A Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde has on Thursday ordered a 24-hour status quo on a plea filed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) alleging that Haryana would cut 20% of its water supply to Delhi due to repair work in one of its canals. On Friday, the court extended the status quo order till April 6. It said the petition would be take up on April 6. Appearing for the Board, senior advocate A.M. Singhvi and advocate Gautam Narayan, had urged the court to order Haryana to postpone the work. Senior advocate Shyam Divan, for Haryana, continued to deny the Board’s allegations. “The full and complete supply is being given to Delhi... not a drop less. A series of wrong statements are being made,” Mr. Divan had objected vehemently in the previous hearing held on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sc-extends-status-quo-on-yamuna-water-supply/article34174714.ece
27 March 2021||TITABOR (ASSAM),||In Titabor, fight to fill the gap left by Tarun Gogoi||The aura of former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi lingers beyond his portrait adorning the wall of Rajiv Bhavan, the local Congress office, at Titabor station Tiniali. But his legacy is struggling to be alive at Thengal Kachari Cultural Centre and Museum – a landmark – that he had initiated and his successor Sarbananda Sonowal had inaugurated in December 2020. Thengal Kachari is a Scheduled Tribe and Titabor is the administrative headquarters of the Thengal Kachari Autonomous Council the BJP wrested from the Congress in December 2016. Titabar, the Assembly constituency, has been a Congress stronghold since 2001. Dip Gogoi won it that year but vacated it for brother Tarun Gogoi. The BJP sniffs a chance in this Congress bastion for a few reasons. The absence of the former CM is one, the Congress not fielding his son and MP Gaurav Gogoi and opting for the inexperienced Bhaskar Jyoti Baruah is another. Alliance with AIUDF The BJP is also banking on the perception that the alliance with Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front would harm the prospects of the Congress in the Assamese dominated eastern Assam, more so in Titabar where the late Mr. Gogoi defied the “Modi wave” of 2016. “The story could have been different had Gaurav Gogoi contested,” local teacher Imtiaz Hussain said. The Congress, hopeful of weaning the tea plantation workers away from the BJP with enhanced daily wage guarantee, is confident that the son not taking the father’s space will make no difference. “My relationship with the people of Titabor is beyond politics,” Gaurav Gogoi had tweeted, seeking votes for Mr. Baruah. “The Congress shattered the myth of dynastic politics by fielding me. I hope the people’s blessings and the goodwill that late Tarun Gogoi enjoyed will see me through. Besides, I am a local candidate,” Mr. Baruah told The Hindu . His Assam Jatiya Parishad rival Sailendra Kumar Hazarika has also pinned hopes on his “local” status. Both appear to be hinting at the BJP candidate, “non-local” Hemanta Kalita, who is from Jorhat town. But the BJP believes that a slew of development projects and Mr. Kalita’s “lockdown generosity” in 2020 would stand him in good stead. “I have been acquainted with the constituency since winning in 1996 for the AGP,” he said. The fourth candidate in the fray is Dilip Gogoi, an independent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/in-titabor-fight-to-fill-the-gap-left-by-tarun-gogoi/article34174746.ece
27 March 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi Cabinet gives green signal for 300 electric buses||The Delhi Cabinet on Friday approved a proposal for the engagement of 300 Low-Floor Fully Electric Air Conditioned buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) under the Centre’s ‘Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India [FAME] Phase-II’ Scheme. The initial tender called by the DTC in October 2019 was not found responsive and, therefore, the process was cancelled, the government stated. A fresh tender called in June 2020 too was also cancelled as the rates were not found competitive. Then a tender was called the third time in December 2020 and found to be responsive and competitive. The engagement of electric buses in the DTC fleet on the OPEX Model is a major policy shift as regards the operation of buses by the DTC. So far, the DTC has been operating only buses owned by it. Electric buses are being inducted into the DTC for the first time, the government said. The induction of 300 electric buses by the DTC at a time is one of the largest engagement of electric buses by any State government or State Transport Undertaking (STU).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-cabinet-gives-green-signal-for-300-electric-buses/article34174713.ece
27 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||PhD scholar, 4 others nabbed for duping 500 of Rs. 7.5 crore||A PhD scholar and his accomplices have been arrested for allegedly duping over 500 people of Rs. 7.5 crore on the pretext of providing jobs with leading multi-national companies, the police said on Friday. DCP (Cyber Crime) Anyesh Roy said the accused have been identified as Manoj Hota (44), Ashish Ranjan (26), Abhishek Kumar (27), Sonu Rawal (29) and Shaik Pintu Ali (28). The crime came to the fore when a person from Uttam Nagar approached the police, complaining that he has been cheated of Rs. 20 lakh by people who posed as representatives of a recruitment agency and assured him of a job in an MNC. During investigation, the money trail was examined and the location of the accused was traced following which a raid was conducted at an illegal call centre in Gurugram, an officer said, adding that the accused were then nabbed. It was revealed that Hota has a PhD with specialisation in Compensation Management from a reputed university. He also used to work as a visiting faculty at various colleges and later started his own college but incurred losses and had to pay debt. He came in touch with Ranjan and Kumar — both engineers. The accused created fake websites and email IDs in the name of various MNCs for the scam. Further probe revealed that Ranjan was the head of the call centre and Kumar was the ‘star caller’, who used to convince people that he was calling on behalf of MNCs. Rawal and Ali are graduates and used to be the first persons to call the victims, the police added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/phd-scholar-4-others-nabbed-for-duping-500-of-rs-75-crore/article34174722.ece
