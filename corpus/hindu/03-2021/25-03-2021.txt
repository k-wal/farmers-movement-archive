25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Justice N.V. Ramana set to take over as 48th CJI||Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde has recommended Justice N.V. Ramana, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, as the next top judge. The recommendation to the government was followed by the publication of a short statement on Wednesday, informing that a complaint sent to the CJI by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy against Justice Ramana was dismissed under an in-house procedure after due consideration. “A complaint dated October 6, 2020, sent by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh to the Supreme Court was dealt with under the In-House Procedure and the same, on due consideration, stands dismissed. It be noted that all the matters dealt with under the In-House Procedure being strictly confidential in nature, are not liable to be made public,” the statement, published on the Supreme Court website, said. Cases against Ministers Mr. Reddy had complained that Justice Ramana was influencing the Andhra Pradesh High Court judiciary to destabilise his government. The complaint was sent shortly after a Bench led by Justice Ramana started hearing and fast-tracking hundreds of criminal cases against Ministers, legislators and politicians pending in trial courts across the country. In an affidavit filed with the election nomination papers in 2019, Mr. Reddy had declared that there were 31 criminal cases pending against him with the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate and different police stations in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Justice Ramana is now set to take over as the 48th Chief Justice of India from April 24. Chief Justice Bobde handed over a copy of his letter of recommendation to Justice Ramana on Wednesday after sending it to the government. The Centre had recently asked Chief Justice Bobde, who is retiring on April 23, to initiate the transition process to the top judicial office. Justice Ramana would be the CJI till August 26, 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/justice-nv-ramana-set-to-take-over-as-48th-cji/article34156307.ece
25 March 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra creates new record in daily surge: 31,855 cases||Maharashtra touched another new high with a single-day surge of 31,855 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, its highest since the pandemic began last year, pushing its active case tally to 2,47,299 — more than 65% of the country’s total active cases. While Pune continued to maintain the dubious distinction of being the worst-afflicted district in the country and the State, Mumbai city reported more than 5,000 cases — its highest single-day spike recorded till date. Recoveries constituted less than half the case surge with just 15,098 patients being discharged in the last 24 hours. The State’s recovery rate has now dipped to 88.21%. As many as 95 deaths took the fatality toll to 53,684. While the total case tally has reached 25,64,881, the cumulative recoveries stand at 22,62,593. “Of a total 1,87,25,307 laboratory samples tested thus far, 25,64,881 (with the case positivity rising to 13.70%) have returned positive with over 1.41 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said. No Holi in Pune Pune district reported its highest-ever surge of 6,600 new cases to take its total case tally to 4,87,966. In keeping with the alarming spike, district authorities have banned all celebrations for the Holi festival. Mumbai recorded 5,190 new cases, taking its total tally to 3,74,641 of whom 29,395 are active. Six fatalities took the city’s death toll to 11,610. Amid fears among citizens of an imminent lockdown, Mumbai civic body officials said that no such move was being mooted as yet. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, said: “Currently, there is no talk of a lockdown being planned in Mumbai, as it will merely bring all activities to a grinding halt. Despite the steep rise in cases, we can sustain this spike owing to our available medical infrastructure. We are going to ramp up the city’s bed capacity, scale up testing, and accelerate the vaccination drive.” Lockdown in Beed Beed in Marathwada became the latest among districts in Maharashtra to go under a lockdown. The district administration has declared a 10-day lockdown from March 26 to April 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-creates-new-record-in-daily-surge-31855-cases/article34156824.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Double mutant’ virus variant found||A unique “double mutant” coronavirus variant — with a combination of mutations not seen anywhere else in the world — has been found in India, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday. However, it is still to be established if this has any role to play in increased infectivity or in making COVID-19 more severe. Genome sequencing of a section of virus samples by a consortium of 10 laboratories across the country, called the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), revealed the presence of two mutations, E484Q and L452R together, in at least 200 virus samples from Maharashtra, as well as a handful in Delhi, Punjab and Gujarat. Mutations in the virus per se are not surprising but specific mutations that help the virus evolve to thwart vaccines or the immune system or are linked to a spike in cases or in disease severity are causes of concern. While the two mutations have been individually identified in other variants of SARS-CoV-2 globally and have been associated with a reduction in vaccine efficacy, their combined effect and biological implications have not yet been understood. In the days ahead, the INSACOG will submit details of this variant to a global repository called GISAID and, if it merits, classify it as a “variant of concern” (VOC). India has not yet conducted studies on how vaccine efficacy is influenced by variants, except for limited laboratory trials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/double-mutant-virus-variant-found/article34156305.ece
25 March 2021||Shiv Sahay Singh Kolkata,||Violence over death of local BJP leader||Violence erupted in Dinhata in West Bengal’s Cooch Behar district after a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader was found dead on Wednesday morning. The body of BJP Dinhata Town mandal president Amit Sarkar was found at local veterinary hospital, triggering massive protests. The BJP supporters targeted the police with stones and also blocked roads in the area. The police also resorted to use of force and fired tear gas shells. The BJP supporters also attacked the Trinamool Congress office. Cooch Behar MP and BJP candidate from Dinhata Nisith Pramanik said that Sarkar was killed in a similar manner in which several BJP supporters, including Hemtabad MLA Debendra Nath Roy, were killed. “Everyday we are losing our party supporters. How long will this continue?” Mr. Pramanik asked. The BJP leadership blamed the Trinamool Congress for the death. Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, who was in north Bengal earlier in the day said that the commission has asked for a report on the issue from the issue. Local TMC MLA Udayan Guha staged a dharna outside the police station to protest against the attacks on the party’s offices. The BJP leadership including party observer in West Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya said such attacks will not deter the BJP from achieving its objective of forming the government in West Bengal “Pishi’s KHELA HOBE! Amit Sarkar, Dinhata town mondal president was hanged to death by TMC goons just 72 hours before the first phase of polling. People of Bengal to take a decisive step against this blood thirsty govt who is responsible for more than 130 BJP worker’s murder,” BJP West Bengal unit tweeted from its official Twitter handle. This is the second death in the past few days in poll-bound Bengal. On March 22, a seven-year-old boy died when a crude bomb exploded in Bardhaman town. Purkayashta removed In another development the Election Commision of India on Wednesday removed Surajit Kar Purakayastha from the post of State Security Advisor. The post was created by the Mamata Banerjee government and Mr. Purakayastha was appointed after his retirement as Director-General of Police.

25 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Row over Ministers’ remarks on 10.5% quota for Vanniyars||With two Ministers terming the 10.5% internal quota for Vanniyars as a “provisional arrangement”, a debate has been triggered if the AIADMK is changing its tune on the issue in the light of a reported backlash from other communities. The quota was provided within the 20% reservation for the Most Backward Classes through legislation in the last Assembly session of the current regime. In the midst of the Assembly election, Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar and Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar had sought to dub it as a provisional arrangement. While Mr. Udhayakumar was reported to have stated that the latest reservation scheme would “last only six months”, Mr. Jayakumar said this was subject to the proposed caste-wise census. Asked for a response, Mr. Udhyakumar told The Hindu on Wednesday that what he had said was that “within six months, a caste-wise census would be carried out, based on which, reservation would be provided to all communities proportionately”. To a question whether his clarification had been issued on account of “disenchantment” among other castes, the Revenue Minister replied that social justice had been one of the core principles of the Dravidian movement. As a sequel to this, the MBCs had been enjoying 20% quota. “All communities may have expectations. It is our duty to give a proper explanation,” he said. Mr. Jayakumar said the provisional nature of the 10.5% quota scheme for Vanniyars was made clear even at the time of tabling a bill in the Assembly. “Let us wait for the completion of the proposed survey.” K.P. Munusamy, AIADMK deputy coordinator, referred to his party’s manifesto, wherein it had been stated that “all castes would get proper reservation based on the caste census”. Did the clarification come because of the row over the quota? “It all depends on how you perceive it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/row-over-ministers-remarks-on-105-quota-for-vanniyars/article34156464.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||Supreme Court flags concern over misuse of electoral bonds||The Supreme Court on Wednesday flagged its concern that political parties could misuse crores of rupees received as donations through electoral bonds to bankroll violent protests or even terror. The court asked the government whether there was any “control” over how these donations were used by the political parties. “Suppose there is a political party, which wants to buy electoral bonds and finance a protest. What is the control of the government on how the money is put to use? A party receives electoral bonds worth Rs. 100 crore — what is the guarantee that they will use the entire funds for political purpose alone and not for terrorism or other activities? Funds can be misused… We would like you, as the government, to look into that aspect. They [parties] can use the funds for activities outside their political agenda… along with election expenditure, you [a party] can also start a violent protest,” Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench, addressed Attorney General K.K. Venugopal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/supreme-court-flags-concern-over-misuse-of-electoral-bonds/article34156300.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Excluding India from Moscow talks a mistake’||India should have been included by the China-Russia-U.S. “troika” that met in Moscow with regional stakeholders, including Pakistan, last week, said Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Haneef Atmar during a three-day visit to India, where he discussed a new peace plan proposed by President Ashraf Ghani. According to the plan, for which Mr. Atmar sought New Delhi’s support, Mr. Ghani said he was prepared to hold early Presidential elections in Afghanistan, if the Taliban agreed to a ceasefire and to take part in those elections. The plan could set the Ghani government at odds with the Biden administration as it runs counter to a recent U.S. proposal for an interim government in Afghanistan that would include the Taliban as a negotiated settlement, not elections. “[Mr. Ghani’s proposal] is what the Afghan people want. And it is the legitimate way for Afghan free political will to be expressed,” Mr. Atmar said in an interview to The Hindu , adding that the U.S.’s promise to pull out all “foreign” troops later this year had set the conditions for the plan, which would give the militants a “legitimate way to participate in the polity and governance of Afghanistan”. The Afghanistan government is expected to unveil its full proposal during the upcoming intra-Afghan talks due to be held in Istanbul in the beginning of April. The talks are a part of the U.S.’s latest push for intra-Afghan talks with the Taliban that appear to have stalled in Doha, and was outlined in a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to President Ghani. While the U.S. has also proposed future regional talks, led by the UN, to engage all regional stakeholders, including India, the most recent talks held in Moscow on March 18 by the so-called “troika”, with envoys from Pakistan, Qatar, Afghan and Taliban leadership, had not invited the Indian government, which Mr. Atmar called a “mistake”. “We made it clear [to the organisers] that peace and stability in our region and regional connectivity and prosperity cannot happen without India,” he said. Mr. Atmar said there was no proposal to request Indian troops in Afghanistan, nor had his government asked India to directly open a dialogue with the Taliban. He said that Afghanistan “appreciates” India’s position that it would engage the Taliban “if the Taliban come and join a legitimate government of Afghanistan”. In a statement at the end of Mr. Atmar’s visit, issued on Wednesday, the Ministry of External Affairs did not refer directly to the Ghani proposal, but said that India remains committed to “a peaceful, sovereign, stable and inclusive Afghanistan where the rights of all sections of the society are protected within a democratic constitutional framework”. Asked if he had discussed recent steps in India-Pakistan engagement with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Mr. Atmar said that India-Afghanistan talks focused only on “bilateral issues”, which included regional and international cooperation. However, he added that he welcomed any dialogue between them, and hoped that India’s “responsible gestures are met with reciprocity” from Pakistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/excluding-india-from-moscow-talks-a-mistake-afghan-minister/article34156352.ece
25 March 2021||CHENNAI,||HC upset with BJP for ‘accessing’ voter details||The Madras High Court on Wednesday took serious note of a complaint that the Puducherry unit of the BJP had accessed voters’ phone numbers linked to their Aadhaar cards and had been misusing the data for electioneering. It directed the Election Commission of India to file a report by Friday on the steps taken by it to prevent such acts. Passing interim orders on a public interest litigation petition filed by A. Anand, president of the Puducherry State committee of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy wrote: “A matter of serious concern has been reported by the petitioner that a prominent political party apparently has access to personal records of citizens to undertake a political campaign.”  ‘Don’t pass the buck’ On ECI counsel Niranjan Rajagopalan’s submission that it had forwarded the petitioner’s complaint to the cybercrime cell, the Bench said: “It will not do for the Election Commission to pass the buck in this case and say the cybercrime division is conducting an investigation. When the Commission is up and about in all other matters and asserts its primacy and authority, it has to look into this allegation immediately and with the degree of seriousness that it deserves.” In his affidavit, Mr. Anand, a law graduate, said voters in Puducherry, Mahe and Yanam had been receiving messages on their mobile phones with a link to an invitation for joining booth-level WhatsApp groups created by the BJP. A click on the link makes the voter a part of the WhatsApp group that had been created for the voters of the booth where he/she is supposed to vote in the Assembly election. When the petitioner probed to find the source from where the party could have obtained the mobile phone numbers that had not been disclosed in the electoral list, he stumbled upon the fact that all the messages were being sent only to those numbers which had been linked with Aadhaar. He also claimed that no such messages had been sent to phone numbers that were not linked with Aadhaar. He feared the party might use the phone numbers even to bribe voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-upset-with-bjp-for-accessing-voter-details/article34156442.ece

A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R. Subhash Reddy asked Mr. Singh, who was represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, to approach the Bombay High Court with his plea for investigation by an independent agency. Mr. Rohatgi said Mr. Singh would move the High Court in the afternoon itself as the “matter was too serious”. “The parties in this case were hunky-dory for a long time. Now they have fallen apart and this has come up. I agree it is serious, but High Court can deal with it,” Justice Kaul reacted. Mr. Singh, who was shunted out to the Home Guards Department, said his transfer order arrived “immediately after” he complained to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior leaders about the “corrupt malpractices” of Mr. Deshmukh. “The entire State is rocked.

25 March 2021||FARIDABAD,||Two accused held guilty in Nikita murder case||The prime accused in the Nikita Tomar murder case, Tosif and his friend Rihan, were held guilty by the District and Sessions Court here on Wednesday. The third accused, Ajrudeen, was acquitted. The judgment in the sensational murder case came almost five months after Nikita, 20, was shot point-blank outside Aggarwal College in Ballabgarh on October 26 last year. The quantum of sentence will be announced on March 26. Pronouncing the verdict, Additional Sessions Judge Sartaj Baswana held Tosif and Rihan guilty on charges of murder and criminal conspiracy, among others, under the Indian Penal Code. Tosif was also separately held guilty under the Arms Act. His uncle Arjudeen, accused of supplying the weapon of offence, was let off, said Public Prosecutor Sunil Kumar Parmar. Nikita’s father Moolchand Tomar said the verdict had given him hope that justice would be done in the case. Death sentence demand “The real justice to Nikita will be done when the court would sentence her murderers to death,” said Mr. Tomar. He said his lawyers, Sanjeev Jain and Adal Singh Rawat, would go through the verdict and make an appeal against the acquittal of the third accused, if need be. The prosecution had produced three eyewitnesses, including Nikita’s friend accompanying her at the time of the murder, and the CCTV footage of the incident. Nikita was coming out of the college with her friend when Tosif shot her and fled in a car with Rihan. The murder led to huge public outrage and the Haryana government, in its wake, announced to promulgate a law on “love jihad”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-accused-held-guilty-in-nikita-murder-case/article34156504.ece

25 March 2021||MANGALURU,||Court sends man to jail for causing the death of autorickshaw driver||Principal District and Sessions Judge B. Muralidhara Pai on Tuesday sentenced Aneesh John (37) of Bikarnakatta to three years simple imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 1,000 on finding him guilty of causing the death of an autorickshaw driver and injuring two other autorickshaw drivers after ramming his car against a row of autorickshaws at Ambedkar Circle here in 2017. According to a charge-sheet, John, who was then running a spa in a luxury hotel in the city, consumed alcohol on the night of August 6, 2017, and was driving a hatchback car with his friend T.A. Mathew. After approaching the Ambedkar Circle from Bunts Hostel Circle at 10.45 p.m., John drove straight instead of taking a left turn towards Balmatta Circle. The car rammed against the autorickshaws parked outside KMC Hospital. Autorickshaw driver Praveen M.A. (21), a native of Madikeri, died on the spot. Two other drivers Ashok Pascal D’Souza and Jagadish were injured. Fearing assault by the on-lookers, Mathew, who was also injured, ran away from the spot and got himself admitted at a private hospital in Falnir. Police Inspectors Shantaram and Suresh Kumar investigated the case and filed the charge-sheet against John for offences under Sections 304 (Part 2) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 338 (Whoever causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life) of the Indian Penal Code. Prosecutors B. Shekar Shetty and Raju Poojary Bannadi examined a total of 17 witnesses, including Mathew, who deposed in court about John continuing to drive in an inebriated state despite being warned of drastic consequences for his action. Complainant Nishanth K.N., who was among the onlookers at the spot, was also examined. Apart from sentencing John for the offence under Section 304 (Part 2), the judge sentenced him to simple imprisonment for one year and imposed a fine of Rs. 1,000 for an offence under Section 338. Both sentences will run concurrently, the judge said. The judge asked District Legal Services Authority to consider awarding compensation to the legal representatives of the deceased autorickshaw driver Praveen and also the injured autorickshaw driver Ashok Pascal D’Souza.

Pune (43,590 cases), Nagpur (33,160), Mumbai (26,599), Thane (22,513) and Nashik (15,710) in Maharashtra and Jalandhar (92,629), SAS Nagar (2,561), Ludhiana (2,167), Patiala (2,064) and Hoshiarpur (1,833) in Punjab are the districts registering the highest numbers. “Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh are also areas which are seeing a surge. While COVID protocol needs to be followed, we also urge greater private partnership to ensure faster and wider coverage of the vulnerable population,” he said. Mr. Bhushan said 88% of the COVID-19 deaths in India was of those 45 and above, and the expanded vaccination cover was aimed at protecting the most vulnerable. “The way forward in this early phase of the second wave is test, mask and vaccination,” Balram Bharagava, Head, Indian Council of Medical Research, said. He said the vaccines available with India protected against the U.K. and Brazilian variant, while research was on about their effectiveness against the South African variant. Health workers Telangana, Chandigarh, Nagaland and Punjab have low vaccination coverage of healthcare workers, the Ministry said.

25 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||NDA promises jobs to all families||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led NDA manifesto released on Wednesday leaned heavily on populist measures targeted at low-income families. It reaffirmed the alliance’s core commitment to nationalistic politics. Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar unveiled the declaration. The manifesto promised employment for at least one member in each family. An increased social welfare pension of Rs. 3,500 a month, free housing, piped drinking water and power for the poor are on the cards. Five acres of land to deprived SC/ST families, free laptop for high school students, the promise of a hunger-free Kerala, six free cooking gas cylinders for BPL families, a monthly medical grant of Rs. 5,000 to in-patients from BPL households, travel concession for senior citizens and fair wages are the other highlights. Health front The BPL families would receive medical assistance up to Rs. 5 lakh under the Ayushman Bharath scheme. The NDA would open Jana Oushadhi centres in all panchayats. It also promised an AIIMS centre in Kerala and upgrading district hospitals and medical colleges in the State to speciality and super-speciality centres. The NDA promised to be a bulwark against the global Islamist threat and terrorism. It pledged a State law against Love Jihad. It vowed to free temple administration from political control and hand the institutions over to collectives of devotees. The coalition promised to target terrorism, anti-national organisations and end political violence in Kerala for good. The manifesto seemed to hark back to the principles of “integral humanism” propounded by the Hindu right-wing idealogue Deenadayal Upadhyaya. The manifesto promised to transform panchayats to gram swaraj moored to self-sufficiency in food production, housing, drinking water supply and hygiene. Namo food joints would serve breakfast (Rs. 10), lunch (Rs. 20) and dinner (Rs. 10) in all panchayats. Infrastructure The NDA vowed enhanced rural road, internet and power connectivity, electric crematoria and garbage disposal units in villages and rapid re-skilling of rural youth to meet the demand of the global economy. A six-lane highway linking Kaliakkavila in the south to Manjeswaram in the north would open up the State’s hinterlands for development. Motels would dot the freeway. New airports in Idukki, Wayanad and Sabarimala, development of minor ports, a new road parallel to the Thamarassery Ghat in Wayanad, trams for urban centres, development of water transport are other election pledges. The NDA said it would revitalise the State’s agriculture sector and make KSRTC operations financially viable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nda-promises-jobs-in-all-families/article34156218.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||GST: ‘No discretion, only formula’||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha on Thursday that compensation to States under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for the financial year 2017-18 and 2018-19 was not pending with the Centre. “GST compensation has been paid to States for 2017-18, 2018-19, nothing is pending. Prior to COVID-19, every compensation to States has been paid. The unutilised contribution of 2017-18 and 2018-19 has been carried forward and utilised in 2019-20 and 2020-21. Over Rs. 2,17,000 crore is the GST compensation due for 2020-21 [till January]. The compensation will be released in March, Rs. 30,000 crore will go to States. There is no discretion in GST, it is as per formula,” she said. She sidestepped questions raised by the Opposition regarding amendments made to the Life Insurance of India (LIC) Act through the Finance Bill in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. The Bill seeks to amend 27 out of 49 Sections of the LIC Act, 1956. One of the amendments proposes that the Centre will hold at least 75% stake in state-controlled LIC for the next five years and will continue to hold at least 51% after that period. Commotion in House The Finance Bill was passed amid commotion in the Rajya Sabha as Trinamool Congress members sparred with the Finance Minister over various issues, including compensation under the GST to West Bengal. Jairam Ramesh of Congress said many Acts were being amended through the Finance Bill. He said India needed many LICs and when it was going to be a listed company, “foreign firms will own part of LIC.” Neeraj Dangi of the Congress said the country’s economy was being handed over to capitalists. Responding to the debate on the Finance Bill that lasted more than five hours, Ms. Sitharaman said the 14th Finance Commission (around 2014-15) recommended devolution to States and the Centre in the ratio of 42:58 compared to the earlier 32:68 ratio which naturally resulted in slashing down of Centrally run schemes. Reading out a statement in Bengali, the Finance Minister said, “Centre wants to implement Aysuhman Bharat Yojana in West Bengal, but the State government is not allowing. You may have a better scheme. What is the problem if Modi gives additional one crore rupees?” she asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-discretion-in-gst-says-nirmala/article34156238.ece
25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||A grounding in civil liberties||Many years before he began his journey, which will eventually see him being sworn in as the 48th Chief Justice of India, Nuthalapti Venkata Ramana undertook an arduous journey by truck with Rs. 10 in his pocket. The journey was to the home of his maternal aunt. The year was 1975. The young man had heeded his father’s advice to stay away from their agrarian home at Ponnavaram village after word spread that the government was going to proclaim Emergency. The father feared that the police would arrest his son, who had never hid his passion for civil liberties. “In hindsight, I wish my father had given me some more money,” Justice N.V. Ramana said, while recounting the incident recently. Justice Ramana said excesses such as the Emergency impact generations. In January 2020, a Bench led by Justice Ramana ripped the veil of secrecy shrouding months of restrictions imposed in Jammu and Kashmir. The Bench made it mandatory for the government to publish each and every one of its orders that crippled the fundamental freedoms of over 7 million Kashmiri people following the abrogation of Article 370. The Bench held that a right cannot be used against itself. The extensive reach of the Internet cannot be cited as a reason to restrict the right. “Freedom of speech and expression includes the right to disseminate information to as wide a section of the population as possible,” Justice Ramana observed in the judgment. Part of many decisions Justice Ramana, as Supreme Court judge, has been part of various decisions ranging from electoral issues to rights of women to bringing the Chief Justice of India’s office within the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI). In 2019, a five-judge Bench, of which Justice Ramana was a member, declared the CJI’s office as a public authority accountable under the RTI to provide information sought in public interest. However, Justice Ramana, in a separate opinion, said “RTI should not be used as a tool of surveillance”. Paternalistic notion A Bench led by Justice Ramana, in a recent judgment, criticised the paternalistic notion that homemakers neither work nor contribute anything of economic value to the household. Justice Ramana’s judgment in the Karnataka MLAs’ disqualification case said it was time to “reconsider strengthening certain aspects of the Tenth Schedule”. The verdict said that horse-trading political parties and partisan Speakers were denying citizens a stable government. In his speech at a Madras Bar Association function amid the controversy surrounding the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister’s letter to the CJI, Justice Ramana highlighted the need to “hold on to principles and be fearless in decisions”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-grounding-in-civil-liberties/article34156243.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||Closure to plea against Justice Ramana||The Supreme Court’s dismissal of Andhra Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s complaint against the Supreme Court judge Justice N.V. Ramana in an in-house procedure comes a few months after Attorney-General K. K. Venugopal declined consent to a plea to initiate contempt action against Mr. Reddy. The top law officer and constitutional authority has, however, said it was “open” for the court to initiate suo motu contempt against the Chief Minister. A few months ago, in November, the Attorney-General had declined permission to a Supreme Court lawyer, advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, to initiate contempt proceedings against the Chief Minister for his October 6 letter of complaint. Mr. Venugopal had then maintained that the Chief Justice of India was “seized” of the letter and it would be inappropriate on his part to grant consent and “preclude the determination of the Chief Justice of India” in the issue. The Attorney-General had concurred that the timing of Mr. Reddy’s letter was “suspect”. In this context, the Attorney-General had referred to Mr. Upadhyay’s statement that Mr. Reddy had 31 criminal cases against him. Mr. Upadhyay had twice sought the Attorney-General’s consent to file contempt proceedings against Mr. Reddy in the Supreme Court. Mr. Upadhyay is the petitioner-in-person in a case seeking quick disposal of criminal cases against legislators across the country. He had alleged that Justice Ramana’s order on September 16 to try these cases expeditiously may have prompted Mr. Reddy to write the letter on October 6. He had said that Mr. Reddy’s letter and its release to the media by the Chief Minister’s Principal Adviser Ajeya Kallam on October 10 amounted to contempt of court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/closure-to-plea-against-justice-ramana/article34156235.ece
25 March 2021||GUNTUR,||Andhra Pradesh planning changes in liquor policy||Is the Andhra Pradesh government mulling significant changes in the liquor policy? Is the focus now shifting from prohibition in a phased manner to regulation of consumption? The answers seem to be in the affirmative, and the government is expected to make an announcement soon. There could be two possible reasons behind the shift in the liquor policy. Firstly, the high price of liquor brands is opening the doors for illegal smuggling across the border. In spite of many enforcement measures, such as constitution of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), there is rampant smuggling of liquor. Secondly, the demand for beer is expected to go up significantly as summer sets in. The significant loss of revenue to the exchequer and the perilous financial situation of the State could be other reasons. Though no decision has been taken in this regard, sources say that the government may soon take a call on this. Soon after the YSRCP formed the government, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced graded prohibition as consumption of liquor was leading to many evils in society. The Chief Minister had said that liquor prices would be jacked up by 75% and the number of shops would be gradually reduced. He had also ordered that all permit rooms and belt shops be disbanded. He had also directed that the business hours be reduced from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The policy decision had reduced the consumption of liquor. The sale of IMFL from April to December 2020 was 126.55 lakh cases against 239.56 lakh cases during the corresponding period in 2019, a drop of 47.17%. The sale of beer in 2020 had also gone down to 126.55 lakh bottles against 186.36 lakh cases in 2019, resulting in 80.91% dip in consumption. The number of liquor shops were reduced by 33%, from 4,380 to 2,934. In all, 43,000 belt shops were closed. However, the government is mulling significant changes, and the first announcement may be on the prices of beer as summer sets in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/andhra-pradesh-planning-changes-in-liquor-policy/article34156215.ece
25 March 2021||Kochi,||An experiment that reaped sweet dividends||A two-year experiment with strawberry farming is paying sweet dividends for the Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp), which has started harvesting in about 4.5 acres in Munnar. The yield has been good and visitors, mostly domestic tourists, are taking advantage of the strawberry cultivation. The ‘Pick and Pack’ offer allows visitors to pick fruit of their choice, taste them, and buy them at the farm itself. Strawberries are now being sold for Rs. 400 a kg. The number of visitors to the farm is around 60 to 70 on average, with holidays seeing more people. The experience of seeing such a large strawberry plantation is the driving factor behind the success of the initiative. While strawberry cultivation fell flat last year due to the lockdown, 2021 has been a success. The fruit could not be sold in time last year because of the shutdown in businesses across the State to contain COVID-19. Besides, Munnar, one of the major attractions on the tourism map of Kerala, was totally closed down because of the pandemic. Horticorp and farmers in places, such as Vattavada and Kanthalloor, were in a difficult situation to sell the harvest as the flow of tourists came to a standstill and movement of transport vehicles was restricted. Last year’s experience of difficulties in selling the fruits restricted the planting this year. The number was reduced to about 7,000 but the yield from the Camarosa and Nebula varieties has been good. Horticorp is also in the process of getting certification for jam from strawberry as a processing unit is now operational to utilise the fruit that goes unsold.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/an-experiment-that-reaped-sweet-dividends/article34156224.ece
25 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||‘Devotees will not forget Sabarimala’||All India Congress Committee (AICC) core committee member A.K. Antony on Wednesday invoked the image of the Kerala police “secretly and rapidly” conveying “activist women” to the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple under the cover of darkness in 2018. The devotees would not forget the hurt caused by the Pinarayi Vijayan government’s “blind haste” to implement the Supreme Court verdict that allowed women of all ages to worship at the temple. It would reflect in the Assembly polls on April 6, he said. Faced with inevitable defeat, Mr. Vijayan had changed tack. He had promised to hold consultations and arrive at a general agreement before implementing any future verdict on the Sabarimala issue. His belated endearments had failed to make any impression on the Ayyappa devotees, Mr. Antony said. “Women of Kerala would not forget the widespread violence, pain and social upheaval caused by Mr. Vijayan’s ham-fisted and arbitrary attempt to enact the Sabarimala verdict,” he said. Mr. Antony said the Left Democratic Front (LDF) would run Kerala to ruin if voted to power again. He said the government faced youth ire over back-door appointments. The administration had transformed the Public Service Commission into an agency providing government jobs to Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers. Mr. Antony also attempted to breathe life into Flory Periera’s memory. She had died in police firing during the peak of the ‘Liberation Struggle’ against the first Communist government led by E.M.S. Namboodiripadu in 1959. Foreign trawlers He said the government’s move to allow foreign trawlers to raid the open seas reserved for traditional fishers had precipitated a similar situation in coastal Kerala. The fishers were up in arms against the LDF. The United Democratic Front (UDF) had spearheaded their struggle to preserve their right to livelihood. Mr. Antony said the gold-smuggling case and the attempts to stonewall Central Bureau Investigation inquiries into political murders were permanent blots on the LDF government’s record. He said a second innings for the LDF in power would author the State’s economic and social collapse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/devotees-will-not-forget-sabarimala/article34156716.ece
25 March 2021||KOCHI,||Kerala HC declines to stay case against ED officials||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday declined to stay a criminal case registered against some unnamed officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Kochi, for forcing Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling and in the money laundering cases, to make false statement against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Justice V.G. Arun adjourned to March 30 for a detailed hearing on the petition filed by P. Radhakrishnan, Deputy Director, ED, Kochi seeking to either quash the case or order a CBI probe into the case. When the petition came up for hearing, S.V. Raju, Additional Solicitor General of India, appearing for the ED sought a stay on the case. Opposing the plea, Suman Chakravarthy, Senior Public Prosecutor, submitted that no coercive steps such as arrests, or searches would be taken by the police. Statement of witnesses In fact, the police wanted to take the statements of the witnesses in the case. If a stay was granted, it would disrupt the police plan to record the statements of the witnesses. Moreover, the petitioner was not made an accused in the case. The prosecutor also sought time to make his arguments. Justice V.G. Arun then observed that there need not be any apprehension of coercive steps being taken against the ED officials till March 30 in view of the prosecutor's submissions Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India, who appeared for the Deputy Director, submitted that when Swapna Suresh was produced before the court in the money laundering case, she did not make any such complaint of pressure or coercion on her before the court. Had there been any torture or coercive action on the part of the ED officials, she would have told the court. The registration of FIR was illegal and it did not make out any offence. WhatsApp messages When the court queried as to how come the petitioner attached statements of the accused and mirror images of WhatsApp messages collected by other investigating agency with his petition, the Senior Counsel for the ED replied that the investigation was over and the complaint along with all these records had been filed before the sessions court. Besides, the agency was getting help from the Customs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-hc-declines-to-stay-case-against-ed-officials/article34156290.ece
25 March 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Co-op. networks promote sustainable development’||Cooperative networks are truly people-centred and planet-sensitive, and promote sustainable development across the world, said Daniela Bas, director of the Division for Inclusive Social Development, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. She was delivering the inaugural address at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (65th Edition) virtual parallel event titled “Destitution to Global leadership: The Iconic Working Women’s Forum (India)”. Held for the last 64 years from the UN headquarters, the Working Women’s Forum (India)-Indian Cooperative Network for Women (ICNW) made history by organising the virtual parallel event from Chennai for the first time. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care provided by cooperatives greatly helped their members. Cooperative networks are helping build the world back better and contribute towards sustainable development — socially and economically,” said Ms. Bas. “Institutions like the Working Women’s Forum in India are critical for the sustainability of women-led cooperatives as they can provide a range of essential services such as legal advice, property management, training, and access to markets. They also advocate for the rights of women working in rural and informal economies, and advocate for their organisations with policy makers at the local and national level,” said Simel Esim, Head of the Cooperative Unit of the International Labour Organization, Geneva. Nandini Azad, president, WWF and ICNW, said they would be setting up a virtual global resource centre for women informal sector workers. Chitose Arai, JCCU Vice Chairperson of the International Cooperative Alliance for Asia Pacific; Andreas Kappes, Secretary General, International Raiffeisen Union; Maria Peres, Chair of the Gender Equality Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance; Haruyoshi Amano, the Head of the International Division Tokyo of the JCCU; and Luisa Volpe, Policy Head of World Farmers Organization, were among those who shared their insights. Prof. Neerja Mishra, social activist, discussed the learnings from the WWF-ICNW.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/co-op-networks-promote-sustainable-development/article34156292.ece
25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM to visit Mujib’s mausoleum during his trip to Bangladesh||In a rare gesture, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit the mazar or mausoleum of ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at Tungipara in Gopalganj district during his visit to Bangladesh on March 26 and 27, sources told The Hindu on Wednesday. The two-day visit will include a cultural show by Hindustani classical vocalist Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty and his nine-member musical troupe from Kolkata. Mr. Modi will participate in the centenary celebration for Sheikh Mujib upon his arrival in Dhaka where he will hold bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The visit to Gopalganj is symbolically significant as it is the first time that an Indian leader will pay tributes to Bangabandhu at his grave which was neglected during the military rule in Bangladesh during the 1980s. The mazar has been developed by the Government of Bangladesh in the past two decades as a major destination for visitors to the country. The mausoleum contains the grave of Sheikh Mujib and his parents, Sheikh Lutfar Rahman and Saira Khatun. Sheikh Mujib was buried at his ancestral estate at Tungipara near Dhaka after he was assassinated on August 15, 1975 in a military takeover. Gopalganj will be in focus also for the visit by Mr. Modi to the Thakurbari at Orakandi, the heartland of the Matua Hindus who constitute a sizeable population in Bangladesh and West Bengal, where they are expected to play an important role in the coming Assembly election. Mr. Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart, Sheikh Hasina, will attend a concert in the evening of March 26 where Mr. Chakraborty will perform live with his team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-to-visit-mujibs-mausoleum-during-his-trip-to-bangladesh/article34156247.ece
25 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Kerala CM asks Shah to act against harassment of nuns||Two nuns and two novices were forced to get down a train at the Jhansi railway station in Uttar Pradesh last Friday and detained briefly for questioning after ABVP members accused them of illegal conversions. The four were allowed to resume their journey after an inquiry by railway officials found no conversion. On Wednesday, amid an outrage, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the harassment was “shocking”. He demanded that Mr. Shah instruct authorities to take strict action against “all groups and individuals who disrupt and impair the freedom of individual rights”. Naeem Khan Mansuri, Superintendent of Police, Railways, Jhansi, said the ABVP members were travelling back from a training camp in Rishikesh. The four women were travelling from Nizamuddin to Rourkela. The Government Railway Police, Jhansi, said their control room received information on March 19 that some women were being taken on the Utkal Express train for religious conversion. On the basis of this information, the RPF asked them to de-board and upon investigation by the police, it turned out that the allegations were false, they said on Twitter. Videos from the day showed the police and unidentified persons questioning the nuns and scanning their Aadhaar cards while they were seated on their berths. The four then got off the train and could be seen heading towards what appeared to be a police station. The police found that the two girls from Odisha were undergoing training in Delhi. They found baptism certificates of 2003 in their possession.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-cm-asks-shah-to-act-against-harassment-of-nuns/article34156262.ece
25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBSE rolls out assessment framework||The Central Board of Secondary Education has rolled out a new assessment framework for Classes 6-10 in English, Maths and Science in collaboration with the British Council. Under the new system, teachers will be trained to create question papers and other assessment methods that test the actual competency of students in these subjects, rather than their ability to memorise chunks of text. Launching the new framework on Wednesday, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said it was aligned with the National Education Policy’s vision of achieving a global standard in assessments, according to an official statement. British agencies worked with the CBSE team to analyse the current set-up in Indian schools and identify how competency-based approaches can be integrated into the assessment system. They have developed materials to train teachers in new styles of pedagogy and lesson plan preparation and will hold capacity building workshops for 40 assessment designers, 180 master test item designers and 360 master trainer mentors, who will create model question banks. In the first phase, the framework will be implemented in select Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas, CBSE schools in Chandigarh, and a few private schools. By 2024, it will be rolled out to 25,000 CBSE schools across the country, with 1.32 lakh teachers and two crore students. “The new National Education policy 2020 envisages a significant shift in the education ecosystem in India. It aims at preparing students for the 21st century,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbse-rolls-out-assessment-framework/article34156264.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||Visit tulip garden in J&K: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday asked everyone to visit tulip garden, located at the foothills of Zabarwan range in Jammu and Kashmir, and enjoy the warm hospitality of the people of the Union territory. Tweeting about the gardens, the Prime Minister said, “Whenever you get the opportunity, do visit Jammu and Kashmir and witness the scenic Tulip festival. In addition to the tulips, you will experience the warm hospitality of the people of Jammu and Kashmir,.” The tulip garden will be thrown open to public on Thursday. “Tomorrow, 25th March is special for Jammu and Kashmir. A majestic tulip garden in the foothills of the Zabarwan Mountains will open for visitors. The garden will see over 15 lakh flowers of more than 64 varieties in bloom,” Mr. Modi said in another tweet. The tulip garden is located in the foothills of the Zaberwan range.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/visit-tulip-garden-in-jk-modi/article34156266.ece
25 March 2021||KANNUR,||Cong. for action on bogus voter issue||Alleging more irregularities in the voters’ list, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Wednesday claimed that more than one lakh voters had votes in more than one constituency. Speaking to the media in Kannur, he claimed that 1,09,693 voters had been issued voter identity cards in more than one constituency. Constituency-wise Mr. Chennithala said 127 voters in Payyannur could also vote in Irikkur. Similarly, 91 voters in Kalliassery had identity cards that enabled them to vote in Irikkur. “We found that 527 voters from other constituencies can also vote in Irikkur. Payyannur has 127 such voters, Kalliassery 91, Taliparamba 242, Azhikode 47, and Kannur 20,” he said. Likewise, Azhikode had 711 such voters, Cherthala 1,205, and Kundara 387, Mr. Chennithala said adding that all 140 constituencies had such voters. Terming not correct the Chief Minister’s statement that Congress workers included the name of a voter five times on the poll roll, he demanded action against the perpetrators. “Whoever adds bogus voters should be removed. There is a conspiracy behind this,” Mr. Chennithala said. Reiterating his charge that Left-leaning officials had conspired to add bogus voters on the electoral rolls, he demanded stern against such officials. Alleging a Communist Party of India (Marxist) bid to subvert the will of the people, he said the matter would be brought to the notice of the Election Commission. The statement of gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh to the Enforcement Directorate against Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan proved that the no-confidence motion brought against him by the Opposition was right. Stating that the truth would have come out if the Speaker was questioned properly, the Congress leader said the Speaker did not deserve to continue in the post. Even his party did not give him ticket for the Assembly polls as it knew what he was up to, Mr. Chennithala said.  Leader of the Opposition says the matter will be brought to the notice of the Election Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-for-action-on-bogus-voter-issue/article34156226.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Probe audio clip on graft in West Bengal’||Demanding an inquiry, the Congress on Wednesday played an audio clip at a press conference in which serious allegations of corruption were levelled against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in West Bengal. The party said it could not verify the authenticity of the clip that was one minute and 28 seconds long. It asked the BJP to investigate the issue. The purported clip relates to a conversation between two persons discussing getting BJP ticket in Bengal in exchange for money. The clip also talks of misconduct by the BJP’s Bengal chief, Dilip Ghosh, and the party in-charge for Bengal, Kailash Vijayvargiya. The voices on the audio clip, however, were not that of Mr. Ghosh or Mr. Vijayvargiya. The Congress claimed that it received the clip from an independent journalist and the identities of the persons taking part in the conversation could not be ascertained. Addressing a joint press conference at party headquarters, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate questioned the silence of top BJP leaders on the audio clip that was circulating on social media platforms. Stating that the matter was in the public domain now, Rajya Sabha member Amee Yagnik asked why the Election Commission and the National Commission for Women (NCW) had not taken note of the matter so far. She said, “When an audio clip comes into the public domain and the BJP has objections, they themselves should order an inquiry.” Lok Sabha member Jasbir Singh Gill said, “The BJP should suspend these people [whose names figured in the audio clip] and the Election Commission of India should take note and register a case. It is the duty of the EC to go into the allegations.” Ms. Shrinate said whenever sensitive and serious allegations are made concerning women, the BJP’s top leaders go silent. “We demand a complete probe into these allegations and expect the party’s top leadership including Prime Minister, Home Minister, BJP President and the women leaders will break their silence. Those office bearers whose names figure in this clip must come clean about it,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/probe-audio-clip-on-graft-in-west-bengal/article34156234.ece
25 March 2021||BENGALURU,||Karnataka Minister’s ‘monogamy challenge’||Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar stirred up a hornets’ nest on Wednesday by throwing an open challenge to all the 225 MLAs of the State to subject themselves to an inquiry to know who among them had extra-marital relationships. This drew criticism from not only the Congress but also several of his own party members. Question of ‘morality’? Mr. Sudhakar, who had earlier come under fire from the Opposition for obtaining an injunction against publishing any objectionable video involving him and five other Ministers, told reporters: “This is an open challenge from me to those who think that they are Sathya Harishchandras . Let all the 225 of us face an inquiry.... It is the question of morality and values. Let the people of the State know if they have any illicit relationship and extra-marital affairs.” He took the names of K.R. Ramesh Kumar, V. Muniyappa, D. K. Shivakumar, Siddaramaiah (Congress leaders) and H.D. Kumaraswamy (JD-S leader), and asked if they were all models for society and were monogamous. The Minister’s statement left members fuming in the Legislative Assembly, with Mr. Siddaramaiah and R.V. Deshpande (Congress) demanding that he should apologise or the Chief Minister should drop him immediately. They described it as a breach of privilege of all the MLAs as well as the House. Declaring that the Congress was ready to accept the challenge, Mr. Siddaramaiah said his party would demand a Karnataka High Court-monitored probe into the “issue of morality” as demanded by Dr. Sudhakar. The party also wrote to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in this regard. “Let the High Court Chief Justice also look into the issue suggested by Dr. Sudhakar along with our earlier demand for probing the CD scandal involving the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi in which he is accused of sexually exploiting a woman by promising a job and the episode of six Ministers, including Dr. Sudhakar, obtaining injunction against publishing of any objectionable videos involving them,” he said. Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri also took exception to such remarks by a member of the House. “Nobody should express their views in such a way that would hurt or affect the dignity of the House as well as its members... As the custodian of this House, I am equally pained. It is my prime responsibility to protect the dignity of the House,” he said. After his remarks created a furore, Dr. Sudhakar issued a clarification, maintaining that his statement had been misinterpreted. “I regret if it has hurt anyone,” he said. “No one bothered when Congress deliberately tried to defame and indulge in character assassination of six Ministers (who have obtained injunction). But my statement on asking them to introspect has hurt some people,” Dr. Sudhakar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-ministers-monogamy-dare/article34156212.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘New legislation a ploy to enforce Police Raj’||Eight Opposition parties in a joint statement condemned the events that took place in the Patna Assembly on Tuesday, where Opposition members were brutally beaten up and dragged out of the Assembly by the police, following chaotic scenes over the Bihar Armed Police Bill. Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj K. Jha had tried to raise this issue in the Rajya Sabha but Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu did not allow him to speak. ‘It is unprecedented’ “This is unprecedented. I have never heard about such an incident in 49 years of my political career that the police entered inside the State Assembly to drag out the legislators, including women members. “This is crossing all democratic boundaries and making a mockery of our Constitutional system,” Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said at a joint press conference. ‘Unbridled powers’ In a joint statement signed by the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Congress, the Samajwadi Party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, the Trinamool Congress and the Shiv Sena, the Opposition said that the Bihar Armed Police Bill is an “insidious conspiracy to enforce Police Raj in Bihar”. This law, the parties said, conferred unbridled powers upon the Bihar Military Police to conduct raids and arrests without warrants. “This is an unconstitutional Bill that effectively transforms the police force into an armed militia to harass, suppress and crackdown on academics, activists, journalists, the political opposition and all those who dare to speak truth to power,” the joint statement said. The events in the Patna Assembly, the joint statement said, also indicated what the Bharatiya Janata Party wanted to do in the rest of the country “employing the sheer tyranny of power”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-legislation-is-a-ploy-to-enforce-police-raj-opposition/article34156244.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||SC flags concern over electoral bonds’ misuse||Mr. Venugopal, appearing for the government, said only parties registered under the Representation of the People Act could receive donations through electoral bonds, and that they should not have secured less than 1% of the votes polled in the previous elections. The court said it did not want to “get into politics” nor were its comments aimed at any particular party. The exchange came during a virtual court hearing of an application filed by the Association for Democratic Reforms, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, to stay the sale of electoral bonds scheduled between April 1 and April 10, prior to the crucial Assembly elections in five States, including West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. “Electoral bonds scheme introduces anonymity in political donations. The sale of bonds in April should be stopped,” Mr. Bhushan urged. Mr. Venugopal said the sale was announced after getting permission from the Election Commission of India. “The Election Commission is supporting electoral bonds or we will go back to the pre-existing situation of donations coming in by cash,” senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, for the poll body, said. Chief Justice Bobde then asked whether the purchasers of electoral bonds disclosed whether the money paid was black or white. “When a businessman goes and buys bonds, does he have to disclose whether he purchases them with white or black money? Does he have to pay tax?” the Chief Justice asked Mr. Venugopal. “Buyers have to use white money. The purchase is through bank drafts, cheques or electronic transfer,” Mr. Venugopal replied. But Mr. Bhushan intervened to submit that though the original purchase of bonds could be done using white money, somebody could anonymously re-purchase the bonds from the original buyer and drop it at a political party office with anyone none the wiser. “Nobody will know who purchased the bonds from the original buyer. The scheme facilitates kickbacks,” Mr. Bhushan argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-flags-concern-over-electoral-bonds-misuse/article34156207.ece
25 March 2021||Hyderabad,||Artist’s plea for assistance||Dusk is eternal at the Old Age Home. Iam a slice of that dusk; bedridden, Wilting away in a musty corner, Of myroom.  The above lines are from a poem penned by Hyderabad-born artist Fatima Ahmed. A known name in the realm of modern Indian art, her paintings had been acquired in the past by national and international museums such as the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi, the Birla Academy of Art and Culture in Kolkata, the State Library of Stuttgart in Germany and the Fukuoka Art Museum in Japan. Now, the 86-year-old is at an old age home in Hyderabad, bed-ridden with partial paralysis following a stroke she suffered three years ago. The dismal environs of the old age home, where some of its inmates battle mental health issues, haven’t bogged her down, yet. Ahmed is among the prominent modern artists to have emerged from the city, and authored the semi-autobiographical book ‘In Haleema’s Words’ (Rupa Publication, 2012). “I have gone through ups and downs in my art career. After the paralytic attack, my savings have gone towards my health expenses,” she rues, disclosing that her monthly medical, caretaker and fee for the stay at the old age home amount to an average of Rs. 60,000 per month.A few of her well wishers have been pitching in to help, but she hopes the Telangana government could provide financial assistance. Contacted, former IAS officer and cultural adviser to Telangana government, K.V. Ramanachary pointed out that the government has been helping artists and others who are in dire straits through the Asara pension scheme. “The monthly financial assistance, depending on different categories, ranges between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,000. In special cases, a one-time medical assistance of up to Rs. 2 lakh is provided,” he says. However, a rehabilitation scheme seems like a tall ask. Ms Ahmed, meanwhile, holds on to hope. Her father served as a collector during the time of Hyderabad’s last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. After schooling at Mahboobia Girls High School, she wanted to study art, which was frowned upon by her family. She wanted to break free from restrictions that society placed on women back then, and enrolled in the College of Fine Arts. “Good girls married off at 18. I refused; so I was labelled to be of ‘loose’ character,” she reminisces. After her parents’ death, she moved to Bombay in the early 1960s and later to Pune. Art took her to London where she spent two years and later, she travelled the world all journeys widening her understanding of art and culture. Ahmed vividly remembers the excruciating paralytic attack. She was in Pune then. “The medical attention wasn’t enough in the initial stages, which worsened my condition.” She was then brought to Hyderabad and has since then been at the old-age home. A staunch believer in the teachings of Osho, she says it helps her find strength and solace. Her plea for financial aid also comes in the wake of the pandemic, making it tough for art business. “I think 12 of my paintings are yet to be sold. We don’t know when the art market will revive and we find buyers,” she says with a smile, through the bleakness of it all.  The monthly financial assistance, depending on different categories, ranges between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 2,000. In special cases, a one-time medical assistance of up to Rs. 2 lakh is provided||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/artists-plea-for-assistance/article34156648.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Double mutant’ virus variant found||However, international studies have shown reduced efficacy of vaccines — particularly those by Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax — to certain variants. However, the vaccines continue to be significantly protective in spite of this. So far, only three global VOCs have been identified: the U.K. variant (B.1.1.7), the South African (B.1.351) and the Brazilian (P.1) lineage. So far, of 10,787 samples from international passengers, 771 instances of these VOCs have been identified in 18 States of the country. After the new double variant has been submitted to GISAID, it will be categorised under a formal lineage, and will have its own name. The identification of a new variant does not yet imply new public health measures, the Health Ministry said: “It would require the same epidemiological and public health response of increased testing, comprehensive tracking of close contacts, prompt isolation of positive cases & contacts as well as treatment as per National Treatment Protocol” by the States/Union Territories. Separately, genome variation studies from Kerala have revealed the presence of other mutations associated with the ability to help the coronavirus evade neutralising antibodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/double-mutant-virus-variant-found/article34156231.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Matter is serious, move HC, SC tells Param Bir||Mr. Rohatgi said Mr. Singh would move the High Court in the afternoon itself as the “matter was too serious”. Mr. Singh, who was shunted out to the Home Guards Department, said his transfer order arrived “immediately after” he complained to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior leaders about the “corrupt malpractices” of Mr. Deshmukh. “The entire State is rocked. Police reforms have not taken place,” Mr. Rohatgi submitted. “That is the case with all States, including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, it’s just not this State,” Justice Kaul observed orally. Justice Kaul also asked Mr. Rohatgi why the Minister was not made a party in the petition. Mr. Rohatgi said he would amend the petition and make him a party, but the court said approaching High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution was equally viable and Mr. Singh should do that. “This is a matter of serious public interest for whole nation. A police officer is transferred citing administrative grounds but Home Minister himself said on TV that it is not an administrative transfer... This court has entertained petitions under Article 32 on much lesser issues,” Mr. Rohatgi said. “The point is simple. He is making some allegations and the Minister is also making allegations. I don’t see a point why you should not move High Court. If you give a list of cases entertained under Article 32, I can also give cases we have relegated to High Court. The power of Article 226 is wide,” Justice Kaul responded. Mr. Rohatgi urged the Bench to request the High Court to take up the case on Thursday itself. “That request is to be made before High Court,” Justice Kaul did not relent. Mr. Singh has alleged that Mr. Deshmukh held meetings with “officers of lower rank” like Sachin Vaze, now in custody in connection with the Ambani residence bomb scare case, and Sanjay Patil, an ACP with Social Service Branch, at his residence in February. This was done “bypassing their seniors”. The Home Minister had “instructed” the duo to “accumulate Rs. 100 crore every month”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/matter-serious-move-hc-sc-tells-param-bir/article34156232.ece
25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||DHFL booked for fake home loan accounts||The CBI has booked the Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), its promoters and others for allegedly claiming interest subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), based on bogus loan accounts opened with its fictitious Bandra branch in Mumbai. During a meeting with institutional investors and analysts, the accused persons had claimed that till December 2018, the company had processed 88,651 cases under the PMAY; received Rs. 539.40 crore in interest subsidy and was to get Rs. 1,347.80 crore more in subsidy from the Central government, amounting to Rs. 1,887.20 crore, on the loans reimbursed by it. Among those named in the FIR are Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, who are already under the scanner of multiple agencies for alleged bank frauds. Unknown officials of the National Housing Bank (NHB) are also under the scanner. A forensic report by Grant Thompton — appointed by the present board of DHFL — revealed that its promoters had floated the fictitious Bandra branch, where fake housing loan accounts of the borrowers who had earlier repaid their loans were created.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dhfl-booked-for-fake-home-loan-accounts/article34156252.ece

The court listed a few questions to be resolved. It asked if the prayers made on behalf of the petitioners (ARG Outlier Media Private Limited and Mr. Goswami) for quashing the FIR can be entertained, in the absence of petitioners being arraigned as accused. It asked whether the petition can be entertained for the prayers on transfer of investigation to the CBI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trp-case-probe-will-be-completed-in-12-weeks/article34156254.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||Rajya Sabha approves Bill empowering Delhi L-G||The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill that seeks to empower the Lieutenant-Governor in Delhi. The Opposition, including the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress, walked out just before the Bill was put to vote as a mark of protest. Earlier, the Biju Janata Dal, the Samajwadi Party and the YSR Congress had walked out. During the division of votes for adopting the motion that the Bill be taken up for consideration, 83 members voted in favour and 45 against. Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said there was no political motive behind the Bill and it was brought only to clear the ambiguities. The Bill states that the government in the national capital territory of Delhi means the “Lieutenant-Governor”. The legislation says the L-G is “necessarily granted an opportunity” to give her/his opinion before any decision taken by the Council of Ministers (or the Delhi Cabinet) is implemented. ‘No power taken away’ “When the Delhi government moved the Delhi Netaji Subhas University of Technology Bill in 2015, it said government means the L-G of Delhi, the Delhi government has already agreed to this… Not a single power of the Delhi government is being taken away. Delhi is a Union Territory, not a full-fledged State,” Mr. Reddy said, responding to the debate. The proceedings saw vociferous protest by the Opposition members with the TMC and AAP accusing the government of “killing democracy”. The House was adjourned twice. Sanjay Singh of AAP said the Bill was akin to dismissing an elected government. “Will you pass a Bill that gives all powers to the President of India? You are smothering an elected government. This Bill is akin to dismissing the government. We denied you nine stadiums to turn them into jails for farmers. This Bill is a revenge for that... The BJP has lost elections to [Arvind] Kejriwal twice and so it is targeting his government,” Mr. Singh said. Abhishek Manu Singhvi of the Congress said the Bill was unconstitutional. He said the Supreme Court judgment had stated that the “L-G of the State has more of an advisory role.” He said the powers of the Delhi Assembly were being diluted systematically.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajya-sabha-approves-bill-empowering-delhi-l-g/article34156295.ece

25 March 2021||KOCHI,||Customs takes exception to AG hearing petition||Commissioner of Customs (Preventive), Kochi, Sumit Kumar has taken preliminary objection to Advocate General (AG) K. Sudhakara Prasad hearing a petition seeking the Advocate General’s sanction for initiating a contempt of court proceeding against him in connection with a statement he had filed in a case.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||‘India should have been included in Moscow talks’||The Afghanistan government is expected to unveil its full proposal during the upcoming intra-Afghan talks due to be held in Istanbul in the beginning of April. The talks are a part of the U.S.’s latest push for intra-Afghan talks with the Taliban that appear to have stalled in Doha, and was outlined in a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to President Ghani. While the U.S. has also proposed future regional talks, led by the UN, to engage all regional stakeholders, including India, the most recent talks held in Moscow on March 18 by the so-called “troika”, with envoys from Pakistan, Qatar, Afghan and Taliban leadership, had not invited the Indian government, which Mr. Atmar called a “mistake”. “We made it clear [to the organisers] that peace and stability and regional connectivity and prosperity cannot happen without India,” he said. Mr. Atmar said there was no proposal to request Indian troops in Afghanistan, nor had his government asked India to directly open a dialogue with the Taliban. He said Afghanistan “appreciates” India’s position that it would engage the Taliban “if the Taliban come and join a legitimate government of Afghanistan”. In a statement at the end of Mr. Atmar’s visit, issued on Wednesday, the Ministry of External Affairs did not refer directly to the Ghani proposal, but said India remained committed to “a peaceful, sovereign, stable and inclusive Afghanistan where the rights of all sections of society are protected within a democratic constitutional framework”. Asked if he had discussed the recent steps in India-Pakistan engagement with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Mr. Atmar said the India-Afghanistan talks focused only on “bilateral issues”. However, he added that he welcomed any dialogue between them, and hoped that India’s “responsible gestures are met with reciprocity” from Pakistan.

25 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka Minister warns of lockdown||After repeatedly stating that there will be no lockdown in the State, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Wednesday indicated that there will be no other option for the State other than a lockdown if the number of COVID-19 cases rose further. Speaking to reporters after a programme organised by the Health Department to mark World TB Day, he said that despite repeatedly appealing to the people to behave responsibly and follow COVID-19-appropriate behaviour, many were still not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. “If the cases further go up, we will have no other option. It will become inevitable for not just me but the Chief Minister too to consider a lockdown. Several States have already imposed a lockdown/partial lockdown,” he said. “That is why we are seeking people’s support and hope they will cooperate.” On the new guidelines issued by the Centre on containment zones, the Minister said a meeting will soon be convened to discuss the implementation of guidelines. “We have experience in identifying containment zones and maintaining them. We will strictly follow the Centre’s guidelines,” he said. Film promotions Pointing out that the government can only come out with rules and regulations, Mr. Sudhakar said it was up to people to follow them. “It is unfortunate that even people who are aware of the situation are not following protocol. Several public functions are being held for film promotions where crowds gather. These people know the situation well and it is their responsibility to take precautions,” he said. The Minister appealed to actors and religious heads to avoid large gatherings and ensure protocol was followed in such gatherings. Meanwhile, the Union Health Ministry on Wednesday advised States to consider imposing local restrictions in public observation of festivals and limit or do away with mass gatherings. “With festivals such as Holi, Shab-e-Barat, Bihu, Easter and Eid-ul-Fitr coming up, States can impose local restrictions in exercise of powers conferred under Section 22 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” stated a letter by Arti Ahuja, Union Additional Secretary (Health and Family Welfare). Fresh guidelines Following this, the State Health Department is all set to issue fresh guidelines for festival celebrations in a day or two. Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra told The Hindu that the Union Ministry’s letter will be discussed with the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). “Following this, we will issue new guidelines in a day or two,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-minister-warns-of-lockdown/article34156213.ece

On the occasion, Mr. Shah launched a scathing attack on the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan over the gold smuggling case. He dismissed allegations of deploying the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for political gains and threw a set of queries towards the Chief Minister. “Whether the prime accused in the gold smuggling case had been working in his office and did your government give Rs. 3 lakh as monthly remuneration to the prime accused? Whether your Principal Secretary had made a phone call to help the accused and had the prime accused woman travelled at the government’s expense with the permission of your Principal Secretary? Why did this woman used to visit the Chief Minister repeatedly? Whether the Chief Minister’s office exerted pressure on Customs officers after the gold seizure and did you initiate a strong inquiry when the Customs and ED officers were attacked?” asked Mr. Shah. He also spoke about how the CPI(M) was remote controlling the Public Service Commission (PSC) to fit in its cadre in government job. Centre committed Holding that the BJP government at the Centre was committed to initiate development projects in Kerala, he elaborated on the new projects allotted to the State, including the 2,000 MW Pugalur-Thrissur High Voltage Direct Current project, a 50 MW solar power project in Kasaragod and the allocation of Rs. 65,000 crore for the development of national highways in Kerala.

She is wearing a saree and one feet is covered. Instead, she should wear a Bermuda so that it can be clearly seen ,” Mr. Ghosh said at a public meeting in Purulia on Tuesday.  “Such condemnable comments against a woman Chief Minister proves that leaders of the BJP in Bengal do not respect women. Women of Bengal will give a fitting reply to the insult on May 2,” the Trinamool Congress tweeted. TMC MP Mahua Moitra also took to social media. “@BJP WB Pres asks in public meeting why Mamatadi is wearing a saree, she should be wearing “Bermuda” shorts to display her leg better.

Leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) condemned the remarks and described them as “derogatory”. ‘PM biggest liar’ Meanwhile, Ms. Banerjee on Wednesday launched her most scathing attack yet on Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling him “the biggest liar”. “I used to respect the Prime Minister’s chair.

25 March 2021||PATNA,||Another day of turmoil in Bihar Assembly||A day after they were evicted from the Assembly by the police after a scuffle, the protesting Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal legislators held a parallel session on the lawns of the House protesting against the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021. ‘CM must apologise’ Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, while condemning the “forcible, brutal police act”, said they would boycott the Assembly for the remainder of its tenure, if Chief Minister Nitish Kumar did not apologise. The Opposition members led by the RJD had created a ruckus inside and outside the Assembly on Tuesday over the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, which they called “draconian”. Outside, RJD leaders had clashed with policemen. Several party leaders and policemen were injured. Inside the House, the protesting Opposition legislators staged a dharna outside the Speaker’s chamber and prevented him from resuming the session to pass the Bill. They were forcibly ousted and allegedly “beaten up and manhandled by policemen” who were called in by the Speaker. RJD MLA Satish Das was seen being taken out on a stretcher. Later, an FIR was filed against Tejashwi Yadav and several RJD leaders for clashing with the police at the Dak Bungalow intersection in the city on Tuesday. Mr. Yadav said the Bill had provisions that would allow the police to conduct searches and arrest anyone without a warrant. The “draconian” Bill, he said, would give absolute powers to the police, so that it could act as a veritable arm of Mr. Nitish’s dictatorial politics. The Opposition’s parallel Assembly session had senior RJD leader Bhudeo Choudhary as the “Speaker”. Members of the RJD, Congress, CPI, CPI(M) and CPI(ML) carried placards with slogans against the NDA government. Inside the House, JD(U) leader and NDA candidate Maheshwar Hazari was chosen as the Deputy Speaker by voice vote in the absence of the Opposition members. Bill passed in Council Meanwhile, the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021 was passed in the Legislative Council too amid protests by the Opposition members. Later, speaking to presspersons, Mr. Kumar said the Bill would now be sent to the Governor. “The Opposition should have participated in the debate, instead of creating pandemonium inside and outside the House.

Swamy along with others hatched a serious conspiracy to create unrest in the entire country and to overpower the government. Special judge D.E. Kothalikar said, “The material placed on record thus prima facie denote that the applicant (Fr. Swamy) was not only the member of banned organisation Communist Party of India (Maoist) but he was carrying out activities further in the objective of the organisation which is nothing but to overthrow the democracy of the nation.” The court said, “There are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation of commission of the offences punishable under chapters IV (punishment for terrorist activities) and VI (terrorist organisations) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act against the applicant is prima facie true. Considering the express bar imposed by Section 43D 5 of the UAPA, the applicant cannot be released on bail.” The court had refused bail to Fr. Swamy on March 22. The order was made available on Wednesday. The court also mentioned, “The material collected during the investigation would further state that the applicant had received Rs. 8 lakh through comrade Mohan for furtherance of the CPI (M) activities. The references made in the aforementioned letters to the members being comrade goes to suggest that there is force in the submissions made by the special public prosecutor that the word comrade was being used while addressing the member of the CPI(M).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fr-swamy-conspired-to-overpower-govt-court/article34156255.ece

25 March 2021||ARUPPUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||Kamal distances himself from IT raids on party functionary’s premises||Distancing himself from the Income Tax raids held on his party office-bearer’s premises that led to unearthing of unaccounted money, Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan said he was a honest taxpayer. He was campaigning for candidates of MNM-led alliance. Stating that he had been invited by the I-Tax Department in the past to honour honest taxpayers, Mr. Haasan said it was not right to connect him with those whose premises were raided. “We have some or other relationship with those people. I have even acted in a film made by DMK youth wing leader Udhayanidhi Stalin. There are corruption charges against his family members. Huge money was recovered from his party functionary’s premises and even an election was countermanded. But, how can people associate me with that raid?” he asked. Mr. Kamal Haasan said that he was using helicopter with his own hard-earned money. “I never said that I have lost money because of joining politics. I have wantonly come to politics without bothering about money. Otherwise, I would not have come to politics at all,” he said. The actor-turned-politician said that people should never sell their votes for a few thousand rupees. “If at all you want to sell your vote, demand Rs. 5 lakh for each of your votes. That is the value of your vote,” he said. He said that Rs. 1,000 a month and Rs. 1,500 a month announced as assistance to housewives by Dravidian parties were pittance. “Six free cooking cylinders announced (by the ruling AIADMK) will only double the debt burden of the State,” he said. The parties that had copied his idea of giving assistance to housewives would not copy if he said that he would close down half the number of liquor shops in the State. “This is because both the parties own liquor factories,” he said.  He sought votes for candidates V. Umadevi (Aruppukottai), S. Mugunthan (Sivakasi), Vivekanandan (Rajapalayam) (all MNM) and N. Manimaran (AlSMK – Virudhunagar), and M. Bharathi (Indiya Jananayaka Katchi – Sattur).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-distances-himself-from-it-raids-on-party-functionarys-premises/article34156961.ece
25 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Not an outsider in the constituency any more’||Minister and AIADMK candidate for Avadi ‘Ma Foi’ K. Pandiarajan is confident of winning with a better margin this time. When he came to this constituency in 2016, he was an outsider. But now he is one among the people. In an interview, he spoke about what he has done for Avadi and the challenges ahead.   Last time you won the election by a narrow margin against the same opponent, S.M. Nasar of the DMK. Do you foresee a tough fight? In 2016, I was seen as an outsider when I entered the fray in Avadi. Now, people have seen me and my work, and no longer do I carry the outsider tag. I have become one among them. Interestingly, last time, I had polled the highest number of votes in all Muslim areas. Three villages, including Nemelicheri, that had voted for the DMK last time will back us, having seen my work. Over 2,000 people from the BJP, who hold key roles, have been supporting my campaign. I’m confident of winning with a better margin this time. What have you done for the constituency in the last five years? The Tidel Park at Pattabiram is one of the biggest projects we have executed. Many companies have evinced interest in picking up space here. TCS has expressed interest in taking 10 more acres. With the surrounding roads getting widened, especially the Chennai-Tiruvallur High Road, many IT companies want to migrate here. Of the 10 bridges that were conceived — three have been completed and another five will be completed in the next 100 days. With all these developments, Avadi will become the home to three key industries — defence manufacturing that has always been strong here, logistics and IT — and they will make a deadly combination. That is my vision for the next five years. We have rejuvenated over 30 waterbodies. But why should people give you a second chance now? Some big initiatives that have come half way need some more time for completion. Any transition would hurt those projects. I will be in a far better position to make them happen as I have done most of what I had committed myself to in the 2016 election. Critics are questioning about pamphlets that you have prepared in Hindi — a Minister for Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture canvassing votes in Hindi... The Hindi-speaking population is quite big in Avadi. Though they can speak Tamil, they can’t read it. So I thought of reaching my voters in the language they knew. It’s not just Hindi we have printed pamphlets in, but in other languages, too. How easy or challenging will this election be for you, given that you have lesser time for canvassing? My candidature was announced on March 10 and on the morning of March 11, I was on the ground, campaigning. We had a seven-day advantage over the DMK, which started its campaign a week later. The feedback from my teams shows a positive trend for me. There are allegations that the MoUs that were signed at the Tamil Nadu Global Investors Meet in 2015 and 2019 have not resulted in gains for the State. Your take on this? No company will come to a public forum and sign a fake MoU. [DMK president] M.K. Stalin does not want us to score strong on the industrial front, so he spreads these stories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-an-outsider-in-the-constituency-any-more/article34156418.ece
25 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Civic body to re-introduce door-to-door surveillance||In the wake of COVID-19 cases increasing in the city, the Greater Chennai Corporation has planned to re-introduce door-to-door surveillance from Monday. The civic body plans to bring back the system of checking residents for symptoms, including fever, by deputing over 12,000 volunteers back on the streets to control the pandemic from getting out of hand. The COVID-19 management plan by the civic body involves home surveillance, strict monitoring of those who are under home quarantine and ramping up of fever clinics, along with testing of persons and speeding up vaccination. The COVID-19 management plan was revealed by Commissioner G. Prakash at a meeting held in the city on Wednesday. Mr. Prakash said 12,000 volunteers for taking up home surveillance would be recruited by this week and would be deputed to carry out inspection from Monday. He also said 4,000 volunteers would be posted as part of the Home Quarantine Monitoring System (HQMS) to keep a strict watch on those who have tested positive for COVID-19. Mr. Prakash, highlighting the effectiveness of the micro-management system which helped in controlling the pandemic, said fever clinics have been proposed to be increased, for which more than 100 medical specialists would be recruited, as also for ramping up the testing of people. “Already more than 40% of the population in the city has been tested and so the testing rate is proposed to be increased to 15,000 per day to cover more people,” he said. The civic body plans to go for full-fledged pandemic prevention based on the meeting the Chief Secretary had with the medical committee on Tuesday. Mr. Prakash said vaccinating those above 45 years of age would begin on Monday. Pointing to the fact that Chennai had vaccinated over 5 lakh people, among the highest in the country, he said transmission could be reduced only if the vaccination rate was increased.  Already more than 40% of the population in the city have been tested and so the testing rate is proposed to be increased to 15,000 per day G.

25 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Samples from clusters sent for genomic analysis||Since March 5, fresh novel coronavirus infections have been steadily rising in Tamil Nadu. Fatigue among the public resulting in poor compliance with masking, physical distancing and hand hygiene, family gatherings, and mass gatherings during election campaigns are key challenges in the control of the surge. In an interview, T. S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, talks about the challenges for the department, its preparedness and ramping up testing and vaccination.  With fresh cases steadily rising across the State, what are the main causes of concern? The challenges are speeding up vaccination for all age-appropriate categories, laxity in the community and fatigue among the public as we are one year into the pandemic. However, the advantages are that we already have clear-cut protocols in place for testing, treating, triaging, admission and home quarantine. We have the required human resources in place. We have extended the period of the human resource personnel such as those who were outsourced till May. Compared with last year, are you seeing a difference in the speed of transmission in certain pockets? We now have clusters in schools, hotels and functions. We are monitoring every cluster and tracing all contacts. We are also sending samples lifted from the clusters for genomic analysis to know the variations and behavioural change of the strain, if any. These samples are being randomly selected from the clusters. With election campaigns being held across the State and polling all set to happen, what are the aspects that you would like to see better enforced to prevent transmission? We are fixing the responsibility on the organisers of election campaigns of ensuring that the participants follow all COVID-19 protocols. We have given the instructions to election officers authorised to tell the organisers that they are responsible. This is one of the conditionalities for granting approval for meetings. We have advised our health inspectors to go as a team to the places of mass gathering for enforcement of COVID-19 norms. The number of samples tested a day has been increasing in the last two weeks. Are you planning to take up aggressive testing in public places? We are ramping up testing. Previously, we primarily traced and tested five to 10 contacts of a patient. These were mainly family contacts. Now, we are expanding up to 30 contacts, including friends and other social contacts. We are planning random testing to check if there are cases in the community in certain areas. Vaccination coverage has crossed 23 lakh. What is the current stock position of both vaccines and is the State expecting more supply? We received 39 lakh doses. With over 23 lakh persons already vaccinated, we have a sufficient stock for the next 10 days. This is based on a three-day moving average. We have placed the next indent with the Centre, and are expecting 10 lakh doses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/samples-from-clusters-sent-for-genomic-analysis/article34156456.ece
25 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fuel prices see a slight dip||After a long hiatus, fuel prices took a dip on Wednesday with both petrol and diesel rates climbing down by 16 paise a litre. In Chennai city, the price of petrol came down from Rs. 93.11 to Rs. 92.95 a litre. The price of diesel came down from Rs. 86.45 to Rs. 86.29 a litre. Industry experts said that with international crude prices coming down, fuel prices are likely to decrease further in the coming days. The last time that fuel prices were changed was 24 days ago. The news about reduction in prices brought a sense of relief to consumers. G. Ramakrishnan of Besant Nagar said that he was relieved to note that fuel prices had started to slide down. “We had expected that the State and Central governments would reduce fuel prices much earlier. After the lockdown, people have been badly hit financially. If the prices come down further, it would be great,” he said. A retailer said the price reduction led to losses on their side since they purchased fuel at a higher price. Oil industry sources said that State-run oil companies were suffering losses for over 20 days now since prices had been kept steady for 24 days despite higher crude prices. “They had kept prices static due to the coming election,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fuel-prices-see-a-slight-dip/article34156412.ece
25 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Online forex scam unearthed, two held||The Cyber Crime Cell of the Central Crime Branch on Wednesday unearthed a major online scam in which more than 100 people had invested their money through websites run by scamsters, who were pretending to conduct foreign exchange trade. The police arrested two young men in connection with the case. The Cyber Crime Police said that on January 21 last year, M. Ashok Kumar, an electrician in Thiruverkadu, lodged a complaint with the office of the Commissioner of Police alleging that two persons had approached him over phone on an international call, and introduced themselves as directors of Deltin International Solutions (www.deltinfx.comandwww.deltininternational solutions.com), a foreign exchange company with branches in various countries. They lured Ashok Kumar into investing in Deltin International Foreign Exchange in order to earn high profits. Trusting the callers who claimed to be directors of the foreign exchange firm, the complainant had transferred Rs. 10.54 lakh to the website’s account through 11 transactions between October 17, 2019, and January 3, 2020. Later, Ashok Kumar realised that he had been cheated by the duo and lodged a complaint. The Cyber Crime Cell took up the case for investigation. Investigators zeroed in on Syed Abu Thahir and Syed Ali Hussain, who admitted to creating the fake websites (www.deltinfx.comandwww.deltininternationals olutions.com). They used voice over internet protocol (VoIP) calls for contacting victims and made false promises of high returns. The duo was arrested and remanded in judicial custody. The police seized Rs. 1.95 lakh and five mobile phones from them. Police said the scamsters had been operating for more than one-and-a-half years from Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/online-forex-scam-unearthed-two-held/article34156411.ece

25 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MMM doctors place stent in novel method||Surgeons at the Madras Medical Mission (MMM) took an innovative approach to treat a complex aortic disease in a patient. The patient was affected by malignant atherosclerosis extensively. The disease affected the walls of the blood vessels, causing both blockages and thinned out weak spots which balloon out and rupture. A large ballooned-out portion of the aorta, the main blood vessel, squeezed the nerve to his voice box, changing the texture of his voice that led to the detection of an aneurysm. The aorta as it passed through the abdomen had two narrow spots. The arch or the main part from which the blood vessels to the brain arose was severely diseased and the aneurysm ballooned out from this part, according to a release. Jacob Jamesraj, senior cardiac surgeon, MMM, planned to place a covered stent across the mouth of the aneurysm. This would normally be placed through the blood vessel in the thigh and it required a reasonably normal part of the aorta to land. In this patient, the thigh arteries were not suitable. The proximal part of the aorta was made use of. The surgical team opened the chest and prepared the structures. A graft or an artificial blood vessel was fashioned into a Y-shaped bypass and sutured from the proximal part of the aorta to the brain’s blood vessels. The team then moved the patient from the operating theatre to the catheterisation laboratory. Here, marking clips placed by the surgeon along with positioning catheters and fluoroscopy-guided the deployment of the stent. The stent plastered the walls of the aneurysm from the insides of the diseased aorta. Dr. Jamesraj said the entire procedure took eight hours and the patient was shifted out of ICU on the same day. Benjamin Ninan, chief of anaesthesia, said a few years ago, a situation like this would have required a heart-lung machine and circulatory arrest which had its risks, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mmm-doctors-place-stent-in-novel-method/article34156451.ece

The video was released a day after he referred to former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s comment made in the 2014 Lok Sabha poll campaign and said, “She asked, ‘Modi ya, Lady ya’. I am asking, ‘Indha Dhaadiya, andha Dhaadiya?’” in a public meeting, roughly translating as “This beard or that?” referring to himself and Mr. Modi. Mr. Haasan, who is shown standing underneath the Gandhi statue on the Marina Beach, says that Mahatma Gandhi wouldn’t have been happy in India today. “When we think that the Constitution written by Ambedkar would save us, there is a person from above telling us what to eat, what language we must speak and what to think. He is telling us how to love our country,” he says. “Look, just because your State is in the North, do not think that you are the high command. Look from here, we are the main door to India. If we think that one person will speak with this anger in New Delhi, he is crossing his arms in front of them,” he says before asking people to vote for MNM’s symbol, ‘Torch Light’. Party sources said the video was not a response to the constant accusation that he is the BJP’s ‘B-team’ and that he is only here to split the anti-incumbency votes. “When Mr. Haasan was critical of Mr. Modi during the lockdown, they said that he is the DMK’s B team. Now, when he is critical of the DMK, he is being called the BJP’s B-team.” “The video was shot much earlier and the truth is that he has been critical of both the BJP and the two Dravidian parties. This is a video that says that the State’s rights are being ceded to the Centre,” said one of the party’s general secretaries.

25 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Jaya||Ramya Kannan   One thing that stands out this election is the lack of voices that people have been hearing for years — that of late leaders of the two Dravidian parties, Jayalalithaa and M. Karunanidhi. Their speeches were a staple for years. Even during the 2019 Parliamentary election, there were recorded speeches being played over speakers, before and during meetings, or sent as WhatsApp forwards. This year seems different because these voices are missing. That is why the voice of Jayalalithaa, booming from a audio system in the T. Nagar constituency took people by surprise, but also gave them a moment of familiarity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/jaya/article34156421.ece
25 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Tough fight between AIADMK and CPI in Valparai||Elusive wage increase for plantation workers and failure to tap tourism potential are the major issues in Valparai (Reserved) Assembly constituency, which will see a tough battle for the seat between the AIADMK and the CPI. The alleged failure on the part of the AIADMK to deliver on these fronts will make the going tough for it against the CPI, which has consistently demanded that the wages for the workers be raised. Valparai, which spreads across a hilly terrain and a sizeable area in the plains in Pollachi, has largely seen parties fielding only outsiders. The constituency has a sizeable population of Kongu Velala Gounders, from the backward communities and from listed communities who are farm and plantation workers. Tea plantations dominate the economy of the constituency. Because of the low wages compared to their counterparts in Kerala, tea does not bring cheer to the plantation workers. The workers in neighbouring Kerala get a daily wage of Rs. 416..16, whereas the private estates in Tamil Nadu pay Rs. 343.27 and the estates of the State-run Tantea pays Rs. 333.27. During the MGR Centenary celebrations, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami promised a wage hike of Rs. 12.50 for Tantea plantation workers and Rs. 5 for those in the private estates. But, this has not been implemented. Valparai has more than 30,000 plantation workers. Of the total electorate of 2,05,335 voters, 59,000-odd voters are in the hills and more than 1.45 lakh in the plains. A.T. Janganathan, a merchant in Valparai says that in every election parties promise a paddy procurement centre at Anamalai, where paddy cultivation is second to coconut, an engineering college, a fire station and a Regional Transport Office. But the promise has never been kept. For the last two decades no concrete measure was initiated to tap the tourism potential of this hill town. T.M. Mohideen, who runs a hotel at Attakatti, says the wage issue and inordinate delay in tapping tourism potential will be key factors in this election. While the AIADMK has chosen to field T.K. Amul Kandasamy from Annur, denying the ticket for sitting MLA Kasthuri Vasu, the DMK has given the seat to Communist Party of India, which has fielded its former MLA M. Arumugam. Denial of ticket to the sitting MLA has resulted in a section of the cadre not extending their co-operation to the AIADMK nominee. There is discontent in the DMK also over the seat being given to the CPI. Till the last minute, there were rumours of Kovai Thangam of Tamil Maanila Congress, which is part of the AIADMK alliance, jumping into the fray as an independent. He had accused party leader G.K. Vasan of betraying him by not getting the seat for him. Valparai has voted Mr. Thangam twice to the Assembly -- in 2001 and 2006.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tough-fight-between-aiadmk-and-cpi-in-valparai/article34156475.ece
25 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. to re-establish COVID-19 care centres||The Coimbatore Corporation is gearing up to establish COVID-19 care centres, as it had done in the months after lockdown was imposed in 2020, to tackle the rise in number of positive cases. Sources in the civic body said the Corporation was looking at a care centre in its wedding hall in Sreenivasapuram, near Ramnagar, and at two more places – both education institutions. While the Sreenivasapuram centre would have around 75 beds and could be used for women, the two centres to be set up in the education institutions will have around 500 beds each. Similarly, the Corporation had also planned to write to pharmacies in the city to not provide medicines without prescription. The civic body was also concentrating on enforcement like slapping fine of Rs. 200 on individuals for not wearing mask and Rs. 1,000 on establishments for failing to ensure compliance with the COVID-19 safety precautions. From checking and slapping fine on fewer than five violators in the first week of this month, the Corporation had slapped fine on more than 300 persons and institutions in the last few days, the sources said and added that there was again a dip on the fine because of increased compliance after intensification of COVID-19 control measures. The civic body had also stepped up the number of fever clinics and samples collected. The number of clinics held every day was 50 and samples lifted more than 2,200. The Corporation has also appealed people to not delay testing or reaching out for medical advice. And, finally, it has also engaged in door-to-door awareness on the possible second wave of COVID-19 and vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-to-re-establish-covid-19-care-centres/article34156484.ece
25 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||SIMA launches contract farming for Extra Long Staple cotton||The Southern India Mills' Association (SIMA) has launched a contract farming project in Tamil Nadu for Extra Long Staple (ELS) cotton cultivation. A press release from SIMA Cotton Development and Research Association (SIMA CDRA) chairman R. Ravichandran on Wednesday said Precot Limited, Coimbatore, signed an MoU with SIMA CDRA for ELS organic cotton cultivation, by supplying all the inputs free of cost to farmers and with a guarantee to procure cotton at market price. Mr. Ravichandran said the pilot project would be on 500 acres at Semmandipatti village in Namakkal district. The organic ELS cotton would have a staple length of over 33 mm and be suitable to produce organic yarn of counts up to 80s. The crop duration would be around 160 days and the expected productivity was 10 quintals an acre. Though India is the largest producer of cotton in the world, it faces acute shortage of ELS cotton as the BT technology that was introduced during 2003, provided the technology only for long staple cotton. The country consumes around 20 lakh bales of ELS cotton while it produces only four lakh to five lakh bales a year. Nearly 15 lakh bales of ELS cotton is imported every year. The Central government has encouraged promotion of ELS cotton cultivation and is expected to announce a scheme shortly, he said. The Government is also encouraging the production of organic cotton not only to protect the soil health and environment, but also to meet the growing demand of domestic and international markets. Proposal submitted The SIMA CDRA recently submitted to the government a proposal for the development of ELS cotton, organic cotton and naturally coloured cotton. About 250 farmers attended a function on Wednesday to launch the pilot project, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sima-launches-contract-farming-for-els-cotton/article34156486.ece

25 March 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK betrayed youth, says Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday said the AIADMK government had betrayed the youth of the State by not providing them employment opportunities. Campaigning for the candidate of the DMK-led front at Thittakudi, he said the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) was giving jobs to candidates from other States and letting down the youth of Tamil Nadu. The State government had promised that jobs would be available to the youth, but nothing had happened even after two global investors’ summits were held. Mr. Stalin said the government had been making tall claims that the Global Investors’ Meet (GIM) had helped in bringing investment to the tune of Rs. 6 lakh crore to the State. When he sought the details of the investments made through the MoUs signed during the two summits, he was not given an appropriate reply, he added. He alleged that the government headed by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was “spineless” and was acting according to the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Our stand is that the AIADMK should be thrown out of power and the BJP should not get even one seat in the State,” he said.  Farm laws During his campaign at Attur, Mr. Stalin said the party’s first job after being voted to power would be to pass resolutions against farm laws in the Assembly. He said States such as Kerala and West Bengal had passed resolutions against the farm laws. “Once voted to power, we will pass resolutions against them,” he said. A separate agriculture budget would also be tabled. Mr. Stalin accused the government of speaking low of the protests by government officials, teachers and never called them for talks. Instead, the government threatened them with disciplinary action. The demands of government officials and teachers would be fulfilled once the DMK came to power, he said. Undeclared assets Referring to The Hindu 's article ‘Ministers’ assets more than doubled in five years,’ Mr. Stalin said, “These are declared assets. There are undeclared assets and assets are being accumulated in the name of benamis, relatives and in foreign countries. We will be voted to power, there is no doubt about it. Separate courts would be set up to investigate the corruption by Ministers. Stalin would never let them go since they have looted public money.”  The State government had promised that jobs would be available to the youth, but nothing happened even after two global investors’ summits were held||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-betrayed-youth-stalin/article34156461.ece

25 March 2021||DINDIGUL/PALANI,TAMIL NADU||‘If DMK comes back to power, land-grab complaints will rise’||If the DMK came back to power, land-grabbing complaints would start coming up, alleged Chief Minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami. Addressing a public meeting in Vedasandur Assembly Constituency on Wednesday, he said since in the larger State category, Tamil Nadu was considered an amaidhi poonga (park of peace), it was a preferred destination for industrial houses, including MNCs. For a State’s growth and development, maintenance of law and order was essential, and businessmen had no issues during the AIADMK regime. DMK men conducted katta panchayat ( kangaroo courts), unleashing violence. The AIADMK never encouraged anti-socials or interfered with police administration, he added. He said when farmers protested for reduction of power tariff, the then DMK government, headed by M. Karunanidhi, ordered firing on them. Now, Mr. Stalin claimed to be a friend of farmers. Mr. Palaniswami said for the welfare of farmers the AIADMK government implemented kudimaramathu scheme, waived agricultural loans and offered subsidy for drip irrigation facility. Unable to accept the fact that farmers considered him one among them, Mr. Stalin was calling him a “fake farmer”, Mr. Palaniswami said. The government had announced round-the-clock three-phase power supply from April 1, he said and introduced Vedasandur AIADMK candidate Paramasivam to the voters. Later speaking at Palani, Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK, if re-elected to power, would declare Palani a district headquarters for more effective administration. The government, under his leadership, had announced six new districts, he said. He highlighted the need for developing Palani on the line of Tirupati as a large number of people visited the town throughout the year. The AIADMK leader said DMK candidate I.P. Senthil Kumar (son of former DMK Minister I. Periasami) had done nothing for the people of the constituency. His government had announced public holiday for ‘Thai Poosam’, he added. Seeking votes for AIADMK candidate K. Ravi Manoharan, he said Mr. Stalin and DMK functionaries had the habit of criticising the AIADMK and its government. Mr. Stalin, he charged, always aspired to come up through short-cuts. Sensing that he could not achieve his goal this time, Mr. Stalin was talking rubbish, he said. In Oddanchatram Assembly constituency, Mr. Palaniswami said DMK candidate R. Chakrapani had done nothing for the constituency as an MLA for over two decades.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/if-dmk-comes-back-to-power-land-grab-complaints-will-rise/article34156585.ece

Releasing balloons with tuberculosis awareness banners in the air in an event organized near Gandhi Memorial here, the personnel attached to the Department of Medical Services (Tuberculosis) conducted a signature campaign also. Deputy Director, Department of Medical Services (Tuberculosis), V.P. Durai said the patients suffering from TB can be cured cent per cent by taking the tablets bedaquilin and delamanid prescribed by the physician regularly. Moreover, the patients would be given Rs. 500 during the treatment for taking nutritious food. “Those who are suffering from cough and cold for more than 2 weeks should undergo radiological and other investigations, which are done free of cost in the government hospitals. Since bedaquilin and delamanid are more effective than the combination therapy, the people should make use of it so as to eradicate the disease by 2025,” Dr. Durai said. In the awareness programme organised in Thoothukudi, Deputy Director (TB) K. Sundaralingam said 972 patients were undergoing treatment in the district. “If the patients take the drug prescribed by the physician continuously for six months, the disease can be conquered comfortably,” Dr. Sundaralingam said, adding that the drug should not be discontinued midway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tuberculosis-awareness-programmes-held/article34156780.ece
25 March 2021||KARUR,TAMIL NADU||Modi’s support strengthened government: Palaniswami||AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday said the support of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had strengthened the AIADMK and the Tamil Nadu government since he assumed office four years ago. Home Minister Amit Shah too, has been helping the AIADMK government, he said. Canvassing for votes for the BJP’s Aravakurichi candidate K. Annamalai at K. Paramathi on the outskirts of Karur, Mr. Palaniswami said that on several occasions when he met Mr. Modi, the latter had offered him a number of valuable suggestions to run the government. They had been very helpful to him in discharging his duties and responsibilities as the Chief Minister. “It is my first stint as the Chief Minister. Based on first-hand experience and the problems faced by Mr. Modi when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he offered me a number of wonderful tips to run the government. It is by following his advice that I have garnered goodwill among the people of the State,” Mr. Palaniswami said. Humble background The Prime Minister told him how he had risen to the top position from a humble background. “He asked me to concentrate on the welfare of the rural people. Despite his hectic schedule as Prime Minister, he took time to offer guidance on good governance. Taking cues from his valuable suggestions, I have implemented a number of schemes for the people living in villages,” Mr. Palaniswami said. The Centre had contributed about Rs. 1 lakh crore to develop infrastructure, especially roads in the State. It became possible only due to the cordial relations that the State had with the Centre, he said, countering the accusation of DMK president M.K. Stalin that the AIADMK was acting as a slave to the BJP government at the Centre. Growth, development and effective implementation of schemes would be possible only if the State government had a cordial relationship with the Centre. Mr. Palaniswami said it would not be possible to implement major schemes without the support of the Central government. It was with the aim of having smooth and cordial relations with the Centre that the AIADMK had entered into an electoral understanding with the BJP, he said. The AIADMK had promised the voters a number of schemes, which required substantial financial allocation from the Centre. This would be possible only if the State had smooth relations with the Centre, he said. Switching loyalties Earlier, canvassing votes for Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar in Karur constituency, Mr. Palaniswami came down heavily on DMK candidate and former Minister Senthil Balaji. Mr. Balaji, who had a history of switching loyalties at will, had been made a district secretary in the DMK. The irony was that Mr. Stalin had reeled out a list of misdeeds allegedly committed by Mr. Balaji, when he was in the AIADMK, and sought criminal action against him. But the DMK president had simply forgotten the charges and made him the DMK candidate. Earlier, former Minister M. Chinnasamy, who quit the DMK, rejoined the AIADMK. Land grab Speaking at a meeting at Vedasandur, Mr. Palaniswami said if the DMK came to power, land grabbing instances would occur. Under AIADMK’s rule, Tamil Nadu was considered a peaceful State in the country, he claimed. That was the reason many industries preferred the State, he added. At Palani, the Chief Minister said the AIADMK, if elected to power, would declare the temple town a district headquarters.          It is by following the Prime Minister’s advice that I have garnered goodwill among the people of the State||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/modis-support-strengthened-government-says-palaniswami/article34156459.ece
25 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Certain battles are rather fought at the hustings than in court halls: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, referring to a catena of decisions that held that there can be no violation of any provision of the Constitution in cases of termination of appointment to a statutory body by nomination based on political considerations, dismissed the plea of a man who was removed from Madurai Local Planning Authority. Justice G.R. Swaminathan observed that the petitioner appointed on political considerations was forced to leave as the political ambience ceased to be conducive and he should not complain now. Rather he should look for greener pastures. “Certain battles are rather fought at the hustings than in court halls,” the judge said. The judge took note of the submission made by the State that one who entered through the backdoor must also exit likewise. The court was hearing a petition filed by R. Selvam who was removed from his post of honorary member of Madurai Local Planning Authority. He sought a direction to be permitted to continue in the post. ‘Tenure not specified’ The petitioner was appointed in 2013 and the government order issued in this regard did not specify his tenure. Referring to Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 on the power of appointment, the court said that the Section also included the power to remove. It was purely a political appointment, the court said and dismissed the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/certain-battles-are-rather-fought-at-the-hustings-than-in-court-halls-hc/article34156592.ece
25 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Former ICAR scientist challenges check dam project in Kanniyakumari||A former scientist of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday challenging a government order issued to construct a check dam across the Pazhayar, the lifeline of Kanniyakumari district. In his petition, R.S. Lal Mohan of Nagercoil in Kanniyakumari district said the project was hastily undertaken without conducting any environment impact assessment study or public hearing involving the stakeholders at Thamaraikulam village. The proposed site of the check dam in the vicinity of Manakudi estuary was a wetland, which was classified as a biologically active and sensitive area with diverse flora and fauna. The check dam would have a disastrous effect on the ecosystem and endanger the biodiversity. Also, it would negatively impact the livelihood of hundreds of families in the area and could lead to flooding of the agricultural fields and coconut grooves. The project would also impact salt pans and intertidal mudflats. The claim of the authorities that the proposed check dam would prevent sea water incursion was not based on scientific study, data or analysis, he said. The petitioner sought a stay on the government order and to restrain authorities concerned from going ahead with the project. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi ordered notice to Centre and State and sought response in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-icar-scientist-challenges-check-dam-project-in-kanniyakumari/article34156586.ece

Kamaraj towards education in the State, Nadar Mahajana Sangam of Tirunelveli moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday seeking a direction to the Centre and State to declare his birth anniversary as ‘National Education Day’. A Division Bench of Justice M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi sought a response from the Centre and State in the case. In 2006, the State government declared July 15, birth anniversary of Kamaraj, as Educational Day, the Sangam, represented by its president I. Jowin Fortunate, said. The Central government also recognised the contribution made by Kamaraj and installed his statue in one of the halls of Parliament. Therefore, steps must be taken by both the Centre and the State to declare the birth anniversary of Kamaraj as ‘National Education Day’ in honour of the contribution made by him towards education, the petitioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-declare-national-education-day/article34156564.ece

25 March 2021||NAMAKKAL,TAMIL NADU||A farmer should win: Anbumani||The upcoming election is between a farmer and a political trader, and a farmer should definitely win, PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss said at Kumarapalayam here. Campaigning for Electricity Minister P. Thangamani, Dr. Anbumani said, “We all belong to the farming family and one among us should be elected as Chief Minister. Women are safe during the AIADMK regime, and not when the DMK was in power. Besides, there was no power cut under the present regime. The PMK joined the AIADMK alliance for social justice. PMK founder S. Ramadoss had put forward several ideas for development of Tamil Nadu. All those ideas had been implemented by the Chief Minister, he said. Dr. Anbumani said the Chief Minister had come out with a well thought out promise of washing machines for women, as this would only help reduce substantially the amount of water used. As Mr. Stalin trusts none, he has given Rs. 700 crore to Prashanth Kishore from Bihar to help him win the elections. Tamil Nadu would stand to lose if the DMK came to power, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-farmer-should-win-anbumani/article34156604.ece
25 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Presence of rebels worries NDA||The National Democratic Alliance, though upbeat about capturing “anti-incumbency” votes against the previous Congress-DMK government, is equally concerned about the presence of AINRC rebels in the fray and the prospect of losing minority votes. The electoral entry of three AINRC members in Orleanpet, Muthialpet, Thirunallar and the presence of AINRC chief N. Rangasamy’s two supporters at Thirubuvanai and Kalapet are giving anxious moments to the NDA constituents — the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Bharatiya Janata Party. While AINRC’s former legislator G. Nehru is contesting from Orleanpet as an Independent where the AIADMK has fielded former legislator Om Sakthi Sekar, in Muthialpet J. Prakash Kumar, formerly of AINRC, is contesting as an Independent and could upset the plans of AIADMK MLA Vayyapuri Manikantan, who is seeking re-election. Similarly, P.R. Siva, a former Minister, is in the fray from Thirunallar as an Independent. The BJP has fielded S. Rajasekaran from the constituency. Though not active members of the AINRC, the presence of Mr. Rangasamy’s former supporters as Independents in the Thirubuvanai and Kalapat segments cannot be brushed away by the NDA, which hopes to capture power. In Thirubuvanai, AINRC has fielded B. Kobiga, where former legislator and Mr. Rangasamy’s supporter P. Angalane is contesting as an Independent. In Kalapet, Rangasamy’s supporter A. Senthil is contesting as an Independent against BJP nominee and former Minister P.M.L. Kalyanasundaram. Rebels warned “Our general secretary has warned party workers against associating with three of our rebel candidates. If they continue to use party flags or the name of our leader, legal action will be initiated against them. As far as the other two members are concerned, they are not members of the AINRC,” said a member of the principal Opposition party. For the AIADMK, it is not just the presence of AINRC rebels alone that is a cause of concern. The party is also worried about which way the large chunk of minorities in Muthialpet, Uppalam, Orleanpet and Karaikal (South) will vote. In Muthialpet, Uppalam and Karaikal (South), there was a huge shift in the minority votes in the last Lok Sabha poll, in which party had an alliance with the BJP. Similarly, the AINRC is concerned about a significant chunk of minority votes in Villianur and Mahe. The minority votes constitute 12.6% of the total votes and could be a deciding factor in at least eight constituencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/presence-of-rebels-worries-nda/article34156920.ece
25 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Over 300 candidates in fray||The April 6 Assembly election to 30 constituencies in the Union Territory will have over 300 candidates of major and minor political parties as well as Independents taking the field after the withdrawal/rejection of affidavits. The Congress, which leads the Secular Democratic Progressive Alliance, has fielded candidates in 14 seats and is supporting an Independent in Yanam. The DMK is contesting in 13 constituencies, while the CPI and the VCK have put up candidates in Thattanchavady and Oulgaret respectively. Led by its founder and former Chief Minister N. Rangasamy, the AINRC, which heads the NDA, has fielded its nominees in 16 constituencies, the BJP in nine and the AIADMK in five. Another ally, the PMK, which did not figure in the seat-sharing arrangement, has gone back on its decision to go it alone and has withdrawn 10 of its candidates and will support the NDA. The sub-plot in the main battle between the rival fronts is the face-off between the Congress and the AINRC in eight seats and the DMK and the AIADMK in constituencies such as Karaikal South, Orleanpet, Ouppalam and Mudaliarpet. It will be the Congress vs the BJP in Lawspet, Oussudu, Thirunallar and Manavely. The highest number of candidates in the Union Territory are in Ozhukkarai and Nellithope (16) and the least number in Kadirgamam (6). Among other constituencies with a large number of candidates are Villianur and Orleanpet (15 each) and Mannadipet, Bahour and Thirubhuvanai (13 each), while constituencies with single-digit contestants are Indira Nagar, Raj Bhavan and Embalam (8) and Kamaraj Nagar and Ariyankuppam (9).

Rathinasabhapathy, who was denied ticket to contest in the upcoming Assembly elections by the AIADMK, announced his resignation from the post of Pudukottai south district presidium chairman on Wednesday. Mr. Rathinasabhapathy told reporters here that he had forwarded his resignation letter to the party high command which had appointed him to the post. Asked what prompted him to take the decision, Mr. Rathinasabhapathy said he had resigned from the post in the wake of the present political situation which he said had troubled him and hence did not want to continue the journey by holding the post. Mr. Rathinasabhapathy said he had served as the party's district treasurer for nine years and 14 years as district presidium chairman uninterruptedly. He had carried out the task given to him with lot of satisfaction. Mr. Rathinasabhapathy he said he felt pride in remaining as a party worker. The MLA said he had been consistently expressing his views from the beginning that there should be a patch-up between both “iyakkams” (referring to the AIADMK and the T.T.V. Dhinakaran-led Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam) but that his pleas went in vain. He expressed apprehensions that the AIADMK would face defeat and claimed that the party was facing a "setback" and attributed it to his suggestion not being accepted. Mr.Rathinasabapathy claimed that he was denied the ticket to contest from Aranthangi for having expressed his suggestion openly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-mla-resigns-from-party-post/article34156566.ece
25 March 2021||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK govt., a puppet in hands of BJP’||Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Wednesday said that the AIADMK government was only as a puppet which was being controlled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The AIADMK had been governing the State for the past 10 years. People had to think whether it was the AIADMK that actually ruled Tamil Nadu during the last five years or was it the BJP, he said while addressing an election meeting in support of DMK candidate S. Regupathy at Tirumayam. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who was in deep slumber in the last four-and-half years, all of a sudden woke up in December announcing a slew of schemes and laid foundation stones for various projects. He termed the AIADMK government’s announcement of waiver of farm loans and those obtained by the Self Help Groups in the run up to the elections as nothing but an act of fooling the people. The AIADMK had tied up with the BJP after the demise of their leader Jayalalithaa, he said and wanted to know on what basis and policy the party had joined hands with the Narendra Modi-headed BJP government. Accusing the BJP of being against Tamil culture and language, he wondered how could the AIADMK join hands with that party. Both Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Paneerselvam feared the ‘shadow’ of Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. The Centre’s stand on abstaining from a crucial vote on Sri Lanka's rights record at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva was a heinous act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-govt-a-puppet-in-hands-of-bjp/article34156568.ece

25 March 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Pinning hopes on caste votes in Mettur||The Mettur constituency could be taken as a one of the samples of whether the implementation of 10.5% of internal reservation for the Vanniyar community has worked in favour of the ruling combine. Vanniyars form the major vote base in the constituency which includes the Mettur dam that meets the water needs of a major parts of Tamil Nadu. The constituency has elected candidates of all the major parties in the past elections. Major industries like Chemplast, besides Mettur thermal power plant are located in the constituency making it an important industrial hub of the district. Agriculture is another major industry in the region. Farmers in the region have been demanding better measures for irrigation of farm lands. The implementation of Rs. 565-crore Mettur surplus water scheme, one of the long-standing demands of farmers in the region to lift surplus water from the Mettur dam to fill dry lakes in the region has obviously rejoiced the farmers. A total of 100 dry lakes in four constituencies, Mettur, Omalur, Sankagiri and Edappadi would benefit under the scheme. Despite a major industrial region, public in the region have been demanding better, expanded roads. They have also been demanding measures to improve tourism in and around the dam and development of the dam park. Tomato is a major crop harvested in the region and farmers have been demanding measures for better price and production of value-added products. The incumbent AIADMK legislator S.Semmalai is not contesting the elections this time and the ruling alliance has allotted the seat to PMK. S. Sadhasivam, State vice-president of the party is contesting from the constituency. The Makkal Needhi Maiam has fielded a young woman candidate P. Anusya. S. Srinivasa Perumal is contesting in DMK ticket and Ramesh Aravind is the DMDK nominee in the constituency. In the 2011 elections, S.R.

25 March 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||BJP, AIADMK have protected minorities: Panneerselvam||Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said on Wednesday that the governments of the BJP and the AIADMK had protected the minorities well. Campaigning at Edappadi constituency to seek votes for Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and other candidates of the AIADMK-led front, he said there was strong protection for minorities both at the national level and in the State. Land grabbing People would never let the DMK return to power since their earlier regime was marked by land grabbing and kangaroo courts. Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had recovered and restored to owners Rs. 3,500 crore-worth lands that were grabbed during the DMK rule. Mr. Panneerselvam appealed to the people to vote Mr. Palaniswami to power and enable continuance of good governance. Mr. Panneerselvam said the DMK never intended to find solutions to issues. Hence, Jayalalithaa had to move the court for a Gazette notification on Cauvery tribunal award during the Congress-DMK regime at the Centre. The DMK and the Congress could have stopped the war in Sri Lanka, but could not save Sri Lankan Tamils. ‘War criminal’ It was Jayalalithaa who passed a resolution in the Assembly declaring the then Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse a war criminal, and that he should undergo trial in the International Court of Justice. On investments in the State, Mr. Panneerselvam said that during the DMK regime, these were only to the tune of Rs. 45,000 crores. In its two consecutive terms, the AIADMK regime had brought in investments worth Rs. .6.87 lakh crores. It had also created 19 lakh jobs opportunities. Besides, 602 MoUs were signed and 82.4% of projects had been realised.  Krishnagiri Special Correspondent adds:  Campaigning for the AIADMK and the PMK candidates in Dharmapuri, Mr. Panneerselvam said the coming elections would determine who had the ability to provide good governance, and that was why the people should vote for the AIADMK. The AIADMK government achieved what the Congress could not. “The DMK- Congress rule could not fetch a single medical college to the State. But under the AIADMK, the BJP government at the Centre sanctioned 11 medical colleges to the State,” he said. Mr. Panneerselvam alleged that the ban on conduct of jallikattu, the famous bull-taming sport, was a conspiracy by the DMK and the Congress and claimed that the issue was resolved at “the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-aiadmk-have-protected-minorities/article34156441.ece
25 March 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Will pass resolution against farm laws: Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin said the party’s first job after being voted to power would be to pass resolutions in the Assembly against the contentious farm laws passed by the Centre. Campaigning at Attur, Mr. Stalin said States such as Kerala and West Bengal had passed resolutions against the farm laws. “Once voted to power, we will pass resolutions against the farm laws in the first Assembly session,” he said. A separate agriculture budget would also be tabled. Mr. Stalin accused the government of speaking low of the protests by government officials, teachers and never called them for talks. Instead, the government threatened them with disciplinary action. Former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi protected government officials and teachers. The demands of government officials and teachers would be fulfilled once the DMK came to power, he said. Referring to The Hindu 's article “Ministers’ assets more than doubled in five years”, Mr. Stalin said, “These are declared assets. There are undeclared assets and assets are being accumulated in the name of benamis, relatives and in foreign countries. We will be voted to power, there is no doubt about it. Separate courts would be set up to investigate the corruption by Ministers. Stalin would never let them go since they have looted public money.” Contesting Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s claim that he got Cauvery water, Mr. Stalin asked “Did he get an empowered body for Tamil Nadu like Kalaignar did? Mr. Palaniswami has got a powerless board under Jal Shakti Abyan fearing the BJP, and has betrayed farmers of the delta region”, he said. Mr. Stalin said that despite being asked repeatedly, the Chief Minister was incapable of presenting a white paper on investments the State had attracted. Highlighting various poll promises in the DMK’s manifesto, Mr. Stalin said women would be able travel free in town buses, the price of Aavin milk would be reduced by Rs. 3 while the procurement price would not be reduced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-pass-resolution-against-farm-laws-stalin/article34156488.ece

It comprises Sattur Town and panchayat unions of Sattur, Vembakottai and parts of Srivilliputtur and Rajapalayam. One of the oldest municipalities to get underground drainage, Sattur town craves for better roads and a good bus stand. Both Irukkangudi and Tamirabarani drinking water schemes have been inadequate in quenching the thirst of the town. The second combined drinking water scheme with source from Tamirabarani has been approved for the town. With increased commercialization in the town, traffic congestion is a regular feature in the bazaar area. The oldest bus stand is bereft of adequate space and facilities, so much so that long distance buses no more enter the town. Attempts to shift the bus stand made 10 years back has not worked till date. All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam staged a massive protest as an opposition party seeking a flyover on Madurai-Tirunelveli highway where it meets Thayilpatti Road. However, 10 years after being in power with MLAs (including a Minister) for two terms and an MP for five years, the ruling party has kept Padanthal junction remains a dangerous zone. However, the ruling party helped in decongestion of the Government hospital here by constructing an additional hospital building on its outskirts. An industrial park proposed by the previous DMK Government to provide employment has not come up in the last decade. Fireworks and matches in the rural areas of the constituency gives major employment to the people. However, the major fire accident at Sree Mariyammal Fireworks unit in February shook the nation with 23 deaths. Though plagued with an array of issues of public interest, the focus of this election has been taken away by the internal politics in the ruling AIADMK. Sitting MLA of the AIADMK, M.S.R. Rajavarman (who won in a by-election in 2019 after disqualification of the party MLA, S.G. Subramanian for switching loyalty to V.K. Sasikala) after being denied ticket by the party joined Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam and is bent upon to defeat the AIADMK. The constituency is facing a virtual triangle contest with AIADMK candidate, R.K. Ravichandran (younger brother of former Assembly Speaker, K. Kalimuthu), and Dr. A.R.R. Raghuraman (of MDMK) who is contesting on DMK’s Rising Sun. If battle intensifies between both AMMK and AIADMK candidates, belonging to dominant Mukkulathor community, it will give an edge to Dr. Raghuraman, who had garnered over 26,500 votes in the previous triangle contest as not so popular Makkal Nala Kootani in 2016. Mr. Rajavarman is confident that his work in the constituency during the COVID-19 pandemic will help him to sail through. He was the first candidate to hit the streets to meet voters in a whirlwind campaigning in the constituency. Mr. Ravichandran relies on his party vote base along with his familiarity in the constituency as the previous Chairman of Vembakottai panchayat union. Dr. Raghuraman says he has been with the local people even as a Government medical officer in various primary health centres in the constituency. A total of 27 candidates are in the fray including K. Pandi (Naam Tamilar Katchi), G. Marikannan (Puthiya Tamilagam) and M. Bharathi (Indiya Jananayaka Katchi).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/political-battle-overshadows-civic-issues-in-sattur-segment/article34156570.ece

25 March 2021||Sivakasi,TAMIL NADU||Labour-oriented fireworks industries face challenges in Sivakasi||Fireworks industry, the major employer of Sivakasi, has been facing a series of challenges right from GST to green crackers in the last few years. The issue of pollution has been plaguing the sale of fireworks across the country during every Deepavali festival. The industry is tired of fighting the legal battle in Supreme Court year after year. Few units are still remain closed after intensive inspection started after death of numerous workers in fire accidents reported in two units. Speaking of fire accidents, the Centre of Excellence for Burns treatment set up in Sivakasi Government hospital is yet to get a permanent plastic surgeon. Lack of CT scan machine that is indispensable to diagnose fractures in victims of fire accident to provide quick treatment is still eluding. On the civic front, the slower pace at which the new drinking water project is being executed has put the residents to lot of inconvenience as most of the roads have been left unmotorable for the last one year. Both the ruling party and the opposition have promised to provide a permanent solution to the survival of the industry. “DMK president, M.K. Stalin, has promised to pass a resolution in the State Assembly to exempt fireworks from Environmental Protection Act, a demand of the industry to overcome complaints on pollution issue, within the first 100 days,” said Congress candidate, G. Ashokan, who runs fireworks, matches and printing units. The former vice-chairman of Sivakasi municipality, Mr. Ashokan is pitted against AIADMK candidate, Lakshmi Ganesan, who is former chairman of Tiruthangal municipality. Ms. Lakshmi says Chief Minister, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, has promised to provide all support to find a permanent solution for the problems faced by the fireworks industry. Ms. Lakshmi listed out bringing a Government Arts and Science College in the town, construction of new bus stand for Tiruthangal and expansion of Sivakasi bus stand and upgrading the Government hospital in Tiruthangal and RTO office. However, the announcement of upgrading Sivakasi and Tiruthangal into Sivakasi Corporation few years back is yet to take full shape. Accusing two-time MLA, K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji of having failed to provide any constructive work for the constituency, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam candidate, G. Samikalai, said that is why he had to shift to Rajapalayam Assembly constituency. Despite 10 years after sanction, the construction of a road over bridge at Tiruthangal could not be taken up. Another ROB promised at Satchiyapuram to prevent traffic congestion too has remained a non-starter, he said. Upon mechanisation, lot of workers have lost job in match industry. Similarly, mushrooming of printing industry outside Sivakasi too taken away job opportunities and hence an industrial park will help, Mr. Samikalai said. Mr. Ashokan too has vouched of bringing an industrial park to provide jobs to local educated youth. “We are planning to set up a power plant that would run using the garbage, a major problem for the town, to make the local body self-reliant for it power needs,” he added. S. Mugunthan of Makkal Needhi Maiam, Ananthalakshmi of Bahujan Samaj Party, R. Kangapriya of Naam Tamilar Katchi, are among 26 candidates in the fray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/labour-oriented-fireworks-industries-face-challenges-in-sivakasi/article34156574.ece

25 March 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Thoothukudi’s long wait for basic civic amenities continues||The port town that craves badly for basic civic infrastructure for a few decades and indefinitely grappling with those civic issues throughout the year goes into the Assembly polls once again even as the candidates in the fray are giving tall promises as usual of alleviating all these issues with the magic wand. The dusty, basic infrastructure-starved and seriously polluted Thoothukudi Assembly segment is once again going into Assembly polls – the 15th election - but without any desirable change to make this coastal town a place for peaceful living. After the Congress won the first two Assembly polls in 1957 and 1962, the Dravidian party candidates are getting elected to the Assembly from Thoothukudi. While the seaport and the heavy industries, especially the coal-based thermal power plants that have taken roots around Thoothukudi indeed catalyzed the development of the town, environmental pollution being caused by these units is a major problem here. Consequently, the middle class working with the Central and the State government offices have started moving to places like well-connected Palayamkottai outskirts as they can reach their workplace within an hour from their home. And the annoyed residents’ concern over environmental pollution overflowed onto the streets in the form of protest against Sterlite Copper that led to police firing in which13 persons were killed on May 22, 2018 to haunt the ruling partymen here. Though the gruesome killing of trader P. Jayaraj of Sattankulam and his son J. Benicks due to suspected torture in police custody is not from this segment, the spine-chilling murder has sent the ruling party men and their allies to search for covers even as the DMK, the main opponent, makes it a poll issue after making it the police firing issue louder during the Lok Sabha polls in May 2019. “Since these incidents, both orchestrated by the police, shook the conscience of the entire nation, the outcome of the poll of this Assembly segment is closely monitored by everyone. In a sense, it’s a referendum on these gruesome incidents,” says a professor working with a government-aided college here. As the Thoothukudi Corporation, the urban civic body taking care of the development of civic infrastructure of this port town, miserably failed over the past few decades to check the encroachments cropping up along all already narrow main roads, traffic snarl is an inseparable part of this town. To add more miseries to this irritating issue, the frequently closed manned level crossings at First, Second and the Fourth Gate areas make things worse as the railway track passes through the town. Though there was widespread appeal from the people that the Thoothukudi railway station might be shifted to nearby Meelavittaan when the gauge conversion was taken-up, the people’s request was trashed, and the traffic woes continue.  The roads that were dug to drain the stagnant rainwater give nightmarish experience to the road-users, particularly during nights. And the ongoing smart city project works have made the roads unmotorable. The roads dug for the smart city projects make things worse further. DMK candidate for the upcoming Assembly polls, Geetha Jeevan, who managed to get elected from this constituency by defeating AIADMK’s S.T. Chellapandian, former minister, with the promise of ensuring regular supply of drinking water is yet to fulfill the promise even after 5 years. The Tamil Maanila Congress, an ally of the AIADMK-led electoral alliance, has fielded S.D.R. Vijayaseelan, a young businessman after the ruling party allotted the seat to the G.K. Vasan-led party in an apparent bid to avoid embarrassment caused by the police excess.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thoothukudis-long-wait-for-basic-civic-amenities-continues/article34156954.ece

According to Collector K. Senthil Raj, the wheelchairs will be kept ready in all 2,097 polling booths in 889 polling stations in six Assembly constituencies to receive the physically challenged voters at the entrance of the polling stations, take them to the polling booth concerned, help them to cast their vote with ease and take them back to the entrance of the polling station.  Ramps provided In this connection, all polling booths have been provided with ramps in the district. “To simplify this procedure further, the voters with disability can reserve their timing of voting by using PWD App so that the volunteer will be waiting with the wheelchair for the voter at the entrance of the polling station,” Dr. Senthil Raj said. The Collector handed over the wheelchairs to be used in the polling stations in Thoothukudi Assembly segment to Sub-Collector, Thoothukudi, Simranjeet Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wheelchairs-for-899-polling-booths-in-thoothukudi/article34156783.ece

25 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||DMK veteran Nehru takes on AIADMK’s new face||Contesting his fifth straight elections from the Tiruchi West constituency, former Minister and DMK’s principal secretary, K.N.Nehru, is seemingly on a comfort zone as the ruling party has pitted a new face, V.Padmanathan, making his debut in big time electoral politics. But electors in his predominantly urban constituency, who account for a little over one-fourth of the city’s population of about 10 lakhs, have reason to feel frustrated on the development front. For many residents, nothing symbolises better the apathy of elected representatives than the unfinished multi-level road over bridge near the Railway Junction. The project came to a halt after several crores of rupees was spent on it owing to the delay in getting just 67 cents of Defence land to complete the first stage of project. Construction of the ROB remains suspended for more than two years now after 90% of the project was completed with just the final approach road to the Chennai arm of the bridge still to be built. This is the first stage of the multi-level bridge which commenced in 2014 and was scheduled to be completed by February 2017. Anguished residents blame the absence of a strong political will for the stalemate. “It shows the lack of interest of the elected representatives. Ideally, the project should have been taken up after getting the Defence land. But so much of money has already been invested. Who will bear the increase in the cost of construction now?” wonders H.Ghouse Baig, a consumer activist. Narrow roads and traffic congestion, including in and around the Central Bus Stand, remain a major concern. Cramped for space, the Central Bus Stand has been perennially gridlocked while a proposal to establish an integrated bus stand remains mired in political wrangling and blame game. The pollution caused to the city stretch of the Uyyakondan canal has been a worry for conservationists and residents as well. Many extension areas such as Karumandapam lack underground drainage, storm water drains and roads. The rapid urbanisation and the burgeoning population density along Vayalur Road have left the narrow road bursting at the seams. “Given the exponential increase in the volume of traffic, there is an urgent need to widen the road,” observes V.Sundararaju, a retired government officer residing at Srinivasa Nagar South. With development issues being the key plank, Mr.Nehru is on familiar turf and is well aware of the problems. He blames the AIADMK for the stalemate in development in the constituency. A realtor turned full-time politician, Mr.Padmanathan, seem to have done his homework and accuses Mr.Nehru of failing to address the basic needs of the people in the constituency over the past five years as an MLA. He promises to strive for establishment of an integrated bus stand and relieve the traffic congestion. The DMK has won the constituency seven times since the 1967 elections while the AIADMK has emerged victorious on six occasions. Prior to 1967, the Communist stalwart, M.Kalyanasundaram had been a three-time MLA from the constituency. Mr.Nehru won from here after shifting from his native Lalgudi in 2006, but lost two subsequent elections in 2011, including the by-election held after the demise of N.Mariam Pitchai of the AIADMK that year. In 2016, he overcame what was supposed to be a stiff challenge from R.Manoharan, the then Government Chief Whip, rather comfortably and is confident of bettering his record. But Mr. Padmanathan dismisses the impression that he is up against a political heavyweight in the constituency. “He (Mr.Nehru) is no tiger; he is just like any other candidate. I have people’s support and will win,” he asserts. M.Abubacker Siddiq of Makkal Needhi Maiam and V.Vinoth of Naam Tamizhar Katchi are also in the fray in a field of 13 contestants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-veteran-nehru-takes-on-aiadmks-new-face/article34156583.ece
25 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||More tests being done to check spread of COVID-19||There was a good response to resumption of fever camps in the city to screen for COVID-19, officials of the Tiruchi City Corporation say. The camps, which are being conducted with the help of vans, are halting at designated areas testing identified groups including senior citizens and people with co-morbidities. Mobile fever camps are being conducted in areas where people tested positive for the viral infection, S. Sivasubramanian, Corporation Commissioner, said. On an average, about 1000 samples are lifted from these mobile camps in the city daily, data showed. As of Thursday, the camps are scheduled at the panchayat office in ward number 30 and in Nachiyar Palayam in the morning and in the evening, Adaikalamadha Kovil Street, Ponmalai. On 26, Fathima Nagar and Palayam Bazaar street in the morning and Good Shed Road in the evening. On 27th, K.R.S. Nagar and Convent Road would be covered in the morning while Cauvery Nagar, Singarathope would be covered in the evening. Meanwhile, in rural parts of the district, the Department of Public Health has pressed three teams into action in each panchayat union. ‘The three teams have segregated the population into high-risk categories. There are patients over the age of 60, patients with co-morbidities, patients with a history of Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses and patients with Influenza-Like Illnesses. Along with them, primary contacts of patients who had tested positive earlier are also being tested,’ S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director of Health Services, Tiruchi said. While around 1000 samples are collected in rural areas, at least 1000 more are collected at the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, Primary Healthcare Centres and Tiruchi airport. While the facility at the K.A.P. Viswanatham Government Medical College was testing around 2,700 samples a day, it would be increased to 3000 in the next few days, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-tests-being-done-to-check-spread-of-covid-19/article34156558.ece
25 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Rs. 99.73 lakh seized||A Flying Squad seized Rs. 99.73 lakh near the Pettavaithalai check post on Tuesday night. Four persons were called for inquiry following suspicion that it could have been meant for distribution to the public. Income Tax Department officials were informed. Some passersby informed the police about a quarrel among a few persons. The police found four persons standing close to a car that was parked there at that time. They told the police that those who were involved in the wordy duel had fled the spot. The police found a gunny bag nearby and on finding a huge amount, they alerted the Flying Squad. The Returning Officer of Srirangam Assembly constituency Nishant Krishna visited the spot. The cash was brought to the Srirangam taluk office. The four persons, who were called for inquiry, claimed that the cash did not belong to them, said official sources. The car which was found at the spot apparently had an AIADMK flag on the front. It was reportedly registered in a name of one Ramamurthy. The source of the unclaimed money and where it was being taken were not known immediately. Police said they were yet to receive any formal complaint regarding the seizure. A detailed report regarding the seizure would be submitted to the Collector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rs-9973-lakh-seized/article34156554.ece

25 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Absentees respond to show cause notices||Several teachers of schools and colleges and employees of other government departments, who did not attend the first training programme for polling personnel, responded to show-cause notices issued to them on Wednesday. According to official sources, nearly 300 school and college teachers, including those who had submitted medical certificates, were issued show-cause notices. The explanations will be scrutinised and while genuine cases will be considered for exemption from poll duty, the remaining teachers will be instructed to attend the training programme this week-end, sources said. On Wednesday, 62 out of a little over 1,000 teachers from all government colleges, government-aided colleges and the Bharathidasan University who were drafted for poll duty responded to the show-cause notice by submitting the explanation to the district administration, A. Megala, Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education, said. On its part, the School Education Department had issued show cause notices to 200 teachers who had not attended the training programme last week. In all, 369 teachers and employees of other departments offered their explanations for not attending the training programme on March 21. While the cases of those in maternity leave and explanations for other genuine cases will be considered, the others will have to fall in line and undergo the next training, an official of Election Department said. ‘More than 10,000 teachers of elementary, high and higher secondary schools from government and aided institutions have been deployed for poll duty in Tiruchi district. Additionally, the heads of high and higher secondary schools will also be drafted for poll duty,’ R. Arivalagan, Chief Educational Officer, said. Deployment of teachers for poll duty in large numbers has been necessitated in view of the increase in the number of polling booths. The teachers, after training, will be assigned polling booths where they would be posted as either presiding officers or polling officers. According to the teachers who had undergone the poll-related training, the extent of exposure they get in just a few sessions will not be sufficient for effective execution of the tasks. ‘Teachers who have all along been into academic activities cannot be expected to suddenly perform poll-related work which is more of a clerical nature, and warrants substantial training,’ a college teacher said. The teaching community, he said, was anticipating a positive outcome from the Central government’s readiness to link poll rolls with Aadhaar card.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/absentees-respond-to-show-cause-notices/article34156555.ece

Ms. Divya told reporters that the average number of positive cases had increased from five to 10 each day to between 10 and 15 over the last two weeks. She said that part of the reason for the increase was due to primary contacts of the people infected testing positive after initially testing negative. Preventative steps are being undertaken across the district with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) teams were being deployed in 108 ambulances to administer COVID-19 vaccine to people above 45 years of age in places where a high number of cases have been reported recently. Moreover, people who come into contact with members of the public, including auto-rickshaw and cab drivers, shopkeepers, traders and people travelling to surrounding districts for transporting vegetables, who are living in containment zones, are also being administered the vaccine through mobile dispensaries and primary health centres, said the Collector. Ms. Divya said that on an average, around 3,700 people were being vaccinated in the district each day. The Collector advised tourists and the general public to wear masks while leaving their homes and said that people not wearing masks would face strict fines.

25 March 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||AMMK alliance will be third front: Owaisi||The alliance led by T.T.V. Dhinakaran’s AMMK will emerge as a third political front in Tamil Nadu, according to All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi. The alliance comprises the DMDK, the AIMIM and the SDPI. Addressing an election campaign in Vellore on Wednesday, Mr. Owaisi said: “There is a political vacuum and people of Tamil Nadu no longer desire politics to revolve around two political formations.” He alleged that the AIADMK and the BJP were deceiving the people. “How can the AIADMK support the BJP-led Central government when it did not vote on the resolution raised against Sri Lanka for its war crimes and human rights violations at the UNHRC? The government does not have respect,” he alleged. According to him, in Vellore district, 75,000 people had lost their jobs in the leather industry. “The BJP in its manifesto has announced that it will bring stringent anti-cow slaughter laws. This will lead to more job loss in the leather industry,” he said. “The DMK [too] had previously aligned with the BJP. The DMK claims to be secular, but why has it joined hands with the Congress that supports the communal Shiv Sena in Maharashtra?” he asked. He said neither the DMK nor the Congress supported an amendment moved by him in the Lok Sabha against Citizenship Amendment Act. “Now, the DMK has the cheek to say that our alliance is a ‘B’ team, which is dividing votes. People of Tamil Nadu have to unite and save the State from fascist forces and from the opportunistic politics of the DMK,” he added. Mr. Dhinakaran introduced the candidates contesting in the election in the region. “This is the time to create a turning point in Tamil Nadu’s history by electing to power the AMMK-led alliance,” he said. SDPI vice-president Tehlan Bagavi was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ammk-alliance-will-be-third-front-owaisi/article34156959.ece

Jayanthi Padmanaban of the AMMK, besides the candidates of the All Pensioners’ Party, the India Jananayaka Katchi and the Bahujan Samaj Party, are also in the fray. Residents say this is the first time so many women have been nominated. G. Varalakshmi, of the Gudiyattam Municipality Federation of Self-Help Groups-1, is excited at the majority of the candidates being women. “It would be very convenient for us to approach a woman MLA and convey our problems... Women workers will benefit a lot as they can deal with the problems of women easily. They will surely do good for men too.” R.K. Mahalingam, secretary of the Matchsticks Manufacturers Association, Vellore district, feels the winner will have to work for improving the livelihood of women. “The handloom industry employs a large number of women, especially many who work with the yarn at home. The match industry used to employ a lot of women, but they lost their jobs because of automation. Women from these segments will have pinned their hopes on any of the women candidates.” Besides a solution to women-related issues, the candidates are promising overall improvement of the constituency. A few of the common promises are improvement in education, good water supply and establishment of a weavers’ park. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Amulu said she had been in politics for 15 years and had served as a panchayat union member. “People here want good water supply, a weavers’ park and good colleges. Each panchayat has different demands,” she said. Ms. Kalaiyenthiri, who entered politics four years ago, has been the Naam Tamilar Katchi women’s wing secretary at Gudiyattam. “People are buying drinking water. The quality of education needs to be improved. More government colleges and schools need to be started. We will ensure that youngsters get employment within the constituency itself,” she says. She has also promised steps to improve the livelihood of farmers. Ms. Paritha, who entered politics in 2008, says, “I will improve the livelihood of women and create more opportunities for them in farming and other areas. There are a lot of sportspersons in the constituency. I will create facilities for them to hone their skills. All the demands of the minority communities will be fulfilled.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/women-power-to-the-fore-in-gudiyattam/article34156436.ece

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||‘How can I form an alliance to get rid of corruption?’||Naam Tamilar Katchi coordinator Seeman is contesting in his second Assembly election. This is the third election wherein the party is going it alone in all constituencies. While the party secured 1.1% of the total votes in the 2016 Assembly election, it bagged 3.9% in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. It is again contesting the poll alone to become an alternative to the Dravidian parties, especially the DMK. In an interview, Mr. Seeman spoke about the logic of contesting the election alone, social justice, Dravidian ideology and his thoughts on Hitler and Mussolini. Excerpts:   This is the third election in which you are contesting alone. How long will you contest alone? Are you not feeling tired of spending resources without winning seats? Why would I feel tired? Is victory in elections everything? When Vaiko split from the DMK, there was an uprising, which fizzled out when he joined an alliance. Vijayakant had a similar uprising when he contested alone. It fizzled out after he joined an alliance. The Trinamool Congress’s Mamata Banerjee contested alone and lost twice. Didn’t she become Chief Minister twice after that? I want to get rid of corruption. How can I do that by aligning myself with these parties? Why do I need to align with Muslim parties? I will give seat to a Muslim in my party. Don’t you have any point of convergence with the Dravidian movement and its ideas? You have opposed the Dravidian ideology and the Dravidian parties vehemently. The Aryan-Dravidian divide is a fake, fictional history. [Tamil poet] Navukkarasar says, ‘ Aryan Kandai Tamilan Kandai ’, not ‘Dravidan Kandai’. The Tamils are a race and the Aryans are a race. Who are Dravidians here? The south Indian languages came from Tamil. Dr. Ambedkar says the Nagas were originally present in the subcontinent and the language spoken by his ancestors was Tamil. Robert Caldwell labelled south Indian languages as Dravidian. The Brahmins who came to south India are called Dravidians. I am being constantly asked: Who are all Tamils? Can they explain who these Dravidians are? [DMK president] M.K. Stalin said ‘ Tamil Kudigal ’ at a public meeting in Tiruchi. Why didn’t he say ‘ Dravida Kudigal ’? He said 75% of the jobs would be reserved for the Tamils. Why didn’t he say Dravidians instead? We may soon have Tamil-origin leaders occupying powerful positions around the world. Someone like U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris can one day become the President... My politics is for all life, my party is for everyone, but leadership is only for Tamils. In Kattabomman’s army, our ancestors Sundaralingam and Vellaiyathevan were generals. Likewise, my army will have every one; you can be the generals, but I will be the king. When the Tamils get elected in foreign countries, it is an accident. It happens once in a while. But, in Tamil Nadu, it has become the rule and fate. [Late DMK leader] Karunanidhi is followed by his son and then his son. Dravidian ideologues say Tamil Nadu would not have secured social justice if not for the Dravidian movement... I have given 16 seats to Muslims. Of them, 9 are women. What have they done for the minorities? I have given 21 seats to Christians... I have given more than 25 seats to Vanniyars, when the PMK has been allotted only 23 seats [in the AIADMK-led alliance]. Paraiyar candidates are contesting in 16 general constituencies when VCK president Thol. Thirumavalavan has settled for 6 seats in the DMK-led alliance. Paraiyar candidates will contest in close to 60 seats. I have given seats to candidates from the Kuyavar, Navidhar, Vannar and other smaller communities. I am the one actually ensuring social justice, but they will keep talking about how they are saving social justice. You have criticised the DMK and the AIADMK for corruption. Isn’t corruption a common issue throughout in India? The administrative decay is the reason for corruption... This is not my biggest issue. I am more concerned about resources being plundered. Who has given them the right to exploit sand and mountains? I can regrow the forests by planting trees but I cannot create mountains. How can we call it development when this would affect future generations? You seem to be attacking everybody in politics. Don’t you see anyone as an ally? Am I opposing Mamata Banerjee? You should look at why I am opposing someone. [Tamil Nadu Chief Minister] Edappadi K. Palaniswami said the farm laws were good for the farmers. How can I not oppose it? Can you clarify your comments that you wanted to consider bringing the AMMK and the AIADMK together with Sasikala? I didn’t ask her. When I met her, she said the AMMK and the AIADMK should work together to be strong. I suggested that she speak with them but she said it was not working. I understood how she felt. Then I said I would try to speak to him [Mr. Palaniswami] with a view to offering support. She agreed. He didn’t give me time and I left it at that. I tried to prevent the split of the TMMK [Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam]. But nobody talks about that. I am not going back on my criticism of Ms. Sasikala. You speak fondly of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and quote them in many of your speeches. Why? It is important to see what I am taking from Hitler and Mussolini. What is Mussolini saying? He says, “There are no rights without duty,” and “Live dangerously, the enemy should fear you.” I like these thoughts. Hitler says, “What are you looking for? A path? Just walk. It will become your path.” All revolutionaries think alike. When you make fruit juice, do you take everything? You peel the skin, take away the seeds and then, after you juice it, you filter it before serving. Take what is good in them and leave the rest.

The minimally invasive and pinhole surgery was performed with the support of an endoscopic camera inserted through the nose of the patient. Known as endoscopic transnasal transpterygoid excision, the procedure was performed by a team of surgeons at Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre here on February 25. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, K. Selvamuthukumaran, senior consultant and head, neurosurgery, said it was challenging in very many ways as the tumour was in a difficult-to-operate region. The highly skilled team performed the surgery with precision without damage to the skull. The patient, who was under observation, was free from the eye condition and was doing well. Senior ENT surgeon D. R. Nageshwaran said the patient was diagnosed with double vision for distant objects. The brain MRI showed presence of a heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue lesion. The double vision could be due to a range of factors including problems within the eye muscles or nerves that controlled function and movement or issues in the brain, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/double-vision-corrected-using-pinhole-surgery/article34156572.ece

25 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Stone inscription found in Bagalkot||A Vijayapura-based researcher has deciphered an undocumented 17th century stone inscription in Benakanatti village of Bagalkot district. A.L.Nagur, researcher from SECAB PU College, has documented the writing on a stone slab that is dated 1627 CE or 1549 Shali Vahana Shake as per the Indian Lunar calendar. Prof. Nagur describes the three-line inscription as a rare find as it is by non-State agencies. “It was not commissioned by any king. That is why it is rare. There are not many stone inscriptions about private individuals,” he said. Written in medieval Kannada script, it states that Veeranna Gouda, son of Giriyappa Gouda, began laying the foundation stone for a temple in the village. The temple is presumed to be the Maruti temple on whose premises the inscription was found. The date of the inscription is November 17, 1627. This was commissioned in the reign of Mohammad Adilshah, who ruled from Bijapur, around 60 km away. This shows that though the language of administration was Persian-Urdu, the language used by the common people was Kannada, the researcher said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stone-inscription-found-in-bagalkot/article34156612.ece
25 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Statement by Annasaheb Jolle, MP, on dividing district opposed||Kannada organisations have opposed the statement by Annasaheb Jolle, MP, that Belagavi district will be divided to create a new Chikkodi district. In a letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the action committee of Kannada organisations has warned that it will stage a protest if the district is divided. “Mr. Jolle has announced in Chikkodi that the government is planning to divide the district. He has also claimed that the Chief Minister has agreed to this proposal. This is unacceptable. This is not in the best interests of the State. This can lead to serious problems,’’ Ashok Chandargi, convenor of the committee, said. “The committee has been opposing attempts at dividing the district since 1997. We held a month-long protest across the district when the J.H. Patel government announced a division of the district then. We will take to the streets even now,” he said. “We have to maintain status quo till the Supreme Court decides on the border dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra. This was a promise made by successive governments over the years. It should be respected,’ he said. The committee has also urged the Chief Minister to instruct leaders not to make public announcements about the division of the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/statement-by-annasaheb-jolle-mp-on-dividing-district-opposed/article34156610.ece

25 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||CM: Direct recruitment will cost additional Rs. 12,000 crore a year||With the COVID-19 pandemic likely to hit revenue generation in 2021–22, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday said the government would do its best to strike a balance between revenue and expenditure, though borrowing loans would be inevitable to fund development activities in the State. The Chief Minister said it was not just Karnataka that had presented a revenue deficit Budget for 2021–22, but many States, including Kerala, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, too had presented such budgets. Mr. Yediyurappa read out a 21-page reply to the debate on the State Budget 2021–22 in the Legislative Assembly amid dharna by the Opposition Congress demanding a Karnataka High Court-monitored probe into the CD scandal in which the former Minister and BJP MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi is accused of sexually exploiting a woman after promising her a government job.  On the Opposition members’ charge about vacancies in the government departments, he said of the sanctioned posts of 7,68,975, a total of 5,16,073 were filled through direct recruitment. A large number group ‘D’ posts such as driver and data entry operator were vacant and these posts would be outsourced, he said. The State government would be burdened with an additional Rs. 12,000 crore a year if all vacant posts were filled through the direct recruitment process. This would again increase committed expenditure and reduce available funds for development works. Only essential vacant posts would be filled through direct recruitment in a phased manner in the future, the Chief Minister said. Noting that fiscal deficit was estimated to be Rs. 59,240 crore, which constituted 3.48% of the GSDP in 2021–22, the Chief Minister said estimated fiscal deficit in Tamil Nadu was 3.94%, Kerala 3.5%, and Maharashtra 2.24% of their respective GSDP in 2021–22. He said the pandemic had reduced the State’s revenue amounting to more than Rs. 20,000 crore in 2020–21. By reducing the borrowing limit to 4% of the GSDP in 2021–22 against 5% in 2020–21, the State was expected to reduce an additional burden of Rs. 9,000 crore and annual interest payment of Rs. 700 crore, said Mr. Yediyurappa. The State has proposed to borrow Rs. 71,322 crore by limiting borrowings at 4% of the GSDP. Total liability The Chief Minister said the total liabilities at the end of 2021–22 were estimated to be Rs. 4,57,899 crore, which is 26.9% of the GSDP. The Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2002, was amended to limit the borrowings to 4% of the GSDP in 2021–22. In 2020–21, the Centre permitted the State to borrow up to 5% of the GSDP. The State Budget and Bills related to the Budget were passed amid protest and sloganeering by Congress members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-direct-recruitment-will-cost-additional-rs-12000-crore-a-year/article34156382.ece
25 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Placements hit a new low||The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the job prospects of students, particularly those in degree colleges. With placements not as robust when compared with previous years, students say that they will be forced to take up odd jobs. C.B. Annapurnamma, principal of National College, Basavanagudi, said companies have been offering online placements over the past few weeks, but admitted that recruitment is low. “Firms are going to recruit less people as they are facing a financial crisis,” she said. Firms are changing their recruitment strategy in an attempt to cut cost. There is a growing trend of companies, who used to regularly hire graduating students, offering an internship instead. Many have decided not to hire full-time employees and are instead recruiting students for unpaid internships or on a monthly stipend, said Annie Fathima Shruti, Placement Coordinator, Mount Carmel College. “In keeping with this trend, the college is planning to hold a virtual internship fair in April,” she said, and added that recruiters are not only reducing the number of new hires, but also offering lesser c compensation packages. The situation is far worse in many government colleges where placement activities are not conducted on a large scale. D.S. Prathima, principal, Government First Grade College, Malleswaram said that placement drives are yet to commence. “Many companies are cutting costs, and do not want to hire at the moment. We are hoping that the situation will improve in the next two months,” she said. Students who have financial support have decided to use this dry spell to pursue a Masters after they graduate, but others said they have no choice but to work as delivery partners, drivers and in call centres. Priyanka S., a B.Com student who will be graduating this year, has decided to work in a call centre. “I would have ideally liked to work in a finance company where I could put my skills to use. But as my father is the sole breadwinner, I will have to take up a call centre job even though it does not interest me,” she said. “Our seniors told us that they were offered Rs. 15,000 per month when they were placed last year. The same company is offering Rs. 10,000 this year.” Amaresh Kadagada, State president, Students’ Federation of India, Karnataka said that there is a need for the government to intervene and act as a bridge between companies and college managements in the interest of students. “This is an unprecedented year. The government has to put in extra effort to ensure that unemployment levels among the youth do not increase further,” he said.  Our seniors told us that they were offered Rs. 15,000 per month when they were placed last year. The same company is offering Rs. 10,000 this year Priyanka S., B.Com student||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/placements-hit-a-new-low/article34156365.ece
25 March 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Cowardly’ govt. not seeking its rightful share from Centre: Ex-CM||Launching a frontal attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party government over the alleged financial mismanagement, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Wednesday described it as a “cowardly” government. “The Centre is showing a stepmotherly attitude towards Karnataka and is sacrificing the State’s interests by drastically reducing its share of financial allocation and subsidy. But why is the Chief Minister not demanding the State’s rightful share?” he asked, addressing a press conference. He alleged that Karnataka had lost about Rs. 5,500 crore of Central allocation. Pointing out that the State’s entire expenses towards handling the COVID-19 pandemic were Rs. 5,300 crore, he said this would mean that the State had lost its money which was bigger than what it spent on COVID-19 management. Pointing out that the government often refers to additional expenses owing to the pandemic to argue that it was not possible to provide additional grants to other projects or take up new projects, he argued that it was possible to prevent such a situation if the government had shown courage to demand its rightful share of allocation from the Centre. “Karnataka gives a total Central tax of about Rs. 2.5 lakh crore. But in return, it is getting a meagre Rs. 34,198 crore,” he said. He said the actual revenue deficit in the State was expected to touch Rs. 20,000 crore for 2020–21 as against the claims of having Rs. 143 crore surplus in the State Budget. Similarly, the revenue deficit for 2021–22 was also likely to touch Rs. 20,000 crore though it was projected to be Rs. 15,133 crore, he said. According to the prediction by the State government, the deficit was likely to touch Rs. 57,933 crore by 2024–25, he said, and wondered if it was not an indication of the State moving towards financial bankruptcy. He alleged that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa did not have any plan to tackle such a huge revenue deficit, let alone reducing the committed expenditure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cowardly-govt-not-seeking-its-rightful-share-from-centre-ex-cm/article34156384.ece

25 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Construction works up to Rs. 2 crore exempted from Transparency Act||The Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was passed in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday to exempt all types of construction works not exceeding Rs. 2 crore entrusted by any procurement entity to Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd. (KRIDL). The Bill amended the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements Act, 1999. The Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was amended to limit the borrowings at 4% of the GSDP in 2021–22. Last year, amendments to the 2002 Act were made to increase the borrowing limit from 3% to 5% of the GSDP following the pandemic and decline in revenue. The Bill was passed in the Assembly. This also limits the State’s total liabilities to 25% of the GSDP. The Karnataka Appropriation Bill, 2021, was also passed in the House to draw Rs. 2.52 crore from the Consolidated Fund of the State during 2021–22. All these Bills were passed without debate as the Opposition Congress members staged a dharna in the well of the House. Taking exception to the provisions of the Bill, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah told reporters that the Bill would take away the provision for providing reservation to SC/ST contractors for tenders with a value of less than Rs. 50 lakh. This is because there would not be a need to go for tenders for projects below Rs. 2 crore, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/construction-works-up-to-rs-2-crore-exempted-from-transparency-act/article34156380.ece
25 March 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Legislature session ends seven days ahead of schedule||Both the Houses of the State legislature were adjourned sine die on Wednesday, seven days ahead of the schedule, amid uproar over sex CD scandal allegedly involving the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. The legislature session that had commenced on March 4 was originally supposed to go on till March 31. However, it came to an end on Wednesday amid vociferous protests by Opposition Congress members in both the Houses demanding filing of rape case and a court-monitored probe into the CD scandal in which Mr. Jarkiholi is accused of sexually exploiting a woman by promising her a government job. In the Assembly, Congress members had commenced a dharna from Monday evening itself.

District Lead Bank Manager Praveen M.P. said that taluk-wise camps will be held shortly to address the issues concerning seeding of Aadhaar. While asking banks to have a platform to teach Kannada to their personnel, Mr. Kumara said that it was important that frontline staff of banks speak in Kannada. Mr. Kumara said that banks should conduct financial literacy programmes at the panchayat level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/400-students-yet-to-get-scholarship/article34156807.ece

25 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 spreading from schools: DHO||The case of 18 children of a government school in Bannur town of T.Narsipur taluk testing positive to COVID-19 has become a cause for concern with the health authorities claiming that the pandemic was spreading from schools, colleges, cinemas and large wedding events because of staying indoor for long hours and not adhering to social distancing norms. Mysuru District Health Officer T. Amarnath on Wednesday told a meeting of the Zilla Panchayat that COVID-19 cases had been on the rise and the infection was spreading from schools, colleges and cinemas because of the closed environment. The cinemas had been permitted to run shows to full capacity, after the curbs were lifted following drop in the infection rate. Now, the positivity rate is peaking, worrying the authorities who are fearing faster spread of the pandemic. Dr. Amarnath said 78 people who were traced as contacts of the 18 infected children had also tested positive. A decision on sealing the school or isolating it would be taken after consultations with the Deputy Commissioner. Replying to questions from the ZP health committee, the DHO said there have been reports of school and college students not wearing masks besides hostel inmates not taking enough precautions, and moving in groups without maintaining social distance. The complaints in this regard had been received and the hostels were visited cautioning the authorities to ensure proper enforcement of the rules, he said, adding that RT-PCR negative report is a must for the inmates who return to hostels after visiting their homes. Instead of organising weddings indoors in closed setting, outdoor arrangements would help besides strict wearing of masks and maintaining social distance, he advised. After reaching the 100-mark cases on Tuesday, the highest so far in the last four months, there was a moderate drop in cases with 74 testing positive on Wednesday. They include 52 contacts of the infected persons, 17 ILI cases and five SARI cases. Two deaths had been reported on Wednesday, taking the total number of victims to 1,044. In response to the norm of “test, trace and treat”, the health authorities here have stepped up testing and the number of swab tests has crossed 5,000 daily. This may go up further and reach 6,000 with more number of bulk swab tests done using the mobile units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-spreading-from-schools-dho/article34156855.ece
25 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Focus on DC village stay programme||The village stay of Deputy Commissioners once a month has evoked mixed reactions from social activists, from cynicism to optimism. But it has also ushered in a ray of hope for resolution of long pending problems plaguing the rural community. M.B. Prabhu, who works for the cause of tribal rights at Veeranhosahalli in Hunsur taluk, said at present the Deputy Commissioner can cover only one village a month. “But if officials below the rank of DC are given a specific timetable so as to redress grievances, the scope and impact of the programme will be manifold and benefit a large number of people as more villages can be covered.” Recently, Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru Rohini Sindhuri visited Yelehundi in H.D. Kote taluk during which she received nearly 130 grievances and petitions most of which could be redressed locally. She said the grievances would be resolved within 15 days. The visit also helped ascertain the infrastructure at the Primary Health Centres and it was announced that an ambulance would be donated to cater to the local community through the RBI Note Printing Press CSR funds. A senior official in the Revenue Department said this exercise will help lubricate the bureaucratic machinery and keep the staff on their toes. Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi said the village visits and grievance redressal on the spot is a welcome initiative as a majority of the cases are those that can be dealt at the district magistrate or deputy commissioner’s level and can provide relief to the people. Change of khata of the land, property mutation, land encroachment, lack of drinking water, issues related to power supply, condition of the village schools, lack of road connectivity and healthcare tend to cover a majority of the grievances. Also, certain grievances call for inter-departmental coordination and such meetings help in clearing the hurdles to pave way for redressing the issues. S. Sreekanth of Development through Development (DEED) of Hunsur said though village visits are fine, the need of the hour was toning up the administrative machinery in the revenue section at the tahsildar office across the district as bulk of the cases tend to be land or revenue related. Social activists said what is required is an impact assessment analysis of the programme after a few months so that a broad template for the entire State can be drawn for tweaking the existing institutions for greater efficacy. Mr. Sreekanth said there are problems that are common across the State. The government should establish a pattern in the issues and analyse why certain problems linger on even after so many decades and tweak the policy for better delivery. “Otherwise, it will be another PR exercise’’, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/focus-on-dc-village-stay-programme/article34156848.ece
25 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘TB is riskier than COVID-19’||Every three minutes, one person is dying to tuberculosis in the country, said Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri. Participating in the World Tuberculosis Day event organised by the Department of Health and Family Welfare here on Wednesday, she described TB as a silent killer and more dangerous than COVID-19. “The challenge before us is to eradicate the disease and there is an urgent need to educate people about TB across the district. We could not hold rallies or any awareness drives marking the day because of COVID-19,” she said. On the occasion of the World TB Day, all of us have to take the oath to put in best efforts for eliminating the disease from the State, by drawing the attention of public on the dangers of the disease, she added. Uday Kumar, Joint Director, Health and Family Welfare, said TB existed since centuries and the cause for the disease was not known. Though the cases are on the wane in Mysuru district, the disease could not be eliminated. India has set a target of freeing itself from TB by 2025 and efforts should be made in this direction with the support of the public, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tb-is-riskier-than-covid-19/article34156854.ece
25 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Mysuru gets sports talent search programme||The sports talent search programme using scientific methodology, a unique initiative of the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports (DYES), will be held at Chamundi Vihar Stadium in Mysuru on March 25 and 26. The programme conducted on the basis of scientific parameters including strength, endurance, mobility, motor capacity and speed will be held using various equipment and gadgets. It is aimed at creating a pool of talent from grassroots across different districts of the State. The sportspersons with promise, who are identified under the programme, will be brought under a Long Term Athlete Development programme with complete sports science support. More than 40 officials and personnel from the Centre for Sports Science, Bengaluru, which is part of the DYES, will camp at Chamundi Vihar Stadium in Mysuru for two days, carrying out a battery of tests on the budding sportspersons aged between 8 and 15 years in all categories. Boys and girls practising different sports disciplines such as athletics, swimming, fencing, wrestling, archery, badminton, cycling, rowing, kayaking, canoeing, weightlifting, sport climbing, golf, skate boarding, taekwondo, judo, gymnastics, diving and shooting will be taking part in the programme. Speaking to The Hindu , Director of Centre for Sports Science, Bengaluru, Antony Chacko, said the heads and managements of schools and other educational institutions in Mysuru had already been informed through the DYES and Department of Education officials to send their top two to three students, who are excelling in any field of sports, for the programme. After they undergo the tests, the results are analysed for various parameters to study their physical suitability for various sports disciplines before enrolling them for the long-term athlete development programme. Mr. Chacko said the Centre is going around the State tapping raw talent from the grassroots. Most of the sports teams representing the State comprise sportspersons from Bengaluru. “There is hardly any representation from the grassroots. So, this exercise,” he said. The Centre for Sports Science, Bengaluru, which came into existence in September 2020, has already carried out such talent search programmes in KGF, Kolar, Bangarpet, Karwar, Haliyal, Yellapur, Raichur and Yadgir. After finishing the programme in Mysuru, the team is scheduled to move to Madikeri and nopikoppa before proceeding to Udupi, Mr. Chacko said. Sports journalist C.K. Muralidharan said the exercise will help identify sporting talent early so that the boys and girls can be advised to choose the sporting activity in which they have inherent talent. Various physical attributes such as lower/upper limb strength, lower limb strength, standing mobility, and hip mobility will be tested scientifically during the programme, he said. Centre for Mysuru A Sport Sciences Centre will soon come up in Mysuru to help scientifically assess a sportsperson’s talent and chalk out a road map for their promotion, Mr. Chacko said. It will serve as a sub-centre of the Centre for Sports Science situated in Bengaluru. Mr. Muralidharan said the centre will have all facilities for not only training the girls and boys, but also counselling their parents and providing training to the coaches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-gets-sports-talent-search-programme/article34156857.ece
25 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Vairamudi Utsava’ held||The annual Vairamudi Kireetadharana Mahotsava of Lord Sri Cheluvanarayana Swamy was held at Melkote in Mandya district on Wednesday evening amidst curbs on large gatherings over COVID-19 spike. The utsava was limited to the devotees of the temple town in Pandavapura taluk. The district administration had barred devotees from other districts and other States from participating in the event as a measure to contain the pandemic.  As a precaution, the administration decided to limit the entry during the event only to the local priests and local devotees, issuing passes and deploying tight police security. The idol of Cheluvanarayana Swamy, adorned with the diamond-studded Vairamudi crown, was taken in a procession along the streets with the priests and devotees chanting hymns. The idols of Goddess Sridevi and Bhudevi were also taken out in the procession. Minister in-charge of Mandya district Narayana Gowda witnessed the utsava along with district officials. Earlier, the ornaments, including the crown, were brought to the temple from the district treasury and handed over to the temple authorities in the presence of the Minister and Deputy Commissioner Aswathi. Thereafter, puja was performed at the temple, and the utsava commenced with most participants wearing masks. Mr. Gowda said “I have prayed to the Lord to eliminate the pandemic and help us celebrate the religious event in a grand manner next year.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vairamudi-utsava-held/article34156359.ece
25 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC to help old-age home residents get vaccinated||The Mysuru City Corporation has taken up the responsibility of helping senior citizens housed in various old-age homes get vaccinated if they are unable to visit the vaccination centres on their own. Volunteers from the MCC would pick up them up and drop them back at their respective homes. This drive got off to a start on Tuesday and a few residents from an old-age home in Alanahalli got the shot. MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag, after launching the drive, said the MCC was ready to expand the free transport facility if more number of elders come forward to get vaccinated. The MCC took up this task after Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar, at a recent meeting here, told the district officials to get all senior citizens vaccinated by the end of this month. Mysuru district has 3.5 lakh senior citizens and nearly 65,000 had taken the shot since the third phase of vaccination began on March 1. Some government staff had been tasked to vaccinate at least 10 senior citizens daily for covering the target. On the call from MCC, the JSS Mahavidyapeeta gave a vehicle to carry the residents to the vaccination centres. The MCC is planning to cover nearly 50 per cent of the residents of old age homes by the end of this month. Accordingly, it has collected details of the old-age homes operated here and each one of them would be assigned a date for visiting the vaccination site after collecting the mandatory details for registration and hassle-free immunisation. With the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, the government has told the districts to step up vaccination and cover as many senior citizens as possible before March 31. From April 1 onwards, people aged above 45 years would be given vaccination, and accordingly more number of hospitals had been permitted for carrying out the vaccination. Major centres The district hospital and trauma care centre on KRS Road are among the major centres where the vaccination can be taken on all days of the week besides the primary and urban health care centres where the jab would be given on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday for free.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-to-help-old-age-home-residents-get-vaccinated/article34156859.ece

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Unorganised sector workers are yet to recover||The national lockdown wrecked livelihoods of people, especially those working in the unorganised sector whose lives are yet to return to normal. “People working as security guards, drivers, and as housekeeping staff have been completely wiped out, as offices haven’t reopened fully yet,” said Gayathri Vasudevan, chairperson, LabourNet. The second wave of COVID-19 and fears of another lockdown will mean further delay in revival of these sectors. Sadashiva, who used to work as a driver with a corporate firm but lost his job, first took to selling vegetables in an autorickshaw once lockdown restrictions were eased. But he returned to his village in Tumakuru district as he was unable to eke out a living in Bengaluru. Shantha Kumari, a supervisor in a housekeeping firm, has the onerous task of letting people go. “We have had no business for a year. Our employer is forcing us to fire people working with us,” she said. Unlike auto and taxi drivers, barbers and some others who received compensation from the government, people like Shantha Kumari and Sadashiva had no safety net. Ruth Manorama, Karnataka Gruha Karmikara Sangha, said the COVID-19 pandemic had hit domestic workers hard and exposed the heartlessness of employers. “Families asked domestic workers not to come to work, and stopped paying them as well. Hope the trend doesn’t resume with the second wave,” she said. One sector where the damage to livelihood has been recorded – to an extent – is the garment sector. Labour Minister A. Shivaram Hebbar recently informed the Assembly that more than one lakh women workers previously employed in the garment sector ‘are yet to rejoin work’ after lockdown as several factories haven’t reopened yet. Those that have opened are reportedly forcing employees to resign, according to a recent study by Garments and Textiles Workers’ Union. Ms. Manorama observed that job loss among domestic workers, sex workers, garment workers and construction workers has only led to an increase in domestic violence against women and children. A group that was severely hit by the pandemic was sex workers, who only recently staged a protest in Bengaluru against police brutality. Along with loss of livelihood, many faced abuse. “We are essentially daily wage workers. The lockdown and the pandemic hit us really hard. The government did not give us any relief package. Our trade was slowly picking up, but the rise in cases has already hit us,” said Bharathi, a sex worker. She added that ‘police harassment hasn’t stopped, and we are now being blamed for spreading COVID-19’. Meanwhile, street vendors face a peculiar problem. “Those who shifted to buying produce and staples online during the lockdown a year ago haven't returned to us. Those who have come back to us drive a hard bargain expecting steep discounts as they are habituated to getting deals online,” said S. Babu, president, Federation of Bengaluru District Street Vendors’ Association. One sector that bucked the trend was the home delivery sector, which saw a boom and rise in demand for delivery partners on apps. However, delivery partners complain of ‘insane work pressure and meagre incentives’. “The delivery platforms are doing roaring business, but that has only translated into bad work conditions for us,” said Tejas Kumar, a food delivery partner in the city.

The alleged incident took place on March 6 at the residence of Prashanth Kumar, a constable who is a driver for the Additional Director General of Police, CID. The main accused, Nagendra, is a flower decorator who had been employed by Prashanth to decorate the house for a family function. “Nagendra decided to rob the household and roped in his associates to execute his plan,” said a police officer.

The Minister’s statement left members fuming in the Legislative Assembly, with Mr. Siddaramaiah and R.V. Deshpande (Congress) demanding that he should apologise or the Chief Minister should drop him immediately. They described it as a breach of privilege of all the MLAs as well as the House.  Declaring that the Congress was ready to accept the challenge, Mr. Siddaramaiah said his party would demand a Karnataka High Court-monitored probe into the “issue of morality” as demanded by Dr. Sudhakar. The party also wrote to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in this regard. “Let the High Court Chief Justice also look into the issue suggested by Dr. Sudhakar along with our earlier demand for probing the CD scandal involving the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi in which he is accused of sexually exploiting a woman by promising a job and the episode of six Ministers, including Dr. Sudhakar, obtaining injunction against publishing of any objectionable videos involving them,” he said. Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri also took exception to such remarks by a member of the House. “Nobody should express their views in such a way that would hurt or affect the dignity of the House as well as its members... As the custodian of this House, I am equally pained. It is my prime responsibility to protect the dignity of the House,” he said. After his remarks created a furore, Dr. Sudhakar issued a clarification, maintaining that his statement had been misinterpreted. “I regret if it has hurt anyone,” he said. “No one bothered when Congress deliberately tried to defame and indulge in character assassination of six Ministers (who have obtained injunction). But my statement on asking them to introspect has hurt some people,” Dr. Sudhakar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sudhakars-monogamy-challenge-leaves-legislators-seething-with-rage/article34156389.ece

Addressing a press conference, Justice Aravind Kumar, a judge of the High Court of Karnataka and the Executive Chairperson of the KSLSA, said that the State government has already released Rs. 1,260 crore to be paid for settlement of several cases related to land acquisition during the forthcoming mega Lok Adalat. Reduce burden on courts The mega Lok Adalats will not only give relief to litigants by away of amicable settlement and reduce burden on courts, but also save crores of rupees for the State exchequer in the form of payment of salaries to judges and court staff, and other incidental expenses, he said. Justice Kumar said that settling a record 2.61 pending cases on a single day in the previous mega Lok Adalat on December 19, 2020 had saved around Rs. 102 crore for the exchequer. It would have taken 80 days or 87,274 man days to disposes of these 2.61 lakh pending cases for the around 1,100 judges in the State considering that a judge in the State disposes an average of three cases per day by taking the average of number of cases disposed in the last three months of 2019, he said. How money was saved While Rs. 39.47 crore has been saved in the form of salaries payable to judges and Rs. 64.15 crore in the from of salaries payable to court staff by considering the average salary per judge as Rs. 4,523 per day and the average salary of six court staff (per court) as Rs. 7,351 per day, Justice Kumar said. Going by this calculation, Justice Kumar said, the mega Lok Adalat held in December 2020 involving 940 judges was only Rs. 1.1 crore while the savings to the exchequer was around Rs. 102 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mega-lok-adalat-saved-around-rs-102-crore-for-exchequer-hc-judge/article34156362.ece

Early next morning, when his father woke up, he saw the front door ajar. “He went to check on his son in his room and found him dead. His throat had been slit,” the police officer added. The murder and the motive have the police puzzled. A preliminary investigation indicated that Manjunath had no criminal background. “We are now scanning CCTV footage from in and around the area to identify the assailants,” said the police, who are analysing his mobile phones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/businessman-murdered/article34156375.ece

25 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fronts raise the poll pitch in Vypeen||At a stone’s throw away from the Mangalya Sree Dharma Shastha Temple off the State highway at Nayarambalam panchayat were fluttering numerous hammer-and-sickle red flags. A folk band belted out live numbers engaging the audience awaiting the arrival of K. N. Unnikrishnan, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate in the Vypeen Assembly constituency, who was about to kick-start the constituency tour for the day on Wednesday morning. Eventually, the candidate arrived to the deafening sound of the burst of crackers. Don’t lower the guard trusting opinion polls and continue to work hard for the victory of the LDF summed up Mr. Unnikrishnan’s speech before he boarded the open vehicle shaded by a makeshift roof escorted by a bunch of motorcycle-bound volunteers with placards. “We have a head start and hold the advantage in the campaign. Congress is a divided house, and local leaders are nowhere to be seen, making their campaign very disorganised,” he said confidently. Three ‘mantras’ As his vehicle headed to the next reception point at Nayaramabalam Dheevara Bhavan, Mr. Unnikrishnan, amid bouts of waving, confided to The Hindu correspondent accompanying him on the vehicle the three ‘mantras’ of the victory of which he was assured: the State government’s achievements, the development of the constituency during his predecessor S. Sarma’s term, and the manifesto for the constituency his campaign team is to release shortly. In fact, Mr. Sarma’s achievements were a recurring theme of Mr. Unnikrishnan’s speeches as if there was no escaping his clout. ‘Party is united’ About 5 km away at Kolothumkadavu in Pallippuram panchayat, UDF candidate Deepak Joy was amid a similar tour, and he shot down allegations levelled by the LDF. He accused the LDF government of violating the faith of people and even selling off marine resources. “The party is united, and we are confident of a UDF victory. Under the LDF, the development of the constituency was stagnated, as even a basic need like drinking water is elusive for people, not to mention the poor state of roads and the challenges posed by sea erosion,” Mr. Joy said. He was accompanied by a slew of local leaders on his vehicle as if to project a united face. ‘Unique advantage’ Unlike his opponents, National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate K.S. Shaiju is yet to embark on a vehicle tour of the constituency and focusses on door-to-door campaign claiming to have covered 1,000 households a day across various panchayats in the past four days. He believes that being the sole candidate born and brought up in Vypeen gives him a distinct advantage with the electorate. “The Marxist party’s propaganda of portraying the BJP as a communal outfit will cut no ice with the electorate. Despite being a marine-rich constituency, none of the fronts could tap into its potential,” said Mr. Shaiju who claimed that the electorate would realise the need for fuel and cooking gas price hike to keep the Central government on a firm footing amid the pandemic-induced challenges. Job Chakkalakkal of the Twenty20 completes the electoral fray. “They have made their presence felt, and the question is into whose vote base they will cut into,” said Jolly, a 55-year-old local shop owner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fronts-raise-the-poll-pitch-in-vypeen/article34156720.ece
25 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Can crossover candidates prove their worth?||Walking over to a rival political camp and contesting the election as its candidate has not been that easy in the State till recently. However, the upcoming Assembly poll has set off such a trend in the State. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, which is striving to position itself as a third alternative in the bipolar polity of Kerala, has successfully poached a few faces from the rival coalitions to field them as its candidates. The Communist Party of India (CPI) had to put up a brave face after the NDA succeeded in convincing Thambi Mettuthara, a district executive committee member, to join the saffron bandwagon. The Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) readily accepted Mr. Thambi Mettuthara to its fold and fielded him as its candidate in Kuttanad . As CPI nominee, he had earlier served as vice president of the Alappuzha district panchayat. Prize catch Another prize catch for the BDJS from the district is P.S. Jyothis, former president of the Thanneermukkam grama panchayat, who had been the face of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the area for a quarter century. Mr. Jyothis, who first contested the local body polls in 1995, failed to get the party ticket in the recent local body polls. Mr. Jyothis, who nursed a complaint that the party failed to recognise his contributions, kept the decision to leave the party a secret. The CPI(M) got wind of his desertion only when the BDJS announced his candidature for Cherthala. Playing down his move, the CPI(M) maintained that he had been ousted from the party recently for anti-party activities. In Mavelikara, the BJP succeeded in weaning away K. Sanju from the CPI(M). Mr. Sanju was Chunakkara local committee member of the party for a decade and district committee member of the Democratic Youth Federation of India for the past three years. The political career of Mr. Sanju, a former local office-bearer of the Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha, has taken a new course with the BJP fielding him as a candidate. The Congress was in for a rude shock in Pathanamthitta when Pandalam Prathapan, a former secretary of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, shifted loyalties to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mr. Prathapan, who was among the probable Congress candidates for Adoor, is the younger brother of former Congress Minister Pandalam Sudhakaran. Mr. Prathapan had earlier served as vice president of the Pathanamthitta district panchayat and president of the Pandalam panchayat. In Kottayam, Minerva Mohan, a three-term president of the Poonjar Thekkekkara panchayat, perplexed the CPI(M) by shifting her allegiance to the BJP. Ms. Mohan, who was once chosen as the best panchayat president in Kottayam, was recently appointed chairperson of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) yogam women’s wing in Meenachil taluk. Real political test The real political test for the crossover candidates will come on May 2, when their worth would be evaluated in terms of votes they garner.

25 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Sand removal requires approval||The Forest Department has justified its stance that prior approvals under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act were required before transporting the huge quantity of debris that had accumulated in the Pampa following the devastating floods of 2018. Though the Disaster Management Act has overriding effect on other statutes, the debris collected could be transported outside the forest area only after obtaining requisite permissions as envisaged under the relevant provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, says a report filed by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Head of Forest Force, Kerala, before the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal(NGT) on March 20. “Such removals will definitely attract the relevant provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act,” it says. The Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta had taken suo motu notice of the news report ‘Kerala Forest Department told to permit sand removal from Pampa’ published in The Hindu on May 30, 2020. The State respondents were directed to file their independent responses to the circumstances under which the National Disaster Management Act was invoked for de-silting without following the necessary procedures. Controversy The sand removal had snowballed into a controversy after the Forest Department revoked an order issued by the District Collector, Pathanamthitta, permitting Kerala Clays and Ceramic Products Ltd (KCCPL), a public sector entity based in Kannur headed by a functionary of the CPI(M), to transport costly river sand from Triveni at Pampa. The report states that the KCCPL started transporting the accumulated sand/silt without the permission of the Forest Department instead of depositing it in the nearby forest site. The balance quantity of sand, silt, and the debris that was deposited in the forests by Tata Projects Ltd, which was entrusted with the Pampa rebuilding mission, for about two years had by now compacted itself. It had more or less merged with the forest ecosystem. It may not have to be removed any more and could be left for further stabilising at the site, according to the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sand-removal-requires-approval/article34156712.ece

Mr. Shah began his whirlwind election campaign in the State by attending the event. The BJP leader travelled in a specially designed vehicle from Kizhakkekotta Junction to the Poornathrayeesa temple premises as part of the roadshow and greeted voters and workers who gathered in good numbers. Scores of women party workers too joined the roadshow, which began late by nearly one hour. Party workers enthusiastically joined the event by waving the party flag and holding placards with the pictures of Mr. Shah and K.S. Radhakrishnan, the BJP candidate in the constituency. The BJP leader also gave short interviews to television channels during the roadshow. Party district president S. Jayakrishnan and party general secretary George Kurian accompanied Mr. Shah, who arrived in Kochi on Tuesday night. After the roadshow, Mr. Shah left for Kanjirappally by helicopter.

25 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||An iconic satire’s re-emergence in the time of election||The Palarivattom flyover, found damaged soon after it was commissioned and was subsequently rebuilt, is finding repeated mention as electioneering to the State Assembly polls is catching up. Campaigning for the Left, poet Balachandran Chullikkad used it as a metaphor suggesting that the flyover symbolised the political, social and economic life of Kerala. “What the UDF did to the flyover represented what they did to Kerala society and the what the LDF did to the flyover showed what they did for the people of Kerala,” he said, adding that this was one of the reasons why he was canvassing votes for the Left front. As a video of the speech made in Thrikkakara went viral, original posters of K.G. George’s iconic satire, Panchavadippalam appeared in several parts of Ernakulam, reminding people of the plight of a bridge in the film and the similar fate faced by the Palarivattom flyover. The posters do not carry any political messaging, but there is discussion on the similarity, citing the Kerala High Court’s reference to the Palarivattom flyover as ‘Panchavadippalam’. Palarivattom falls within the Thrikkakara Assembly constituency. After the flyover built during the UDF government was found to have developed cracks, the Left government proposed to rebuild it after extensive consultations. But the contractors opposed it, and the issue went into litigation following which the flyover was rebuilt and reopened to traffic in record time early this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-iconic-satires-reemergence-in-the-time-of-elections/article34156722.ece

He said that since the floods of August 2019, music programmes had been cancelled. The situation became very grim after the lockdown came into effect in March last year in the wake of the pandemic. However, while most activities had been allowed to return to normal levels, concerts and artistic programmes had been restricted.  The protest in Kochi was part of the Kerala-wide action to draw the attention of the authorities. Musicians expressed their protest in different parts of the State, including small towns, on Wednesday, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/musicians-stage-protest-against-curbs-on-programmes/article34156724.ece
25 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Kochi’s prime waterfront space in ruins||The vast space atop the Ernakulam boat jetty building that provides an unmatched view of the Marine Drive waterfront and ships sailing into the harbour is in ruins and has become a haven for miscreants owing to shoddy upkeep and slack coordination among different government departments which have stakes in the premises. The building, constructed two decades ago by Kerala Tourism, occupies prime space along the Marine Drive waterfront. Apart from multiple boat jetties and offices of the State Water Transport Department (SWTD), it also houses the regional office of Kerala Tourism. Making matters worse, over half-a-dozen abandoned ferries of the SWTD occupy substantial space, making them eyesores on the otherwise pristine waterfront. The abysmal upkeep of the space atop the building and the alleged differences of opinion among Kerala Tourism, Revenue Department, and the Kochi Corporation over the handing over of the title deed to the tourism agency and allocation of building number, have resulted in Kerala Tourism not able to rent out the vast prime space for eateries and other commercial purposes. On its part, the tourism agency has not bothered to engage staff to ensure cleanliness at the space which gets ample natural breeze and sunlight. A gory welcome Dead pigeons, bird droppings, and cobweb-infested corridors stare at visitors. Over the years, all this has made it a den for illicit activities, prompting the closure of either end of the vast space on the building’s second floor, which was once an extension of the Marine Drive walkway. “The space fell into disuse years ago after the Kochi Corporation objected to it being rented out to a cafeteria. We hope to tidy the space and cover it with nets to prevent entry of pigeons and other birds. Much more can be done if the Revenue Department hands over possession of the land that houses the boat jetty complex to us,” said sources in Kerala Tourism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochis-prime-waterfront-space-in-ruins/article34156707.ece

25 March 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Rivals symbols of graft: Shah||The Congress and the Communist parties have become symbols of corruption and can do nothing for the people of Kerala, said Union Home Minister Amit Shah here on Wednesday. "Communists have become extinct across the globe and the Congress party has come to an end in India. Only the leadership of (PM) Narendra Modi and E. Sreedharan can help Kerala,” he said, while inaugurating the NDA campaign meeting in Paravur. The Union Minister observed that though the BJP is not in power in the State, the Centre has implemented several projects in Kerala, including the recently inaugurated 2,000-MW Pugalur-Thrissur High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) project. “If elected, the BJP will make Kerala the best State in five years," he said. Urging the voters of the State to come out of the LDF-UDF loop, he said that both the fronts have been trying to destroy the tradition and culture of India. "Kerala is a land of great social reformers such as Sree Narayana Guru, Chattambi Swami and Aayyankali. But the LDF and the UDF have destroyed all traditions and customs in God's Own Country, causing great damage to our culture,” he said. Hub of corruption Mr. Shah said Kerala, a State where corruption was unheard of, has gained notoriety due to scams. "There was a time when Kerala was considered the most educated State and a global tourism hotspot. But now the Congress and the Communist parties have turned it into a hub of corruption. If Congress is in power, there is solar scam and if the communists take over, there is dollar scam. (CM) Pinarayi (Vijayan) can't escape the scam and he should answer the public if his principal secretary was involved in the gold smuggling scam and why the main accused used to frequent his house. Had it been any other Chief Minister, he would have resigned." On Sabarimala issue Talking about the Sabarimala issue, Mr. Shah said communists were bent on destroying India’s tradition and culture and the government should leave temples to devotees. "Nowhere in India the faithful have to face the kind of atrocities Ayyappa devotees were subjected to.” Taking a dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and terming his recent visits to the State as 'picnics', he said the Congress leadership was confused and delusional. "While fighting the Left in Kerala, his party has formed an alliance with them in West Bengal. In Kerala, they ally with the IUML and in Assam, they have joined hands with (perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal (of the AIUDF). At the same time, they are enjoying power along with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. I have never seen such a 'secular' party before," he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rivals-symbols-of-graft-shah/article34156700.ece
25 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||LDF, NSS spar over Sabarimala issue||As the Assembly polls are nearing, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Nair Service Society (NSS) appear to be slugging it out in a conflict of narratives over the Sabarimala issue. The latest round of battle was triggered by a recent statement by Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran purportedly expressing regret over the developments in connection with the entry of women at the temple. With both sides determined to fight their corner, what seemed certain was that this war of words would intensify in the run up to the election. After a cold war of words, the sparring between the two sides hit a crescendo on Wednesday when Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan expressed his displeasure over the relentless criticism by the community organisation on the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government. Asserting that the NSS’s position indeed raised some suspicions, he even asked the mediapersons to find out the reason with its general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair. No issues with NSS “The common people have an opinion on how the NSS looks at the government. It is up to Mr. Nair to take notice of this. I have no issues with the NSS and so does the State government,” Mr. Vijayan said. Joining Mr. Vijayan in this round were two Ministers in his Cabinet, M.M. Mani and K.K. Shylaja, who also sought to question the political motives of the organisation. Equidistance policy The NSS, on its part, saw these remarks as essentially oppositional that forced a reply. In a statement, Mr. Nair reiterated its long-held policy of equidistance to all political parties and also warned against any attempt to intimidate the community organisation. According to the NSS, it has forwarded only three demands to the government. They were to adopt a stance in support of the Sabarimala devotees, implementation of 10% reservation for economically weaker sections among the upper castes, and the declaration of Mannam Jayanti as a holiday under the negotiable instruments act. Of these, people know where does the Sabarimala issue stands currently. Regarding the reservation issue, the EWS are yet to avail themselves of the benefit of the policy due to the delay in publishing the list of beneficiaries. On the Mannam Jayanti, the government has simply dismissed all the petitions submitted by the NSS. “Let those criticising the NSS of pursuing political agenda explain the political angle of these three demands,” noted Mr. Nair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-nss-spar-over-sabarimala-issue/article34156726.ece
25 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||A red fortress shows signs of faltering||Voters in Beypore have long forgotten the maverick electoral experiment CoLeBi (short for Congress-League-BJP) alliance of the 1991 Assembly polls in their constituency. But the waves of the political engineering conceived by the BJP as a quid-pro-quo relationship with the Congress-Indian Union Muslim League combine to secure a seat in the legislature still hit the shoreline of this ancient port town and elsewhere in the State. CoLeBi experiment Electoral politics of Beypore has remained the same after the CoLeBi experiment failed to take off with the CPI(M) winning the seat and the party maintaining that winning streak. But the so-called unbreachable red fortress is showing signs of faltering with the BJP making a dent in the vote share of the CPI(M). A reason to be cited is the interplay of religion and politics in the segment that has Hindus and Muslims equally sharing the demographic profile. The CPI(M) has fielded Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) president P.A. Mohammed Riyas, who is entering the fray after a hiatus following his debacle in the 2009 Lok Sabha election. He had also tasted defeat in his maiden electoral contest from the Palayam division in the Kozhikode Corporation polls in 2005. His candidacy with the tag ‘the son-in-law of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’ has given the constituency a glamour quotient. But old-timers believe that the meteoric rise of Mr. Riyas would also be a liability for the party in the polls. Others strongly feel that a new power centre led by him is emerging in the party. Strong undercurrents in the form of religious polarisation could also mar his chances. Many including local leaders as well as former Mayor and incumbent legislator V.K.C. Mammed Koya had set their eyes on the seat. But his poll managers are confident that Mr. Riyas will sail through even in the fiercest electoral storm. In the recent 2020 local body polls, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) secured a lead of over 5,000 votes in the constituency. However, it lost the Feroke and Ramanattukara municipalities to the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). In an attempt to capture the seat, the Congress has fielded Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary and Kozhikode Corporation councillor P.M. Niyas, son of the late trade unionist K. Sadiikoya. But his electioneering has been debilitated by factionalism in the party and hamstrung by financial resources. Anti-incumbency factor However, the victory of the Congress in the last Lok Sabha polls has greatly boosted the morale of the party workers who believe that the anti-incumbency factor will work in his favour. Meanwhile, the BJP, which is slowly making inroads in Beypore, has fielded its State secretary Prakash Babu, who is contesting for the second time in a row. He also unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha polls from Kozhikode in 2019. At best, the party can improve its performance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-red-fortress-shows-signs-of-faltering/article34156764.ece

They took out a protest march to the PWD office on Wednesday to drive home their point. According to functionaries of the medical college students union, the existing hostel buildings are quite old and are in a dilapidated condition. Five to six first-year and second-year undergraduate students are forced to live in one room. “In these pandemic times, when we urge everyone else to observe social protocol, future doctors are not able to observe it. And, this is the condition in one of the best medical colleges in the government sector in the State,” one union functionary said. The students had earlier written to Health Minister K.K. Shylaja and Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran. In the letter, they said the hostel facilities had not been improved even after raising the student intake each year from 200 to 250. In reply to a query under the Right to Information Act, PWD officials had said Rs. 14 crore had been allocated in 2016 and Rs. 8 crore in 2019 for constructing hostel buildings. However, the work is yet to start because the design wing of the department was not acting on the proposal, the RTI reply said. The college principal too claimed that the funds for the building construction had been transferred to the PWD, the students added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/medicos-seek-early-completion-of-hostel-buildings-in-kozhikode/article34156702.ece

25 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||‘BJP will make major inroads this elections’||0Both the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and the Congress engage in accusing each other of having an electoral tie-up with the BJP in any elections only to conceal their hypocrisy of having an open alliance between them in many other States, including Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, BJP State general secretary M.T. Ramesh has said. “Their leaders employ this tactic against each other to run away from real political issues. In Tamil Nadu, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury is star campaigner for the Congress and the IUML. Similarly, the Congress leaders are actively electioneering for the CPI(M) candidates. The fact is that they are in alliance and are united in the polls,” he told The Hindu . Mr. Ramesh, who is in the fray from the Kozhikode North Assembly constituency, said the BJP would make a tremendous impact in the coming Assembly polls. “The people are fed-up with the politics of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF). A new alternative political situation favouring the BJP has evolved in the State. So the party has fielded candidates from different walks of the life,” he said. The focus of the BJP in these polls, he said was that Kerala desperately needed a change and that the State should travel on the development path envisaged by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. “We are presenting before the people to accept the development and welfare schemes implemented by the BJP-led government in the country in the last six years years,” he said. Party objective Stressing that the objective of the BJP is to form a government in the State, Mr. Ramesh said that the party considered the Congress-led UDF as well as the CPI(M)-led LDF on the same page. “However, the approach of the party towards them also depends on the political anatomy in each Assembly constituency,” he said. On the Sabarimala issue, he said the BJP would not make it as a dominant issue in the elections. “Sabarimala is already on the minds of the people. It is the CPI(M) and the Congress that attempted to rake up the issue. This will be a setback for them. The devotees are well aware which party stood for them,” Mr. Ramesh said.  A new alternative political situation favouring the BJP has evolved in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-will-make-major-inroads-this-elections/article34156766.ece
25 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Women make a mark in Kozhikode||When the final list of candidates in Kozhikode district was announced, just around 10% of them were women. The 10 women are contesting to the Assembly from Koyilandy, Kozhikode South, Vadakara, and Balussery. K.K. Rema of the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) is contesting from Vadakara as a UDF candidate. Rema’s candidature was announced after a lot of suspense and drama, as she had refused to contest in the beginning. The UDF offered to support the RMP only if she was the candidate. Since her candidature was finalised at the last minute, she was far behind her opponents on the campaign front, but is catching up fast. Rema had contested from Vadakara in 2016 and had been in the third position behind her present opponent Manayath Chandran. However, with the changed political dynamics, Rema’s possibilities of victory are far better. Noorbina Rashid, contesting from Kozhikode South, is notable for the reason that she is the first woman to be fielded by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) after a quarter of a century. A lawyer by profession and having donned various mantles, including that of the corporation councillor and member of the Kerala Women’s Commission, Ms. Rasheed’s candidature is considered unconventional, yet a risky step by the party. Her non-involvement in ground-level politics had initially caused minor disgruntlement among party workers, which was soon resolved by senior leaders. However, reports are that party workers are trying hard to catch up with her dedication and boldness during campaigning. District panchayat president Kanathil Jameela is the lone woman fielded by the LDF in the district. Contesting from Koyilandy, Ms. Jameela is riding on the developmental activities carried out by sitting MLA K. Dasan and the LDF government in general. She is a familiar face in the district as a people’s representative, especially her previous tenure as the district panchayat president, during which she initiated several welfare projects, including ‘Snehasparsam’ for kidney patients. Navya Haridas of the BJP is not a familiar name outside the Kozhikode Corporation, but her candidature against Ms. Rashid in Kozhikode South catapulted her to fame. Navya, a former IT professional, is known as bold and dedicated as Ms. Rasheed, but without experience in politics. The youngest of the lot, she is the BJP’s lone woman candidate in the district. Of the remaining six candidates, five are namesakes. Among them are Jameela P.P. in Koyilandy, Mubeena in Kozhikode South, and three Remas (K.T.K. Rema, Rema K.K., and Rema) in Vadakara. Chandrika N.K., fielded by the Welfare Party of India in Balussery, is the remaining one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/women-make-a-mark-in-kozhikode/article34156694.ece

Mr. Ramachandran was speaking after releasing the ‘development document’ highlighting the achievements of sitting MLA and UDF candidate in the Thiruvananthapuram constituency, V. S.

25 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Corpn.’s Plan expenditure at 55.25%||With one week remaining in the financial year, the city Corporation’s plan expenditure this year stood at 55.25%, as on Wednesday. Considering the number of bills that are remaining to be submitted and passed from the treasury, the civic body officials expect the expenditure for the year to be anywhere between 65 to 70%. According to city Corporation Secretary Binu Francis, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the local body elections had reduced the time and resources available for the Corporation last year. “During this financial year, much of the time was lost in various activities to contain COVID-19 and in relief efforts. Almost from March to August, the Corporation was focussed only on COVID-19 related activities. Later, almost two months was used up during the local body elections, during which many of the employees here were deployed for election work. Now, for the past few weeks, quite a few employees have again been deployed for the assembly election work. So, the time available for plan implementation during this financial year was quite less,” Mr.Francis told The Hindu . This year, the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has a total plan fund allocation of Rs. 390.14 crore, out of which Rs. 215.53 crore has been spent till now. Third place Among the six municipal Corporations in the State, the city now stands at third place in plan expenditure, with Kochi at 79.37% and Kozhikode at 60.53%, but these Corporations have only total plan funds of Rs. 183.56 and Rs. 187.17 respectively, allocated for the year. According to Mr.Francis, the bills of quite a few civil works are set to be cleared this week, which will ramp up the expenditure figures. Civil works had come to a halt during the initial months of the pandemic. Consequently, many of the works are just being completed, after which the bills will be cleared. More to be cleared Since there are no treasury restrictions as of now, compared to the situation last year, bills of larger amounts can be expected to be cleared in the coming days. A total of 686 bills under the development funds and 166 bills under the maintenance fund of the city Corporation have been passed this year at the district treasury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpns-plan-expenditure-at-5525/article34156942.ece

Thiruvananthapuram district had 2,736 polling booths for the last elections. The number has gone up by 1,428 booths due to an Election Commission of India (ECI) decision to cap the number of voters per booth at 1,000 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The auxiliary booths have been arranged close to the main polling booths. The voters can ascertain their booths in three ways: by using the ‘Voter Helpline’ app, by visitingvoterportal.eci.gov.in, and SMS-ing <ECIPS> SPACE <EPIC NO> to 1950.

25 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Shah should explain ‘mysterious death’: Mullappally||Union Home Minister Amit Shah should divulge details of the “mysterious death” which he had referred to during his March 7 visit to Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran said on Wednesday. “Mr. Shah alleged that a mysterious death occurred in connection with the gold-smuggling case. I do not believe that the Union Home Minister would make such a statement without accurate information in his possession. The people of Kerala are waiting for his reply,” Mr. Ramachandran told reporters here. (Mr. Shah had asked during the valedictory of the Vijaya Yatra by BJP State president K. Surendran whether a proper investigation was conducted into a “suspicious death.”) ED probe Mr. Ramachandran said there had been a conspicuous silence on the issue ever since Mr. Shah made his remark. Mr. Shah should also clarify as to who was dragging back the Enforcement Directorate probe into the gold-smuggling case, he said. Mr. Ramachandran termed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the solar case “politically motivated” and a “political gimmick.” “It (solar case) is an allegation out rightly rejected by the people of Kerala. The CBI probe is nothing more than a political gimmick when the elections are around,” he said. He cited it as another example of the tacit understanding between the CPI(M) and the BJP. On NSS and CM Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan need not target Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary Sukumaran Nair, Mr. Ramachandran said. Mr. Nair did not make politically motivated statements. Neither did he interfere in the internal matters of any political party, he said. The KPCC president demanded a follow-up by the Election Commission of India on the issue of duplication of voter names in the electoral rolls. He demanded action against government officials who were members of the CPI(M)-backed service organisations, accusing them of perpetrating the double entries. On the election prospects of the United Democratic Front (UDF), he said the front would register a record victory by bagging 100 of the 140 seats.  Mr. Shah had asked during the valedictory of the Vijaya Yatra whether a proper probe was conducted into a “suspicious death.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shah-should-explain-mysterious-death-mullappally/article34156732.ece

25 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Moves on to curb vote-related fraud||Steps are being taken to prevent vote-related fraud during the Assembly polls, with a preliminary probe by District Collectors confirming the existence of ‘double entries’ in the electoral rolls. Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Teeka Ram Meena has ordered an inspection of electoral rolls in all the 140 Assembly constituencies for pinpointing entries of a similar nature. The CEO has also asked the Collectors to constitute special teams of electoral registration officers and complete the inspection by Thursday. Booth-level lists of ‘double entries’ will be prepared, which in turn, will be handed over to the booth-level officers (BLO) for carrying out field-level inspection. The BLOs will mark the names repeated in the rolls and transfer the information to the returning officers concerned by March 30. This list will be made available to the presiding officers for preventing malpractices such as bogus votes on the day of polling. Voters mentioned in this list will be asked to remain in the polling booth until the ink applied to the finger is dry. Booths where large-scale discrepancies are noted will be equipped with webcasting/CCTV surveillance if they are not already listed for such surveillance. The lists containing the duplicate entries will be distributed to all political parties. Nonetheless, it is the polling officer’s duty to identify the voter even if complaints are not raised by the polling agents. Negligence or a deliberate lapse on the part of polling officials in connection with the double entries would attract stern action, Mr. Meena said. The spotlight was turned on the issue of multiple entries after the Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala filed a series of complaints before the Election Commission of India (ECI). Normally, such duplications—or demographically similar entries (DSE) in the Commission parlance—are identified and further action initiated using the Eronet and de-duplication software. This time, the commission had instructed election officials in poll-bound States to focus on the speedy disposal of petitions for the enrolment of names in the rolls rather than on the removal of DSEs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/moves-on-to-curb-vote-related-fraud/article34156733.ece

In a statement, the foundation said children with type-1 diabetes studying in public schools might have to take the insulin injection multiple times to regulate their sugar levels. Often, they were unable to check their sugar at the stipulated time or take the injection owing to lack of basic facilities. In at least 95% of educational institutions, there was no nursing room or teachers with nursing service or training. In many schools, students had to take the injections by visiting the staff room. But with many staff rooms having male and female teachers, children could not take the injection. It was important for parents, school authorities and health workers to know how to take care of such children. Adequate facilities and privacy to take the injection near the classrooms should be arranged for. Schools should also make allowances so that children can measure their sugar levels at the stipulated time. ,||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-facilities-in-schools-for-insulin-jab/article34156695.ece

Replying to a question by Shashi Tharoor in the Lok Sabha on Monday, Union Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said there were several reasons for the inability of the autonomous institution, under the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, to exit from project mode even in 2021. The breakdown of the initial contract with M/s Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited (CCCL), hard terrain of the region in which the institute is located, heavy rain for almost seven to eight months annually that preclude constructions and non-availability of adequate number of workforce are some of the reasons, he informed the Lok Sabha. Three departments of IISER Thiruvananthapuram have independent buildings already and these are Chemistry, Biology and Physics, the Union Minister said. The Union Minister said that the institute presently was not in a position to accommodate all the students on a single occupancy basis if they joined the residential campus during the prevailing pandemic. Furnishing of a 1,000-bed hostel need to be completed, after which all the students could be accommodated.

25 March 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Nod for NH-544D widening project||The State government has given its nod for taking up the widening project of the National Highway No-544D that connects Anantapur with Guntur, said Roads and Buildings Principal Secretary M.T. Krishna Babu on Wednesday. The project of expanding the highway into a four-lane one will be taken up at a cost of Rs. 6,000 crore, with the government’s share being 30% of the project cost in addition to making land acquisition wherever essential, the official added. The highway project was taken up four years ago but was put on the backburner when the Rs. 20,000-crore Anantapur-Amaravati Expressway project was actively pursued by the Telugu Desam Party government and till recently the land acquisition process was in progress in different districts. Mr. Krishna Babu, who was in Anantapur to hold talks with the revenue department officials regarding the land acquisition for this project, told The Hindu that a detailed project report for the project would be prepared within a month. The 417-km National Highway No-544D connects Anantpur with Guntur via Tadipatri, Kolimigundla, Owk, Banaganapalli and Nandyal (in Kurnool district), and Gajualapalli, Giddalur, Cumbum, Thokapalli (in Prakasam district), and Vinukonda, Narasaraopet in Guntur. Currently, the stretch between Giddaluru and Vinukonda in Prakasam district has been converted into a proper four-lane road, and some small stretches, including Anantapur to Tadipatri, have a narrow four-lane road, which need to be properly laid, Mr. Krishna Babu said. A major push is being given for recarpeting and repairing the existing Major District Roads and State Highways in Andhra Pradesh in the second phase of the project at a cost of Rs. 2,000, the Principal Secretary said after reviewing the progress with district officials. In Anantapur district alone, at least Rs. 170 crore will be spent to repair 710 km of roads, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nod-for-nh-544d-widening-project/article34156878.ece
25 March 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Paradigm shift in liquor policy?||Is the State government mulling significant changes in the liquor policy? Is the focus now shifting from prohibition in a phased manner to regulation in consumption? The answers seem to be in the affirmative, and the government is expected to make an announcement soon. Reasons There could be two possible reasons behind the shift in the liquor policy. Firstly, the high price of liquor brands is opening the doors for illegal smuggling across the border. In spite of many enforcement measures such as constitution of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), there is rampant smuggling of liquor. Secondly, the demand for beer is expected to go up significantly as summer sets in. The significant loss of revenue to the exchequer and the perilous financial situation in the State could be other reasons. Though no decision has been taken in this regard, sources say that the government may soon take a call on this. Soon after the YSRCP formed the government, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had announced a graded prohibition as consumption of liquor was leading to many evils in society. The Chief Minister had said that liquor prices would be jacked up by 75% and the number of shops would be gradually reduced. He had also ordered that all permit rooms and belt shops be disbanded. He had also directed that the business hours be reduced from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The policy decision had reduced the consumption of liquor. The sale of IMFL from April to December 2020 was 126.55 lakh cases against 239.56 lakh cases during the corresponding period in 2019, a drop of 47.17%. The sale of beer in 2020 had also gone down to 126.55 lakh bottles against 186.36 lakh cases in 2019, resulting in 80.91% dip in consumption. The number of liquor shops were reduced by 33%. In all, 43,000 belt shops had been closed. While the policy shift could make tipplers excited, the crusaders of prohibition feel that it could lead to increased consumption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/paradigm-shift-in-liquor-policy/article34156892.ece

Wednesday saw 128 positive cases in the district, the highest this year, reported from 39 of the 66 mandals. Srikalahasti, which was a hotspot with maximum number of cases last year, once again started witnessing a spike in the daily cases. The corporations of Tirupati and Chittoor continue to take the first and second places in daily cases. Chittoor district’s tally so far stood at 88,624 cases, including 859 deaths, the highest in the State. Awareness campaign The district COVID-19 Task Force on Wednesday launched an awareness campaign on “Face mask rule” at the busy Government Hospital junction at Puttur. Task Force Special Officer P. Ravi Raju, pulmonologist P. Amarnatha Reddy, medical and paramedical staff of Nagari, Puttur and surrounding mandals took part in the campaign. Dr. Raju told the media that the sudden spike in positive cases every day since a month had clearly led to fear among the public. “During our inspections in Puttur, Nagari, Nindra, Narayanavanam and other areas bordering with Tamil Nadu, we could find good response from the public to the face mask rule. At this time of resurgence of cases, the best deterrent to avoid the spread of virus is by wearing a face mask. Due to our campaign, the number of people wearing mask is increasing, and by the next few days we hope to achieve cent per cent results,” he said. The official said that apart from holding meetings with the police, revenue, APSRTC, owners of shopping complexes and cinemas, the awareness campaign covered hundreds of drivers of autorikshaws, cabs and school buses, taking a pledge from them to adhere to the face mask rule, considering the safety of schoolchildren. “Our campaign series have also covered parents, teachers and gram and ward volunteers,” the official said. Dr. Reddy said that during the last one week, the number of beneficiaries taking the vaccine under the first and second target groups (above 60 years, and 45-59 with co-morbidities) was steadily on the rise. “We are confident that by the next couple of weeks, the response would cross 70%,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/masks-are-back-as-virus-fear-grips-people/article34156875.ece

Speaking after filing two sets of nomination papers before Nellore District Collector K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu, the Returning Officer for the Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election, here on Wednesday, Ms. Lakshmi recalled that it was in Tirupati, in the run-up to the 2014 elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised Special Category Status (SCS) for not five years but 15 years. Dig at PM After coming to power, the Prime Minister had meted out a raw deal to the State, she alleged. Ms. Lakshmi, who came in a procession after paying floral tributes to the statue of B.R. Ambedkar, said the YSRCP had won in the 2019 elections as it promised to secure SCS. “What has happened to the promise on SCS? Despite the people electing 22 YSRCP MPs, the party did little to achieve SCS,” she said, and added that it was the TDP MPs, including K. Rammohan Naidu, who had taken up the State’s case forcefully in Parliament. VSP row ‘The YSRCP is answerable to the people on the Centre’s decision to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant after several rounds of negotiations with the State government,” she said while campaigning in the Sarvepalli Assembly segment. Among others, former Minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy accompanied her. Social justice was at peril as the reservation for the SCs/STs would become irrelevant in the wake of the PSU privatisation spree, she said. The BJP and the YSRCP had no moral right to seek votes as they had turned a blind eye to major infrastructure projects such as Dugarajapatnam port and Mannavaram NTPC BHEL power project, she said. TDP State president and MLA K. Atchannaidu contended that the YSRCP had won the panchayat and municipal elections by resorting to “gross misuse of official machinery.” Senior TDP leaders Devineni Umamaheswara Rao and Yanamala Ramakrishnudu took part in the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-failed-in-achieving-scs-panabaka/article34156894.ece

25 March 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Merger of 13 mandals with VMRDA opposed||Former bureaucrat and social activist E.A.S. Sarma and the Human Rights Forum (HRF) have taken strong objection to the outright inclusion of 13 non-agency mandals in Visakhapatnam district in Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Development Authority (VMRDA) vide GO No. 20, dated March 23, issued by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MA&UD) Department. They say that the GO was issued without much thought and was issued in haste. Scheduled villages Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Sarma said though the intention of the government seemed to be to exclude villages in the Scheduled Areas of the district, there are at least six Scheduled villages of Nathavaram mandal finding their place in the list attached to the GO. The villages are Chammachinta, Dharmavaram Agraharam, Kalavavoddu Sarabhavaram, Kuruvada, Pottinagannadora Palem and Sarugudu, he said. In principle, extension of APMRDA Act to the Scheduled Areas is violative of the provisions of the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1986 (PESA) and the Scheduled Tribes And Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition Of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) which have conferred special authority on the local adivasi Gram Sabhas in all matters, including decisions on projects, forestry schemes and development planning. The authority of the Gram Sabha in the Scheduled Areas overrides the authority of any other institution, said Mr. Sarma.  Fifth Schedule Area Mr. Krishna said that the government ought to remember that the Fifth Schedule Area is of a unique and exceptional nature and is endowed with explicit Constitutional recognition. Including these villages would mean they are deprived of rights and authorities bestowed upon them by the Constitution, he said. Mr. Sarma said that the setting up of the VMRDA is by itself violative of Article 243ZE of the Constitution which requires that any urban planning body shall have not less than two-thirds of its members elected by, and from amongst, the elected members of the municipalities and the chairpersons of the panchayats in the metropolitan area in proportion to the ratio between the population of the municipalities and of the panchayats in that area. According to Mr. Sarma, the VMRDA is headed by officials and, therefore, its role as an urban planning and development body is patently illegal. As such, VMRDA cannot interfere with the authority of any Gram Sabha in the Scheduled Areas, he said. Mr. Sarma said that some of these villages in Visakhapatnam district find a place in the list of 800 villages that were proposed by the erstwhile undivided A.P. government for inclusion within the Scheduled Areas. The then State government had submitted proposals on this in 1986 to the Centre for issuing a Presidential Notification under the Fifth Schedule. Those proposals are at an advanced stage of processing. And that is why the present State government, has to do some rethinking on this GO No.20, said Mr. Sarma. In Visakhapatnam district there are 91 such villages under various mandals that find a place in the list of 800 villages. They include Cheedikada Mandal (one village), Golugonda Mandal (8 villages), Madugula Mandal (21 villages), Nathavaram (2 villages), Ravikamatham Mandal (3 villages), Rolugunta Mandal (8 villages), Devarapalli Mandal (12 villages) and Ananthagiri Mandal (36 villages).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/merger-of-13-mandals-with-vmrda-opposed/article34156986.ece

25 March 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Not much wiggle room to conduct MPTC & ZPTC elections, says SEC||With just one week remaining for his tenure to end and not having much wiggle room to conduct the elections for the MPTCs and ZPTCs, State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar has left the task to his successor. In his order on Wednesday, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said that he would not announce a schedule for the elections, citing legal wrangles and the Election Commission of India’s observations on vaccination programme and the need for the poll staff’s involvement in it. The SEC said there was a window of opportunity for him to hold the MPTC and ZPTC elections and then demit office with a clear record of fulfilling his mandate, but it was lost due to some unexpected legal challenges. Regarding the resumption of the adjourned election process, the commission is strictly bound by the provisions of the judgment of the Supreme Court dated March 18, 2020, wherein it ruled that since the commission had already taken the decision to postpone the elections, there should be a post decisional consultation with the State of A.P. before notifying the next date and the Model Code of Conduct should be reimposed four weeks before the date of polling. Referring to the cases in which Form-10 was given, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the contestants and political parties could approach the Collectors and district election authorities and submit their grievances vis-a-vis the mala fides of the Returning Officers, in writing. The SEC said government servants across the board had worked with a rare sense of dedication and responded beyond the call of duty in holding the gram panchayat and ULB elections without major incidents. In the case of elections to the Legislative Assemblies of five States, the ECI declared that all poll staff should be vaccinated, by duly recognising them as frontline workers and acknowledging the growing concerns of a second wave of COVID-19. “The SEC has been adhering to the ECI’s best practices and will adopt the same measures regarding vaccination,” he said and added that these responsibilities were best shouldered and addressed by his successor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/not-much-wiggle-room-to-conduct-elections-sec/article34156607.ece

25 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tech firm to distribute million books to govt. school libraries||An owner of a tech company has embarked on an ambitious mission to distribute a million books among government school libraries across the State free of cost. “The idea is to foster a love of reading in schoolchildren,” says M. Satish Babu, pointing to a collection of books of different genres scattered around him. “Exposing children to a diversity in books will prepare them for life in a diverse world,” he says, informing that the collection around him is a sample of the one million magazines and comic books worth around Rs. 12 crore he intends to distribute. Founder and managing director of Tech Mark, a company that deals with e-solutions, digital marketing and imparting skill training to youth, Mr. Satish Babu was fascinated by the work done by US-based MagazineLiteracy.org that supplies new and recycled magazines and comic books to millions of young readers across the United States and now also in Canada, the Caribbean, South America and Africa, and decided to replicate the model here in collaboration with the US NGO. MagazineLiteracy.org was started in 1994 by John Mennell who organised community hunger relief measures. He, however, realised that homes with less or no food did not have access to reading material too, a major factor contributing to a cycle of illiteracy and poverty for children and families. He then set out to share the reading material that could feed children’s hunger to read. “I may not be able to take up the project on Mennell’s scale, but to begin with, I intend to distribute a million books in the first consignment,” says Satish Babu. For him, it is a mission to deliver the joy of reading to children and strengthen their literacy skills and self-esteem. “The education sector has come to the centrestage under this government. The reforms to spruce up infrastructure and raise standards of education, as well as recent initiatives like ‘We Love Reading’ to inculcate the love of reading among students at an early age reflect the intent that goes well with our initiative,” Mr. Satish Babu says. He recently met Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh, who expressed happiness over his initiative. Mr. Satish Babu is currently working on the logistics of bringing in the books from the United States for which he would be compensated by the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tech-firm-to-distribute-million-books-to-govt-school-libraries/article34156313.ece

He won the Ward 20 under which his native village of Lingapuram comes. Life has not been kind to Mr. Ramaraju. Orphaned at a tender age, he was brought up by his ailing grandmother. He completed his graduation in humanities, a correspondence course from Andhra University in 2009, after which he undertook a welding course. Days of struggle Mr. Ramaraju started earning when he was a teenager to run his family. In 2011, he got married and later he attended an apprenticeship programme at the Hindustan Shipyard Limited for a year. However, he returned back to his village due to financial issues and started driving an auto-rickshaw in 2014. Known as a kind-hearted person who always lends a helping hand to the people in distress in his village, winning the election in the village that has about 1,800 votes was not very difficult for him. His candidature for the post was recommended by the people in the village and the TDP gave him a ticket. “I like to help the people in need. There were a number of occasions when I transported sick people to hospitals or to the nearest ambulance station at odd hours, free of cost. I also take poor and elderly people to the mandal headquarters or banks for free to get their work done. Now, I have a post which gives me ample opportunity to serve people. It is a big responsibility too. I will try to meet the expectation of the people,” said Mr. Ramaraju.   Focus on civic amenities Speaking about his priorities, he said, “I always wanted to serve people as it gives me immense satisfaction. Being a councillor now, I want to address the issues in my ward and village. My village lacks proper road, burial ground, good drinking water facility, and these will be my initial focus areas,” said Mr. Ramaraju. However, he said that he would not stop driving auto-rickshaw. “I will continue to ply the auto-rickshaw and attend council sessions too. I have requested the owner of the auto-rickshaw to grant me leave on Mondays, so that I can visit my ward and attend council meetings,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/auto-rickshaw-or-serving-people-he-wants-to-be-in-the-drivers-seat/article34156904.ece

25 March 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||Police give away water filters to tribals||Ahead of peak summer, the Charla police have initiated a major outreach activity to distribute water filters in some of the interior tribal habitations tucked away in the dense forest region in Charla mandal, bordering Chhattisgarh. The initiative is the second such key outreach activity of the Charla police, who organised a mega two-day eye screening camp for tribal people of remote villages in the border mandal last month. This follows a host of outreach programmes, including volleyball tournaments recently organised by the police for local youth in the border mandals, Charla and Dummugudem, which share a thickly-forested border with the Maoist strongholds of Chhattisgarh. The Bhadrachalam sub-division police have stepped up outreach activities in Telangana’s tribal heartland of Bhadrachalam Agency as part of concerted efforts to win over the hearts of Adivasis of the border villages and wean the local youth away from the influence of Left-Wing Extremism (LWE). As many as 184 terafil water filters were distributed to villagers from Chennapuram, Errrampadu, Battugudem and Ramachandrapuram at a function held at Pedamidisileru village in Charla mandal on Wednesday. Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt handed over the water filters to the villagers on the occasion. The terafil water filters will help the tribal people of the far-flung habitations consume safe drinking water and protect themselves from water-borne diseases, said Bhadrachalam Assistant Superintendent of Police Dr. G. Vineeth. In the next few days, some more water filters will be distributed, one each to every household in Bakkachintalapadu, Korakatpadu, Veerapuram and Mulkalapalli villages, he told The Hindu , when contacted. A large number of tribals from far off places in Bhadrachalam Agency and neighbouring Agency areas attended the free eye-camp organised by the Charla police recently, he noted. Nearly 400 spectacles were distributed free to the needy and 117 persons were diagnosed with cataract problems and referred to the Nava Bharat Eye Centre run by the LV Prasad Eye Institute in Palvancha for surgery, the ASP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-give-away-water-filters-to-tribals/article34156676.ece

25 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Farm mechanisation in TS to be doubled to tackle labour crunch||The government plans to double farm mechanisation in the State through a new scheme to overcome farm labour shortage and increase mechanisation from the existing 45% to 90% over the next four years. Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy said in the Assembly on Wednesday that an inventory of farm cluster-wise will be created for identifying the needs of farmers for every 5,000 acres. The new scheme will be prepared based on the inventory to supply farm equipment like harvesters, threshers, winnowers and reapers through Custom Hiring Centres. The Minister said there is likely to be severe shortage of farm labourers in the future and with the paddy cultivation increasing in Telangana, it would further be difficult to find labourers. Keeping that in view, the government is focusing on farm mechanisation and will announce the new scheme after finalising the modalities, he said. Mr. Reddy said farm mechanisation will reduce the input costs and save time for farmers which in turn can ensure effective and timely intervention. The Custom Hiring Centres, he felt, will also open new employment avenues for the rural youth. He said the government spent Rs. 951.28 crore for farm mechanisation over the last few years benefiting 6.66 lakh farmers. The government had earmarked Rs. 1,500 crore exclusively for farm mechanisation for providing up to 50% subsidy on the farm equipment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farm-mechanisation-to-go-up-to-tackle-labour-crunch/article34156670.ece

The meeting identified on digital screen reservoirs of Palamuru-Rangareddy, canals to carry water from them, their height and contours with the aim to irrigate the entire erstwhile Mahabubnagar district and adjoining Rangareddy, a release said. In this context, the routes to excavate main canal and distributaries for carrying water from Karivena reservoir to Jurala were studied. The routes for canals from Uddandapur to Kodangal, Narayanpet, Tandur, Parigi, Vikarabad and Chevella Assembly constituencies were also discussed. Mr. Rao asked officials to study as much height as possible for canal network to irrigate maximum acreage. It was suggested that ideal technology to lessen tunnel construction and focus more on open canals be studied to carry water by gravity. More meetings to finalise the plan must be held in a couple of days, he said. He also reviewed the progress of work on Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme to supply water to Alampur constituency in Gadwal district. The State must secure 15.9 tmc ft water from RDS as allotted by Bachawat tribunal. If needed, he will meet his Karnataka counterpart to discuss the matter. The operations and maintenance wing of irrigation department must be strengthened in view of the construction of projects. The department had become the lifeline of State. The network of irrigation had expanded vastly after formation of the State. The lower level staff of the department must be sensitised about the importance of operations and maintenance wing, and should have specialised officers. The State will have plenty of reservoirs and a huge canal system in the coming years. There should be workshops of Chief Engineers and Superintending Engineers to discuss the progress of works and the field level engineers should be trained by experts. He said he would himself participate in the training sessions some day. He said the O&M wing should be divided into separate sub-sections for pumps and motors and project gates and canals. The meeting was attended by Ministers and MLAs from Mahabubnagar and Rangareddy, and Principal Irrigation Secretary Rajat Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-reviews-linking-of-li-projects/article34156668.ece

The Gandipet main road is proposed to be widened from two-lane to eight-lane towards Shankarpally, for which trees lining the road on both sides need to be felled as per a proposal submitted by the Roads & Buildings department to the Forest department. Forest officials who inspected the road stretch extending up to 2.5 kilometres have enumerated a total of 286 trees with girth over 30 centimetres. The proposal was forwarded to the Tree Protection Committee (TPC) as mandated by the Water, Land, and Trees Act (WALTA). Joint inspection The TPC conducted joint inspection of the stretch and issued orders for felling a total of 244 trees, and translocation of the remaining 42. Majority of the trees which are allowed to be felled belong to the species such as peltophorum, subabul, sissoo (Indian Rosewood), and eucalyptus, while those ordered to be translocated are banyan, neem, millingtonia, and pongamia, among others. Meanwhile, the NGO Vata Foundation which has been engaged in voluntary and free translocation of trees, has come forward to translocate even the trees marked for felling. “We are ready to translocate all the 244 trees free of cost, and even donors are ready to adopt all the trees. But the department is yet to give a nod,” says Uday Krishna, the Founder of Vata Foundation. Officials of the R&B department, when sought their version, expressed helplessness saying that tenders were finalised for the tree felling and contract was awarded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/244-trees-set-to-go-off-gandipet-main-road/article34156651.ece
25 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC sets aside order rejecting woman’s plea seeking job||The Telangana High Court on Wednesday set aside an order issued by a district judge rejecting the petition of a woman seeking job of her mother, who passed away, under compassionate grounds. A Bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy directed the judge to finalise the petition of Bandari Divya within four weeks. The Bench found fault with the judge order stating that reasons for rejection of the woman’s petition seeking job on compassionate grounds were not properly explained in the order. Ms. Divya filed the petition stating that her mother Swaroopa was given process server job in RangaReddy district court following the death of her father. Eventually, her mother too passed away. The petitioner, who got married and was living with her husband, moved the district court seeking her mother’s job on compassionate ground claiming that she was a dependent. She also presented a no-objection certificate from her younger sister to claim the job. The district judge rejected the petitioner’s contentions that she was a dependent on her mother despite being married and living with her husband. The district judge, however, mentioned an order of the High Court which stated that daughters were eligible to secure jobs of parents on compassionate grounds. The Division Bench headed by the Chief Justice found fault with the order, observing that it had cited a High Court order upholding rights of daughters to claim parents’ job on compassionate grounds on one hand and rejected the petitioner’s petition on the other. The Bench also sought to know from the petitioner’s counsel as to how she can claim to be a dependent while living separately with her husband.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-sets-aside-order-rejecting-womans-plea-seeking-job/article34156661.ece

25 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Centre favouring poll-bound states, ignoring Telangana: KTR||Continuing his attack on the Central government, IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao said that Telangana was being discriminated by the Centre that was announcing and supporting schemes only in poll-bound states. He listed out how the BJP government was ignoring the rightful demands of Telangana like Turmeric Board, Defence Corridor between Hyderabad and Bengaluru, Vaccination Lab that was shifted to another state despite Hyderabad being the vaccine capital and Railway Coach factory at Kazipet. He alleged that the Central government was trying to please the poll-bound states in extending financial assistance or announcing new plans but was ignoring Telangana. He said the Turmeric Board in Telangana was a non-starter despite the present Nizamabad MP won on the promise of Turmeric Board. But the poll-bound Tamil Nadu is promised the Board now. He said the government had urged the Centre to release RS 832 crores for the Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP) but it was turned down. Similarly, despite Hyderabad emerging as the vaccine capital of the world and diplomats from several countries praising Hyderabad’s contribution the vaccine testing laboratory has been allocated to Himachal Pradesh without any logic, he argued. The Defence Corridor was announced for Bundelkhand though Hyderabad had many defence institutions. This was despite the state government making several representations seeking Defence corridor for the state. Interestingly, Bundelkhand doesn’t even has a single defence institution. Even the Railway Coach factory is denied despite the assurance in the AP Reorganisation Act and it was sanctioned for Marathwada for which a proposal was made in 2018. Mr. KTR said a DPR on Metro phase II for Hyderabad was submitted but not a single rupee has been sanctioned. The BJP government has approved the Chennai Metro since Tamil Nadu was going for polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-favouring-poll-bound-states-ignoring-telangana-ktr/article34156673.ece

From around 40,000 tests in a day throughout February to mid-March, 60,000-70,000 samples are being tested across the State from the third week of March. A total of 8,41,979 samples were examined in February, and the number has reached 10,27,906 in March with another week to spare. RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) are performed to detect the presence of coronavirus. While results of RAT are received in a few hours, it takes a day or two to know the results of RT-PCR tests. The categorisation of total tests into RAT and RT-PCR are, however, not mentioned in the media bulletin issued by the State Health department. At Osmania Medical College (OMC) in Koti, the sample load for RT-PCR tests increased from around 100-150 a day in January and February, to around 200-300 currently.

Currently, RT-PCR tests are conducted at GMC, Institute of Preventive Medicine at Narayanguda, OMC, Siddipet medical college, and some other facilities. The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics also examine the samples. Last year, four scientists were assigned to GMC in addition to two there to process the samples. As the tenure of the four scientists ended, the laboratory at the college is left with only two.

Researchers now claim that it could be due to the Arctic region warming up like never before and at an alarming rate with temperatures increasing more than twice as fast as the global average. Arctic warming or increased surface temperatures is a result of “global warming” and a recent study involving researchers from India and Brazil published a research article entitled “Large-scale connection to Deadly Indian Heatwaves.” Here they state that Indian heat waves occur due to a theoretical mechanism called “Quasi-Resonant Amplification (QRA).” The researchers, including National Institute for Space researcher V. B. Rao, Azim Premji University’s K. Koteswara Rao, Andhra University’s B. Mahendranath, SRM Institute of Science and Technology’s T. V. Lakshmi Kumar and University of Hyderabad’s Govardhan Dandu, have shown for the first time that heat waves leading to deaths, can occur in India, due to QRA, caused by Arctic warming a result of global warming. Mitigating the change Hence, there is an urgent need to plan mitigation of this very adverse climate change. This QRA mechanism is also shown to be the cause of 2003 European heatwave, 2010 Pakistan flood and Russian heat wave and other extreme events affecting human and animal life. Dr. Rao and co-authors said that Indian heat waves can be predicted about four days in advance prior to their occurrence. The results of this study were published in reputed British journal, Quarterly Journal of Royal Meteorology, said a press release on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/arctic-warming-is-causing-heat-waves-in-india-study/article34156682.ece

25 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Sad day for democracy, will continue struggle’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday slammed the Central government for passage of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, in the Rajya Sabha. “RS passes GNCTD amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet. AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that it is a “dark day for democracy”. “The rights of the government elected by the people of Delhi have been taken away and handed over to LG. Parliament, which is the temple of our democracy, was chosen for the murder of democracy. People will fight against this dictatorship. #BJPFearsKejriwal,” Mr. Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi. AAP leader Satyendar Jain said that regardless of whatever the Central government does, “we will keep working, we will not stop”. “The NCT of Delhi [Amendment] Bill, 2021, is an unconstitutional attempt to make Delhi Government ‘administratively impotent’ by a political party that has been made ‘electorally impotent’ by people of Delhi,” AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sad-day-for-democracy-will-continue-struggle/article34156522.ece

Akbar moved the Delhi High Court challenging a trial court order acquitting journalist Priya Ramani in the criminal defamation case filed against her over the allegations of sexual harassment. The plea is scheduled to come up for hearing on Thursday. The trial court’s February 17 order had acquitted Ms. Ramani on the ground that a woman has the right to put grievances before any platform of her choice even after decades. The court had rejected Mr. Akbar’s complaint saying that no charges were proved against Ms. Ramani.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/akbar-moves-high-court-against-verdict/article34156526.ece
25 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Amarinder warns of threat from Pak.||Terming the growing economic and military collusion between Pakistan and China as New Delhi’s “failure of diplomacy”, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said that by delaying resolution of the farmers’ crisis, the BJP-led government at the Centre was allowing Pakistan to take advantage of dissatisfaction emerging in the State.  ‘Learn from history’ Urging the Centre to repeal the farm laws in the interest of the nation’s security, the Chief Minister asked, “Have you not thought of what Pakistan will do in this scenario?” Warning that they will take advantage of the dissatisfaction among the youth in Punjab, as they had done in the past, he stressed the need to “learn from history”. Is Delhi sleeping, he asked, citing data on increase in arms smuggling into Punjab through drones since the farmers had intensified their stir. Capt. Amarinder once again urged the Central government not to make it an issue of ego or prestige but to withdraw the farm laws immediately. “This is not Hitler’s Germany or Mao Zedong’s China. The people’s will has to be heard,” he stressed. He added those at the helm should understand that the agitation of the farmers is not a political issue but a matter of their survival. The agitation is not limited to Punjab, he said. Capt. Amarinder said he had seen the build-up of terrorism, and also the assassination of a CM of Punjab. The situation was worse today because of the economic and military collusion between Pakistan and China, which was “very ominous for India”, he said, at a media event. ‘AAP poses no risk’ Capt. Amarinder said in the upcoming Assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party poses no risk to the Congress in Punjab. “Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had failed to implement even 30% of his promises in his previous terms. He should focus on his own State instead of talking rubbish in Punjab. He talks about giving jobs to Punjab youths when his own track record in Delhi is pathetic!” ‘A divided lot’ “As for the Akalis, they are a divided lot and the party is splintering, with nobody to hold them together,” he said. Capt. Amarinder added Badal Senior is no longer in a position to lead the party due to his age. On the BJP’s prospects in Punjab, he said, “The party has no support base in the State...people are in fact angry with them.” The BJP could even end up getting back with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in desperation, Capt. Amarinder added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/amarinder-warns-of-threat-from-pak/article34156548.ece
25 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||AASU intensifies anti-CAA protests||Members of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) on Wednesday went on an 11-hour hunger strike across the State to protest the BJP’s avowed commitment to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act after the Assembly elections. The hunger strike coincided with the election rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. AASU members had on March 20 organised a State-wide rally on two-wheelers to oppose the CAA. “We will never allow the CAA to be implemented. Assam cannot be a dumping ground for immigrants all the time,” AASU president Dipanka Kumar Nath said. Another students’ organisation, the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad has also announced a fresh phase of anti-CAA protest from March 25. “We will fight the CAA come what may,” Parishad general secretary Palash Changmai said. While the BJP and its allies claim the CAA is a non-issue, the Congress-led Mahajot and a new regional front have campaigned against the law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aasu-intensifies-anti-caa-protests/article34156546.ece
25 March 2021||Guwahati,||AGP too skips CAA in manifesto||The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) on Wednesday followed ally BJP in skipping the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but promised in its manifesto to implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord. Pressure groups in Assam say the CAA, which seeks to fast-track the citizenship of non-Muslims who came from three neighbouring countries till December 31, 2014, contradicts the Assam Accord that prescribes March 24, 1971, as the cut-off date for detecting and deporting illegal immigrants. Clause 6 guarantees constitutional safeguards for the indigenous people of Assam as a reward for accepting the load of migrants from 1951, when the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was made, and March 1971. Releasing the manifesto, AGP leaders Birendra Prasad Baishya and Kumar Dipak Das said the party was firm on implementing the Clause 6 for solving the foreigners’ issue. “The AGP will pressure the Centre for the completion of the exercise to update the NRC,” the manifesto read. The assurance differed from the BJP’s promise to go for a “corrected” NRC after coming to power. Like the BJP, the AGP avoided mentioning the CAA. The party was initially opposed to the Bill and had threatened to pull out of the Sarbananda Sonowal government in 2019 but backtracked later.  Better education, health The AGP’s other promises include flood control, development of language and culture, addressing the issue of unemployment, ensuring farmers’ development, better education and health, and special schemes for the elderly and differently abled people. The manifesto also laid emphasis on the welfare of “tea tribes” and other backward classes and protection of women and children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/agp-too-skips-caa-in-manifesto/article34156545.ece

The Zo Reunification Organisation (ZORO) asked the Ministry of Home Affairs to revoke its March 10 order directing four Northeastern States bordering Myanmar to deport people from the neighbouring country who have taken refuge in India following the military coup in February. The Mizoram-based group seeks the reunification of the Zo ethnic people of India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. “Thousands of people from Bangladesh and other countries have illegally migrated to India and the Central government accepted them as refugees and provided them with asylum,” ZORO president R.

25 March 2021||Kolkata,||‘ Khela hobe’ to ‘ khela sesh’ — it’s season of slogans||While addressing a public meeting in West Bengal’s Purulia district, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday told her party supporters to greet each other with ‘ joy Bangla ’. “When someone calls you over telephone, greet them with Joy Bangla,” Ms. Banerjee said. With only 48 hours left for West Bengal to go to polls, these slogans are setting the tone for the elections in the State. ‘ joy Bangla ’ is the Trinamool Congress’ counter to the BJP’s ‘Jai Shri Ram’ chant. Even though the BJP leadership, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, claims that the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ chant in West Bengal is different from what it meant during the Ram Mandir movement, the inherent religiosity in it is undoubtedly aimed at dividing the electorate on communal lines. The Trinamool Congress has responded by raising the issue of Bengal pride with ‘ joy Bangla ’. The most catchy slogan that has emerged in this high-pitched election is ‘ khela hobe ’ (game will be played) coined by the Trinamool Congress. The slogan caught on after it was raised a few times by heavyweight Trinamool leader from Birbhum, Anubrata Mondal. Mr. Mondal, who is known to speak in political innuendos, gave this slogan a menacing undertone.  ‘Khela hobe’ has become such a rage across the State that even Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s speeches are woven around it. “We are going to play such a game that we will throw the BJP out of the stadium,” Ms. Banerjee is often heard at her public meetings. During the campaigns, all the references to sports and “bowling out” the Opposition have their roots in the slogan “ khela hobe ”. The BJP had to counter this this slogan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi came up with a suitable retort. “Trinamool is saying khela hobe. Now it is khela sesh (the game is over) for Trinamool. Ebar vikas hobe (now there will be development),” the Prime Minister has repeatedly said in his rallies. The Trinamool Congress has put a lot of emphasis on the slogan ‘ Bangla nijer mein kei chai’ (Bengal wants its own daughter) as a strategy to win over women voters. The BJP’s emphasis on development is reflected in its slogan to build a ‘ sonar Bangla (golden Bengal)’. The Left parties, which are contesting the polls in an alliance with the Congress and the Indian Secular Front under the banner Samyukta Morcha, have put more emphasis on remixing popular Bengali pop songs to spread their message. The CPI(M) is trying to reach out to the young electorate by selecting young new faces as candidates. The remixed songs have not only got the attention of the electorate but have also become quite a hit on social media. The Congress in its poll manifesto announced its party’s slogan — “ Ebar aar phool na, ebar kono bhul na ( no flower this time, no mistake this time)”. The slogan is an attack on the symbols of both the Trinamool Congress (two flowers on a stalk) and the BJP (lotus). Long after affect Slogans, graffito and songs relating to polls are crucial to any election in West Bengal and their echoes can be felt decades after. The Left parties’ slogan of the 1970s — “Congresser kalo haath gudie dao ( grind the evil hand of the Congress)” has come to haunt them 50 years later when they are allying with the same party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/khela-hobe-to-khela-sesh-its-season-of-slogans/article34156542.ece

25 March 2021||Mumbai,||BJP urges Governor to seek status report from CM||A delegation from the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Devendra Fadnavis met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Wednesday and urged him to seek a status report from Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on the law and order situation in the State and convey it to President Ram Nath Kovind. Speaking after the meeting, Mr. Fadnavis said, “The State is witnessing a number of concerning incidents every day. But the Chief Minister has gone into silent mode. Sharad Pawar has held two press conferences and tried to shield the accused. The Congress is nowhere to be seen. The government has turned into an extortion gang and lost its moral compass.” ‘CM in silent mode’ Mr. Fadnavis said the delegation informed the Governor that the Chief Minister was not addressing the people on matters regarding the State’s law and order. The leaders urged Mr. Koshyari to seek a detailed report from Mr. Thackeray on action taken on the allegations against the State Home Minister and the police department that have surfaced over the past few days. “A reply should also be sought on the racket involving the transfer of police officers,” he said. Mr. Fadnavis on Tuesday submitted a report on the alleged racket to the Union Home Secretary and sought a CBI investigation into it. Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said the allegation ‘is a damp firecracker that does not even have a wick’. The Nationalist Congress Party had clarified that over 80% of the transfers mentioned in the report never took place and the rest were approved by a panel comprising former Maharashtra DGP Subodh Jaiswal. Mr. Fadnavis said it would soon be clear if the report is a ‘damp firecracker or an atom bomb’.

25 March 2021||Mumbai,||MVA allies sideline Congress||The Maharashtra unit of the Congress has found itself isolated as its allies in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government — the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) — have not sought its help in fighting allegations of extortion against the State Home Minister and irregularities in transfers of police officers. According to party sources, even the Chief Minister has not bothered to hold a meeting with senior Congress ministers in his Cabinet. “Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan went to meet Uddhav Thackeray on their own. This is frustrating for us as we are an important ally in the government,” a senior party leader said. Congress ministers even held a meeting on Tuesday evening in a bid to show their strength in the present government. “A section of the party believes that the Sena and the NCP should sort out the matter as the Congress has no relation whatsoever to the allegations. Why should we jump into it when we are not even considered an ally by these two parties?” the leader said. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party has ridiculed the Congress for its conspicuous absence in the firefighting. “Where is the Congress? Aren’t they in this government? Why is the party silent and not spoken anything? Are they also a beneficiary of the extortion racket?” asked Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis. In reply, State Congress chief Nana Patole said that Mr. Fadnavis seemed to know how extortion rackets work from his past experience as chief minister. ‘Probe RSS link’ “Mr. Fadnavis while holding the chief minister’s post used police officers like Rashmi Shukla to extort money. Officials affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) also penetrated different government departments and extorted money. We demand a probe into the officers linked to the RSS and the amount of money they extorted over the past five years,” he said. Mr. Patole added that if he had been in the government he would have suspended an officer like former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mva-allies-sideline-congress/article34156757.ece

25 March 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi reports over 1,000 new cases for second day in a row||The surge in COVID-19 cases continued on Wednesday with the city witnessing 1,254 new cases in the last 24 hours – the highest in more than three months – taking the total number of cases to 6,51,227, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government. This is the second day when more than 1,000 new cases have been reported this year. Wednesday’s bulletin also stated that six deaths were reported in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths to 10,973. A total of 82,331 tests were done in a day, it said. Of the total cases, 6,35,364 people have recovered and there are 4,890 active cases here at present.  Dr. Jugal Kishore, Head of Community Medicine Department, Safdarjung Hospital, said that Delhi is seeing a spike as people are not following social distancing measures and COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. “The percentage of mutant strains is very less in Delhi. For instance, in South Africa, about 90% of the cases has the new strain. Also, there are no re-infections in India, apart from few exceptions. So these two factors cannot be responsible for the spike we are seeing, as per data available to us,” Dr. Kishore said. He also said that Delhi may not see a big spike since a large percentage of the population has already been infected, as per the last serological survey “Recent report of genomic sequencing study showed that 15-20% of samples from Maharashtra had new mutations and this can be the reason behind the rise in cases. As there is no restriction on travel to Delhi, such mutant variant can be the cause of rise here,” Dr, Kishore also said. Over 23,000 vaccinated A total of 23,267 beneficiaries took the COVID-19 vaccination in Delhi on Wednesday and one minor Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) was reported till 6 p.m., a Delhi government spokesperson said. “This report is provisional as sessions are going on in hospitals till 9 p.m. Also, there were lesser sessions today, with dispensary-based session sites not functional on Wednesday and Friday,” the spokesperson said. For vaccinating people aged above 45 from April 1, the Delhi government is increasing the vaccination capacity. “Currently we have a capacity of 75,000-80,000 doses per day and we are increasing it every day. The Chief Minister has already said that we plan to increase it to 1.25 lakh doses per day,” an official said. When asked if all above 45 years can get just walk in at any vaccination centre and get the shot without any pre-registration from April 1, the officer said, “You can either pre-register or just walk in.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-reports-over-1000-new-cases-for-second-day-in-a-row/article34156537.ece

25 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘50 people can pray at Nizamuddin mosque’||The Centre on Wednesday informed the Delhi High Court that 50 people chosen by the Delhi Waqf Board can be allowed to offer prayers at the mosque in the Nizamuddin centre during the coming festival season, once their names are provided to the Station House Officer. The Centre made the submission before Justice Mukta Gupta during the hearing of a plea to reopen the Nizamuddin centre where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held and has been locked since March 31 last year. The submission came after the Board, represented by senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, urged the High Court to permit individuals to pray at the mosque during the ‘shab-e-barat’ holiday at the end of the week. The Board said only the mosque would be used and not the madrasa nearby. Mr. Gupta also urged the court to decide the case before Ramzan commences from April 13 as more people would want to offer prayers at the mosque during that time. The High Court has posted the case for hearing on April 12. The Board contended that even after unlock-1 rules permitted religious places outside containment zones to reopen, the centre — comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madrasa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel, continues to be locked up. The Board said it had on February 16, 2021, given a representation to the authorities to reassess the necessity of keeping the premises locked. It said no action has been taken so far on their representation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/50-people-can-pray-at-nizamuddin-mosque/article34156531.ece

25 March 2021||Beijing,||China lashes out at U.S. and EU||China took the U.S. to task on Wednesday over racism, financial inequality and the federal government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in an annual report that seeks to counter U.S. accusations of human rights abuses by China’s ruling Communist Party. The 28-page report opens with “I can’t breathe”, a reference to George Floyd, a Black-American who was declared dead last May after a police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for about nine minutes. The document also highlighted the January 6 attack on the Capitol, as well as gun violence and health disparities. China issues the report each year in response to U.S. criticism of its record on issues such as abuses against minority groups and a crackdown on opposition voices in Hong Kong.  “To defeat the epidemic requires mutual help, solidarity and cooperation among all countries. However, the United States, which has always considered itself an exception and superior, saw its own epidemic situation go out of control, accompanied by political disorder, inter-ethnic conflicts, and social division,” the report said. ‘Arbitrary sanctions’ Separately, China also hit out at the European Union on Wednesday, accusing it of “hypocrisy” after the two sides summoned each other’s envoys in an escalating row over the treatment of China’s Muslim Uyghurs. France, Germany and other EU nations called in Chinese ambassadors to protest against sanctions imposed by Beijing targeting their citizens, including five members of the European Parliament and two EU bodies and two think-tanks. The sanctions were a tit-for-tat response after the EU, Britain and Canada blacklisted four former and current officials in China’s Xinjiang region. “The EU ... arbitrarily imposes sanctions based on false information and lies, but does not allow the Chinese to talk back or fight back,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying. “This in itself is double standards, a manifestation of bullying and hypocrisy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-lashes-out-at-us-and-eu/article34156197.ece
25 March 2021||Jerusalem,||Uncertainty hangs over Israel election outcome||Israelis awoke on Wednesday to find that after their fourth general election in less than two years, there was still no clear indication of who would form the next government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party won the most votes, boosting his chances of building a coalition with a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. But a rival “Anyone but Netanyahu” camp of parties was running neck-and-neck, spelling more uncertainty ahead as the official vote count continues. Mr. Netanyahu, 71, Israel’s longest-serving premier after 12 years in power, had hoped that Tuesday’s election would finally allow him to unite a stable right-wing coalition behind him, after three inconclusive elections since 2019. Likely partners Analysis by state broadcaster Kan showed that with close to 90% of ballots counted, the combined strength of the declared pro-Netanyahu parties was 52 seats while the rival front commanded 56. This leaves both camps short of the 61 seats required to build a government. The kingmaker, down the road, could be the hard-right Yamina party led by Mr. Netanyahu’s estranged former protege Naftali Bennett, which, by Kan’s projection, won seven seats. Mr. Bennett, a former entrepreneur, has so far not declared which way he will jump.  A Netanyahu coalition would also require alignment with a new far-right extremist alliance called Religious Zionism, which is projected to win six seats. Among its most controversial figures is Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has voiced admiration for Baruch Goldstein, the murderer of 29 Palestinian worshippers in Hebron in 1994.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uncertainty-hangs-over-israel-election-outcome/article34156203.ece
25 March 2021||Yangon,||Myanmar junta frees 600 detainees||Myanmar freed more than 600 coup detainees on Wednesday, including an Associated Press photographer arrested while covering rallies, following fresh outrage over brutal crackdown on protesters. In commercial hub Yangon, AP photographer Thein Zaw, 32, who was arrested last month while covering a protest, was freed from Insein prison. “The police officer who sued me withdrew his charge, that’s why they released me unconditionally,” he said.  “We released 360 men and 268 women from Insein prison today,” said a prison official. Lawyer Khin Maung Myint, who was at Insein prison for the hearing of two other clients, said 16 busloads of people left the jail at 10 a.m. local time. “Some clients called me (after) informing me of their release,” he said. Silent strike The regime has unleashed a deadly wave of violence as it struggles to quell nationwide protests against the February 1 ouster and arrest of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Ms. Suu Kyi was due to have a court hearing on Wednesday in Naypyidaw. But her lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said the hearing was adjourned till April 1 because of problems with video conferencing caused by a junta-imposed Internet shutdown. Activists called for a nationwide “Silent Strike” on Wednesday, and streets were bare in the cities of Yangon and Naypyidaw. In Myeik, rows of dolls were set up along roads, holding up signs reading “We need democracy” and “We wish for Mother Suu to be healthy”. There was chaos overnight in Mandalay with barricades burning, arrests, homes raided by security forces, beatings and machine guns ringing out over multiple neighbourhoods, local media reported. Three people were killed on Tuesday, including a seven-year-old girl Khin Myo Chit, who was shot dead at her home in Mandalay, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a local monitoring group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-junta-frees-600-detainees/article34156202.ece
25 March 2021||Washington,||Biden calls for ban on assault weapons||Hours after a gunman opened fire in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress to ban assault weapons and mandate stricter background checks for those buying guns. The House of Representatives had passed two laws earlier this month that would require more background checks for potential gun buyers — the Bills are yet to be passed by the evenly split Senate, where it would require a majority of 60. “I don’t need to wait another minute — let alone an hour — to take common-sense steps that will save the lives in the future, and I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act,” Mr. Biden said in remarks delivered at the White House on Tuesday. “We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again,” he said, referring to a ban on these weapons between 1994 and 2004. ‘Pass the Bills’ The U.S. has seen two mass shootings in the span of a week — resulting in a total of 18 deaths. Ten people were reported dead in Monday’s shooting in Boulder. While details of this are still emerging, reports say an assault rifle (AR-15) was used in the attack. Last week, eight people were gunned down, most of them Asian women, at three spas in Atlanta. “The United States Senate — I hope some are listening — should immediately pass the two House-passed Bills that close loopholes in the background check system,” Mr. Biden said. “The AR-15 is one of the most popular guns in America, and not just for sportsmen, but also for people that hunt,” GOP Senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley, said on Tuesday as per the Financial Times . Senate Majority [Democrat] Leader Chuck Schumer said he would push for a vote on the House Bills in the Senate but it is far from clear that he can get at least 10 Republicans, let alone all Democrats, to support him. Centrist Democrat from West Virginia, Joe Manchin, said he did not support the House Bills. Second Amendment The U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment grants the right to bear arms. Fifty-seven percent of Americans felt that gun laws need to be more strict, according to a Gallup poll published in the autumn of 2020. Forty-two percent or respondents said they kept a gun at home. More than 43,500 people died due to gun violence in 2020, according to the Gun Violence Archive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-calls-for-ban-on-assault-weapons/article34156206.ece
25 March 2021||Cairo,||Ship blocks Suez Canal after running aground in sandstorm||Tug boats worked Wednesday to free a giant container ship stuck in the Suez Canal after it veered off course in a sandstorm, creating huge tailbacks on one of the world’s busiest trade routes. Egypt’s Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it was working to refloat the Taiwan-run but Panama-flagged MV Ever Given , a 400-metre-long and 59-metre wide vessel, which was lodged at an angle across the waterway. Historic sections of the canal were reopened to ease the bottleneck of marine traffic, with dozens of ships waiting on both Mediterranean and Red Sea sides. The SCA said the ship was caught in a gale-force sandstorm, common in Egypt’s Sinai desert at this time of the year. It was “mainly due to the lack of visibility due to the weather conditions when winds reached 40 knots, which affected the control” of the ship, the SCA said in a statement. Ship operator Evergreen Marine Corp told AFP that the Rotterdam-bound vessel “ran aground after a suspected gust of wind hit it”.  Shipping monitors MarineTraffic recorded that the vessel had been in the same position since at least Tuesday afternoon. SCA chairman Admiral Osama Rabie said on Wednesday that “rescue and tug units are continuing their efforts” to free the MV Ever Given , involving at least eight tugs.  Bloomberg reported that the situation had caused a build-up of more than 100 ships seeking to transit the canal. “There was a grounding incident,” Alok Roy, fleet director of BSM Hong Kong, the Ever Given ship manager, told the news agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ship-blocks-suez-canal-after-running-aground-in-sandstorm/article34156199.ece
25 March 2021||Kabul,||Taliban slam Afghan President’s proposal for new election||The Taliban on Wednesday rejected a proposal by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to hold elections later this year, after months of peace talks between the two sides have made little progress. Although he hasn’t made details public, Mr. Ghani will announce the election plan at a stakeholder conference in Turkey next month, according to two government officials. The move is likely an attempt to undercut a U.S. proposal, supported by Russia, for the formation of an interim government involving the Taliban to rule the country once the last U.S. troops withdraw. “The government will go to Turkey with a plan for an early election, which is a fair plan for the future of Afghanistan,” said an official. The Taliban immediately rejected the proposal. “Such processes [elections] have pushed the country to the verge of crisis in the past,” said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. “They are now talking about a process that has always been scandalous,” he said, adding that any decision on the country’s future must be hammered out in ongoing talks between the two sides. “We will never support it.” The U.S. is due to withdraw the last of its troops by May 1 under a deal finalised last year, although President Joe Biden said earlier this month the deadline would be “tough” to meet.  They are talking about a process that has always been scandalous ...

Aid groups and Rohingya leaders said the fences hampered rescue work and caused injuries. “Rescue efforts proved to be challenging as a result of the presence of perimeter fencing,” a joint statement from the United Nations, and local and international aid agencies said. But Bangladesh refugee commissioner Shah Rezwan Hayat defended the fencing. “I don’t believe these fences have hampered rescue efforts.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Tamil Nadu’s distinct growth path is in peril||A major concern in contemporary Indian development is the widening socio-economic disparity across groups and regions. Even when regions perform relatively better in one developmental dimension, it does not often translate into all round development. For instance, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala might have attained better levels of human development but that has not been backed by adequate dynamism in the productive economy. Similarly, productive dynamism in Maharashtra and Gujarat has not been accompanied by commensurate improvements in human well being. The recent ‘Bhagwati-Sen’ debate best exemplifies this paradox. While Jagdish Bhagwati makes a case for a trickle-down approach where growth will translate into development as it provides surplus resources for human development, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen argue for a capability-centred developmental path where investments in human capabilities will lead to economic development. Tamil Nadu’s trajectory Tamil Nadu, however, bucks this trend as it has managed to combine relatively high levels of human development with economic dynamism. What explains this distinct development trajectory? We argue that this trajectory can be explained through the pattern of political mobilisation in the State. Populist political mobilisation against caste-based inequalities accompanied by a political emphasis on inclusive modernisation have been critical to this process. As the State goes to elections next month, the media is abuzz with news of competitive welfare promises announced by various parties. What is seldom taken note of is that the State’s distinct developmental path is at stake. We suggest that Dravidian mobilisation has institutionalised two sets of policy interventions — ‘economic popular’ and ‘social popular’, which have fostered a comparatively inclusive development pathway. While both share certain common characteristics, we find this analytical distinction useful. The ‘social popular’ pertains to rights-based interventions that ensure inclusive access to modern sectors and public goods. It has a definite redistributive character. Affirmative action policies, land reforms or legislation for equal property rights for women are some examples. ‘Economic popular’ policies are different. They are driven by electoral imperatives and tend to address issues of absolute poverty such as through expansion of food or education subsidies. No ‘elite bias’ here Scholars like Myron Weiner have pointed out that India’s human development policies have been historically biased towards elites. Such bias can be seen in policies privileging higher education rather than universalising primary education, and investing more in curative and tertiary health care than in preventive and primary health care. Public interventions in health and education in Tamil Nadu have countered this ‘elite bias’. In education, Tamil Nadu emphasised primary education as early as the 1950s and gradually shifted its emphasis towards higher education. Interventions such as the noon meal scheme, that goes back to the Justice Party government in the early 20th century are well known. In addition, infrastructure such as hostels for lower caste students, and transport and tuition subsidies have made education one of the most inclusive and low cost in the country. In higher education, apart from investing in such supportive infrastructure, the State used caste-based reservation to enable broad-based access, simultaneously addressing the differences within the Backward Classes and the Scheduled Castes”. Better indicators in health In health, Tamil Nadu has achieved relatively better indicators such as a favourable total fertility rate, low infant mortality rate, and maternal mortality ratios across social groups. These are again outcomes of a long history of public interventions in health care. ‘Social popular’ measures such as constituting the first State Planning Commission in India with a taskforce specifically for health care, investments in public health infrastructure, and ensuring a socially inclusive pool of health personnel combined effectively with ‘economic popular’ measures such as subsidised health insurance, expanded noon meal schemes, and maternity benefits to generate inclusive health outcomes. If social popular policies helped build public health infrastructure and democratised health governance, economic popular policies enhanced its coverage and added new schemes to meet specific demands. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) is a case in point. Through this scheme, the State has pioneered free provision of essential drugs and diagnostics at public health-care facilities, which in turn has led to households in Tamil Nadu incurring one of the lowest out-of-pocket expenditure for health in India. Such attainments in human development have sustained and fed into economic dynamism. Contrary to popular perceptions that lower castes are mere recipients of welfare benefits, our analysis of the State’s experience tells a different story. Tamil Nadu is home to a higher share of lower caste entrepreneurs compared to Maharashtra or Gujarat. This simultaneity of growth and development becomes particularly evident in the 1990s when regional governments were tasked with the responsibility of mobilising resources for development particularly through attracting private investments. This is a phase when the long-term investments in higher education in the State translated into capital accumulation by sections of lower castes. Several entrepreneurs from lower castes, armed with technical capabilities, emerged during this period. In addition, Tamil Nadu has also witnessed relatively better diffusion of gains to labour. Though the State is not immune to the global and nation-wide shifts against labour, wage levels and social protection for labour in both the organised and unorganised sectors tend to be better. In fact, apart from relatively lower levels of contractualisation, the share of wages in organised manufacturing is the highest among industrially dynamic States such as Maharashtra and Gujarat. We suggest that this became possible partly due to better unionisation and also due to welfare interventions outside the workplace that helped enhance the bargaining power of labour. The embedding of labour mobilisation within larger social solidarities among lower castes is critical to the higher unionisation and state response to labour demands. Advances made in human capital formation too aided this process. Relatively higher wages could be offset by access to better quality of labour inputs for competitive accumulation. Based on the Tamil Nadu experience, we can therefore say that processes of human development and economic dynamism can go hand-in-hand and not necessarily be sequential, as hinted by the ‘Bhagwati-Sen’ debate. Some imbalances There are, however, asymmetries emerging in this development trajectory. Federal constraints on resource transfers as well as powers to chart autonomous policies are increasing. This curtails powers to respond to popular demands at the subnational scale. The arbitrary imposition of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions to medical courses is one such example. We are also beginning to witness unevenness in the quality of health care and education in Tamil Nadu. Poor learning outcomes among schoolchildren as well as a growing preference for private schools even among marginalised social groups have been causes for concern. Similarly, the increase in reliance on private health-care facilities implies a segmentation of public services based on perceived or real differences in quality. Though not unique to the State, this opens spaces for new disparities. Further, despite a highly dynamic manufacturing and high end service segments, the quantum and quality of jobs are inadequate to accommodate the large numbers of educated lower caste youth entering the labour market. This aggravates the reduced efficacy of affirmative action — a policy central to Dravidian mobilisation, due to growing privatisation. Together, such trends generate new axes of inequalities that are both intra and inter-caste that challenge the sustaining of the Dravidian bloc. The emphasis on welfare interventions is clearly insufficient. The extent to which political mobilisation can reorient its terrain to forge appropriate demands in the new context will therefore shape the possibilities of further expansion of substantive democracy in Tamil Nadu.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Arresting the juggernaut in Assam||The biggest success of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s election campaign in Assam has been the virtual erasure of the rage against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) from public memory. The movement against the CAA was crucial in uniting the people of all communities in Assam. Even Bengali Hindus in Assam Valley were lukewarm towards the law that they feared might plunge the State once again into instability and chaos. The BJP campaign The BJP has followed a calculated, systematic plan to go about this. For months, it said little about the CAA, instead harping on its alleged historic achievements in ensuring that Assam was at long last on the path ofvikas(development). The party’s rallies have been spectacular extravaganzas filled with airy promises and menacing innuendos. The BJP’s top leaders, including the Prime Minister, Home Minister and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, have repeatedly spoken of Assam’s glorious heritage. They have promised to preserve the State’s culture, traditions and civilisation and ensure that Assam remains free of militancy, agitation, infiltration, violence, corruption, flood and pollution, if voted back to power. The State leaders also borrowed from the war cries of the national leaders against an “alien civilisation” in the State and “Mughal invaders”. They have all repeated the cliche that all the Congress did during its rule was indulge in corruption and “appease” Muslims. Further, the BJP has handed out an incredible amount of money in the last quarter in the guise of welfare schemes, borrowing for that purpose, according to regional reports, Rs. 80,000 crore. Needless to say, it will be a tremendous fiscal burden on any future government in this financially ailing State. The party has managed to assuage the pent-up fury of the common people who had been reeling under the effects of demonetisation, the Goods and Services Tax, soaring prices, unemployment, loss of income and the blow dealt to them by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many in the countryside now fear that if they don’t vote for the BJP, money will dry up, though it is certain that such largesse cannot be maintained much beyond the election. The BJP also released Rs. 2.5 lakh each to 8,756 namghars in August 2020. Namghars are centres of rural social life, though with waning influence. Incumbent Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has claimed that CAA is not an issue anymore. The party’s manifesto does not mention the CAA. Despite all this, the BJP is not sure if it can repeat the triumph of 2016. It is holding quite a few high-pitched rallies at the last moment, possibly to befuddle judgment. Thousands of people accompanied Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sharma when he went to file his nomination papers. But the youth, quite ahead of Opposition leaders, have been scathing in their remarks on the hypocrisy, false promises and hollow claims of the BJP.  The Grand Alliance cobbled together by the Congress has held firm in spite of the weaknesses of the national party, thanks to the determination of the Left parties not to allow a division of votes. The Congress leaders had lost touch with the masses and it is because of the excesses of the BJP that the party has gained some ground now. But there is no reason to assume that the anti-BJP sentiment will automatically turn into votes unless the Grand Alliance puts in a consistent, united, and dedicated effort till the final hour. Their top State leaders have been embroiled in unseemly turf wars, with Gaurav Gogoi also entering the fray allegedly with the aim of joining State politics in the future. Leaders deputed by the Congress high command have tried hard to keep things going, but their efforts have been hampered due to their ignorance of the specifics of the situation. The Congress is now mounting a campaign to highlight the follies and failures of the BJP. Its manifesto speaks to the people’s concerns though there are a few unfortunate concessions to the BJP’s populist religious narrative. It has rightly stuck to a clear stand on the CAA. In a few constituencies, perhaps because of infighting or loss of base, it has put up weak candidates. It has the solid support of Muslims in many constituencies and is gaining some ground in the tea garden regions where it was dislodged earlier by the BJP. The BJP’s fear of offending big capital by raising wages in these regions has provoked anger and mistrust among large numbers of the tea-garden workers. The Left parties have to be content with the few seats they have been offered because of their awareness of the much bigger threat posed by the resumption of BJP rule. The Congress’s alliance with the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) is the greatest gamble it has taken considering the long-standing feud between the two parties for immigrant Muslim votes. But in view of the creeping fear among Muslims about the intentions of the BJP, the alliance may well pay dividends. That is precisely why the BJP keeps harping on the alleged threat to the Hindu Assamese and the tribals and projects AIUDF leader Badruddin Ajmal as the future Chief Minister of Assam to drive the indigenous peoples into panic. But this strategy seems to have had only limited success. Mr. Ajmal is an orthodox Maulana but has enough sense not to indulge in anti-Assamese or anti-Hindu fusillades. Dividing anti-BJP votes Both the regional parties, the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and the Raijor Dal, have said that the BJP is a menace to democracy and will change the identity of the indigenous people; yet, surprisingly, both of them have kept their distance from the Congress saying that all the national parties have aims antithetical to regional interests. The AJP has in its fold some stalwarts who may prefer the BJP to the Congress if the question of a post-poll alliance arises at all. Activist Akhil Gogoi’s detention hampered the efforts of his Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti whose members know how to agitate but have no idea how to run an election. They have a following among the poor and marginalised and should have thrown in their lot with the Grand Alliance. Mr. Gogoi stubbornly bargained till the eleventh hour with the Congress demanding that the AIUDF be dropped from the Grand Alliance, an impossible demand from the perspective of the Congress. That they are contesting just a few seats now has unwittingly weakened the Opposition. But the late entry of Bodo People’s Front leader Hagrama Mohilary, now disenchanted with the BJP, might add several seats to the Grand Alliance from the Bodoland Territorial Area District. The two regional parties may snatch some votes from the Grand Alliance and end up dividing the anti-BJP votes. This would only weaken the prospects of democratic forces.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Assessing India’s counter to ‘diminishing democracy’||The first three weeks of March saw major developments in the ongoing drama over international assessment of how New Delhi has overseen the functioning of Indian democracy in the recent past. There were the annual reports of the United States-based Freedom House and the Sweden-based V-Dem Institute, which downgraded and redesignated Indian democracy. And farmers’ safety and curbs to press freedom in the context of the ongoing protests by farmers were debated in the British Parliament. New Delhi has hit back. But how do we assess its response? Consider three elements. Aggressive, fine-tuned First, there is decidedly a new approach. Something more layered is replacing the reliance on hard sovereignty. While the establishment continues to underline the internal nature of the issues raised, it is also beginning to counter the criticisms aggressively. The strongest evidence of this yet came from a discussion in the Rajya Sabha, on March 15, 2021, on racism in the United Kingdom. It appeared to implicate everyone, from the royals to society at large, in systemic racism. India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar noted the concern on behalf of the government and made the assurance that it would be taken up with the U.K. even as India would ‘monitor these developments very, very closely’. Earlier, on March 9, 2021, in response to the debate in the U.K. Parliament on the ‘safety of farmers’ and ‘press freedom’ in India, the Indian High Commission in London had noted the ‘need to set the record straight’ regardless of claims of ‘friendship and love for India’ professed by anyone. The statement was brash, while the location from which it was released was symbolically significant. The response is also becoming fine-tuned. The London statement called India ‘the largest functioning democracy in the world’. The key word here was ‘functioning’. The emphasis had moved from the size of Indian democracy to its quality. What it was insinuating at became clear with Mr. Jaishankar’s remark made in Chennai on March 13, 2021: ‘Look at the politics of these places… whatever you might say… in this country [India] nobody questions an election. Can you say that in those countries?’The reference obviously was to the United States. Further, the London statement mentioned India’s ‘well-established independent democratic institutions’. This formulation sought to counter the allegations that authority has become increasingly personalised in India. It asserted the apparent autonomy of Indian institutions. Finally, it has sought to narrow down the scope of the issue and belittle its opponents. A statement by the Ministry of External Affairs on February 3, 2021, arguably put out in response to the celebrity tweets, claimed that a ‘very small section of farmers in parts of India’ had ‘some’ reservations about the farm reforms. It also referred to international critics as ‘fringe elements’ and linked them to desecration of Gandhi statues. This was built upon in the London statement. It referred to the discussion as involving ‘a small group’ of parliamentarians in ‘a limited quorum’. A favourable global situation Second, the assertiveness in the establishment’s response is partly because India currently enjoys a favourable international constellation. Relatively speaking, the novel coronavirus pandemic has spared India and allowed the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer (by number of doses produced and sold globally) to engage in vaccine diplomacy and position itself as an ‘internationalist’ actor. Here, New Delhi has attempted a transference of latitude, leveraging the goodwill generated by ‘Vaccine Maitri’ to counter the criticisms. Thus, in Chennai, Mr. Jaishankar asked what the (presumably western) critics of the Delhi regime had done in comparison with India’s critical health aid to 70 countries. The fact that the western countries have struggled to cope effectively with the pandemic and remain inconsistent as well as, as in Europe, divided in their governmental and medical responses, also makes India look coherent and ‘functional’. Further, the contemporary crisis within western democracies is deep rooted. While it eludes resolution, the fact is that it has robbed western governments of the reputational privilege and the moral right to criticise what they view as assaults on liberal democratic values. We see governments quiet but streets and legislators vocal. This factor, coupled with their need for India for economic, environmental, and geopolitical reasons, offers New Delhi considerable space for an aggressive response. Finally, the conservative allies in western countries that New Delhi has likely cultivated have also helped it undercut international criticism. Recall the October 2019 visit to Kashmir of about two dozen largely right-wing Members of European Parliament. Further, a quick review of the remarks of Conservative UK MPs Bob Blackman and Theresa Villiers on contentious issues concerning India over the past nearly two years will be revealing. In fact, Ms. Villiers’ statement during the U.K. parliamentary discussion in early March was remarkably understanding of New Delhi’s position. Key question unanswered Third, the question of the effectiveness of its response. How substantive is New Delhi’s counter? In part, as Mr. Jaishankar’s remarks in Chennai showed, it has met facts with rhetoric. In addition, it has questioned the practice of western institutions and civil society of judging and criticising those political processes in non-western democracies that do not match up to western standards. The objection is useful insofar as it checks sorry remnants of western cultural arrogance as well as ‘knowledge imperialism’. But it does not address the fundamental point of the critics, which is that human dignity and freedoms are universal and an assault on them anywhere is an assault on them everywhere. New Delhi was well within its rights to offer the sovereignty shrug and say it did not care. But it has engaged the critics, not on facts but on values. And now it must make its position clear. If it does not believe that these values apply to all human beings everywhere, regardless of the society and culture in which they find themselves, then it can state it unambiguously. This would deprive its critics of the moral basis for their criticism. At the Munich Security Conference in February last year, Mr. Jaishankar argued that democracy and the West should not be equated, implying that there are different types of democracies. Fair point. But the Minister did not pursue the thought fully. His South Korean counterpart did. Speaking after him, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Korea Kang Kyung-wha said: ‘South Korea is West if you are going by values… Instead of talking about the West let’s talk about the values that we are trying to prove.’ This is an approach worth considering. For in order to effectively counter its critics, the establishment must first confront itself. Atul Mishra teaches International Relations at Shiv Nadar University.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Water, the looming frontier||While we are still in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is airborne, we have forgotten that another such blight could well come from contaminated water. NITI Ayog and WaterAid, amongst others, have found that over 70% of India’s surface and groundwater is contaminated by human and other waste and is likely to carry viruses. Indiscriminate human activity is often the reason for environmental degradation and pandemics. The practice of keeping animals locked together for mass production of meat produces an artificial environment that can birth mutations in erstwhile dormant viruses. Earlier, in the wild, animals were far away from human habitats. The viruses they harboured remained isolated. But today’s practices can spawn viruses that can easily transfer to the human population. A source of virus Once the virus has found its way into the human population, it is bound to proliferate in wastewater. For example, in England, Wales and Scotland, several wastewater samples were tested and were found to carry traces of SARS-CoV-2. Remnants of the virus have also been detected in raw sewage across Sydney. Research at the University of Stirling in Scotland indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can spread through sewage water. But such water is often discharged into water bodies in India. This is an alarming prospect for us as river water or lake water, which carries human waste, sewage, and toxic waste, can be a very generous host for viruses of different kinds and we do not know where and how they can mutate and strike. Some water-transmitted viral pathogens are astrovirus, hepatitis A and norovirus. Unlike in the developed world, a huge section of the population in India uses polluted water from sources like rivers, lakes, or groundwater for drinking. Are we prepared for this? Certainly not. Can we be prepared? Very unlikely, even if we understood the viruses, and we are not there yet. Can we decontaminate our water bodies and groundwater? This could take several decades. But despite the poor quality of water in India, the government has announced a Rs. 3 lakh crore ‘Nal se Jal’ scheme to provide drinking water connections to every rural household by 2024. Since most of the water sources are contaminated, the only way to purify water is through reverse osmosis (RO). But though RO removes contaminants, it also takes out all the healthy minerals and nutrients required by the human body. This is an unhealthy and exorbitantly priced proposition. To neutralise the virus, we would need at least an ultraviolet aquaguard treatment. While this won’t take out chemical contaminants, it is also costly. So, what is the solution? The simple answer is that there is no technological substitute for living natural resources like pristine natural water and soil. This means that we must conserve and use our natural living resources. The water beneath our forests is as good as natural spring water. We must safeguard it for our own lives and for future generations. We have destroyed our natural living resources in our rush for development. Our development model is always focused on artificial infrastrusture, building highways, industrial plants, high-rise structures. In doing this, we kill our natural resources. As a result, we are running out of natural infrastructure at an alarming pace. Let’s not forget that developed countries have stable landscapes and populations whereas India has a growing population, which means there will be growing consumption. Freshwater sources There are two unpolluted fresh water sources left in the country. The first is the water lying below our forests; the second is the aquifers that lie below the floodplains of rivers. Both these sources provide natural underground storage and are renewable – the rains provide natural recharge year after year and it is this recharge which can be used to water our cities and towns. There is one sacred conservation condition: we should use only a fraction of the annual recharge. The aquifers underlying forests can provide healthy mineral water purely for drinking purposes. Since a person drinks only 2-3 litres of water a day, the mineral water requirement is modest. The river floodplains are a great source of water for cities. The Yamuna floodplains in Delhi already use such a scheme to provide water to a million people each year. Forests and floodplains must be declared as water sanctuaries. Such schemes work with nature rather than against it. They can be used around the globe. It is important to remember that these evolutionary resources, once lost, will be lost forever. It is time we understood this is natural infrastructure bequeathed to us by nature. If we don’t realise this, it will only be our loss.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Adding coal to the fire||If India loses the fight against climate change, new investments in coal will be a decisive factor. India has reaffirmed its commitment to bold plans for switching to renewable energy. Yet, one of the world’s largest new coal investments is Adani’s $16.5 billion dollar Carmichael coal mine project in Queensland. That this project is going ahead despite coal’s declining competitiveness raises valid concerns that the new coal investments are viable only because they are supported by the Australian government’s subsidies or incentives. Gains and losses Coal mining provides incomes for Australia’s local economy, but the health and environmental harm from mining and combustion represents a big net loss for the world. CO2 emissions, the chief cause of climate change, totalled 36 billion metric tonnes globally in 2019, of which nearly 40% came from coal. The Carmichael mine is set to become Australia’s largest coal mine, producing up to 60 million tonnes of coal annually and 2.3 billion tonnes over its 60-year lifespan. Of the nearly 8 billion tonnes of coal produced globally in 2019, a sixth is exported, with the largest share, one third, coming from Australia. In 2020, 16% of Australia’s coal exports were shipped to India. As India is the primary buyer of the Carmichael coal, the project will significantly add to its emissions. Australia’s coal mining and coal exports generate incomes and jobs, but when the destruction from pollution, soil erosion, and biodiversity loss is included, the net contribution for India is negative. In south-western China, the environmental and social damage from burning coal exceeds the price of coal by four times. The health damages from coal-fired power stations in the U.S. are estimated at 1-6 times the value of the power output. In India, coal contributes to 1,00,000 premature deaths annually: the poor are hit hardest. With declining coal prices, the mine may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to get a return on investment. That the project might not be viable even financially — and this without considering the environmental, social and health impacts — is damning. It supports the worry that government subsidies underlie Adani’s decision to proceed with the project. It bears mentioning that 17 international banks declined to fund the Carmichael mine based on its weak financials and environmental danger; State Bank of India’s plan to provide financing is under scrutiny. A report by the Australia Institute points out that the spillover harm from extracting and burning coal is not included in the true cost of coal projects. One estimate puts the damage to health alone in Australia at $2.6 billion annually. The mining of coal emits massive amounts of particle pollution, contributing to heart disease, lung disease and lung cancer. With exports of coal, India will be hurt too from burning coal, and the global harm is a multiple of Australia’s. Leave coal underground Then there is the environmental and climate impact. Annual emissions of 79 million tonnes of carbon equivalent from the Carmichael mine is higher than Malaysia’s 75 million tonnes and Austria’s 76 million tonnes. The mine will also lead to the Galilee Basin being opened up to nine additional coal mines, which would cumulatively emit an estimated 705 million tonnes of CO2 every year, more than 1.3 times Australia’s current emissions. After facing heat waves, bushfires, and intense rainfall that are linked to climate change, Australia should be deeply concerned — and so should India. The Government of India is drawing up plans for carbon neutrality, following several others that have announced 2050 as their target date for this. Achieving a zero-carbon target will require vast investments in the production, storage, and distribution of renewable energy. But the approval for Adani to mine and export coal to India makes reaching those targets much harder. It is time for India and Australia to leave coal underground.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Tactical abstention||By abstaining from the vote on the UN Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka, India has signalled its unwillingness to upset its neighbour. At the same time, it does not want to be seen as ignoring Sri Lanka’s reluctance to meet the political aspirations of the Tamils or endorsing the country’s stubborn refusal to ensure any sort of accountability for its war-time past. It may be easy for the political opposition to dismiss India’s abstention as showing an intent to shield Sri Lanka from a credible investigation into allegations of war crimes. A more reasonable assessment would be that India seems to have utilised the opportunity to preserve its diplomatic space and to contain the pervasive influence of China over Sri Lanka even while maintaining its support for the Tamil minority to achieve equality, justice, dignity and peace. India has not been comfortable with externally mandated investigative mechanisms. Even when it voted in 2012 in favour of a credible investigation into human rights, India had got the resolution to incorporate the need for Sri Lanka’s ‘concurrence’ to any assistance that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights may offer in such a probe. In this session and just ahead of the vote, India stressed on both meaningful devolution to meet Tamil aspirations and the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka — aspects that it believes are not an ‘either-or’ choice. The resolution comes amidst disturbing signs that Sri Lanka is regressing into the days of democratic deficit seen prior to the 2015 elections. Unfortunately, the present regime withdrew from the commitments made to the UNHRC by its predecessor on constructive engagement with the international community, and the consensual resolution on justice and accountability. The UN High Commissioner’s report raises concern over increasing militarisation, heightened surveillance against rights defenders and NGOs, interference with the few prosecutions in emblematic cases from the past, and the dangerous anti-minority rhetoric. India’s concerns in Sri Lanka have always been different from the rest of the international community, informed by a sense of the long-term well-being of the Tamils, and that power-sharing does foster reconciliation. Hence its emphasis on devolution rather than accountability. It is clear that India has its own limitations in expressing disappointment over the island nation’s move away from reconciliation and devolution. It continues to be weighed down by the Chinese presence in the region. Even the need to be in accord with sentiment in Tamil Nadu in the midst of an election was not motivation enough for India to change its position from tactical neutrality to one of open support for the resolution. When pragmatism and principle were needed in equal measure, the Centre seems to have chosen abstention as an easy way out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/tactical-abstention/article34156173.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Arts and awards||The announcement of the 67th National Film Awards on Monday, to recognise films certified in 2019, quite predictably drew its share of controversies. While some attributed a few of the awards to the political alignment of the personalities and films concerned, there were others who thought that deserving candidates were overlooked. However, there was no disputing the fact that the awards acknowledged both well known and less known films from different pockets of the country. Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Bengali films have always had their fair share of recognition, winning a clutch of awards. Thanks to the blurring of regional and language boundaries in cinema in recent years, a Tamil or a Telugu film, for instance, now stands a better chance at enjoying a pan-Indian theatrical release with subtitles, and thereafter reaching wider audiences through digital platforms. Dhanush, Vetri Maaran and Vijay Sethupathi are names that are recognised well beyond the boundaries of Tamil cinema, appreciated for projects that have smudged the line between art house and mainstream cinema. Dhanush being declared the Best Actor for Asuran , which was also acknowledged the Best Tamil Film, and Sethupathi winning Best Supporting Actor for Super Deluxe , have been lauded widely. Sharing the Best Actor honours with Dhanush is Manoj Bajpayee for his internalised performance in Bhonsle . The Kannada film Avane Srimannarayana was chosen for Best Action Direction. The Malayalam period magnum opus Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea bagged Best Feature Film. The award that drew the fiercest criticism was that of Kangana Ranaut for being declared Best Actress for Panga and Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi . Whether or not her politics was a factor in the choice, there is no doubting Kangana’s talent. Look beyond the noise surrounding this recognition, and the National Awards also put the spotlight on films from the Northeast region — the Khasi film Iewduh for Best Audiography (Location Sound Recordist) and Water Burial , in Arunachal Pradesh’s tribal Monpa language, for Best Film for Environment Conservation. For film industries that rarely enjoy their place in the sun, a National Award should ideally help winning films find a wider audience. It has not always been the case, but there is hope, in a world where cinema may increasingly be consumed on digital platforms. Perhaps, brushing aside the high-pitched debates, it is imperative to look at how some of these less known feature films, and award-winning non-feature films, can find their target audience, without having to rely on marketing muscle. A framework to bring these films to limelight, with the help of digital platforms, will be an incentive to film-makers striving to narrate stories from the remote corners of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/arts-and-awards/article34156174.ece

Achutha Menon, to-day [Trivandrum, March 24] called for “fundamental changes” in the economic and financial relations between the Centre and the States to enable the latter to stand on their own legs. These changes would have to be brought about by amending the Constitution, if necessary, he said. Mr. Menon warned that Centre-State relations would become “strained and create more difficulties” if the changes were not brought about or delayed. Mr. Menon was replying to the three-day general discussion in the State Assembly on the budget for 1971-72 presented to the House by him on Friday last.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Revolutionary change in education||According to a writer in the Popular Science siftings , the time-honoured entrance examinations to the various educational institutions are now being dispensed with in the United States, substituting in their place tests based on the principle of mental alertness. This revolutionary change, forms the climax of more than a decade of research and experiment on the part of psychologists. And far from affecting the standard and efficiency of selection, the new test, we are assured by Prof. Robert G. Skerret, is calculated to eliminate many applicants, who are now able to gain admission by means by what he calls an ‘academic camouflage,’ and pick out the promising intellectual sheep from the unimprovable goats. And the question as to how the new method will fulfil the functions of the orthodox written examination, the Professor answers by saying that the volume and variety of an aspirant-student’s knowledge is not so important as his grasp of the basic principles involved, and his ability to apply these logically and quickly. The several tests devised to judge this capacity in the student comprise oral problems, to test ingenuity, to be answered without the use of pen and paper, the repetition of series of digits in normal and reverse order to test attentiveness and memory, moralisation from simple fables read out to the student, and many others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/revolutionary-change-in-education/article34156183.ece
25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Define unfair trade practice for e-com’||A parliamentary panel has recommended that the government should offer a more clear-cut definition of what constitutes ‘unfair’ trade practice as well as spell out a practical legal remedy to tackle the issue, warning that there was a risk that predatory pricing by e-commerce firms may result in competition being wiped out and prove detrimental to consumers in the long run. The panel, headed by Partap Singh Bajwa, in its report on ‘The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020’ tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, has also recommended fixing a cap on delivery charges levied by e-commerce firms, as well as providing for penal provisions for violation of rules related to misinformation. The committee noted that while e-commerce enterprises offer many benefits, the development of the segment has rendered consumers vulnerable to new forms of unfair trade practices, violation of privacy and issues of unattended grievances. “Predatory pricing as a short-term strategy, adopted by some of the market giants with deep pockets to sustain short-term losses and reduce the prices of their products below the average variable costs may lead to wiping out competition from the market and could be detrimental to the consumers in the long run,” the committee said. ‘Difficult to prove’ It, however, added that from a legal standpoint it was very hard to substantiate allegations of predatory pricing, since the impact of such practice on the competition in the market would be very difficult to prove. “The Committee, therefore, recommends that there should be a more clear-cut definition of what constitutes Unfair Trade Practice and practical legal remedy to tackle such circumventing practices by e-commerce entities specifically multinational companies and kirana small vendors.” The panel also suggested that the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution should issue broad guidelines for the fixation of delivery charges charged by the marketplace entities along with a cap on the highest limits of the delivery charges in peak hours of service. “The Ministry should clearly distinguish in the rules itself the cases of misinformation, no information and the information which is otherwise correct but creates a false impression and provide for penal provision for each case in the rules itself,” it said. The Ministry should also clearly define ‘drip pricing’— wherein the final cost of the product goes up due to additional charges, and provide for protecting consumers against this by including penal provisions for violation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/define-unfair-trade-practice-for-e-com/article34156160.ece

25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Neeraj is the perfect role model’||Neeraj Chopra may be India’s brightest Olympic hope, but the stardom sits easy on the javelin thrower. His coach insists it is just one of the factors that make him an ideal role model. “Neeraj can be the perfect role model. He is not jealous and he is not insecure of his own form or position. He never says no to anyone for help. One of the best “He is also one of the best all-round athletes here and one of the hardest working people. What more can you ask for?” says Dr. Klaus Bartonietz, the bio-mechanical expert in charge of Chopra for the last two years. Bartonietz took charge in 2019, at a time when the youngster was going through a testing time with his injury and subsequent surgery which forced him to forego competitions for the entire year. With 2020 marred with COVID, there was little opportunity to test him against the best in the world. But it gave them enough time to iron out the creases and push him towards the elusive 90m mark. “We had a very good general preparation in the last three months. We worked in the gymnastic hall with parallel bars, high bars, rope climbing and all such things, did a lot of systematic strength training. In the last two years we have worked on things like improving the use of the javelin, no unnecessary attack, the angles which you let the javelin fly and the importance and impact of air resistance,” Bartonietz told The Hindu . What makes Neeraj different, he said, was his athleticism. “His athleticism is at world level. He is the best overall athlete — on the track in sprints, jumps, lifting, gymnastic work for flexibility and athleticism, core work, everything. He is also the most creative towards his own training. “He is always reflecting on his position and takes the initiative to bring his own ideas into his training. There is a clarity of thought on what he wants to do,” Bartonietz explained. Asked if he can cross the 90m mark, Bartonietz insisted he could. “Maybe he throws 90m at the next competition, that is possible. Honestly, it isn’t anything spectacular you need to do. It is all about daily hard and smart work, removing shortcomings, working on strong sides, staying healthy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neeraj-is-the-perfect-role-model-bartonietz/article34156318.ece
25 March 2021||PUNE,||Ducks to water — Krunal, Prasidh show they belong||One had an emotional outburst. The other chose to display controlled aggression. Despite contrasting reactions to their success, both of Tuesday’s debutants not only rose to the occasion but also reaffirmed that they belonged to the fearless generation of new-age India cricketers. All-rounder Krunal Pandya and fast-bowler M. Prasidh Krishna joined the long list of newcomers taking to international cricket like a duck to water in a unique season for the Indian team. Like the majority of newcomers this season, neither Krunal — who made his ODI debut on the eve of his 30th birthday — nor Prasidh, 25, are callow young men. Both have experienced the challenges and pressures of domestic cricket, the India-A circuit and the Indian Premier League (IPL). And as veteran opener Shikhar Dhawan pointed out, performing in the IPL helps domestic cricketers not get overawed in the international arena. “They are confident because they play so many domestic games and IPL, and they share the dressing room with big players, play against them. That builds confidence and they feel the same players play international cricket,” Dhawan said after winning his first ODI ‘Man of the Match’ award in India since November 2013. IPL exposure helps “Also, IPL has some top-notch coaches, so the IPL exposure helps a lot, and our domestic cricket is strong, so it is a good mix of the two that’s helping new players perform better.” Both Krunal and Prasidh displayed their belief in themselves — in terms of skills and mental toughness. Krunal came in to bat with fewer than 10 overs remaining and his side in danger of falling considerably short of the par score. He promptly scored the fastest ODI fifty by a debutant, elevating India into the ascendancy at half-time. It was followed by an emotional outpouring, with a teary-eyed Krunal finding solace in younger brother Hardik’s arms, as they paid tribute to their father Himanshu who passed away in January. Early in the chase, Jonny Bairstow targeted Prasidh and used the quick’s pace — consistently clocked at more than 140 kmph. When a debutant goes for 22 runs early in the piece, seldom does he get his act together later in the match. No doubt it helped that captain Virat Kohli immediately took him out of the attack, but when Prasidh returned to bowl, he saw the back of Jason Roy and Ben Stokes in successive overs. It got even sweeter — when he dismissed Tom Curran off what turned out to be the last ball of the match, Prasidh became the first India pacer to pick four wickets on ODI debut.  Krunal’s debut was only the third occasion of siblings featuring together in a men’s ODI for India, after the Amarnath brothers (Mohinder and Surinder, 3 games) and the Pathans (Irfan and Yusuf, 8 games). Despite being a bowling all-rounder in T20Is, Krunal earned an ODI call-up thanks to his scintillating performance with the bat in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He scored 388 runs in five innings at 129.33, including two unbeaten hundreds, for Baroda. In spite of picking up five wickets on his First Class debut, for Karnataka vs Bangladesh-A, Prasidh has played just nine FC games so far. But he has made rapid strides in limited-overs cricket, catapulting himself into the reckoning for the forthcoming T20 World Cup.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ducks-to-water-krunal-prasidh-show-they-belong/article34156285.ece
25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Aishwary in blistering form, clinches gold||Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar won the men’s rifle 3-position gold while Chinki Yadav beat Rahi Sarnobat and Manu Bhaker for the women’s sports pistol gold in the World Cup at the Dr. Karni Singh Range on Wednesday. Even though Anjum Moudgil and company failed to make the women’s rifle 3-position final, India was sitting pretty on top of the medals table with nine gold, five silver and five bronze. The US followed a distant second with three gold, two silver and a bronze. The 20-year-old Aishwary beat a strong field and pushed world No. 1 Istvan Peni to the silver by 0.9 point. Aishwary said he had aimed for the gold and coach Suma Shirur said that the young boy was a ‘natural talent’ and was making ‘rapid progress’. The gold in an event in which Olympian Sanjeev Rajput finished sixth, should strengthen Aishwary’s claim on the Olympic quota that he had won. In women’s sports pistol, Chinki was brilliant as she beat Asian Games gold medallist Rahi 4-3 in the shoot-off, after the two were tied 32-32. Nosing ahead Rahi picked herself up after a poor start to nose ahead of Manu Bhaker, who had two bad series in the final. With the three pronged race in the event for the Olympics, Chinki’s gold could help her retain the Olympic quota. She had scored the second best in qualification with 580, one point behind Rahi.

25 March 2021||BENGALURU,||National Para Athletics hits a new low||The National Para Athletics Championship slipped into fresh crisis on Wednesday after a few events at night were conducted with just mobile phone torch lights. Officials were seen measuring shot put marks at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium with tiny flash bulbs for an event that is a qualification competition for Tokyo 2020 Paralympics. An athlete, who wished to remain anonymous, said massive delays during the day had resulted in events slipping beyond sunset and the organisers did not use the available flood lights. Norms flouted There were also allegations from athletes that international Paralympic norms were flouted in deciding the weights for events like shot put. Neither Satyanarayana, the Bengaluru-based chairman of the Technical Committee of Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) nor Gursharan Singh, Secretary General of PCI, were available for comment. Earlier in the day, the organisers were at the receiving end of the Sports Authority of India’s ire. SAI, in a press statement, had expressed concern that Stadia in Bengaluru at which the Championship is being held were not “wheelchair-friendly” and that COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures like physical distancing were not being adhered to. It sought a report from the PCI regarding the same. The PCI wrote back listing all arrangements that had been made, like the setting up of widely dispersed tents, sanitised water bottles and random COVID-19 tests. According to PCI, distancing guidelines were breached when athletes were registering for events and that the crowd was subsequently dispersed. PCI’s assurance To the specific concern about one of the stadia — Sree Kanteerava Stadium — not being wheelchair-friendly, PCI said that a very small patch of track under renovation could not be completed before the competition was shifted to Bengaluru from Chennai at short notice. The PCI assured that a temporary solution will soon be found. On day one of the competition on Wednesday, S. Gokul Srinivas of Tamil Nadu won the gold in long jump T20 category with a leap of 4.56m. M.S. Sujith of Kerala finished first in long jump T12 category with a jump of 6.88m. According to the PCI, no athlete secured qualification for Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/national-para-athletics-hits-a-new-low/article34156323.ece
25 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Shafali, Richa, Harleen and Rajeshwari dispel some gloom||It was delightful, the way Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana tangoed together at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium on Tuesday night. While it was ‘see ball, hit ball’ for Shafali, Smriti was all silken grace and sublime timing. Shafali had ruined the South African bowlers’ figures in the second T20I too, with her 31-ball 47. But India had lost the match to surrender the rubber. Her 60 off 30 balls in the final game, however, gave India a much-needed consolation win. A scoreline of 2-1 always reads much better than 3-0. Shafali’s great show also helped her regain the No. 1 spot in the ICC’s rankings for T20 batting. Perhaps she will not be made to wait much longer for her ODI debut. Especially after India’s 4-1 defeat in the series that preceded the T20Is. Formidable alliance Shafali could form a formidable opening alliance with the left-handed Smriti in ODIs, too. She wasn’t the only 17-year-old who got the vocal crowds on their feet here. There was Richa Ghosh, too. She made a blistering 44 not out off 26 balls in the second T20I. She could turn into a handy finisher. Yet another youngster, Harleen Deol, also showed what she could do when given an opportunity. The 22-year-old from Chandigarh made her maiden international fifty after being sent in at No. 3 in the first T20I and followed it up with 31 in the second. Her leg-spin is a value addition. The success of the young trio should indeed gladden the Indian team management. Despite losing the series, this side appears to be moving in the right direction, certainly as far as the T20 format is considered. The superb bowling of left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the final T20I would have also pleased coach W.V. Raman, after the Indian slow bowlers disappointed in the ODI series. The South African batters tackled the Indian spinners rather well, until they walked into that magical spell from Rajeshwari. The heavy defeat notwithstanding, there were some memorable moments for the host in the 50-overs series as well. Captain Mithali Raj crossed another milestone, as she became only the second ever female cricketer to reach 10,000 international runs. And there was a fine hundred for Punam Raut. The Women in Blue may not have lived up to the expectations, but they had been rusting a bit, having played little cricket during the last one year following the coronavirus outbreak. The South Africans, on the other hand, arrived here like a well-oiled machine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shafali-richa-and-harleen-dispel-some-gloom/article34156281.ece

25 March 2021||Chennai,||CSK unveils redesigned jersey||Chennai Super Kings, on Wednesday, unveiled a new jersey, the first redesign since the inaugural 2008 edition. The new-look jersey features camouflage as a tribute to India’s armed forces and three stars atop the franchise’s logo. Ahead of the 2019 IPL season, CSK presented a cheque of Rs. 2 crore for the armed forces. It may be recalled that skipper M.S. Dhoni is an honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army and also trained with the Parachute Regiment in 2019. “It has been on our mind for some time now to find ways to raise awareness about the significant and selfless role of the armed forces. The camouflage is an appreciation of their service… they are the true heroes,” said CSK CEO K.S. Viswanathan. Fans can order replica jersey through the CSK app or website www.chennaisuperkings.com  Meanwhile, 20-year-old Afghanistan fast bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi has been roped in as a net bowler by CSK for the upcoming season.

25 March 2021||PUNE,||Shreyas out of ODIs||India batsman Shreyas Iyer has been ruled out of the ODI series and is a doubtful starter for the IPL after injuring his left shoulder while fielding during the first ODI against England on Tuesday. An India team spokesperson on Tuesday had revealed that Shreyas was diagnosed with partial dislocation and had gone for a scan. The Hindu understands that the scans have confirmed a labrum tear in his left shoulder. A labral tear of the shoulder usually takes at least three months to heal. It is understood that the BCCI medical team has advised surgery for Shreyas. In that case, he is likely to miss the entire IPL which begins on April 9. It will be interesting to see if his franchise — Delhi Capitals — adheres to the rehab protocols or tries to convince him to delay the surgery in order to be available at least for the latter half. Shreyas suffered the injury during the first ODI on Tuesday when he dived full length to his left to stop a full-blooded Jonny Bairstow drive. Having landed awkwardly on his shoulder, he was writhing in pain. Rohit Sharma, who was hit on the elbow while batting, is understood to be ready to take the field for the second ODI on Friday. England skipper Eoin Morgan and Sam Billings are doubtful after sustaining injuries in the opener. Morgan split the webbing between his right thumb and index finger while Billings injured his collarbone while diving to stop a boundary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/shreyas-out-of-odis/article34156287.ece
25 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Bhavani set to resume training at Livorno||India’s star fencer Bhavani Devi is all set to resume training at Livorno (Italy) with coach Nicola Zanotti for the Tokyo Olympics. “I will be leaving for Italy on Saturday. I came to Chennai to be with my mother, who is recovering from COVID-19. I will be training at Livorno till the Olympics,” Bhavani told The Hindu here on Wednesday.  She said the focus will be more on camps with the Italian National team at Livorno as there are no major competitions, barring the Asian championships in South Korea in June. The 27-year-old Chennai-based sabre fencer said there will not be any major changes in her technique given the short time for the Games. “There will be repetition on some technical stuff and analysis of opponents [at Tokyo]. “The focus will also be on correcting weaknesses and working on fitness,” said the nine-time National champion. Bhavani added she was not thinking too much about Tokyo. “In the last four-and-a-half years, there was a lot of stress to qualify. “All I want to do is to give my best in the Olympics. As far as I know, each opponent will be tough in the Olympics.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bhavani-set-to-resume-training-at-livorno/article34156403.ece
25 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Chennai City takes on NEROCA||It has been a disappointing season for former champion Chennai City FC in the I-League. Hoping to finish inside the top-five at the beginning, Chennai City is in the eighth spot, but managed to avoid relegation. In the five-team Group B, Chennai City has one win and two losses, and on Thursday, it takes on the relegated NEROCA in Kolkata. Speaking ahead of the match, Chennai City head coach Satyasagara said his team is keen to win. “For me every match is important. We always go for the three points. We will be giving a tough fight,” he said.  Satysagara chose to see the positives, highlighting that players from Tamil Nadu did show their potential. “Some of the local talents were very good. Players like Vineeth Kumar, Syed Suhail Pasha and Pradison Mariyadasan grabbed their chances well.” Asked if he was keen to continue as the coach, Satyasagara said it was not the ideal time to talk. “I will have to discuss with the management.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chennai-city-takes-on-neroca/article34156404.ece

Things went from bad to awful for the four-time F1 champion in 2020. He had just one podium finish and ended 10 of 17 races outside the top 10 last season amid a tense atmosphere worsened by the fact Ferrari did not offer him a new contract. “The whole year was a challenge. I'm obviously not happy with how last year went in terms of performance, in terms of my performance,” he said. “There are things that didn't go well and things I would have liked to go differently. It's not a secret that at stages I wasn't at my happiest."

25 March 2021||Dubai,||India seeks to play fearless football||Captain Sunil Chhetri — recovering from COVID-19 — will not be there to inspire but a young Indian team will seek to play fearless football against a more fancied Oman in its first international match in more than a year here on Thursday. Head coach Igor Stimac said he has told the players to play free and fearless football as he was not expecting much from these two matches. Talking about Oman, Stimac said, “I have seen their match against Jordan. They are a really physical side, well organised and really patient. We also have worked hard and we expect a good game tomorrow.” Fortunately for Stimac, the 27-member squad is a mixture of players who have been with the team earlier and new faces like Akash Mishra, Liston Colaco, Ishan Pandita, Bipin Singh and Lalengmawia. Top performers The likes of Amrinder Singh, Chinglensana Singh, Rowllin Borges and Lallianzuala Chhangte have been the top Indian performers for their ISL teams and they will be propped up by experienced campaigners like Gurpreet, Sandesh Jhingan and Anirudh Thapa.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Greatness of Yamuna||River Yamuna has a greatness which is unmatched, elaborated M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. When infant Krishna was taken by Vasudeva to Nandagopa’s house, the river parted to allow him to pass. Baby Krishna’s feet touched the waters of the Yamuna. And when Krishna was growing up as Yasoda’s son, He bathed in the river, and played on the banks. Which other river has had such good fortune? While Sarayu flows on the banks of Ayodhya, Rama’s city, He did not have the connection with Sarayu, which Krishna had with the Yamuna. It was only when the avatara ends that Rama steps into the Sarayu. Whereas, Yamuna’s association with Krishna begins minutes after His birth. Coming to Godavari, a river in the South of India, this river did something unforgivable. When Ravana was carrying Sita away, She cried out to Godavari, asking the river to tell Rama that it was Ravana who was abducting Her. But when Rama was looking for Sita and asked the river if she knew where Sita was, the river was silent. Godavari was afraid that Ravana would harm her if she told Rama the truth. Hence the silence. But should the river not have spoken the truth, and helped Rama? The river remaining mum was a blot on its reputation. Vedanta Desika, in his Goda stuti, says that Godavari’s reputation was redeemed, when Andal was born, for She was also known as Goda. Andal assuming even half of Godavari’s name, was enough to restore the river’s good name! Ravana was far away in Lanka, and yet Godavari was afraid of him. Whereas, the Yamuna flowed adjacent to Kamsa’s palace and yet this river did not fear the consequences of helping Krishna reach safety. That is why Andal praised Yamuna’s blemishless quality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/greatness-of-yamuna/article34156269.ece

The all powerful board meet is scheduled for March 30, the day under fire Chief Executive Manu Sawhney’s future will also come up for discussion. Sawhney is currently on leave after an internal investigation allegedly found him to be “abrasive” in his behaviour towards the employees of the organisation. While Sawhney has a few sympathisers within the board, majority of the influential cricket boards want his ouster. While Kohli, after a few debatable umpires’ calls, has said that the rule is “confusing” and LBWs should be decided solely on whether the ball is hitting the stumps, even if marginally. However the ICC has always maintained that ball hitting the stumps isn’t as linear as it seems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/umpires-call-and-sawhneys-future-in-icc-agenda/article34156330.ece

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Flight club||An Asian koel is ready for his afternoon snack. He flutters in, perches on his favourite branch and bites into a banana. As he enjoys the fruit, a coppersmith barbet glides in. They exchange hostile glances. This could be war. Thankfully, the coppersmith barbet decides to retreat and flies away. The fight will continue another day. Every afternoon at Zhayynn James’ personal photography hide, located inside his farmland at Tirukazhukundram, 70 kilometres from the city, is an episode from a Nature channel. When this landscape architect and passionate wildlife photographer slides open the small windows in his hide, the chirps and whistles — seldom heard in the city — give him a warm welcome. Nature’s choice Zhayynn’s intention behind creating the photography hide was simple: to provide an environment that allows photographers to get close to wildlife and observe animal/bird behaviour at close quarters without adversely impacting them. Combining his designing skills — Zhayynn is a professional landscape architect — with his knowledge of light and lenses, the 45-year-old conceptualised this hide that has, over the last three years, witnessed 44 avian species, 11 non-avian species including reptiles, mammals and amphibians. “A few friends of mine were discussing what to do with some space they had, and I suggested a hide. But they thought it was an outlandish idea, and so, I figured I should create one myself, as proof of the concept,” says Zhayynn. What followed was a process of experimentation in his 10-acre farm. He found a patch that had the least amount of human interference and zeroed in on an area in which light was ideal for photography. He decided to make it an evening hide for convenience sake; to help him drive down from his Chennai residence, in order to catch the action. With an investment of about Rs. 1.5 lakh, Zhayynn and his team went about creating a small pond, planting a few trees and creating an environment that they hoped the birds would like. “Some birds do not like moving branches. Some like the bounce on the branches. The idea was to put different tensile quality purchase to suit the variety of birds that come in,” he recalls. A few metres away, they created a small, well-ventilated space for the photographer to sit comfortably. “The first birds that came were babblers. Though they are common on the farm, the fact that they chose to come here, drink and bathe was wonderful. It is a man-made structure, but for Nature to choose it was so heartwarming,” says Zhayynn. He has been making a weekly visit to the hide to document animal behaviour; and has witnessed many birds including scaly-breasted munias, white-throated kingfishers and Brahminy starlings. That’s not all; his hide has also turned into a hangout for other animals like rat snakes, calotes and mongoose. “And then one day, when my wife and I were sitting around 7.30 pm, a cobra decided to take a swim in the pond. It was an experience we will never forget.” Feathered friends Since 2017, Zhayynn had been making weekend visits to the hide. These increased during the lockdown last year. “It’s almost home,” says the photographer, who is usually armed with his trusted Nikon D5, bananas and grains for his feathered friends. “As a means of documenting bird behaviour, hides are a fantastic tool...but they are also great from a conservation point of view.” Over the last six months or so, Zhayynn has been actively branching out to conceptualise hides for clients. Today, he has three projects, for clients in Bangalore and Coimbatore. “One of them even has a pantry and a built-in toilet. Hides can be customised based on budget and space, but the idea is to get a sense of animal behavour at close quarters. The kind of drama that plays around a hide is fascinating.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/flight-club/article34156116.ece

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||In a world without fragrance||For 10 days, all I could taste were oranges. Those citrusy bites were my only gustatory awakenings in the sleepy blandness that COVID-19 brought into my life. But, I could not smell them. Close your eyes and picture your favourite food. It is likely that the first thing you thought of was how it smells. The parts of your brain that process your emotions and memories use olfactory data, linking them closely. Our sense of smell richens our sense of taste. So when you wake up one morning and lose both, the world around you shifts slightly. You don’t realise it but you miss the stimuli that were anchoring you: the smell of your skin, your bedsheets, wet soil in the garden, the shampoo in your hair, breakfast cooking in the kitchen. It happened to me in February, after I caught COVID-19. But to Chindi Varadarajulu, it happened 30 years ago — a severe flu during her second winter in Vancouver, Canada, left the would-be chef’s nose incapable of sniffing out flavours. “I am still upset that I have never smelt real lilacs,” says Chindi. After appointments with specialists in Singapore and Canada, she had a name for the condition: anosmia. In the past year, anosmia has become a significant marker of Covid. Or in my case — parosmia, where instead of an olfactory vacuum, familiar smells seem distorted. For a few days, I wondered if anyone had spilled anything rancid in the vicinity. Did our dog kill a rat we did not know about? Because it seemed as though a stench would follow me around, stuck inside my nose. Around the world, as there is greater research on ‘long covid’, there may be relief for people whose symptoms have still not abated, even after testing negative. Thirty years on, Chindi’s sense of smell still has not returned. Still, it did not pull her back from a career in the culinary arts. Could her journey provide some answers for those who still show symptoms of anosmia? “For a year after I stopped being able to smell, I tried nasal sprays of all sorts. Sometimes I would convince myself that I smelled something familiar — but it was just like a phantom itch,” says Chindi. At her first restaurant in Vancouver, set up in 2003, she remembers accidentally burning a batch ofdal, failing to notice and put it out until someone drew her attention to it. Today, she creates new recipes out of memories of old flavours, and has her team at Pumpkin Tales in Chennai test it out. She can do this because all these years, she has been making up for her lack of smell through an accentuated sense of taste. “I may not be able to identify flavour profiles [a combination of taste and smell] but my taste is enhanced in many ways. For instance, tamarind, tomato, lemon — these are all sour tastes, but to different degrees: some sharp, some more rounded, some leave a bitter aftertaste, some sweet. I can appreciate all of that because of my years of training in it,” says Chindi. The passion with which she speaks of taste reminds me of the two weeks I spent bereft of it. At lunchtime, I could see how visually appealing the meal was: a dollop of ghee melting over the tomatodal, seasoned with herbs and greens. But inside my mouth, it was a hot lump of nothingness. Fluffy rotis were like wet paper; evening snacks nothing better than an exercise in chewing. So of course, after getting my taste back, the first swirl of peanut butter chocolate ice cream made me feel complete in a way nothing else has. Chindi encourages me to pay more attention to the food I eat, and I readily agree. “Take in the texture. Look at what you are eating and associate it with what you’re feeling in your mouth, focus on the balance of tastes,” she recommends. Train yourself Pay attention because if it slips away, you might not notice all at once. For, while there are eye charts and hearing tests, there are not many quantitative ways we can measure our power of smell and taste. Which is why, many people who have been infected with Covid once find it difficult to say for sure whether their senses have returned completely. Smell kits help. Comprising essential flavour profiles, they help associate odours with the correct source, almost willing your brain into recognising and remembering them. Back in February, I would do an informal training every day, as I picked up an apple or my favourite bar of soap, sniffing it, trying to remember what it smelt like. After I was reacquainted with a familiar smell — a cloud of freshly sprayed disinfectant, I rushed to the kitchen, sniffing spice after spice like some strange dog-woman. Most I could recognise again, but some are ‘muffled’ till date. “You should come over to the restaurant once,” offers Chindi, “We can do a smell-test and see how many you get right.” I look forward to it.  Smell kits help.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||An unlikely mix||The stage has been unlit and silent for a year now. But as theatres gradually usher in limited, socially-distanced crowds, artistes and audiences are reuniting with excitement, anticipation and almost a first-time-on-stage like nervousness. This World Theatre Day, which falls on March 27, will see a similar, rather emotional union of performers and the stage through a two-day theatre showcase of both Tamil and English plays, put together by city-based theatre outfits, Masquerade and Chennai Art Theatre. Titled Theatre Unlocked, the series of plays will be performed over Friday and Saturday in Alliance Francaise of Madras, Nungambakkam. Every year since 1997, Masquerade has been celebrating World Theatre Day with at least one production. Till 2020. “Everyone had to be ‘locked-down’ from doing theatre and arts. There were groups who could do with a little bit of ‘coming together’ to get started on things,” says Krishna Kumar S, artistic director of Masquerade. Soon enough, A Charles from Chennai Art Theatre also jumped onboard. Though the initial line-up had three groups, it gradually branched out into six. Myriad characters will take centre stage over the course of two days, staging three Tamil and as many English plays. From Greek mythology’s Hera and The Mahabharata’s Ashwatthama to run-of-the-mill couples chatting over coffee, the line-up is a mix of both verbose and physical performances. Narjaya will presentPasi, a Tamil absurdist fiction written by Padmashri-awardee and playwright Indira Parthasarathy. Among the roster of English plays are Stage Fright’sCoffee, which revolves around three conversations over coffee and Masquerade’s G.O.M.D , a marriage of two narratives that touch upon affairs and legacies. Of G.O.M.D , Krishna Kumar adds, “One is a sort of monologue that breaks into an interaction with the audience, by Hera, sister and consort of Zeus. She gives the real dirt on Zeus — almost a stand-up [comedy] piece, but filled with poignant moments. The other monologue is a piece that I acquired in the ‘90s.” The duration of each performance will hover around 60 minutes. The diversity in genres is aimed at exposing different audiences to unfamiliar styles. “The audience also gets to mingle,” says Krishna Kumar. “It’s literally bringing everyone back to their feet and saying that live theatre has started!”  Tickets can be purchased on www.bookmy   show.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-unlikely-mix/article34156119.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Remember when we made Dalgona?||This time last year we were dreaming of butter in ransacked grocery aisles. Panic buying tinned food, stockpiling flour and hunting down biscuits in a desperate attempt to hold on to familiar comforts. Telling ourselves we just need to get through the next few weeks till things settle. Little did we know... Remember your last unmasked restaurant dinner? That final heady cocktail in our pre-pandemic, hedonistic sanitiser-free lives? The last packed nightclub, alive with strobe lights and sweaty with dancers, none of whom had ever quarantined. A time before QR-code menus, temperature checks and vaccination selfies. It has been a year since India’s first lockdown, and the pandemic has changed the way we live, and hence naturally, the way we eat. First, we washed dishes March 2020 was a haze of grocery runs, YouTube cooking classes and scrubbing kadais between Zoom meetings. Perhaps TikTok food trends best explain how the year influenced our cooking. First came sourdough, demanding skill, patience and basic ingredients — ideal for a time when ambulance sirens shrieked outside our windows and we craved a challenging distraction from ominous daily COVID-19 graphs. Then came Dalgona coffee, channelling our excess energy into whipping sugar, milk and instant coffee into a fragrant froth. Now, as life begins to resume familiar patterns, a quick, elegant nature cereal is trending: pomegranate seeds, berries and ice cubes in a bowl with coconut water. What they all have in common is a focus on quality ingredients. Through the first few months of lockdown, when fresh vegetables were in short supply, people began to explore ways to be more self sufficient, foraging through their backyards and starting kitchen gardens. Paranoia around infected surfaces forced us to scrub our bags of rice, potatoes and apples with equal vigour, as well as cook instead of ordering in. Classes from mothers, grandmothers and chefs on Instagram demonstrated basic techniques and demystified regional ingredients, even as Facebook and WhatsApp groups buzzed with generously shared family recipes and cooking hacks. One year later, we are all more comfortable in the kitchen. It helps that lockdown triggered a wave of food start-ups supplying high quality sauces, pickles and masala for home cooks making it easier to put together both family meals and dinner parties. It also led to a dramatic rise in dishwasher sales. Now, the joy of masked dining Covid baby restaurants surprised everyone, including their promoters. Launching a restaurant is always risky. In a world bristling with fear, you would think it would be riskier. However, after many months of home cooking and solitary dining, customers are embracing new openings with excitement. So these spaces, opened soon after lockdown, bustle with a cheery camaraderie bolstered by a year of confinement. Eager to venture out again, buoyed by savings accrued from a year at home, people are congregating at restaurants to work, reunite with friends or just linger over coffee. The romance with home chefs was short. Of course, there was a rise in talented, motivated ones, who steadily cooked their way through the pandemic, drawing a loyal audience. But, in the surge of 2020, many put profits over passion, cutting costs on ingredients and raising prices arbitrarily. Quality is often inconsistent and packaging haphazard, although they do seem to strive tirelessly when it comes to updating Instagram. We also saw a surge in dark kitchens, as customers embraced takeaway, all of varying quality. Given the current levels of competition, many of last year’s food start-ups will not survive through 2021. The survival of the fittest will come into play, so the ones that do stay open will be a dependable, valuable addition to the city’s foodscape. The pandemic has devastated the hospitality industry, with restaurant closures and job cuts. However, the last few months have seen an encouraging number of restaurant openings, capitalising on low rents, lower overheads and a large pool of talented manpower available because of last year’s closures. In response to the lockdowns, they are designed to be bright, filled with sunshine and colour. Menus focus on comfort over style, and local ingredients over imported exotica. Service is less formal, prioritising warmth over ritual. And customers, largely, are less demanding, grateful to be out again. After a year of uncertainty, restaurants remind us about the joy of social interaction, even if it does come with masks, temperature guns and sanitiser.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/remember-when-we-made-dalgona/article34156127.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||A fight for forests||Working with elephants — according to filmmaker Prabhu Solomon — is like “managing babies”. He should know: Kaadan , scheduled for release tomorrow, is the director’s first movie in nearly five years (since Thodari ), and it features elephants alongside Rana Daggubati, Shriya Pilgaonkar, Vishnu Vishal and Anant Mahadevan. This is Prabhu’s third film featuring elephants — after Kumki (2012) and its upcoming sequel. “I used more than 18 elephants in Thailand [to film Kaadan ],” says Prabhu, over phone. “Each one had a different attitude, just like humans. If even one had a bad day or gets aggressive, all the elephants would start to trumpet,” he adds. That was not the only unusual challenge. Since most of Kaadan was to be filmed in the backdrop of a forest, changing seasons meant the filmmaker had to wait for withered leaves to regenerate before resuming work. Thus Kaadan , Prabhu adds, “is a work of patience” and is a journey that took him three years. “It got to a point that I thought I shouldn’t make another film with elephants,” he quips. Edited excerpts: Why is Kaadan ’s story significant for the audience? Hopefully now, after the pandemic, everybody should realise that if we disturb Nature’s cycle it will impact us. And this applies to every other aspect, not just a virus; forests are the lungs of the world, so if we disturb jungles, then we will suffer. This must be told [on film]. A hero fights for a village, his love and even the society. But who fights for the forests?  The story has similarities with what has happened in Coimbatore’s forest...  [Encroachment] happens everywhere and not just in Coimbatore. Kaadan , specifically, is the story that happened in Kaziranga, Assam (Kaziranga elephant corridor case). That is where my inspiration is from, but there are many places in India where people are building resorts by encroaching forests. How did you zero in on Rana Daggubati for the role of Bandev?  Bandev is like a grown-up Mowgli, someone who is over six feet tall and when you see him, the person should convince you that he is a man who lives in a forest. He should appear aggressive, bold and someone who takes on the fight single-handedly.In terms of character design, Rana was a perfect fit. But you have not had much success making films with established names...  The thing about working with stars is that they have their own images and a brand exists. So if we don’t create something for the brand, then it is criticised. If we go overboard with the brand, then the reality is lost. That confusion is always there. This is why I find it easy working with new faces. I am able to bring out the character I envisioned the way I want to. With Rana, however, I was very clear in my first meeting with him that this role will not reflect stardom at any point. He too surrendered himself to the role. What do you have lined up next?  I made Kaadan for three years but since it is a trilingual, it feels like I’m releasing three films at the same time! But up next, I really want to make a film that doesn’t need green screen and VFX.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-fight-for-forests/article34156110.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||When Chai Met Toast, on road again||After five sold out shows, When Chai Met Toast heads to Chennai for the last leg of its tour. The Kochi band is one of the first in India to complete a multi-city tour after the pandemic, instilling much-needed hope into the indie music scene: could it be that live gigs are back for good? It has been an interesting cocktail of caution and exhilaration for frontman Ashwin Gopakumar as he and his band hop from city to city: Candolim, Delhi, Guwahati, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai. Multivitamins have replaced afterparties, but nothing can dampen the joy of being back on stage. “It’s like being home again,” says Ashwin. “For a five-year-old band like ours to have so many sold out shows is very promising. In Guwahati, there were some people who travelled 12 hours from Manipur and Mizoram to watch us play, that was overwhelming.” He chalks the buzz down to the fact that for many of its audience, it was their first night out, listening to a live act. “People were singing along. It would get so loud that sometimes I could barely hear myself,” says Ashwin. The band — vocalist Ashwin, Achyuth Jaigopal on guitar, Palee Francis on keyboard and Pai Sailesh on drums — was ecstatic to be playing on stage again, and that energy rubbed off on the audience, he believes. The live act is where it is at, for Ashwin. “We have always been a touring band. We aren’t one of those content creators who will just make something and put it up online. We love to make people dance,” he adds. However, the one-year break helped them experiment with their creative side: the band released When We Feel Young , its début album last year, and went on to produce ‘Nature Tapes’ versions of their songs: stripped down, calm, acoustic, surrounded by greenery. This creativity has fuelled the current tour with a fresh set list and a fresher vibe — the band has added instruments such as the charango, ukelele, and electric guitar. It has also helped them understand their demographics better: “’Kahaani’ was a big hit in Delhi, ‘Ocean Tide’ in Guwahati and ‘Break Free’ in Kolkata, whereas ‘Khoj’, ‘When We Feel Young’, and ‘Firefly’ were popular everywhere,” he notes. Lugging all of the instruments around — down to Ashwin’s personal microphone, for hygiene — was one of the challenges in the post-Covid world. “There are so many different rules in the airline industry, it’s confusing,” he says. But their touring experience is laying down the groundwork for other artistes and bands who have got in touch with them to understand what performing in the new normal is like. “The other day, Swarathma texted us saying ‘it’s great to see you touring, it gives us hope that live music is coming back’, and that feels good!” he says.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Combat mode||May 2021 will mark 35 years since Nagarjuna Akkineni debuted as hero in the Telugu film Vikram (1986). Mention this to the actor and he laughs aloud, “I didn’t realise this until someone mentioned it to me recently; it doesn’t feel like 35 years at all.” What keeps him going? “I cannot sit at home; I love to work,” he says. At 61, with fitness levels that can challenge his younger colleagues, Nagarjuna is among the busiest actors in Telugu cinema. His new film Wild Dog , inspired by an undercover operation of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) following the serial blasts that shook Hyderabad in 2007, will release in theatres on April 2. He recently signed a Telugu film to be directed by Praveen Sattaru, is a part of director Ayan Mukherji’s Hindi film Brahmastra co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, and is also in talks for a web series. Written and directed by Ahishor Solomon, Wild Dog was in the making long before the team announced the film with its first poster in December 2020. It stars Nagarjuna as NIA officer Vijay Varma and Saiyami Kher as a RAW (Research & Analysis Wing) agent. “We completed filming the investigation portions in Hyderabad’s Old City, Mumbai and Pune prior to the lockdown. In November, we filmed in Manali and Nepal,” says the actor. After the blasts Nagarjuna vividly recalls the shock when the blasts at Lumbini Park, Gokul Chaat and near Konark Theatre brought Hyderabad to its knees: “I used to frequent Gokul Chaat in the early 2000s, for late-night paani puri . My car would be parked nearby and I would walk in front of the chaat centre. Two days after the blasts, I visited the place and was devastated by what I saw.” A story inspired by the aftermath of these incidents, says the actor, prompted him to consider the script. Ahishor Solomon, who directed the Hindi thriller John Day (2013), first met Nagarjuna to narrate the story of Oopiri ( Thozha in Tamil, co-starring Karthi): “He was a writer associated with [director] Vamshi Paidipally and I liked how he narrated Oopiri . When he came to me with a well-researched story for Wild Dog , I was confident that he would direct it well.”  Wild Dog is in a genre similar to the Hindi film Uri: The Surgical Strike (2019), which Nagarjuna says is among his favourite films in recent years. “It’s hard to tell what is fiction and what is real; I liked how they wove in the family drama.” How much of Wild Dog is fictional? “It’s hard to say. One of my dialogues is about how these officers are unsung heroes. If they fail on duty, they might languish in a foreign prison or be executed. If they return successfully, their identities are still kept a secret so they can go on their next mission.” Postures for combat Nagarjuna was trained by action choreographer David Ismalone, who has worked on international projects such as Fast and Furious 7 and Ong-Bak: Muan Thai Warrior , and Major Ajay, who was part of the surgical strike operations. The training included combat postures, communicating with signs while on an operation, and how to hold the gun. Though he has acted as a cop in several films, Nagarjuna says Wild Dog was an eye-opener: “I realised I had been holding the gun wrong all along,” he laughs, “These weapons are sophisticated and the slightest pressure is enough to trigger them. David told me that the gun should look like an extension of my arm.” Post lockdown filming in Nepal and the Rohtang Pass in Manali in winter, was a liberating as well as an eerie experience. “Liberating because there were no tourists and we could be in a bubble during the pandemic; eerie because it felt like we were in ghost towns, similar to what we see in Hollywood disaster films,” he recalls.  Going digital  Wild Dog was to release directly on Netflix, but the deal was re-negotiated once theatres reopened and Telugu films began faring well at the box office. “It works in favour of Netflix as well, since a film that releases first in theatres generates a buzz.” Nagarjuna believes OTT is the future of entertainment and says, “A project has to be a spectacle film or solidly engaging to draw people to the theatres.” He is in talks for a web series and likes the idea of a story being narrated over several episodes: “There’s scope to experiment. Digital platforms are also a fantastic opportunity for smaller films to find an audience. We are also beginning to see a reverse phenomenon — Money Heist is now being adapted into a feature film. This is an interesting phase.”  Lockdown diaries Looking back at 2020, Nagajuna says there were lessons to be learnt and room for introspection during lockdown. “In 35 years, I’ve never had so much free time. It was good to bond with my family; everyone is so busy that I hardly get to see them in normal circumstances. While being homebound, I also realised how much I love my work. I think the tiny virus gave the world a checkmate, telling us that we are all dispensable. It was as though the virus told me, ‘I can stop the world, you are no big deal’.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/combat-mode/article34156137.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Flight club||An Asian koel is ready for his afternoon snack. He flutters in, perches on his favourite branch and bites into a banana. As he enjoys the fruit, a coppersmith barbet glides in. They exchange hostile glances. This could be war. Thankfully, the coppersmith barbet decides to retreat and flies away. The fight will continue another day. Every afternoon at Zhayynn James’ personal photography hide, located inside his farmland at Tirukazhukundram, 70 kilometres from Chennai, is an episode from a Nature channel. When this landscape architect and passionate wildlife photographer slides open the small windows in his hide, the chirps and whistles — seldom heard in the city — give him a warm welcome. Nature’s choice Zhayynn’s intention behind creating the photography hide was simple: to provide an environment that allows photographers to get close to wildlife and observe animal/bird behaviour at close quarters without adversely impacting them. Combining his designing skills — Zhayynn is a professional landscape architect — with his knowledge of light and lenses, the 45-year-old conceptualised this hide that has, over the last three years, witnessed 44 avian species, 11 non-avian species including reptiles, mammals and amphibians. “A few friends of mine were discussing what to do with some space they had, and I suggested a hide. But they thought it was an outlandish idea, and so, I figured I should create one myself, as proof of the concept,” says Zhayynn. What followed was a process of experimentation in his 10-acre farm. He found a patch that had the least amount of human interference and zeroed in on an area in which light was ideal for photography. He decided to make it an evening hide for convenience sake; to help him drive down from his Chennai residence, in order to catch the action. With an investment of about Rs. 1.5 lakh, Zhayynn and his team went about creating a small pond, planting a few trees and creating an environment that they hoped the birds would like. “Some birds do not like moving branches. Some like the bounce on the branches. The idea was to put different tensile quality purchase to suit the variety of birds that come in,” he recalls. A few metres away, they created a small, well-ventilated space for the photographer to sit comfortably. “The first birds that came were babblers. Though they are common on the farm, the fact that they chose to come here, drink and bathe was wonderful. It is a man-made structure, but for Nature to choose it was so heartwarming,” says Zhayynn. He has been making a weekly visit to the hide to document animal behaviour, and has witnessed many birds including the scaly-breasted munias, white-throated kingfishers and Brahminy starlings. That’s not all; his hide has also turned into a hangout for other animals like rat snakes, calotes and mongoose. “And then one day, when my wife and I were sitting around 7.30 pm, a cobra decided to take a swim in the pond. It was an experience we will never forget.” Feathered friends Since 2017, Zhayynn had been making weekend visits to the hide. These increased during the lockdown last year. “It’s almost home,” says the photographer, who is usually armed with his trusted Nikon D5, bananas and grains for his feathered friends. “As a means of documenting bird behaviour, hides are a fantastic tool...but they are also great from a conservation point of view.” Over the last six months or so, Zhayynn has been actively branching out to conceptualise hides for clients. Today, he has three projects, for clients in Bangalore and Coimbatore. “One of them even has a pantry and a built-in toilet. Hides can be customised based on budget and space, but the idea is to get a sense of animal behavour at close quarters. The kind of drama that plays around a hide is fascinating.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/flight-club/article34156863.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||In a world without fragrance||For 10 days, all I could taste were oranges. Those citrusy bites were my only gustatory awakenings in the sleepy blandness that COVID-19 brought into my life. But, I could not smell them. Close your eyes and picture your favourite food. It is likely that the first thing you thought of was how it smells. The parts of your brain that process your emotions and memories use olfactory data, linking them closely. Our sense of smell richens our sense of taste. So when you wake up one morning and lose both, the world around you shifts slightly. You don’t realise it but you miss the stimuli that were anchoring you: the smell of your skin, your bedsheets, wet soil in the garden, the shampoo in your hair, breakfast cooking in the kitchen.  From memory  It happened to me in February, after I caught COVID-19. But to Chindi Varadarajulu, it happened 30 years ago — a severe flu during her second winter in Vancouver, Canada, left the would-be chef’s nose incapable of sniffing out flavours. “I am still upset that I have never smelt real lilacs,” says Chindi. After appointments with specialists in Singapore and Canada, she had a name for the condition: anosmia. In the past year, anosmia has become a significant marker of COVID. Or in my case — parosmia, where instead of an olfactory vacuum, familiar smells seem distorted. For a few days, I wondered if anyone had spilled anything rancid. Did our dog kill a rat we did not know about? Because it seemed as though a stench would follow me around, stuck inside my nose. Around the world, as there is greater research on ‘long COVID’, there may be relief for people whose symptoms have still not abated, even after testing negative. Thirty years on, Chindi’s sense of smell still has not returned. Still, it did not pull her back from a career in the culinary arts. Could her journey provide some answers for those who still show symptoms of anosmia? “For a year after I stopped being able to smell, I tried nasal sprays of all sorts. Sometimes I would convince myself that I smelled something familiar — but it was just like a phantom itch,” says Chindi. At her first restaurant in Vancouver, set up in 2003, she remembers accidentally burning a batch ofdal, failing to notice and put it out until someone drew her attention to it. Today, she creates new recipes out of memories of old flavours, and has her team at Pumpkin Tales in Chennai test it out. She can do this because all these years, she has been making up for her lack of smell through an accentuated sense of taste. “I may not be able to identify flavour profiles [a combination of taste and smell] but my taste is enhanced in many ways. For instance, tamarind, tomato, lemon — these are all sour tastes, but to different degrees: some sharp, some more rounded, some with a bitter aftertaste, some sweet. I can appreciate all of that because of my years of training,” says Chindi. The passion with which she speaks of taste reminds me of the two weeks I spent bereft of it. At lunchtime, I could see how visually appealing the meal was: a dollop of ghee melting over the tomatodal, seasoned with herbs and greens. But inside my mouth, it was a hot lump of nothingness. Fluffy rotis were like wet paper; evening snacks nothing better than an exercise in chewing. So of course, after getting my taste back, the first swirl of peanut butter chocolate ice cream made me feel complete in a way nothing else has. Chindi encourages me to pay more attention to the food I eat, and I readily agree. “Take in the texture. Look at what you are eating and associate it with what you’re feeling in your mouth, focus on the balance of tastes,” she recommends. Train yourself Pay attention because if it slips away, you might not notice all at once. For, while there are eye charts and hearing tests, there are not many quantitative ways we can measure our power of smell and taste. Which is why, many people who have been infected with COVID once find it difficult to say for sure whether their senses have returned completely. Smell kits help. Comprising essential flavour profiles, they help associate odours with the correct source, almost willing your brain into recognising and remembering them. Back in February, I would do an informal training every day, as I picked up an apple or my favourite bar of soap, sniffing it, trying to remember what it smelt like. After I was reacquainted with a familiar smell — a cloud of freshly sprayed disinfectant, I rushed to the kitchen, sniffing spice after spice. Most I could recognise again, but some are ‘muffled’ till date. “You should come over to the restaurant once,” offers Chindi, “We can do a smell-test and see how many you get right.” I look forward to it.

25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Just for thrills||Director Sajit Warrier’s web series Chakravyuh — An Inspector Virkar Crime Thriller that has been streaming on MX Player from March 12, pitches the old world against the new digital age. Shot in posh South Mumbai, including trippy underground clubs, the series resonates with the youth, capturing their joys and inner struggles. Based on Piyush Jha’s novel, Anti-Social Network , the cyber crime series is packed with twists and turns, says the director. Prateik Babbar essays the lead role. Excerpts from an interview: Was Prateik Babbar the first choice as lead in Chakravyuh?  Prateik Babbar was always our first choice. He has an intensity in his eyes, which was perfect for this part.... This is rarely tapped and it was such a pleasure to work with him. From physically transforming himself for this role to creating a character with a lot of pent up fury, this was very challenging and he just rocked it totally.  What was your experience shooting for the series ?  The most wonderful aspect was that everyone really connected with the story. Applause Entertainment believed in this story and we had a wonderful cast and crew. Your previous projects, Fired and Trial of Satyam Kaushik, were also thrillers. What attracts you to thrillers?  I remember the first movie I saw as a child was this wonderful mystery thriller Picnic At The Hanging Rock by Peter Weir. I think it affected me so much that I am totally drawn to mystery and thrills. Horror and comedy are the other two genres which I get immense satisfaction from.   As founder of Warrier Films, what has your journey been?   I started as a fine arts student in Vadodara and then moved to screenwriting and directing at UCLA, Los Angeles, where I worked with some really talented filmmakers in Hollywood. When I arrived in Mumbai, I set up Warrier Films and we just enjoyed doing branding and animations for MTV VH1 and other channels. Storytelling and experimenting in the visual medium began with short films and video art. There’s so much opportunity in the visual medium that it’s a great time to try out different genres and have a unique stylistic approach. What role do you identify with most: director, writer, editor? For me, filmmaking is the ultimate visual art. As a director, I bring in a vision which I feel is unique and that’s what I identify with most. I think as a director, my strength is to keep an audience engrossed in the storyviewing process. The social experience of keeping an audience engaged in a dark theatre is what makes me want to enhance my directing approach. With the entry of OTT platforms, has the canvas widened for young filmmakers?  It is with the advent of OTT platforms that I am able to tell my stories. I have been in innumerable meetings where people have told me “The story is a little too out there”. Well this medium is all about being out there and telling stories and characters, which have a unique perspective. We can attempt stories in budgets that would not have worked before. There’s no fatigue for watching content now, which should help us try unique stories. So these are exciting times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/just-for-thrills/article34156865.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Remember when we made Dalgona?||This time last year we were dreaming of butter in ransacked grocery aisles. Panic buying tinned food, stockpiling flour and hunting down biscuits in a desperate attempt to hold on to familiar comforts. Telling ourselves we just need to get through the next few weeks till things settle. Remember your last unmasked restaurant dinner? That final heady cocktail in our pre-pandemic, hedonistic sanitiser-free lives? The last packed nightclub, alive with strobe lights and sweaty with dancers, none of whom had ever quarantined. A time before QR-code menus, temperature checks and vaccination selfies. It has been a year since India’s first lockdown, and the pandemic has changed the way we live, and hence naturally, the way we eat. First, we washed dishes March 2020 was a haze of grocery runs, YouTube cooking classes and scrubbing kadais between Zoom meetings. Perhaps TikTok food trends best explain how the year influenced our cooking. First came sourdough, demanding skill, patience and basic ingredients — ideal for a time when ambulance sirens shrieked outside our windows and we craved a challenging distraction from ominous daily COVID-19 graphs. Then came Dalgona coffee, channelling our excess energy into whipping sugar, milk and instant coffee into a fragrant froth. Now, as life begins to resume familiar patterns, a quick, elegant nature cereal is trending: pomegranate seeds, berries and ice cubes in a bowl with coconut water. What they all have in common is a focus on quality ingredients. Through the first few months of lockdown, when fresh vegetables were in short supply, people began to explore ways to be more self sufficient, foraging through their backyards and starting kitchen gardens. Paranoia around infected surfaces forced us to scrub our bags of rice, potatoes and apples with equal vigour, as well as cook instead of ordering in. Classes from mothers, grandmothers and chefs on Instagram demonstrated basic techniques and demystified regional ingredients, even as Facebook and WhatsApp groups buzzed with generously shared family recipes and cooking hacks. One year later, we are all more comfortable in the kitchen. It helps that lockdown triggered a wave of food start-ups supplying high quality sauces, pickles and masala for home cooks making it easier to put together both family meals and dinner parties. It also led to a dramatic rise in dishwasher sales. Now, the joy of masked dining COVID baby restaurants surprised everyone, including their promoters. Launching a restaurant is always risky. In a world bristling with fear, you would think it would be riskier. However, after many months of home cooking and solitary dining, customers are embracing new openings with excitement. Eager to venture out again, buoyed by savings accrued from a year at home, people are congregating at restaurants to work, reunite with friends or just linger over coffee. The romance with home chefs was short. Of course, there was a rise in talented, motivated ones, who steadily cooked their way through the pandemic, drawing a loyal audience. But, in the surge of 2020, many put profits over passion, cutting costs on ingredients and raising prices arbitrarily. Quality is often inconsistent and packaging haphazard, although they do seem to strive tirelessly when it comes to updating Instagram. We also saw a surge in dark kitchens, as customers embraced takeaway, all of varying quality. Given the current levels of competition, many of last year’s food start-ups will not survive through 2021. The pandemic has devastated the hospitality industry, with restaurant closures and job cuts. However, the last few months have seen an encouraging number of restaurant openings, capitalising on low rents, lower overheads and a large pool of talented manpower available from last year’s closures. In response to the lockdowns, they are designed to be filled with sunshine and colour. Menus focus on comfort over style, and local ingredients over imported exotica. Service is less formal, prioritising warmth over ritual. And customers, largely, are less demanding, grateful to be out again. After a year of uncertainty, restaurants remind us about the joy of social interaction, even if it does come with masks, temperature guns and sanitiser.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/remember-when-we-made-dalgona/article34156867.ece
25 March 2021||March 25 2021 00:00 IST,||When Chai Met Toast, on the road again||After five sold out shows, When Chai Met Toast heads to Chennai for the last leg of its tour. The Kochi band is one of the first in India to complete a multi-city tour after the pandemic, instilling much-needed hope into the indie music scene: could it be that live gigs are back for good? It has been an interesting cocktail of caution and exhilaration for frontman Ashwin Gopakumar as he and his band hop from city to city: Candolim, Delhi, Guwahati, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai. Multivitamins have replaced afterparties, but nothing can dampen the joy of being back on stage. “It’s like being home again,” says Ashwin. “For a five-year-old band like ours to have so many sold out shows is very promising. In Guwahati, there were some people who travelled 12 hours from Manipur and Mizoram to watch us play, that was overwhelming.” He chalks the buzz down to the fact that for many of its audience, it was their first night out, listening to a live act. “People were singing along. It would get so loud that sometimes I could barely hear myself,” says Ashwin. The band — vocalist Ashwin, Achyuth Jaigopal on guitar, Palee Francis on keyboard and Pai Sailesh on drums — was ecstatic to be playing on stage again, and that energy rubbed off on the audience, he believes. The live act is where it is at, for Ashwin. “We have always been a touring band. We aren’t one of those content creators who will just make something and put it up online. We love to make people dance,” Ashwin adds. However, the one-year break helped them experiment with their creative side: the band released When We Feel Young , its début album last year, and went on to produce ‘Nature Tapes’ versions of their songs: stripped down, calm, acoustic, surrounded by greenery. This creativity has fuelled the current tour with a fresh set list and a fresher vibe — the band has added instruments such as the charango, ukelele, and electric guitar.

25 March 2021||New Delhi,||Cabinet clears ration scheme without name||The Delhi Cabinet on Wednesday approved the removal of name from its doorstep delivery of the ration scheme, in a meeting under the leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The original name of the scheme, Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana, which was expected to be rolled out on March 25, will not have any name due to an objection by the Centre. ‘Do not want credit’ Following a receipt of a written communication to this effect from the Centre last week, Mr. Kejriwal held a press conference on Saturday, where he said the scheme will have no name and the Delhi government did not want any credit for it as long as it could be rolled out. “No mention of Mukhya Mantri will be there. We have called a Cabinet meeting in the coming week where this idea will be passed. This will not be any new scheme and this will not have any name. After the Cabinet nod, we will send the decision to the Central government and I am very hopeful that this time they will approve our decision,” he had said. Under the new scheme, wheat flour atta, rice, and sugar will be delivered to homes of eligible beneficiaries in packed bags. Moreover, taking ration at subsidised rates from a public distribution system (PDS) shop will become optional according to the scheme. On Saturday, Mr. Kejriwal had, at a meeting with all the officials concerned, issued directions to do away with the name of the scheme. Making the scheme nameless, Mr. Kejriwal had said he was hopeful, it would remove the problems the Central government had and would allow the Delhi government to implement it. It was very important, the CM had said, to defeat the ration mafia and to ensure that every poor person gets ration at his or her doorstep.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nod-for-ration-scheme-with-name-removed/article34156525.ece
25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘JNU Registrar appointment is part of administrative overreach’||Responding to allegations by the JNU administration saying that “downright falsehood and malicious propaganda was being spread by a small section of faculty member of JNU”, the teachers’ union said that the university statement was issued in the name of the new Registrar of the university that has not been appointed by the Executive Council of the university as per the rules of the university. The JNUTA said that the appointment of the Registrar was an example of administrative overreach on the part of the “caretaker” Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar that they were highlighting. Executive Council “Statute 8[1] of university rules categorically states that the “Registrar shall be appointed by the Executive Council” and “shall be a whole-time salaried officer of the university. It may be noted that there has been no Executive Council meeting where the EC has deliberated on the matter or approval for this decision has been specifically sought,” the JNUTA said. The JNUTA continued to question the powers of the Vice-Chancellor after the expiry of his term saying no matter what he claims, he is a “caretaker” Vice-Chancellor with restricted powers serving an interim period till the new appointee takes charge. The JNU administration did not respond to the allegations by the JNUTA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jnu-registrar-appointment-is-part-of-administrative-overreach/article34156524.ece
25 March 2021||New Delhi,||3 held for trying to extort Rs. 5 lakh from businessman||Three men were arrested for allegedly trying to extort Rs. 5 lakh from a businessman in north-west Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh. The accused also threatened to shoot him if he failed to provide the amount, the police said on Wednesday. The accused Rohit (26) wanted to make a quick buck and he chose businessman Sahil Sethi, who his father knows, as his potential target. Rohit along with his two associates, Azam Khan (19) and Faraz Khan (20), hatched a conspiracy to extort money from the businessman, police said. All the three men are residents of Seelampur. Threat call According to the police, on Monday morning, Mr. Sethi, received a threat call from an unknown number after which he lodged a complaint at Shalimar Bagh police station. DCP (North West) Usha Rangnani said a case was registered under section 387 (putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation). During investigation, call details of the alleged mobile number was analysed and the accused was identified. After raids at several locations, Rohit was arrested and the mobile from which the extortion call was made was recovered from him, she said. On Tuesday, the businessman got another call around 3 p.m. from an unknown person. He threatened him to withdraw the complaint against Rohit besides demanding Rs. 5 lakh from him again, the DCP said. The location of the caller was traced and the accused duo, Azam and Faraz Khan, was nabbed and the mobile phone was recovered from them, she said. “Interrogation revealed that Rohit had relevant information about the businessman as his father has been associated with the complainant for business purposes for a long time,” Ms. Rangnani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/3-held-for-trying-to-extort-rs-5-lakh-from-businessman/article34156519.ece
25 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||DUTA marches to CM’s residence with demands||The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) on Wednesday carried out a protest march to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence demanding assurance of timely release of grants-in-aid, removal of the pattern of assistance document and revoking the Delhi government order appointing senior administrative officers in the 12 DU colleges that are fully funded by the government. DUTA president Rajib Ray said: “Employees of these 12 DU colleges have lost faith in Delhi government as it has not been releasing the grant-in-aids timely. DUTA notes with dismay that the additional grants and posts promised by Mr. Kejriwal to the principals of the 12 DU colleges in a meeting on March 16 has not yet materialised. This will again lead to financial crises in these colleges as they will not be paid salaries of February and there will also not be any settlement of long pending dues.” The teachers’ body also sought removal of the pattern of assistance document.“This document is a prelude to massive restructuring of these colleges that would inevitably lead to dismemberment of these colleges from DU. We remind you once again that such unilateral reworking of pattern of assistance without taking into consideration other stakeholders, including DU and employees of these colleges, is both unethical and illegal,” the DUTA said in a statement issued. Opposing the Delhi government’s order of appointing Senior Administrative Officers to the 12 colleges, the DUTA said, “Introduction of such officers is not tenable under the framework of DU. The office of the principal is competent enough to look into these matters.”  We remind you once again that such unilateral reworking of pattern of assistance without taking into consideration other stakeholders is both unethical and illegal DUTA statement||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/duta-marches-to-cms-residence-with-demands/article34156530.ece
