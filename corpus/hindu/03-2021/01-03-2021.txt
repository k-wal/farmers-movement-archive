The satellites were carried on board the PSLV-C51, the 53rd flight of ISRO’s launch vehicle and the first dedicated mission of its commercial arm, NewSpace India Ltd. The mission was undertaken under a commercial arrangement with Spaceflight Inc., U.S. The PSLV-C51, equipped with two solid strap-on boosters, the third such launch of the PSLV-DL variant, lifted off at 10.24 a.m. from the first launch pad at Sriharikota. Of the 13 satellites from the U.S., one is a technology demonstration satellite and the remaining are for two-way communications and data relay. The satellites from India are the Satish Dhawan SAT (SDSAT) built by Space Kidz India, a nano-satellite intended to study the radiation levels, space weather and demonstrate long-range communication technologies; the UNITYsat, a combination of three satellites for providing radio relay services; and another satellite belonging to the DRDO. The SDSAT has an engraving of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the top panel to show solidarity for the aatmanirbhar initiative and space privatisation, SpaceKidz said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/isro-puts-brazils-amazonia-1-18-other-satellites-into-orbit/article33958074.ece

A UN human rights official said it had “credible information” that 18 people were killed and 30 wounded. That would be the highest single-day death toll among protesters who are demanding that the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi be restored after being ousted by a February 1 coup. Nearly 1,000 people are believed to have been detained on Sunday. “Deaths reportedly occurred as a result of live ammunition fired into crowds in Yangon, Dawei, Mandalay, Myeik, Bago and Pokokku,” the UN Human Rights Office said in a statement, adding that the forces also used tear gas, flash-bang grenades and stun grenades. “We strongly condemn the escalating violence against protests in Myanmar and call on the military to immediately halt the use of force against peaceful protesters,” its spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani was quoted saying. The Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent media company, reported that as of 5 p.m., there had been 19 confirmed deaths in nine cities, with another 10 deaths unconfirmed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/at-least-18-dead-on-bloodiest-day-of-myanmar-protests/article33958103.ece
01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||In Nagaland, an itch to revive prickly cages for lawbreakers||Some villages in Nagaland are trying to revive a traditional form of punishment that seeks to check crime with an itch in time. Social offenders or violators of Naga customary laws have over the ages dreaded a cramped, triangular cage made from the logs of an indigenous tree that irritates the skin. The dread is more of humiliation or loss of face within the community or clan than of spending at least a day scratching furiously without any space to move. Such itchy cages are referred to as khujli ghar in Nagamese — a pidgin lingua franca — but each Naga community has its own name. The Aos, one of the major tribes of Nagaland, call it Shi-ki that means flesh-house. “A few villages where traditional practices are very strong still prescribe this form of punishment, a deterrent for offenders of various shades, including robbers and drug addicts. Many villages are trying to revive it,” Sanen Pongen, the chairman of Chuchuyimlang village council in Mokokchung district, told The Hindu . In full public view The cage is usually placed at a central spot in the village, usually in front of the morung, or bachelor’s dormitory, for the inmate to be in full public view. “The cage is made of the logs of Masang-fung, a local tree that people avoid because of the irritation it causes. It does not affect the palm but people who make the cages have to be careful,” Mr. Pongen said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-nagaland-an-itch-to-revive-prickly-cages-for-lawbreakers/article33958070.ece

The assent was given on Friday (February 26), according to a notification in the Gazette. The notification was also issued on the same day. Two more groups The law, the Special Reservation Act, 2021, which came into force “at once”, has created two more groups — one covering 25 MBCs and 68 DNCs and another covering the remaining 22 MBCs. The law was framed after the State government consulted the Chairman of the State Backward Classes Commission, M. Thanikachalam, on the possibility of providing internal reservation among the MBCs and the DNCs within the 20% available to them under the Tamil Nadu Act 45 of 1994. The Act 45 dealt with the entire reservation scheme of 69% for the Backward Classes, the MBCs, the DNCs, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. In his response, the Chairman referred to the recommendation made eight years ago by his predecessor M.S. Janarthanam for providing 10.5% reservation to the Vanniyakula Kshatriya community within the 20%. He also said that to facilitate “distributive social justice”, there could be “no bar on grouping” the other communities, notified as the MBCs and the DNCs, based on the proportion of their population. He suggested that other than the Vanniyakula Kshatriya community, two more groups (MBC-DNC and MBC) be created and provided with 7% and 2.5% reservation respectively, according to the latest Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/governor-gives-assent-to-internal-quota-bill/article33958154.ece

The FDA said J&J’s vaccine offered 85% protection against the most severe illness, in a study that spanned three continents. The announcement came as China also gave conditional approval for its single-dose vaccine. The protection remained strong even in countries such as South Africa, where the variants of most concern are spreading. “The more vaccines that have high efficacy that we can get into play, the better,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said ahead of the FDA’s ruling. Shipments of a few million doses to be divided among U.S. states could begin as early as Monday. By the end of March, J&J said it expects to deliver 20 million doses to the U.S. On Thursday, Bahrain in West Asia became the first nation to clear its use.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/us-nod-for-jj-one-shot-covid-19-jab/article33958072.ece

Balan. However, those in the PSC rank list for appointment to the post of civil police officer (CPO) will continue their strike, citing the government’s “ambiguous response” to their demands. The discontinuation of the high-profile agitation has come as a propaganda victory for the LDF government. The Congress and the BJP had sought to exploit the protests to highlight their charge of backdoor appointments and fan youth anger against the government. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had pushed the strike into national attention by calling on the protesters. BJP national executive member Sobha Surendran had shepherded the agitators to the Raj Bhavan to meet Governor Arif Muhammad Khan after the government displayed reluctance to engage them in talks. The agitation also provoked violent demonstrations by Congress and BJP workers in front of the PSC offices across Kerala. Many protests resulted in police action and injuries on both sides. Several organisations too staged protests in a show of solidarity. Appointments in government posts are made from the rank lists published by the PSC after relevant periodical exams and interviews. The lists will have five times more people than the number of vacancies and are valid for periods ranging from one to three years.

Politically, we may be rivals, but the fact is [that] he does not hide his past reality,” Mr. Azad said at a function in Jammu. Mr. Azad said those who hide their past “live in an illusionary world”, without naming any leader. “A man should be proud of who he is. I have travelled to many countries and stayed in five star hotels across the world. But when I visit my village, the smell there is always pleasant. It smells different,” Mr. Azad added. Mr. Azad’s remarks come at a time when the group of 23 dissenting leaders from the Congress, known as the G-23, held a grand meeting in Jammu on Saturday, with many leaders pitching for him to lead the party. Many saw the G-23 meeting here as an open rebellion against the top leadership of the Congress.

01 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Phase 2 of vaccination begins today amid a COVID-19 surge||A day before India opens up vaccination for senior citizens and those above 45 with comorbidities, fresh daily COVID-19 infections were above 16,000 for the fourth consecutive day. Excluding Sunday, the figures for which are not yet available, the number of fresh weekly infections was close to 1,20,000. Only on January 28 did India record 18,000 new infections, after which daily cases never touched 15,000 until February 23, when cases have consistently been above 16,000. Six States — Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat — have shown a surge in new cases in the 24 hours up to 8 a.m. on Sunday, with about 86% of the cases emerging from these States. Maharashtra reported the highest daily new cases at 8,623, followed by Kerala with 3,792 and Punjab with 593. Nearly 1.07 crore people have recovered so far with 11,718 patients discharged in the 24 hours. The recoveries continue to be high in States that are posting an increase in number of cases. Nearly 85% of the new recovered cases were in six States, with Kerala reporting the highest single-day recoveries of 4,650. As many as 3,648 recovered in Maharashtra, followed by 491 in Tamil Nadu. As of Saturday for which the latest figures are available, 1,43,01,266 vaccine doses have been administered through 2,92,312 sessions. These include vaccination for 6.6 million healthcare workers who have got one dose; 2.4 million with a second dose; and 5.1 million frontline workers with a second dose. The Centre has also deputed high-level multi-disciplinary teams to Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Jammu and Kashmir, to ascertain the reasons for the surge and coordinate with the State Health Departments in COVID-19 control and containment measures. To ramp up vaccination, nearly 10,000 private hospitals under Ayushman Bharat PMJAY and more than 600 private hospitals under the Central Government Health Scheme will be utilised with prospective beneficiaries having the option to pre-register via the CoWin 2.0 or Arogya Setu app, or walk in at any of the registered vaccination sites. Those over 60 and above 50 with comorbidities total at least 270 million Indians. Those with comorbidities are expected to get a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner detailing their condition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/phase-2-of-vaccination-begins-today-amid-a-covid-19-surge/article33958034.ece
01 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||CSIR lab helped develop key molecule for Covaxin||The Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), a Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) lab here, played a role in the development of Covaxin, the indigenous vaccine developed by the city-based Bharat Biotech International Limited. The vaccine is a highly purified, whole virion, inactivated SARS-Cov-2. The vaccine has been formulated with ‘Algel-IMDG’, which contains chemically absorbed TLR7/8 as an agonist or an adjuvant onto aluminium hydroxide gel to generate the requisite type of immune responses without damaging the body. The firm had approached the IICT to develop the synthetic route for the adjuvant molecule TLR 7/8 with indigenous chemicals at an affordable price and with highest purity. This indigenously developed molecule aided Bharat Biotech to scale up the production of the adjuvant, said an official release on Friday. Swift process IICT Director S. Chandrasekhar, along with his team consisting of senior scientists M. Mohan Krishna and Raji Reddy, completed the chemical process in a record four months for the development of analytical method for testing TLR7/8 adjuvant molecule and also got the method validation procedures through National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) accredited lab. “The process technology developed by CSIR-IICT for the molecule is playing an important role in the production of adjuvant for COVAXIN,” said Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Krishna Ella. CSIR director-general Shekhar Mande complimented the CSIR-IICT team for rising to the occasion in making the process affordable and enabling development of the molecule in record time. He mentioned that this was yet another instance of the CSIR’s commitment towards ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ or self-reliant India. CSIR labs, apart from helping the pharma industry launch repurposed drugs through process development and conducting clinical trials, have extensively contributed towards launching of diagnostic kits including ‘Feluda’ and dry swab direct RT-PCR method for the screening of SARS-CoV-2, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/csir-lab-helped-develop-key-molecule-for-covaxin/article33957997.ece
01 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Low-key bidding likely at spectrum auctions||While the much-awaited telecom spectrum auctions kick-off from Monday, analysts do not anticipate large-scale bidding and expect operators to bid conservatively for minimum quantities with a focus on renewal of expiry spectrum. A total of 2251.25 MHz of airwaves, across 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz frequency bands, with a total value of Rs. 3.92 lakh crore at reserve price, will be put up for bidding. The 5G airwaves have not been put up for bidding. In a recent note, IIFL Securities said it sees only 24% of the total spectrum getting sold. “Telcos will likely bid conservatively for minimum quantities, needed to satisfy the immediate 2-3-quarter capacity requirement, and await prices of regular bands to be cut in subsequent auctions as well as wait for 5G spectrum... We do not see any bids in the 700, 1800, 2100 and 2500 MHz bands,” the note said. In the last spectrum auctions, which were held in 2016, about 40% of the 2,355 MHz of spectrum (worth Rs. 5.6 lakh crore) put on auction was sold, generating Rs. 65,789 crore revenue for the government. There were no takers for the 700 MHz spectrum due to the high reserve prices as well as for the 900 Mhz band. The three private operators — Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea — have submitted earnest money deposit of Rs. 3,000 crore, Rs. 10,000 crore and Rs. 475 crore, respectively. According to spectrum auction rules, a firm can bid for spectrum only as per eligibility point allocated based on its deposit. As per ICICI Securities, operators can buy spectrum worth 5-7 times their EMD, meaning Bharti Airtel’s spectrum payout could be capped at about Rs. 15,000-21,000 crore, Reliance Jio’s at about Rs. 50,000-70,000 crore and for Vodafone Idea at about Rs. 2,400-3,300 crore. Likewise, Jefferies in its research note pointed out that with the 5G spectrum not being auctioned, telcos will focus on 2021-24 renewals and boosting capacity by buying 1800/2100/2300MHz bands. “We don’t expect operators to bid for 700MHz band due to its high price as well as ample availability of spectrum in 800MHz,” it said. As per the government, successful bidders may pay entire bid amount in one go or may exercise the option to pay a certain amount (25% for spectrum won in 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz bands or 50% for spectrum won in 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz bands) upfront and remaining amount in a maximum up to 16 equated annual instalments, after a moratorium of two years. In addition to the bid amount, successful bidders will also have to pay 3% of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) excluding wireline services as spectrum usage charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/low-key-bidding-likely-at-spectrum-auctions/article33958040.ece
01 March 2021||New Delhi,||PM calls for water conservation drive||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said there was a need to start conserving water right away and that the Jal Shakti Ministry would be launching a 100-day “catch the rain” campaign soon. Mr. Modi was speaking during his monthly radio address, Mann Ki Baat , when he said there was a need to have collective responsibility on water conservation. “In most parts of India, rainfall begins in May-June. Can we right away start a 100-day campaign for the sake of cleaning up the water sources around us and conserving rainwater? With this very thought in mind, in a few days from now, Jal Shakti Abhiyan ‘catch the rain’ is being initiated by the Jal Shakti Ministry,” he said, according to the English translation of his address provided by the government. Since it was National Science Day on Sunday, Mr. Modi said the youth should learn about the history of science in India and scientists. ‘Self-reliant India’ “Friends, when we talk of science, many a time people restrict it to physics, chemistry or labs, but the spread of science is much more than that. And there is a lot of contribution of the power of science to the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign. We have to move science forward with the mantra of ‘Lab to Land’,” said the Prime Minister. For making India more self-reliant, Mr. Modi said it was not just “bigger things”, such as missiles, aircraft, tanks and Metro trains, that would achieve the goal. He cited the example of a farmer in Uttar Pradesh who has started growing chia seeds.  “Friends, nowadays you must be hearing a lot about chia seeds. People connected to health awareness give a lot of importance to it and it has a lot of demand too in the world. In India, it is mostly sourced from abroad, but now people are taking up the challenge to be self-reliant in chia seeds, too. Similarly, Harishchandrajiof Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh has begun farming of chia seeds. Cultivation of chia seeds will also increase his income and will help in the self-reliant India campaign too,” he said. Answering a question from a listener about the one thing he felt he “missed”, Mr. Modi said, “I pondered this over and told myself that one of my shortcomings was that I could not make much effort to learn Tamil, the oldest language in the world.” “I could not make myself learn Tamil! It is such a beautiful language, which is popular all over the world. Many people have told me a lot about the quality of Tamil literature and the depth of the poems written in it. India is a land of many languages, which symbolises our culture and pride,” the Prime Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-calls-for-water-conservation-drive/article33958021.ece
01 March 2021||New Delhi,||Long wait for kin of missing engineer||The wait for the family of Subhan Ali, a 27-year-old civil engineer posted with the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), who went missing after an accident on the Zozila-Kargil-Leh road last June, has been prolonged due to bureaucratic delays. Son of a tailor from Balrampur in Uttar Pradesh, the Indian Engineering Service (IES) officer had been posted in Ladakh as part of the General Reserve Engineering Force (GREF) of the BRO. On June 22 last year, Mr. Ali, along with his driver, Palwinder Singh, went missing after their vehicle fell into the Drass river and got swept away by the fast-flowing waters. While the Gypsy and the driver’s body were recovered, the engineer’s body remained untraceable. Five days later on June 27, Pakistani authorities reported the finding of an unidentified body from the Shingo river close to the LoC. Following up the lead, the Army Headquarters coordinated with Pakistani authorities to collect the DNA samples of the unidentified body. ‘Sample in queue’ The DNA samples were received by the Kargil police at Tangdhar on August 22, 2020. Two months later, the DNA samples of his parents were also collected on October 28, 2020 and were forwarded to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Chandigarh. However, the process of matching has not been completed. Lok Sabha member and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Kunwar Danish Ali had taken up the case with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in July last year. Now, eight months later, Mr. Singh has informed his Lok Sabha colleague that the DNA matching process would need more time as “the sample is in a queue”. “It is learnt that DNA matching analysis at FSL, Chandigarh, is in queue and it may take 3-6 months before the report is received. Further action will be taken on receipt of report from FSL, Chandigarh,” Mr. Singh said in his letter dated February 11. “It has been a long wait for the family. They have been waiting for a sense of closure to this tragic chapter. Even now, they may have to wait for another six months. I would request the government to speed up the process of DNA sample matching and provide them some relief,” the BSP MP told The Hindu on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/long-wait-for-kin-of-missing-engineer/article33958027.ece
01 March 2021||Kolkata,||Furfura peer targets ally Congress at joint rally||The grand alliance of the Left parties, the Congress and the Indian Secular Front (ISF) on Sunday showed signs of cracks even before a final seat adjustment has been sealed. At a rally here, the differences came out in the open on two occasions. The first was when ISF founder and FurfurapeerAbbas Siddique arrived on the stage. His supporters made huge noise, drowning PCC president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s speech. Mr. Chowdhury wanted to stop his speech mid-way but was persuaded by Left Front chairman Biman Bose to continue. A few minutes later, Mr. Siddique, 34, spoke and heaped praise on the Left Front leadership but targeted the Congress saying they (ISF) are not willing to appease anyone in the seat-sharing arrangement. “The Left, understanding the mood of the people, has agreed to most of our terms and so I will tell my followers … to forget the history and extend their support wherever there is a Left candidate, so we can oust the BJP and the BJP government’s teammate Trinamool from Bengal,” said Mr. Siddique. The ISF founder said the CPI(M)-led Left Front has agreed to set aside 30 seats for the newly formed party. Targeting the Congress, he said, “I came here to stake my claim, not to appease anybody … If somebody wants to be my friend, the door is open and in the coming elections Siddique will fight for them.” He said Congress president Sonia Gandhi is in favour of the alliance but some in the State are delaying the process. Mr. Chowdhury said the Congress does not care about Mr. Siddique’s threats. “Our seat sharing with the Left parties has not been finalised ... How can we talk about the ISF?” According to sources, the Congress leadership is averse to part with seats from Malda and Murshidabad , which are considered its bastions, to accommodate the ISF in those areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/furfura-peer-targets-ally-congress-at-joint-rally/article33958029.ece
01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Modi, Mamata of same political DNA’||Leaders of the Left and the Congress, who addressed a historic joint rally at the Brigade Parade ground in Kolkata on Sunday, said it was necessary to defeat the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal to stop the BJP. Joining the Left and Congress leaders at the dais was Abbas Siddique, the peer of the iconic Furfura Shareef and founder of the Indian Secular Front (ISF), a recent member of the opposition alliance in the State. Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said without removing the Trinamool Congress, it was difficult to defeat the BJP; West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said Narendra Modi and Mamata Banerjee have the “same political DNA”. “It is difficult to differentiate between Modi and Mamata. Both are stifling democracy. While Modi says Congress Mukt Bharat (Congress-free India),Didihere says opposition-less Bengal,” Mr. Chowdhury said. Highlighting the association of the Trinamool with the BJP both in terms of contesting the polls and joining the government, Mr. Yechury said people of the State do not want a government that indulges in loot and divides people on caste and religion. Both Mr. Yechury and Mr. Chowdhury exuded confidence that the people of the State want “change ( parivartan )”. Senior Congress leaders, including Jitin Prasad, and Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Bhupesh Baghel, were present at the rally, as were leaders of the Communist Party of India (CPI), Revolutionary Socialist Party and All India Forward Bloc. General secretary of the CPI, D. Raja, said the presence of such a large number of people at the meeting should send a strong message to both Trinamool and BJP. Addressing the gathering, the ISF chief said the person feeling most threatened today is Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Responding to the rally, senior Trinamool Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee said it is a matter of regret that the Left and the Congress have allied with ISF, which is a “communal force”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-mamata-of-same-political-dna/article33958031.ece
01 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Swiss neutrality in world affairs attractive again: envoy||Switzerland’s traditional foreign policy of neutrality has become attractive again because of the changing political reality in the world, said its Ambassador Ralf Heckner at a think tank event on Saturday. He said neutrality has become necessary as a foreign policy tool as the phase of power politics has returned in the world affairs. “Switzerland’s neutrality has to serve a purpose. The purpose of neutrality to the global powers was maintained also after 1945. After 1991, at the end of the Cold War, neutrality was not very much in demand. There was a moment of unipolar world and that can explain it. Now with big power politics, Switzerland’s neutrality and Switzerland as a place to meet is much more attractive again,” said Mr. Heckner at an online discussion organised by Asian Pathfinders, an open knowledge sharing platform for policy planners and academics. When asked whether Switzerland would redefine its neutrality to adjust with the global order, the Ambassador said, “The answer could be yes.” The envoy said the foreign policy was born out of a necessity to stay away from the wars in Europe from the 19th century till the middle of the 20th century. The policy, he said, was not just to the advantage of Switzerland as it also served a purpose of the European powers who wanted a neutral venue to meet and do business. In the 21st century, Switzerland is again becoming a destination for dialogue on difficult issues, he said. “Discussions on Syria, Libya and Yemen were held in Geneva. A lot of the Iran talks were held in Geneva.” Ambassador Heckner said Switzerland is also likely to extend its foreign policy tool to the digital domain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/swiss-neutrality-in-world-affairs-attractive-again-envoy/article33958036.ece
01 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Suryakiran, Sarang teams to dazzle Colombo skies||The Suryakiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) and the Sarang helicopter display team, along with the light combat aircraft, of the Indian Air Force will perform at an airshow at the Galle Face in Colombo from March 3 to 5 as part of the 70th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lankan Air Force (SLAF). In all, 23 aircraft of the IAF and the Indian Navy will take part in the show and have begun arriving at the airbase in Katunayake on Saturday, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said on Twitter. The teams are in Colombo on an invitation from Air Marshal Sudarshana Pathirana, Commander of the SLAF, an IAF statement said. This will be the first performance for the SKAT team outside India since it was resurrected in 2015 with the Hawk advanced jet trainers. Earlier, the SKAT team had toured Sri Lanka during the 50th anniversary of the SLAF in 2001. 1971 commemoration Marking the golden jubilee year of the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh, the SKAT team has been flying different formations over landmarks across the country starting from Kanyakumari in the south. The team has already flown over some of the southern cities and more demonstrations are in the pipeline. As an aerial salute to all those who took part in the 1971 war, the number “71” was formed in the air over Kanyakumari with 10 aeroplanes — six aircraft making the number seven and four of them making the number one. More formations are planned all over the country over the year, a defence official said. The team currently has 13 pilots and is led by Group Captain Anoop Singh. The entire team consists of fighter pilots and qualified flying instructors. The team is currently procuring and integrating the smoke pods so it can paint the skies in the signature Suryakiran Style, the official added. The SKAT team, also known as 52 Squadron or The Sharks, is based in Bidar. The team was formed in 1996 with Kiran Mk-II aircraft and had enthralled spectators across the country till 2011. It was revived in 2015 with Hawk trainers initially with four aircraft and grew to the nine-aircraft formation. Since its inception, the SKAT team has carried out over 600 displays all around the country. It has also represented India across southeast Asia including China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/suryakiran-sarang-teams-to-dazzle-colombo-skies/article33958043.ece
01 March 2021||Pune,||Need to reset India-China trade ties: Foreign Secretary||Remarking that a normal bilateral trade relationship with China was contingent on peace and tranquillity on other fronts, Indian Foreign Secretary H.V. Shringla on Sunday said the country was looking to diversify its trade dependencies. “The current bilateral trade with China at $78 billion is heavily tilted in the latter’s favour and that will need a reset. India on its part is simultaneously working on diversifying its sourcing to ensure a more resilient supply chain in the future,” said the Foreign Secretary. Mr. Shringla was speaking during the penultimate panel discussion titled 'India as Global Partner' at the fifth Asia Economic Dialogue (AED) 2021, jointly hosted by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Pune International Centre (PIC). Commenting on future relations with the United States in wake of new Joe Biden administration, Mr. Shringla said India has had “an element of continuity” with the U.S. and that Prime Minister Modi had had close personal relationships with both former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. “While China continues to be one of India’s most important trade partners, the balance of trade is skewed in favour of the former. With recent disturbances in eastern Ladakh and the ongoing process of disengagement, there is introspection on our part in making our supply chain more resilient… a normal bilateral relationship with China is calibrated on peace and tranquillity on other fronts,” he said. Mr. Shringla said the Indian government was trying to work out details of new proposals with the Biden administration to make the supply chain more resilient in the Indo-Pacific region. Observing that the Prime Minister had had close relationships with both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump, Mr. Shringla said that Mr. Modi also shared a good rapport with Mr. Biden. “They have had a series of good conversations. So, we have a sense of priorities with the new U.S. administration. New elements like climate change and technology have been introduced by the Biden administration. There is a range of areas to collaborate,” said the Foreign Secretary. Stating that the Indian government’s first priority was to fulfil its domestic vaccine needs, he said the country would not compromise on its commitment to meet international vaccine requirements as well. Noting that India’s vaccine diplomacy had been a “huge success”, he said that India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy in the context of supplying vaccines to its neighbours has significantly raised New Delhi’s stature among people of these countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/need-to-reset-india-china-trade-ties-foreign-secretary/article33958047.ece
01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Fertilizer plant set to go on stream||When Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the revival of the project on August 7, 2016 — earlier it was Fertilizer Corporation of India unit which fell sick and stopped production on March 31, 1999 — the targeted completion was fixed for April 2018 but revised to December 2018 and some other later dates. More recently, the commissioning of the project was anticipated by June last year. However, it was again postponed due to coronavirus. Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said in January that Mr. Modi will be invited for the inauguration. He had earlier reviewed the plant progress with RFCL officials through video conferencing and asked them to ensure that the fertilizer needs of farmers in Telangana were met on priority basis as the facility was located in the State. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had also expressed the hope that the plant will augment fertilizer supplies to the State as its cultivable area had vastly grown in size due to construction of irrigation projects. The project was a result of Modi government’s decision to revive some of the sick units of FCI, including the one at Ramagundam, which had to be shut down due to high production cost on account of usage of coal as fuel. The earlier Congress government contemplated to turn it into a naphtha-based project but no headway was made. Finally, a revival package with a joint venture between National Fertilizers Limited (26 % equity), Engineers India Limited (26 %) and FCI (11 %) was struck in 2015. The Telangana government (11 %), Gas Authority of India Limited (14.3 %) and a consortium led by HTAS joined the financial closure in August 2018. It was decided that the supply of natural gas to the plant will be from the 365 km long gas pipeline from Kakinada. The Telangana government will provide water from Sripada Yellampalli project on river Godavari and power from its utilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fertilizer-plant-set-to-go-on-stream/article33958348.ece

Shaji, hailing from Kollam district of Kerala, on charge of wildlife crimes, including elephant trading. Shaji was arrested from Navi Mumbai recently with the help of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (western region) officials. Five cases were booked against him in Kollam under the Wildlife Protection Act and Captive Elephant Management Rules, Kerala. There is a police case too for forgery on a complaint from the Forest Department. Some of his close relatives too are accused in the cases. 15 elephants found The cases were booked after a YouTube video, in which Shaji claimed to have traded in over 200 elephants, went viral in October 2020. The Forest Department found 15 captive elephants in his custody. Soon after, he went into hiding. M.V. Prasanth of Thiruvananthapuram, another alleged elephant trader and an accused in two cases, is still on the run. The crackdown against elephant trade in the State had run into a controversy with the State Principal Secretary (Forest) stalling the investigation following a complaint from an association of elephant owners to the State Forest Minister. The Hindu had earlier reported the controversial order issued by the forest official. Later, the government lifted the ban and permitted the Chief Wildlife Warden to proceed with the probe. “We tracked a telephone number used by Shaji to Mumbai. The officials of the bureau led by Deputy Director Yogesh Nilkanth Warkad, a Kerala-cadre IFS official, and Maharashtra police traced him to a house in Navi Mumbai,” said Surendrakumar, Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala, who laid down his office on Sunday.

The Centre is preparing its own MERITE project with some similar objectives to improve technical education, but that may be too late for the faculty employed under the current project. Tanmay Rath holds a Ph.D. in polymer chemistry from IIT Kharagpur, with post doctoral experience in nanomaterials research in eastern Asia. However, for the last three years, he has been engaged in a project teaching chemistry to undergraduate engineering students in Motihari, a small town in Bihar’s East Champaran district. “I was hired under the TEQIP [Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme] project along with other NIT and IIT graduates and recruited to teach in some of the poorest and most remote areas. In Motihari Engineering College, there are 52 faculty but 20 are from TEQIP,” he said. “We have transformed the teaching system here. There were no practical lab classes being conducted at all until we came,” he added. “I don’t know how they will manage to teach the classes once our contract ends on March 31. In the Chemistry department, the only other faculty is also retiring at the end of the month. We have been appealing to the State and Central governments, but no one is willing to take the responsibility for the fate of these faculty or the students.” Three phases of the Rs. 3,600-crore TEQIP project have been completed since it was launched in December 2002. The third phase focussed on improving quality and equity in engineering institutions in seven low income, eight northeastern and three hilly States. Among the initiatives was a bid to recruit more than 1,500 faculty from top institutions and send them to colleges that could never have afforded them. They were paid salaries in accordance with the Seventh Pay Commission. Now, neither States nor Centre is willing to commit to continued funding. “What is the government talking about a new National Education Policy when it cannot even sustain the gains of an existing project?” asked Rabel Guharoy, a computer science faculty hired under TEQIP at the University College of Engineering and Technology in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand. About 300 faculty have already quit TEQIP for other jobs, but 250 of those remaining have filed cases in the Delhi High Court.

The result of this ‘mental cruelty’ must be such that continuation of marital relationship would be impossible. In other words, the wronged person can hardly be expected to condone the other. Background matters “The degree of tolerance will vary from one couple to another and the court will have to bear in mind the background, the level of education and also the status of the parties, in order to determine whether the cruelty alleged is sufficient to justify dissolution of marriage,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul observed in a judgment on February 26. The judgment came in an appeal filed by an Army officer whose estranged wife had filed a series of complaints against him with his superiors and even the Army chief. A Family Court had accepted his plea for dissolution of marriage on the ground of mental cruelty on her part. The court had rubbished her claim of adultery against him. The court refused to accept her plea for restitution of conjugal rights. High Court verdict However, the Uttarakhand High Court, on her appeal, dismissed the trouble between the couple as “squabbles in an ordinary middle-class marriage”. It set aside the lower court’s finding of mental cruelty. This time, the husband appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the family court’s finding of mental cruelty. “The allegations are levelled by a highly educated spouse and they do have the propensity to irreparably damage the character and reputation of the appellant [husband]. When the reputation of the spouse is sullied amongst his colleagues, his superiors and the society at large, it would be difficult to expect condonation of such conduct by the affected party,” it concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sullying-reputation-career-a-ground-for-divorce-sc/article33958037.ece
01 March 2021||Hyderabad,||Encourage children into IISERs, Vinod Kumar tells officials||State Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar has urged education officials to take measures for improving the presence of Telangana students in Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), which are government-supported premier public research institutes in the country. On National Science Day, Mr. Vinod Kumar said efforts should be made to increase the number of Telangana students in IISERs as they pave way for good careers apart from serving the nation. He said IISER Aptitude Test for the next season will start on August 1 and officials should plan to educate children for these institutes. He has also written to the Education Secretary and Board of Intermediate Education in this regard. Quoting some figures, he said compared to other States, the number of students appearing and qualifying from Telangana was less. Last year 7,555 students appeared from Kerala scoring average marks of 48.51 out of 180 while only 644 appeared from Telangana scoring just 25.74 average marks. Other States doing better than Telangana include Andhra Pradesh (653 students scoring 37.75 marks), West Bengal (2,138 students scoring 51.34 marks) and Odisha (1,332 students scoring 46.32 marks).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/encourage-children-into-iisers-vinod-kumar-tells-officials/article33958347.ece
01 March 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Fuel price hike affects MSMEs’||The operating cost of over 60 lakh medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs) in Karnataka will go up at least 30% due to the recent hike in petrol and diesel prices, say trade bodies. They said the fuel hike came at a time when MSMEs were still on their way to slow recovery after the pandemic brought the entire sector to a standstill between April and October2020.The hike would certainly put additional burden on the MSME ecosystem as it was like being pulled down again when it was trying to climb out of the pandemic-brought crisis. FKCCI president Perikal M. Sundar told The Hindu: “Operational cost overall has gone up for MSMEs because of the fuel hike and consequently overheads will be up easily by 30%. In addition, to reach units and factories, most MSME workers use their own vehicles or public transport. Under this situation, companies will have no option but to increase salaries, although business activities are yet to become normal.” Most affected Manufacturing, engineering, machine tool, and automotive space parts firms etc. would be the most hit as they run their machines on diesel gen-sets during hours of daily power cuts. D.R. Subramanyam, CII Karnataka State Council member ( MSME) also managing director of SLN Technologies, said: “The hike in fuel price will put the entire MSME sector, especially the small and micro enterprises, under severe pressure. Most companies are still struggling to climb back to normalcy.” Mr, Subramanyam added that costs were only going up for MSMEs even before revenues started picking up. Transport and logistics MSME operations are heavily dependent on transport and logistics. They, on a daily basis, deliver products to OEMs and also buy raw materials. MSMEs in the State despatch autoparts, electrical items and machine tools meant for automotive industries across Pune, Chennai and Hyderabad. Also, most raw materials, be it steel, copper, aluminium, plastic or rubber, come from Kolkata, Mumbai or Delhi on trucks. “The entire life cycle of MSMEs is dependent on transportation. Now, with another hike in fuel prices, the local transportation, inter-State despatches, employee commuting cost of production, and input cost all are on the rise,” said KASSIA general secretary N.R. Jagadish.  The entire life cycle of MSMEs is dependent on transportation.

01 March 2021||Bengaluru,||COVID-19 curbs are back in Bengaluru flats||Residents of apartment complexes in the city are once again tightening precautions to prevent the spread COVID-19, even while colleges have opened and restrictions have eased in restaurants, theatres, etc. The detection of new clusters in the city in the last fortnight, especially in Yelahanka, and the rise in COVID-19 cases in the neighbouring States of Kerala and Maharashtra have residents worried. Though the numbers are not alarming, apartment associations said they do not want to take any chances for the fear that this is the beginning of a second wave. Many apartment complexes have yet to open club houses and other recreational facilities to residents, while others are not allowing vendors inside the premises for deliveries of food/packages, etc. R. Rajagopalan, residents’ association member of L&T South City at Arekere, said residents of the complex, which has 1,998 flats, are not allowed to sit on benches in the open spaces, let alone congregate and gather. “Since March 2020, when the lockdown was imposed, the club house has remained shut. We have not held any physical general body meeting or town hall. However, we have recently opened up the sports facilities, but with restrictions,” he said. At Surabhi Apartment, which is in close proximity to SNN Raj Lakeview — the apartment complex at Bilekahalli where a total of 108 residents tested positive — the club house, swimming pool, and gym continue to remain closed. “We wanted to allow door delivery by different vendors from March 1. However, with cases being reported in the apartment nearby, we have deferred this by another two months,” Sachin Mundade, president of the RWA, said, and added that the gym would be opened only from March 15. Here too, no get-togethers or parties are being allowed, either in the common areas or in the flats. Apart from mandatory temperature checks for helpers and residents, the association of Century Corbel Apartment at Sahakarnagar takes a call on requests to use the common party hall on a case-by-case basis. Deliveries are also allowed only till the security gate and residents have to go pick up their packages from there themselves, said Sindhu Hegde, association president. ‘No reason to panic’ Despite these residents’ associations taking stringent measures, the Bangalore Apartments’ Federation, an umbrella organisation for 911 apartment associations in the city, believes that there is no reason to panic. Vikram Rai from the federation, however, said that general precautions that were in place earlier should continue to be imposed. “At the community level, ensuring that residents wear masks, sanitisation of common areas, and taking the temperatures of those entering the apartment at the gate are important. Such measures should continue. That said, there is no necessity for extreme measures to be put in place,” he said, and added that an advisory would be issued by the BAF to its members soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-curbs-are-back-in-bengaluru-flats/article33958009.ece

Sreedharan’s entry into the BJP a “gimmick”, the Congress’s Kerala in-charge Tariq Anwar on Sunday said it would be a direct fight between the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the coming Assembly election as the people would not “waste” their votes on the BJP which would remain a marginal player in the State. The Congress general secretary also asserted that it was not the party’s tradition to announce a chief ministerial face and after polls the name of the Chief Minister candidate would be arrived at through consensus. In an interview with PTI, Mr. Anwar exuded confidence that the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) would form the next government in Kerala and stated that the main issue in polls would be the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s “corruption and mismanagement” in the last five years. “The results will be in UDF’s favour. People had given mandate to the LDF last time but their performance in the last five years has not been good and three-four scandals have also been unearthed recently in which even the CPI(M) office has come under suspicion,” he said. “Conditions are in favour of the UDF as there is strong anti-incumbency of the five years,” the former Union Minister said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sreedharans-entry-into-bjp-a-gimmick/article33958014.ece

The launch also marked the first dedicated mission of ISRO’s commercial arm NewSpace India Ltd. (NSIL). The unique relationship between both countries has ensured support for each other’s satellites and the use of each other’s ground stations, including tracking India’s Chandrayaan-1&2 missions and the 2013 Mangalyaan Mars Orbiter Mission using Brazilian earth stations Alcantara and Cuiaba. Brazil and India first signed an MoU between the Department of Space and AEB in March 2002, followed by a Framework Agreement in 2004, that is reviewed by a Joint Working Group (JWG).

It does not affect the palm but people who make the cages have to be careful,” Mr. Pongen said. A prickly cage usually accommodates one offender — invariably a male — who barely has space to sit, for 24 hours or more than a week, depending on the gravity of the offence. He can be fed by relatives periodically and let out to answer nature’s call during the punishment. “Some local modifications aside, customary laws of all the Naga tribes are similar. The khujli ghar too used to be common until lock-ups came up in police stations to house the offenders and some forms of punishment began clashing with those prescribed by constitutional laws,” said Hesheto Chishi, a customary law and Naga folklore researcher based in Dimapur. As the founder of Indigenous Cultural Society, the only such in the northeast affiliated to the UNESCO, he has been working on codifying the customary laws and has co-authored Oral Narrative , a book on Sumi Naga laws published by the Ministry of Human Resources Development. “It is not proper to view the itchy cages from the prism of modern laws. They have served a purpose for ages and have often proved to reform offenders, as identity and family or clan reputation is very important to a Naga,” Mr. Chishi, also a community chieftain, said. Article 371(A) of the Constitution guarantees the preservation of Naga customary laws. The State also funds the customary courts in villages and towns where cases — mostly dealing with land litigation, money-lending and marital disputes — have a high rate of prompt disposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/an-itch-to-revive-prickly-cages-for-lawbreakers/article33958016.ece

01 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Govt. continuity vital for State’s progress: Pinarayi||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has batted for continuity of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) rule in the State to take forward the welfare schemes initiated by the CPI(M)-led government. Inaugurating the ‘Youth Summit on Future Kerala’ organised by the AKG Centre for Research and Studies here on Sunday, Mr. Vijayan said that Left governments had contributed immensely towards the State’s development, despite having been in power less times than Congress-led coalitions. “While the E.M.S. Namboodiripad-led government that came to power in 1957 laid the foundation for progress, the next Left government that emerged in 1967 also adopted several pro-people measures. Right-wing governments that ruled for longer phases until 1982 have strived to undo such welfare measures, but such efforts were thwarted by mass movements,” he said. While the State began to alternate among the UDF and LDF governments since 1982, the latter had had to spend half of its terms in reinstating the welfare measures that were reversed by the previous Congress-led governments. This had costed the State immensely, Mr. Vijayan said. The Chief Minister’s appeal for another term in power came shortly after he and LDF convener (and CPI(M) acting State secretary) A. Vijayaraghavan jointly launched the coalition’s tagline ‘Urappanu LDF’ (Yes, for sure it’s the LDF) for its campaign. Mr. Vijayan reiterated the government’s aspiration to attain a knowledge society and digital economy. The State has sowed the seeds for its goal by declaring Internet as a fundamental right and launching the K-Fon project that will link the people of Kerala with the global information highway. Sweeping changes He stressed the need to target sweeping changes in the higher education sector to exploit the State’s potential of a knowledge hub. A knowledge economy fund was being instituted to fuel such goals, he said. Delivering the keynote address, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac advocated greater academic autonomy for educational institutions while restructuring the higher education sector. He called for steps to foster innovations that were vital to drive the economy ahead. State Planning Board member K.N. Harilal, Kerala State Higher Education Council vice chairman P.M.

01 March 2021||Hyderabad,||Ramagundam fertilizer plant set to go on stream||The management of Ramagundam Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited announced on Sunday that its prestigious gas-based urea manufacturing plant at Ramagundam was in advanced stage of commissioning and production of urea for commercial use was expected to commence shortly. In the early hours of Sunday, the RFCL successfully carried out testing of its prilling tower and bagging plant. As part of production procedures at two units — prilling section and tower and conveying systems to the silo as well as bagging unit — a test was successfully conducted using technical grade urea. The trial run was a big step ahead of the much awaited commissioning of the Rs. 6,180 crore project after it jumped quite a few deadlines. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the revival of the project on August 7, 2016 — earlier it was Fertilizer Corporation of India unit which fell sick and stopped production on March 31, 1999 — the targeted completion was fixed for April 2018. But it was revised to December 2018 and some other later dates. More recently, the commissioning of the project was anticipated by June last year. However, it was again postponed due to coronavirus. Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said in January that Mr. Modi will be invited for the inauguration. He had earlier reviewed the plant progress with RFCL officials through video conferencing and asked them to ensure that the fertilizer needs of farmers in Telangana were met on priority basis as the facility was located in the State. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had also expressed the hope that the plant will augment fertilizer supplies to the State as its cultivable area had vastly grown in size due to construction of irrigation projects. The project was a result of Modi government’s decision to revive some of the sick units of FCI, including the one at Ramagundam, which had to be shut down due to high production cost on account of usage of coal as fuel. The earlier Congress government contemplated to turn it into a naphtha-based project but no headway was made. Finally, a revival package with a joint venture between National Fertilizers Limited (26 % equity), Engineers India Limited (26 %) and FCI (11 %) was struck in 2015. The Telangana government (11 %), Gas Authority of India Limited (14.3 %) and a consortium led by HTAS joined the financial closure in August 2018. It was decided that the supply of natural gas to the plant will be from the 365 km long gas pipeline from Kakinada. The Telangana government will provide water from Sripada Yellampalli project on river Godavari and power from its utilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ramagundam-fertilizer-plant-set-to-go-on-stream/article33958343.ece
01 March 2021||Mysuru,||Tigress tranquillised, shifted to Mysuru||Forest Department personnel have trapped a tigress with snare wounds on its neck and shifted it to the Chamundi Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre on the outskirts of Mysuru. This is the same feline which was first sighted, with a snare dangling from its neck and having deep wounds, in Kerala. It had subsequently moved into the Gundre range of Bandipur. It was sighted around 3.30 p.m. in Gundre range on Saturday, following which the authorities decided to tranquillise it as it was badly in need of treatment. S.R. Natesh, director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said this was the same tigress that had attacked a forest officer at Wayanad in Kerala almost 45 days ago. The forest personnel placed a few bones with meat as bait and the animal was trapped in the intervening hours between Saturday and Sunday. On subjecting it to a medical examination and imparting treatment, the authorities discovered that it was a tigress about nine years old and there were parts of the snare embedded in its flesh, causing it much trauma. The snare was removed but the veterinarians treating the tigress said the wounds were deep and infested with worms, and hence the tigress had to be constantly monitored and kept under observation.

Inspector S Rajasekhar Reddy said that the accident took place on road No. 10 of Jubilee Hills, in which the young actor ended up damaging three vehicles as well. Locals caught him and handed him over to the police, who made Shanmukh undergo a breathalyser test. “His blood alcohol content was 170mg/100 ml, which is against the permissible limit of 30 mg,” Mr. Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/short-film-actor-booked-for-drunk-driving/article33957999.ece
01 March 2021||Kochi,||Kerala a haven for fundamentalists: Sitaraman||Kerala, which was once famed as God’s Own Country, has become fundamentalists’ own country, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said. Speaking at Tripunithura in connection with Vijay Yatra, the political rally led by Bharatiya Janata Party State president K. Surendran, Ms. Sitharaman said the slogans of 1921 Mappila Rebellion, which according to her was a Hindu genocide, were being repeated in Kerala. Yet, the Left Democratic Front government was not worried about it as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was in tacit alliance with the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), she alleged. “I just do not want to hear the slogan being raised once again in the State,” said Ms. Sitharaman after reciting the slogan. The Finance Minister said there were also attempts to celebrate the anniversary of the “1921 Hindu genocide” in Kerala. The CPI(M) was not merely into minority appeasement but appeasement of fundamentalists, she said. The LDF government gave permission to the SDPI to hold a protest march in Kasaragod when Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath came to inaugurate the Vijay Yatra. It was shame on Pinarayi Vijayan to give permission for the protest meeting, she said. Political violence The Union Finance Minister said the law-and-order situation had worsened in the State and political violence had become rampant. She said the Centre had extended copious support to the State though there was no BJP MP from the State in the Lok Sabha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-a-haven-for-fundamentalists-sitaraman/article33958002.ece

01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||For Sriperumbudur electors, traffic congestion is the biggest headache||The Sriperumbudur constituency straddles 132 villages in Kancheepuram district. It gets its name from Sriperumbudur village, which is soaked in ancient Vaishnavite tradition and houses the temple of Saint Ramanuja. The area has seen a rapid growth in industrialisation because of the establishment of numerous industrial complexes, including SIPCOT. The constituency also has a large residential population and numerous educational institutions. But traffic congestion remains a big issue. The main grievance of the residents is that the lack of flyovers at important junctions on the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway causes heavy traffic congestion in and around Sriperumbudur. In the last decade or so, the constituency has gained prominence for its industrial estates and the rapid urbanisation around the various villages. Heavy vehicles are causing severe traffic congestion. The foremost demand of residents and industrialists, which remains unfulfilled for more than a decade, has been the construction of a flyover at the trijunction of the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway, Kundrathur-Sriperumbudur Road and Perumalpattu Road linking Oragadam and Kancheepuram. It is one of the heavily congested and accident-prone junctions located near the city. The traffic police have also highlighted the need to post a minimum of four personnel to regulate the traffic there round the clock. T. Sukumar, a resident of Kundrathur, says the trijunction bears with heavy traffic during the peak hours. Vehicles are piling up for more than half-a-kilometre. Several accidents occur here daily, keeping the traffic policemen on their toes, Mr. Sukumar added. Those working in the industrial units rue the time wasted in traffic jams between Sriperumbudur and Sunguvarchatram. The trijunction is prone to accidents. As the facilities are poor at the Sriperumbudur Government Hospital, accident victims are often referred to the government hospitals at Chengalpattu or Chennai, leading to loss of lives, say residents. The reserved constituency has good sources of water, including the Chembarambakkam lake, but they suffer from poor renovation and upkeep. N. Ayappan, a resident of Manimangalam, is all praise for the paving of roads in certain areas. But he is upset at the poor maintenance of a number of lakes. The Manimangalam lake was renovated at a cost of Rs. 2 crore. But a portion of the renovated embankment gave way. The timely steps taken by the Water Resources Department and the villagers helped to prevent disastrous flooding last year, he says. Industrialist S. Thyagarajan has a unit that makes automobile accessories in the SIPCOT complex at Irungattukottai. He says thousands of employees working at the factories in and around Sriperumbudur have been affected by lack of public transport. He wants the government to extend Metro Rail and more bus services to Sriperumbudur. He also wants the second airport project restarted and the toll gate shifted to Sunguvarchatram, besides the Chennai-Bengaluru industrial corridor project fast-tracked. Mr. Thyagarajan says the industrial units are willing to take part in the renovation of lakes for supply of potable water. Sanction accorded Sriperumbudur MLA K. Palani says sanction has been given for widening the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway, and the work on a flyover at the trijunction will begin once the road is widened. Taking credit for improving over 100 roads in various villages, Mr. Palani says three important roads, which had never been developed until 2016, have been paved. “The roads from Somangalam to Chetpattu, from Padappai to Orathur and from Madambakkam to Kavanoor were developed during my tenure.” He says that since the residents bank on bus transport and given the area’s religious importance, direct bus services were increased from Sriperumbudur to Kundrathur, Perungalathur, Iyappanthangal, Thiruvanmiyur, Tambaram, Vadapalani, Poonamallee and Avadi.  Thousands of employees working at factories in the area have been affected by lack of public transport. The government should extend Metro Rail to Sriperumbudur S.

01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CM enacting social justice drama: Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday accused Chief Minister Edapppadi K. Palaniswami of enacting “social justice drama” for the purpose of electoral gains. “He (CM) never uttered a word when the BJP government deprived the backward classes of their rights in education and employment opportunities. Now he is enacting a social justice drama and people should realise it,” he said while participating in the ‘Stalin in your constituency’ programme in Chennai. Earlier in the day, he submitted his application in the party office to contest from Kolathur Assembly constituency again. Mr. Stalin said social justice could not be protected through “half-baked” announcement. “After the DMK forms the government, social justice will be achieved for all,” he said. The Chief Minister’s “unilateral announcements” lacked real commitment, Mr. Stalin. It never occurred to the Chief Minister to make them before the DMK made them, he pointed out. Recalling Mr. Palaniswami’s assertion that the DMK president cannot defeat the AIADMK even in his many births, Mr. Stalin said there was no need for him to take another birth since Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam had eaten away the party like the termites. “He locked the AIADMK office after Ms. Sasikala was released from jail and he also closed Jayalalithaa’s memorial because of fear,” Mr. Stalin said. After getting elected, the DMK would fulfil the demands of the people in 100 days. “We will create a separate department to deal with the petitions submitted by the people,” he said.   After the DMK forms the government, social justice will be achieved for all||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-enacting-social-justice-drama-stalin/article33958193.ece
01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Retail sector showing signs of revival post lockdown||When the lockdown was announced in March 2020, the retail sector in Tamil Nadu, including textile and consumer brands, took a severe hit with business falling immediately by 25%. A year down the line, those at the helm of the retail outlets have realigned their strategies, embraced technology and learnt to operate with minimal workforce. Business is now 80% up when compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. “Retail has bounced back much more strongly in non-metros. Non-metros are at 80% pre-COVID levels while it was closer to 65% in metros. Malls are still facing a challenge in comparison to high street stores,” said Suhail Sattar, chairman of the Chennai Chapter of the Retail Association of India and co-founder of Hasbro Clothing. Mr. Sattar said the lockdown had taught lessons like the need for multi-channel approach and scaling up investment in online and digital as medium. Four textile retailers whom The Hindu spoke to said they were earlier conservative when it came to online business but the pandemic had changed their perception. “Post the lifting of lockdown, we have strengthened our online team and are following up consistently. At present, 2% of our businesses happen through online and the aim now is to sell 20% online,” said P.A. Ravindran, general manager of The Chennai Silks. K. Sivakumar, managing director of RmKV Silks, said, “We have touched 90% of our business – the weddings during the Tamil month of Thai helped us. We will get back our normal business by May or June.” But consumers were conscious about spending and casual shopping was not happening, he said. In the electronics segment, footfalls had increased across markets and people were ready to spend on branded products considering they spent more time at home and they needed an upgrade. “Brands have realised that lower and longer EMIs will help consumer upgrade/buy home appliances. An AC can be bought through EMI at just Rs. 2,999 which was not the case earlier at 0% interest and with additional gifts/warranty/cash backs,” said Vishal Bysani, vice-president – marketing of Viveks. Mr. Bysani said a few segments such as large screen television sets, dishwashers and washing machines were witnessing buoyancy in sales with a growth of 50-200%. Vijay Vasanth, CEO of Vasanth and Co, said that business in second tier cities had been good. But the outlets in malls had been doing business at 50 to 60% of the pre-COVID-19 levels. A retailer in a mall selling luggage and bags said after travel restrictions, his business had been down by 70%. “It would take at least another year for us to revive. We are considering closing one of our branches,” he said. Munish Khanna, chief revenue officer of Express Avenue, said luxury and super premium brands were doing well. “Many new films are slated for summer release. When that happens, people will come out of the OTT and come to multiplexes and this will increase retail sales,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/retail-showing-signs-of-revival-post-lockdown/article33958199.ece
01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Looking beyond traditional forms of schooling||The COVID-19 pandemic has forced several parents in Chennai to consider alternate methods of schooling. Interest has surged in new initiatives based on a learner-centric approach, and in home-schooling, especially for younger learners. Sharanya Dilip and Srikanth Chandrasekaran, founders of The Learning Community at Quest, have started The Unschooling Project, an all-day programme based on self-directed learning. They say parents have shown a lot of interest in their programme, wherein the learning goals of children are prioritised. They meet parents every weekend and talk about what The Unschooling Project offers. “The definition of home-schooling has always been limited to the idea that the parents take the entire responsibility. But here we will be the bridge for the working parents who want their children to shift from mainstream boards,” Mr. Srikanth says. Subject experts work with them as resource persons and the learners can pick subjects ranging from animation to paleontology. “If the first half of their day is dedicated to these classes, the second part can have documentary screenings, workshops, or other group activities,” Ms. Sharanya says. The learners may work with digital tools or with teachers, depending on how they choose to navigate the architecture of the chosen subject. While they work with learners virtually now, they will start working out of their physical resource centre once schools reopen. While schools have reopened for Classes 9-12, there is no word yet on when the classes will resume for younger learners. “We’ve had 14 learners join us during the lockdown, and are speaking to 30 learners about what we offer,” says Raaji Naveen, who, along with Naveen Mahesh, founded Beyond 8 in Chennai. Beyond 8 takes in learners above the age of 14 (or after grade 8). It has adopted a learner-determined approach to education. A curriculum is chosen on the basis of the learners’ interests. They are then assigned a mentor and a coach and learn with their peers, who are part of the programme. “We offer programmes tailored to multiple curricula, and our teachers are experts in the subjects that the students pick. For instance, we have a chartered accountant to teach accountancy,” Ms. Raaji says. Vidya Shankar, founder of Cascade Montessori Resource Centre, says adopting an alternate education model is not rocket science for parents who put the developmental needs of their children first. “The pandemic has encouraged parents, especially those of young learners, to think beyond schools.” Cascade was started 10 years ago as a home-schooling cooperative. Instead of having children at home, this initiative brings parents and children together to pool in their resources. “This paved the way for a new model nearly a decade ago. In the last 10 months, the parents of several young children have been enquiring with us about how our system works,” Ms. Shankar says.

01 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||A tale of a region and time||Not many professors among Tamils have taken to literary creative writing. P. Sundaram Pillai, Mu Varadarajan and Indira Parthasarathy are among those who belong to this club. A specialist in bio-physics, P.K. Ponnuswamy, former Vice- Chancellor of University of Madras and Madurai Kamaraj University, is an aspirant to be part of such a league. Having roots in the western belt (called in Tamil “Kongu” zone), Prof. Ponnuswamy has now come out with his third novel,Thirumurthi Mann(Soil of Thirumurthi) which captures the social, cultural and economic changes in a rural part of the belt in the light of Tiruppur emerging as a new industrial hub. The work, brought out by NCBH publication, is an extension of his earlier novel,Padukalam. It covers the events in the lives of a host of people over 50 years, ending with 1985. As far as the 82-year-old author is concerned, his experiences in the most impressionable part of his life are fresh in his memory and he has brought them out through the work, which is characterised by the Kongu dialect. The period and the region, apart from the factor of familiarity for the author, are significant for the reason that there had been no major caste conflicts during the period in question in the region, known for having two evenly-balanced intermediate castes in terms of resources and social standing. The determination of women to carry on with their lives despite suffering misery is an important feature of the work, Mr. Ponnuswamy adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-tale-of-a-region-and-time/article33958266.ece
01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||What is ethanol-blended petrol? Should we be concerned?||Recently, fuel outlets began placing banners stating that the petrol they sell contains ethanol, which is a bio-fuel obtained primarily from sugarcane. This blending is being done by the oil marketing companies in their terminals. There have been reports of vehicle owners questioning presence of water in the petrol, especially down south in the State. Here are a few frequent question and answers pertaining to ethanol-blended petrol. What is ethanol? It is the organic compound Ethyl Alcohol which is produced from biomass. It is also an ingredient in alcoholic beverages. It has a higher octane number than gasoline, hence improves the petrol octane number. Ethanol has insignificant amount of water in it. Will blending ethanol with petrol have any effect on the vehicle’s pick up? It will not have any effect. Since ethanol contains oxygen, it is supposed to help in complete combustion of fuel, resulting in lower emissions. Where and how is the ethanol blended? Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. blends ethanol at its terminals at Tiruchi, Coimbatore, Salem and Madurai. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd blends the bio-fuel with petrol at its terminal in Chennai, while Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. in terminals in Chennai and Karur. A stream of ethanol stored in a tank is loaded through a separate pumping and metering mechanism into the petrol loading arm at terminals. Where does Tamil Nadu get ethanol from? Mainly from Maharashtra and Karnataka. There are some suppliers from Tamilnadu but the quantity is not much. The State-run oil marketing companies do not have any bio-fuel plants in the State. What is the percentage of ethanol that is blended? From April 2020 – January 2021, the blending percentage in Tamil Nadu has been 1.91% per litre. It increased to 6.73% in January 2021, as against the target of 10% per litre. How much does ethanol cost? A litre of ethanol currently costs Rs. 61. But its price depends on internal fuel prices. There is however no change in the price of petrol or motor spirit, as it is called, due to ethanol blending. The consumer pays for a litre of petrol only. Does ethanol leave behind water? Petroleum dealers have been asked to adhere to quality checks. There is no issue in case such checks are conducted and proper procedures followed. Ethanol has an insignificant amount of water in it and if the mix is as stipulated it does not do any harm. Since ethanol is blended in the terminal itself, there is no chance that it will separate from the petrol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/what-is-ethanol-blended-petrol-should-we-be-concerned/article33958201.ece
01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Allow Divya Prabhandham recitation at Kanchi temple’||A section of devotees of Sri Varadharaja Perumal Temple in Kancheepuram have urged the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) department and the police to ensure that the Naalayira Divya Prabhandham is chanted before the idol of the Lord daily. With a difference of opinion rising between two sections of devotees over the chanting of certain slokas during the Prabhandham , the practice of chanting it even during regular pujas had been stopped, said a devotee. “The Ramanuja Dhayapaathram cannot be chanted anywhere in Kancheepuram town. It is a High Court order. Only the Srisailesha Dhayapaathram can be chanted along with the Prabhandham . But one section of devotees is chanting that sloka on purpose and creating a ruckus. As a result of which the processions during festivals, including Ratha Sapthami and Maasi Maham, did not have Prabhandham chanting,” said Ramanujam, a devotee. Opposition to recitation Ranganathan, another devotee, said unfortunately the HR and CE officials and the police remain silent when a section of devotees do not allow the Divya Prabhandham Ghosthi to perform its sevai to the Lord. “The Lord here is also known as Aruli Cheyal Piththan , meaning He loves listening to the Prabhandham, which is why  it is a must as per traditions during the daily pujas and on special occasions” Mr. Ranganathan said. Sources in the department said that they had tried several rounds of discussions and peace talks and even tried reasoning out with the two sections. However, nobody listens to them. “They accuse some officials of siding with one section, which is untrue. Even the Collector has issued orders that the High Court order must be followed. We keep telling the devotees to follow the tradition, but they don’t,” said an official source.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allow-divya-prabhandham-recitation-at-kanchi-temple/article33958616.ece

The clarification comes in the wake of reports that appeared in a section of the media. A spokesperson for the Kalpakkam nuclear plant said the news being circulated by a section of television media, linking the Kalpakkam Nuclear Installation Local Authority (NILA) writing to the Registration Department on regulating sale of lands in 14 villages to the threat of a leak, was false. The spokesperson pointed out that the land mafia was engaged in converting agricultural lands around the nuclear plants into housing plots, which was not permissible. The official said as per the guidelines, urbanisation around the nuclear plant would not be allowed, and hence, the NILA committee was engaged in controlling the land usage pattern by issuing guidelines to the local authority. The spokesperson of the Kalpakkam nuclear complex said the land cartel was trying to divert the attention of the people by spreading rumours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kalpakkam-power-plant-is-safe/article33958182.ece

01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Patient advocacy groups seek more funds for treatment of rare diseases||On Rare Diseases Day which fell on Sunday, stakeholders demanded more funds for treatment of patients afflicted with known rare diseases, besides more research. According to the Indian Society for Clinical Research, there are 7,000 known rare diseases that have affected 300 million people across the globe. Of them, 70 million are in India, and most have no or very limited treatment options. Society president Chirag Trivedi said one in 20 persons would live with a rare disease at some point in life. A large number of patients had no access to appropriate diagnosis or treatment. “This should be a wake-up call for clinical researchers,” he said. Focus on research could reduce the cost for healthcare systems and improve the quality of life of patients and their families, he said. Patient advocacy groups and health experts have appealed to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to allocate money for treatment of patients diagnosed with treatable rare genetic disorders. The International Gaucher Alliance and the Organisation of Rare Diseases India have separately moved the Health Ministry for a corpus of Rs. 100 crore for treatment of those diagnosed with disorders like lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have provided proof of funding from their own health budgets for diagnosis and treatment of treatable genetic conditions such as Pompe disease, Gaucher disease and MPS1, according to Prasanna Shirol, co-founder and executive director, Organisation of Rare Diseases India. Manjit Singh, national president, LSD Support Society, said nearly 190 patients, mostly diagnosed with LSDs, had registered themselves with the Rare Disease Cell of the Union Health Ministry in the last three years for treatment support. “Some of them have already lost their lives for lack of timely support,” he said, urging the government to work out a national policy and introduce a sustainable funding mechanism. In March 2020, in response to a public interest litigation petition, the Madras High Court directed the Union government to pay Rs. 4.4 crore for treatment of rare disease patients in Tamil Nadu and instructed the State government to allocate Rs. 5 crore for treatment of 11 rare disease patients in the State. The Health Department of each of the three States has urged the Union government for a matching grant to sustain the programme. An official of the Tamil Nadu government said the State had received Rs. 4.4 crore from the Union government, and the sum had been deposited in the account concerned to be used for treatment.  One in 20 persons would live with a rare disease at some point in life. A large number of patients have no access to appropriate diagnosis or treatment||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/patient-advocacy-groups-seek-more-funds-for-treatment-of-rare-diseases/article33958166.ece
01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two arrested in Aminjikarai murder||The police have arrested two persons in connection with the alleged murder of a 47-year-old woman and an attack on her daughter in Aminjikarai on Friday. The suspects have been identified as Anthony and Balaji of Pulianthope and they have previous cases against them. The two have been remanded in judicial custody. According to the police, Jayanthi lived with her husband Kamala Kannan, a driver and financier, and her daughter Monica at Vellala Street, Aminjikarai. Monika is a final year engineering student and has been working in a BPO during the lockdown period as the college was closed. Monika was sleeping in her room, when she felt someone strangling her. When she opened her eyes, she realised that a man was trying to kill her. He stabbed her with a knife on her face and hands and fled the spot. When she tried to chase him, she reportedly spotted another man attacking her mother with a weapon. As she raised an alarm, the two fled the spot. The police are investigating the motive behind the murder. “It is suspected that they came to loot the house based on information provided by an informant. We are trying to nab him also,” said an officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-arrested-in-aminjikarai-murder/article33958176.ece
01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||TNERC notifies regulation for installing safety devices||The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) has recently added a safety regulation to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Distribution Code. It calls for erecting a residual current-operated device (RCD) in every consumer’s electrical installation to avert accidents. RCD embraces all types of residual current circuit breaker (RCCB). RCD not exceeding 30 milliampere (mA) shall be provided for protection against electric shock in all consumer installations. For large installations with 10 kilo watt and above, RCD with 300 mA shall be provided for protection against fire and electric shock, according to the gazette notification. When a person comes into contact with a piece of equipment having leakage of current exceeding 30 mA, he will be electrocuted, said A.S. Kandasamy, former Chief Engineer, TNEB, and Member, State Advisory Committee, TNERC. He said the PVC cables in an electrical installation can sometimes split, crack, or even heat up at tension points, resulting in the leakage of current. “If the leakage goes beyond 300 mA, there is an almost instant spark that can ignite any flammable object nearby,” Mr. Kandasamy said. He pointed out that fatal accidents and ignition of fire due to leakage could not be prevented by rewireable fuses and miniature circuit breakers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tnerc-notifies-regulation-for-installing-safety-devices/article33958204.ece
01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Government doctors to resume agitation||The Federation of Government Doctors Association has decided to resume its agitation to press for pay band 4 at 12 years of service, among other demands. Association members said they had staged dharnas and a black badge demonstration, observed a hunger strike and suspended services. But they ended the protest on the Health Department’s assurance and in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though they had risked their lives by treating COVID-19 patients, the government let them down, they said. The government had announced a month’s incentive to COVID-19 frontline workers; a compensation of Rs. 2 lakh to doctors who contracted the infection; and Rs. 50 lakh to those who died of it. But it had not kept these promises, the Association said. Even the demand for a special ordinance to reserve 50% seats in postgraduate medical courses for service quota students had not been conceded, it said. The Association had demanded that the government conduct counselling for transfer and promotion in a transparent manner and restore the 600 doctor posts by correcting discrepancies in the government order. The Association, which represents around 18,000 doctors, said it had been highlighting these demands for the past four years; though the Health Secretary had assured it of action, nothing materialised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-doctors-set-to-resume-agitation/article33958177.ece
01 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Plea to vaccinate all diagnosed with cancer||In the next phase of the COVID-19 vaccination drive that starts on Monday, the Union government must consider including all persons diagnosed with cancer in the last five years, even if they are not under treatment and irrespective of age, said Abdul Ghafur, coordinator, Chennai Declaration on Antimicrobial Resistance and consultant, infectious diseases, Apollo Cancer Institute. The present guidelines for those in the age group of 45-60 include persons diagnosed with solid cancer on or after July 1, 2020, and those who are on any cancer therapy. In an appeal to the Secretary of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Rajesh Bhushan, and NITI Aayog member Vinod K. Paul, he said a 20-year-old leukemia patient was at a higher risk than a 60-year-old patient with diabetes and hypertension. He cited the guidelines of the European Society for Medical Oncology that recommended vaccination of all cancer patients on priority. A recent meeting of senior oncologists and oncology infection specialists from across the country made the same recommendation. Moreover, he said, the vaccine uptake was around 50% among healthcare workers and frontline workers, and a similar hesitancy could be expected from the public in the next phase. Hence, he argued that vaccinating all cancer patients would help to accelerate the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-vaccinate-all-diagnosed-with-cancer/article33958170.ece

The TWAD Board that draws the water to supply to Coimbatore Corporation for the latter to distribute to resident in around 30 wards said the water would be sufficient to meet the city’s need till May end. The Board sources said the organisation had started drawing 80 million litres a day (MLD) from the Reservoir. Last year during the same time it had drawn around 100 MLD. The increased withdrawal last year had resulted in shortage of water during May. This year, to avoid recurrence of such a situation, the Board had reduced supply by around 20 MLD. From the 80 MLD the Board withdrew from the Reservoir, it apportioned six to 7 MLD to wayside habitation and another five MLD to Kuniamuthur. This left Board with 68 MLD to supply to the Corporation. By drawing 68 MLD or thereabout, the reduction in level would be five to six cm a day and that would be sufficient for the Board to help the Corporation maintain water supply till May end. The sources also said that the reduction in water level would not be uniform and that the reduction in level would be more as water level kept coming down because the Reservoir was saucer shaped, with circumference increasing from bottom to top. They also clarified that though the newly commissioned Siruvani water supply scheme for Kuniamuthur mentioned drawing 35 MLD, the Board would not be supplying as much quantity now. It was the designed quantity of the commissioned scheme and to be supplied at least a decade from now. The sources further said that with the Board commissioning an water supply improvement scheme for Kavundampalayam, Vadavalli and Veerakeralam, the pressure on Corporation to supply Siruvani water to those areas would come down. In short, the Corporation would have enough water to supply to the residents this summer, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/twad-board-confident-of-supplying-siruvani-water-till-may-end/article33958207.ece

Karthik has urged the Election Commission of India to rescind the orders. In a statement, Mr. Karthik alleged that after the poll conduct came into force on February 26, the Corporation had on February 27 issued back-dated orders to transfer seven assistant commissioners and three administrative officers. The transfer of assistant commissioners and administrative officers would not help the smooth conduct of election, which was only a little more than a month away. The Coimbatore Corporation had issued the transfer orders at the behest of the ruling party, which misused its powers. This had cast doubts over the free and fair conduct of election. This was only a continuation of what one had witnessed during the AIADMK regime, Mr. Karthik said and added it had become a routine to transfer honest officers or place in them compulsory wait or post them to a junior position. The transfer orders were against the Model Code of Conduct. The Election Commission should take note of those orders and issue necessary instructions to the Corporation to undo the transfers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-wants-transfer-orders-rescinded/article33958208.ece

01 March 2021||KARAIKAL,TAMIL NADU||‘Congress is disintegrating due to dynastic leadership’||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said the Congress party was disintegrating across the country, including in Puducherry, due to dynastic leadership. Speaking at a public meeting organised by the BJP at Karaikal, Mr. Shah appealed to the electorate to strengthen Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hands and exercise their franchise in favour of the BJP-led NDA in Puducherry in the upcoming election. Accusing former Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy of having indulged in “rampant corruption” during his term, Mr. Shah alleged that he served the Gandhi family instead of working for the people of Puducherry. Though the Prime Minister wanted to make Puducherry a modern region and had sanctioned at least 115 schemes aimed at its overall development since 2014, the Congress government, led by Mr. Narayanasamy, indulged in “petty politics”, fearing that the implementation of the schemes would not serve him or his party, the BJP leader alleged. Mr. Shah said the former Chief Minister “blatantly lied” to his leader, Rahul Gandhi, while translating the grievances of the people during an interaction recently. Claiming that merit was seldom recognised in the Congress, Mr. Shah alleged that Mr. Narayanasamy was made the Chief Minister of the Union Territory, overlooking Mr. Namassivayam (who recently joined the BJP), only because Mr. Narayanasamy “fell at the feet of the Gandhi family”. Asserting that the Centre had done a lot for Puducherry, Mr. Shah cited the allocation of Rs. 15,000 crore for executing various development schemes. However, Mr. Narayanasamy failed to put the amount to good use, he added. The unemployment rate was high in Puducherry, Mr. Shah said, assuring that the BJP-led NDA, if elected to power, would bring it down. The Congress had promised to establish an Information Technology Park and an Electronics Park during the previous election, Mr. Shah said, seeking to know if these promises had been fulfilled. The Centre brought Puducherry under the Udan scheme with a view to boosting tourism and providing air connectivity to Bengaluru and Hyderabad. It also implemented schemes in the fisheries sector, allocating Rs. 20,000 crore to augment infrastructure and provide employment to over 50 lakh people. Puducherry also benefited under this scheme, he said, adding that many fishermen had availed themselves of the Rs. 40 lakh subsidy given by the Centre for buying new mechanised boats to carry out deep sea fishing under the Blue Revolution Scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cong-disintegrating-due-to-dynastic-leadership/article33958196.ece
01 March 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Third front idea may work in BJP’s favour in Tamil Nadu: Chidambaram||The idea of a third front in Tamil Nadu may go in favour of the BJP and, hence, those behind it should have a rethink, said senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram here on Sunday. Speaking at a booth committee workers’ meeting, he said the third front may be an advantage to the BJP and its allies in the general election. The BJP should be chased out of Tamil Nadu. Only a powerful party in position in the State would not heed to the threats and pressures of the BJP in the Centre. Hence, the electorate should vote for Congress and DMK allies in the ensuing election. When single-day polling was being held in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, which accounted for 407 Assembly Constituencies, what was the need for conducting eight-phase polls for West Bengal, which had 298 Assembly Constituencies. When the ECI was questioned, there was no answer, he said. Asked to comment on the reported remarks by BJP leader H. Raja that any vote against his party in Tamil Nadu, the Centre would not sanction funds for projects, Mr. Chidambaram said it was against the Constitution. The ECI should take note of it and act. “The BJP is a party ‘purchasing’ elected representatives by the people in a democratic country. This is not Manipur or Goa. The people of Tamil Nadu will elect the DMK and its allies. Any attempts to destabilise or purchase the MLAs [DMK after polls] will not work here,” he claimed. The senior Congress leader said the party had made a request to the DMK to allot the Sivaganga Assembly Constituency to the Congress. The AIADMK was releasing advertisements in the media claiming to be Vetrinadai Podum Thamizhagam (victorious TN) whereas it was only Vetrunadai Podum Thamizhagam (empty TN). Making an announcement for gold loan waiver under Rule 110 in the Assembly was a gross violation. Without earmarking even a single rupee in the budget, making announcements was nothing but mockery. He described the diesel/petrol price hike as ‘daylight robbery’. Exams for students could have been held at least after the pollshad been completed, as they played a major role in assessment, Mr. Chidambaram added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/third-front-idea-may-work-in-bjps-favour-in-tn-chidambaram/article33958290.ece
01 March 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Third front may favour BJP, says Chidambaram||A third front in Tamil Nadu may favour the BJP, said senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram here on Sunday and asked those behind the idea to reconsider it. Speaking at a booth-committee workers’ meeting, he said the third front may be an advantage to the BJP and its allies in the election. The BJP should be chased out of Tamil Nadu. Only a powerful party in position in T.N. would reject the threats and pressures of the BJP. People should, therefore, vote for the Congress and DMK allies. When single-day polling was being held for Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, which accounted for 407 Assembly constituencies, what was the need for conducting eight-phase polls for West Bengal, which had 298 Assembly constituencies, he asked. On the reported remarks of BJP leader H. Raja that if any vote went against the BJP in Tamil Nadu, the Centre would not sanction funds for projects, Mr. Chidambaram said it was against the Constitution and the EC should take action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/third-front-may-favour-bjp-says-chidambaram/article33958187.ece

01 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Home truths dawn on young minds||Sunday saw a steady stream of people visiting Gomespalayam near Arapalayam where a photo exhibition was going on. The residents here are mostly conservancy workers or manual scavengers. Photographs clicked by their children which showed their parents at work were on display. The exhibition was organised by Dr. Ambedkar Free Evening Children’s Tuition Centre. A total of 180 photos clicked by 11 children were on display. M. Palanikumar, a freelance photographer who focuses on manual scavenging, conducted free photography classes for the children for 15 days. “After the classes, the children were given DSLR cameras to document the lives of their parents at work,” he said. R. Sankareswari, a resident of Gomespalayam who teaches free classes through the tuition centre, said the children learned more about their parents’ job through this activity. “They all woke up early and travelled to places where their parents collect garbage and clean septic tanks. They learnt how their parents work without proper safety gear. Two children even broke down when they were sharing their experiences,” she said. “The activity will be helpful for the children - to understand the importance of education and not to be forced into the conservancy work, a job associated with our community,” she said. New perspectives Mr. Palanikumar said he learnt new perspectives from the photographs clicked by the children. “When I click pictures of manual scavengers, it is usually with sympathy. But the pictures clicked by these children show their way of life inside their small cramped houses,” he said. He also highlighted that deaths due to manual scavenging was increasing and was often underreported. A Akshaya Shri, a Class 11 student, said she learnt how difficult it was to be a conservancy worker. “Our parents work too hard every day to ensure that we get good education,” she said.

01 March 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Ignorance of rules, major cause for road accidents’||In a significant order passed recently, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that it was high time the stakeholders had a rethink on fixing the blame on drivers of big vehicles in road accidents involving big and small vehicles. The court said that despite penal laws and awareness programmes, people had not changed. The court said that every road user owes a duty of care and caution and was duty-bound to drive his vehicle in such a way not to endanger themselves and more importantly pedestrians, cyclists, two-wheeler riders and other vehicle users. There was a need for a campaign to enlighten public on rules and penalties, say advocates and RTO Officials. The court had pointed out that as per statistics available for the past two years, in 2018, India ranked first in road accidents among 199 countries. There were 4.67 lakh accidents - those involving two-wheelers alone accounted for 35.2%, the highest in all categories of vehicles. It is pertinent to note that in India, Tamil Nadu stood first in the number of accidents. In 2019, there were 4.37 lakh accidents - 38% involving two-wheelers. “One of the best ways to create awareness is to put up signboards at key junctions. Information on rules and penalties are on display at Regional Transport Offices. If they are also displayed at prime spots, they will better serve the purpose,” said advocate S. Srinivasa Raghavan. Corporates could sponsor the signboards through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative, he said. Concurring with his suggestion, an official of the Regional Transport Office said signboards could be placed at bus stands, railway stations, airports and other public places to create awareness of the traffic rules among the public in a more effective way. Major violations Signal jumping, drunk driving, overspeeding, overloading, non-usage of helmets and seatbelts and using mobile phones while driving are the major traffic violations, the official said. “Speeding and overtaking on the wrong side are the major reasons for accidents,” he said. While strict enforcement of rules will bring down traffic violations, people must start practising road safety precautions on their own volition. “There are many posts lying vacant in the RTOs, which makes it difficult to ensure strict enforcement of rules. Hence, placing boards on the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act at public places is the first step in creating awareness among the public,” he said.  Signboards with information on rules and penalties must be displayed at prime spots  S. Srinivasa Raghavan Advocate||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ignorance-of-rules-the-major-root-cause-of-road-accidents/article33958481.ece

01 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC tells tribunal to number petition||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Tribunal in Virudhunagar to number a claim petition. It observed that the tribunal had failed to number the petition after it wrongly interpreted a High Court order. The court was hearing the petition filed by Senthil Kumar and two others from Virudhunagar who sought a direction to number the claim petition before the tribunal. The petition was returned by the tribunal. Justice R. Subramanian observed that a Division Bench of the court held that when there was an accident involving two vehicles, and both vehicles coud be said to have contributed to the accident, it was for the claimants to implead the owners of both motor vehicles. “It is this judgment, which had been wrongly relied upon by the tribunal, while numbering the petition. The claimants have been required to implead the owner of the two-wheeler for the death of whom compensation has been sought for. I fail to understand that as to how a deceased person can be impleaded as a party to the proceedings,” the judge said.. Therefore, the return of the claim petition was set aside and the tribunal concerned directed to number the petition without insisting upon impleading of a dead person to an action before the court of law, the judge said. The Division Bench had directed tribunals in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry not to number any of the claim petitions without impleading the other vehicle which was also involved in the accident. However, the court made it clear that it would not apply to cases of hit and run where the tortfeasor could not be possible of identification. The tribunals were expected to insist the claimant to array the driver and owner of the other vehicle stated to be involved in the accident as party before numbering the claim petition, the court had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-tells-tribunal-to-number-petition/article33958291.ece

01 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||MP returns letter addressed to him in Hindi to Minister||Terming the practice of sending letters in Hindi without English translation to elected representatives in non-Hindi speaking States as provocative and violation of the Official Language Implementation Act, Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has returned a letter written in Hindi to the Ministry of Culture. In a strongly-worded letter to Minister of State (independent charge) Prahlad Singh Patel, Ministry of Culture, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP said, “Officials of the Ministry of Culture should have the sensitivity on issues keeping in mind the multi-cultural and multi-lingual heritage of the country.” Recalling that he had, in the past, received letters in Hindi from other Union Ministries, the MP said that he had approached the High Court on the issue and the Government of India had expressed regret and assured that future communications would be in English only. ‘Must be deliberate’ Mr. Venkatesan raised doubt that the approach was deliberate on part of the Centre to implement their project of imposing Sanskrit and Hindi on people of non-Hindi speaking States, particularly Tamil Nadu. It might be resorted to repeatedly with the hope that MPs of non-Hindi speaking States would become tired and reconcile to it. “But I want to emphatically state that Tamil Nadu has unique history of fighting such attempts to impose Hindi and many sacrifices were also made. Hence, we will not get tired and fight out the attempts to weaken our resolve to uphold our identity and great culture,” the MP said. Stating that the letter in Hindi was in violation of law of the land and assurance given by the Centre to the High Court, Mr. Venkatesan said it amounted to contempt of court. Sending back the letter, he appealed to the Minister to advise the officials not to resort to such provocative measures in future. Mr. Venkatesan said that he could infer from the format (in English) enclosed with the letter that it was asking the MPs to make recommendations for “Gandhi Peace Prize.”  It is resorted to repeatedly with the hope that MPs of non-Hindi speaking States would become tired and reconcile to it Su.

01 March 2021||Perambalur,TAMIL NADU||New cotton variety enhances productivity||Cotton farmers in Perambalur-Ariyalur belt are able to see higher productivity through cultivation of CO17 variety released by the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The farmers could get a yield of 24 to 28 quintals per hectare, and were also able to produce seeds on their own, under the guidance of TNAU's Cotton Research Station at Veppanthattai in Perambalur district. This variety was also suitable for mechanical harvesting. S. Somasundaram, Associate Professor and Head of the Research Station, said the cotton crop was being raised in about 50,000 hectares in Ariyalur and Perambalur districts. The main problem in cotton production used to be low productivity and absence of mechanical harvesting. Farmers used to spend about 500 mandays for one acre. The CO17 variety with a duration of 135 days was ideal since there was no side branching, and was suitable for mechanical harvesting and high-density planting wherein one lakh plants are raised per hectare, Prof. Somasundaram said. This kind of planting was suitable for mechanised weeding with power tiller, sub-surface drip irrigation and also use of machines for harvesting, Prof. Somasundaram said. These aspects were explained thoroughly to farmers during the Field Day conducted by the Research Station recently. The farmers were told that it was very important to reduce vegetative growth for high-density planting. Interacting with the farmers, K. Sakthiel, Assistant Professor, Plant Breeding and Genetics, explained about the architecture of the plant and said the crop was suitable for rainfed, summer irrigated, winter irrigated condition, and to sustain drought. Suresh, a farmer participant who had been cultivating Bt cotton for a decade, had switched over to high-yielding CO17 variety as it was fruitful.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-cotton-variety-enhances-productivity/article33958271.ece

01 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Efforts on step up coverage in phase 2 of vaccination drive||As the second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination programme broadens in scope to target beneficiaries, including persons above 60 and those above 45 with comorbidities from Monday, health authorities are looking for ways to improve the dismal immunisation coverage. Since, the vaccination drive began in Puducherry, 10,329 personnel, including 9,589 healthcare workers, have undergone immunisation. Vaccination for healthcare personnel has been on for 28 days while the drive has been on for 17 days for frontline workers. “Now that the vaccination will be available to the public on a walk-in basis at any of the 17 government-run facilities, we hope that the programme picks up pace,” said S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health Services. Senior citizens can visit any facility with documentary proof of age and those above 45 years can produce a certificate of their medical condition to get themselves vaccinated. At present, only about 33% of the targeted population has been administered the first dose. And, of this, barely 25% have completed their second dose. “What this means, that as a society, a significant proportion of the population, including those who have been vaccinated with the first dose, remain vulnerable as it takes about two weeks after the second shot for the body to develop full immunity protection to the virus,” Dr. Mohan Kumar said. There is also a new urgency in getting vaccinated in the wake of reports of a second wave of COVID-19 in several States, he pointed out. Officials also pointed out that since the roll out of the vaccination programme in the country, reports of adverse reactions have been negligible and hopefully more people overcome their misplaced fears of getting a jab in the second phase. The Health Department, which had received a consignment of 81,000 doses, now has a stock of 70,000 doses. As part of efforts to boost immunisation coverage, health officials have been asking all medical colleges, including private institutions, to get their staff administered vaccines. At least four committees across different levels of administration are holding consultations regularly to devise methods to improve vaccination coverage in the Union Territory. Recently, a high-powered panel chaired by Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has been constituted. The 22-member panel has been specifically formed to monitor and upscale vaccination activities and control measures across the Union Territory. Ahead of the roll out of phase 2 vaccination, the Centre has held a meeting with all States and Union Territories to review progress of the drives with a focus on improving pace. They were advised to expand vaccination sessions to all public healthcare facilities along with CGHS & PM-JAY empanelled hospitals from March. According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, while Rajasthan, Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have vaccinated over 75% of the registered healthcare and frontline workers for the first dose, Puducherry sits alongside the ones that have reported less than 50% coverage alongside Nagaland, Punjab and Chandigarh. In fact, the coverage of frontline workers has been abysmal in the close to three weeks it has been operational. Puducherry is among the eight States/Union Territories that have reported less than 25% coverage for the first dose. The post-vaccination hospitalisation events comprised 0.0004% of the total vaccinations. The fatalities (45 deaths) after vaccination comprised 0.0004%, while at the same time, no case of serious/severe AEFI/death had been attributable to vaccination, till date, the Ministry stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-on-step-up-coverage-in-phase-2-of-vaccination-drive/article33958586.ece

01 March 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||Listen to Tamils to win their hearts, Rahul tells Modi||Instead of dictating terms to Tamils, as he is doing to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should keep quiet and open his ears to win them over, as was done by late Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said. “Kamaraj listened to the people to evolve great ideas like mid-day meal scheme that feeds crores of poor students across the country. He has become the greatest leader to be remembered even now and won the hearts of Tamils. If you (Mr. Modi) want to win the hearts of Tamils, keep your mouth shut and open your ears to listen to them so that you can win over them,” he said. Stating that the Prime Minister was dictating terms to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Gandhi said that he cannot dictate terms to the people of Tamil Nadu. Mr. Gandhi was continuing his campaign in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts for the second day on Sunday. At Paavoorchathram in Tenkasi district, Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister should understand that the Tamils, their language and their culture should be respected. They would reciprocate with a lot of love. If Mr. Modi chose to dictate terms to them it would prove to be counterproductive. Charging him with thrusting the ‘one nation, one culture and one language’ formula, the Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister should learn to respect the culture of all States, all languages and all religions. Only that could take the country forward. The Congress leader also said the Chief Minister, instead of bowing his head in front of Mr. Modi because of his corrupt administration, should bow the head in front of Tamil Nadu with all humility to get their support. “If you are not ready for it, the people of Tamil Nadu will never vote for you as they are sure to remove the battery in the remote control unit in the hands of Mr. Modi,” Mr. Gandhi said. ‘Modi will be defeated’ Later, at Palayamkottai, Mr. Gandhi said the country had defeated the British empire 70 years ago to become an independent nation. Likewise, Mr. Modi too would be defeated by the people, he added. Addressing the ‘Educators’ Meet’ at St. Xavier’s College, where he interacted with the professors of various colleges, Mr. Gandhi said independent India was fighting a formidable enemy. The country, which had defeated a much bigger enemy 70 years ago, would repeat it, again through non-violence “People of the country sent the British back. The same way we will send him back to Nagpur (RSS headquarters)… We will do it without any hatred, anger and violence. They can do whatever to us. Abuse, kick and spit on our face. We will not do it back,” he said while answering a question on the introduction of New Education Policy. The NEP that was forced on the nation amid COVID-19 without any proper discussion in Parliament was aiming at promoting single ideology that would destroy the country’s education system. “Education, farming and healthcare should never be a commercial commodity as all these quality products should be made accessible to everyone,” Mr. Gandhi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/listen-to-tamils-to-win-their-hearts-rahul-tells-modi/article33958160.ece

01 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Chinna Eri has become the garbage dump of Thuraiyur||The Thuraiyur Chinna Eri has become the garbage dump of the town with plastic waste floating on what used to be an irrigation source for farmlands nearby. Passengers who alight at Thuraiyur bus stand which faces the lake are put off immediately by the sight of the polluted lake and the stench emanating from it. Residents living nearby and commercial establishments blame one another for the poor state of affairs, while authorities say they do take up regular desilting work. The lake used to be the centrepiece of the town, but now it is a symbol of shame for all of us, said M. Rajasekar, an autorickshaw driver who parks his vehicle by the lake. “There is a lot of water in the lake, but it is unfit for any purpose. Thuraiyur experiences water shortage every summer, but we have no hope of putting the lake to better use unless and until we learn to keep our surroundings clean,” he said. Waste from households, street vendors, roadside eateries and commercial establishments make their way into the lake. “These people stealthily come at night and dump the garbage into the lake. When they can make the effort to come all the way and dump it into the lake, why can’t they instead put it in a dustbin, or give it for recycling?” a flower vendor said. The lake poses a major health hazard. It has also become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. “We are just recovering from the COVID-19 scare. With the lake’s condition, we might fall ill from some other infection soon,” a passer-by said. With the lake located in the heart of the town, it reflects poorly on the civic body’s maintenance. However, municipal officials say it comes under the Public Works Department. “We have written to the PWD to desilt the lake. We are collecting waste from commercial establishments and residences regularly. We are unsure of the source of the waste dumped into the lake,” a senior official said.

01 March 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Political graffiti still blights public walls||Though, three days have passed after the model code of conduct was enforced, the political graffiti on public walls are yet to be removed or erased. Minutes after announcing the poll dates on Friday, Chief Electoral Officer Satyaprada Sahu said the model code of conduct had come into immediate effect. Election officials in Tiruchi swung into action and removed the portraits of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa from the offices of the State government. The portraits at Amma canteens were also removed. The political parties were asked to remove their graffiti on public walls such as government buildings, compound walls of government buildings, temples and other places. They were given a deadline of 48 hours to remove the graffiti. A tour through various parts of the city on Sunday indicated that most wall paintings by the AIADMK and the DMK on public walls had not been removed or erased. Paintings that had the images of Chief Minister Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam still remained. Similarly, graffiti with images of DMK president M .K. Stalin that had been put up for the DMK conference, which was eventually cancelled after the announcement of poll dates, had also not been removed. Election officials, who erased a few paintings on Saturday, were said to have slowed down the drive apparently expecting that the political parties concerned would step in. Similarly, flag posts of various political parties installed in public places, were also supposed to be removed. They are still found in thickly populated areas including Srirangam, Thiruvanaikoil, Woraiyur, Bheema Nagar, Varaganeri and East Boulevard Road. A senior election official in the district told The Hindu that the Election Commission had fixed a 48-hour deadline to remove graffiti on public walls. An action taken report would be sent to the Chief Electoral Office shortly. The political parties have been asked to remove flag posts and graffiti immediately. Otherwise, the officials would step in to remove and the expenditure for removing flag posts and graffiti would be collected from the political parties concerned, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/political-graffiti-still-blights-public-walls/article33958275.ece

A major burst on an underground main on Old Post Office Road at Bheema Nagar about three weeks ago had caused an overflow of sewage water on roads and in residential areas.

Virtually inaugurating Dhruva 2021, the flagship business and cultural fest of the institute, Mr. Silva said teamwork and the ability to learn from mistakes were vital for career progression, as he reflected on his most important takeaways from his cricket days. Passion is the most important criteria for a student to translate classroom learning into practical applications, Mr. Silva said.  Speaking of his role in the 1996 World Cup when he led his team to victory, Mr. Silva spoke on how banishing fear propelled the team members to bring out the best of their abilities. “Things keep changing, you need to be innovative and be aware of what is happening around you,” he said, sharing his views on management styles. Citing the rise of the T20 format, he emphasised the necessity of keeping pace with change.

Speaking at a public meeting at Palayamkottai, she said that the people have decided to say 'goodbye' to the BJP-AIADMK combine. They would not wait till May 2, for the results to come out. In the next few weeks, divisive forces from New Delhi would start coming to Tamil Nadu to campaign. Under the pretext of one India, they have been indulging in splitting the people and Tamil Nadu voters should not fall prey to them, she said and added that the BJP had only favoured their friends, who have managed to amass wealth by several millions even during the covid-19 pandemic days. When the whole globe was rattled by the COVID-19 pandemic, in India, a few corporate houses had enjoyed crores of rupees through concessions and other forms of sops. On the other hand, citing the same pandemic, the governments in the Centre and here in Tamil Nadu, had not even paid the workers their dues in MGNREGA projects. While it was Rs. 256 per day for the workers, the AIADMK government had paid Rs. 191 only, she charged and in the last six months, with the coffers going empty, the workers have been not paid what was due to them. On the petrol price hike, the CPI-M leader said that from every one rupee, the public paid 65 % in the form of taxes. Considering all these aspects, the double engine (BJP and AIADMK) should be shown the door in the ensuing polls as the opposition have come together and decided to stop the loot from the common man.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/say-goodbye-to-bjp-aiadmk-combine-says-brinda-karat/article33958286.ece

01 March 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Mandatory COVID-19 test for tourists from Kerala drives down visitors to the Nilgiris||The number of tourists coming to the Nilgiris from Kerala has come down in the last few days after the district administration announced that they would have to undergo a COVID-19 test before entry. Collector J. Innocent Divya said all tourists from Kerala should have undergone a test before visiting the Nilgiris. Those who were coming in without taking the test would be tested at border checkpoints. The measure has been taken in view of the increase in the number of infections in Kerala, and to check the spread of the contagion in the district. The restriction has discouraged visitors, though it does not bar any tourist from the Nilgiris, said a hotel owner in Udhagamandalam. “We have had people calling us up and asking about the new ‘restriction’ and have had many people cancel reservations because they do not want to undergo the test,” he said. The data from the Horticulture Department has confirmed that there has been a steep reduction in the arrival of tourists since the new measure was announced, with the peak tourist footfall falling steeply, especially at weekends. Before the announcement, the number of visitors to seven parks and gardens — the Kallar horticulture farm, Kattery Park, Tea Park, Rose Garden, the Government Botanical Garden, Arboretum and Sims Park — averaged out at more than 15,000 a day last weekend. However, on February 27, only 7,738 tourists visited these parks and gardens. “At the Government Botanical Garden, 11,482 visitors came last Sunday, but the number came down to 4,343 this Saturday,” said an official of the Horticulture Department. He said a majority of the tourists visiting the Nilgiris are from Kerala, and it was clear that the new rule had kept them away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mandatory-covid-19-test-for-tourists-from-kerala-drives-down-visitors-to-the-nilgiris/article33958162.ece

Speaking at the Vijay Sankalp rally here on Sunday, Mr. Shah praised the “excellent performance” of the Tamil Nadu government in various aspects, including measures to combat COVID-19, water management and the overall development of the State. The Union Home Minister said it was amusing that DMK president M.K. Stalin was focusing on corruption in his campaign, though everyone was aware that the State was the “fountain of 2G, 3G and 4G”. Mr. Shah said that by 2G, he meant two generations of the Maran family; 3G — three generations of the Karunanidhi family; and 4G — four generations of the Gandhi family. The NDA and its allies were committed to protecting the nation, whereas the rival camp of the Congress and the DMK were incapable of thinking of the progress and development of the country.

Toll-free number Political parties, candidates and members of public should call toll-free number 1950 to air poll-related grievances and complaints. In the previous elections, Returning Officers for each of the constituency received nomination papers from their respective offices in the Collectorate.

Helpdesks would be set up at the office of Returning Officers to help candidates and political parties to clear their doubts and enable filing online applications seeking permission to conduct processions and meetings. Members of public were allowed to carry up to Rs. 50,000 without any supportive documents, Mr. Kannan said. Stating that focused SWEEP activities would be held in all areas under polling booths where the voter turn-out was less than the district average in the previous elections. “We are trying to increase the voter turn out by 5% to 80%,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teams-in-place-to-implement-model-code-of-conduct-in-virudhunagar/article33958295.ece

It has been stated that the female infanticide could have taken place since the ill-fated child was the third girl child to the parents. It is a pity that in spite of so many schemes being implemented by the government for the welfare of girl children, such unfortunate incidents take place. One such appreciable scheme is the Cradle Baby scheme. It seems the knowledge about the scheme has not reached the interior parts of villages. The Social Welfare Department and NGOs should intensify their campaign against female infanticide. Health nurses should keep a close watch on mothers who have just delivered a second or third girl child and educate the parents about government schemes for the protection of girl child. S.

Overgrown vegetation on the sides has shrunk the width of the road which is already riddled with potholes. An asphalt road along the stretch has been a long felt need of the villagers. Saravanan Natesan  Puthanampatti   Directives of the Election Commission of India for conduct of public meeting must be strictly adhered to, at a juncture where vulnerable States are struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemi impact. The guidelines issued for the conduct of Assembly elections in Bihar ought to be adopted in Tamil Nadu, particularly with respect to extending postal ballot facility to electors with disabilities, people above the age of 80 years, those employed in notified essential services and those who are COVID-19 positive. Use of face mask, sanitizer, thermal scanners, gloves, and face shield must be optimised and social distancing norms should be adhered to. Hand gloves must be provided to all electors for signing on the voter register and pressing the button in the electronic voting machines (EVM) for voting. M. A. Aleem      The roadside behind The Periyar Teacher training Institute near Essar Sign Industries has turned untidy because of the dumping of garbage. The garbage gets spilled on the road when cattle rummage around it. As the location is being used as a urinal, it has become a health hazard for residents of apartment complexes in the vicinity. K. Kapil Raj    The door-to-door collection of garbage has not worked in Tiruchi Corporation area, as the required extent of cooperation from the side of the workers has been lacking. The city corporation had recently announced that garbage from large generators will not be collected from their door steps from the start of March. This has resulted in garbage being discarded on the roadsides. The civic body has to issue fresh instructions to the workers to avoid causing inconvenience to the common public. Thirumeni. J Cantonment   Number of street dogs seems to be on the rise across the city. For instance, the menace is quite apparent near the main gate of the District Court complex. The situation warrants prompt action by the authorities concerned. M. Raja  Tiruchi   There is an urgent need for construction of the underground subway across Chennai Bypass Road for the convenience of motorists from Srirangam and Tiruvanaikovil who are bound for Kallanai along the Kumbakonathan Salai. A box-type culvert subway would be of help for movement of two-wheelers and light vehicles. V. Rajagopalan  Srirangam   It would be prudent for NHAI to advise concessionaires at the toll plazas to have exclusive counters for Fastag users. Such a step is necessary to prevent line-up of vehicles at the toll plazas. P. K. Raman Ayyappa Nagar    Rampant use of air horn has caused severe discomfort to the public. There are instances of two-wheeler riders losing balance due to the abrupt noise of the air horns. Air horns need to be removed from vehicles to control noise pollution and prevent accidents.  G.

01 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Govt. will set up farm banks to provide loans to farmers’ cooperatives’||The State government will set up farm banks, to provide loans to farmers’ cooperatives to buy farm machinery, B.C. Patil, Agriculture Minister, said on Sunday. He was speaking to farmers in Morab near Dharwad as part of ‘A day with farmers’ programme of the Agriculture Department. “We plan to give loans of up to Rs. 8 lakh to farmers’ cooperatives that have 20 farmers as members. The government has started Yantra Dhare, a scheme to lease equipment to farmers. This is being taken up in partnership with NGOs, like the Sri Dharmasthala Rural Development Agency,” he said. “These machines can save a lot of money to farmers as the cost of cultivation and harvest is reduced over 75%,’’ he said. Every village will have a Yantra Dhare centre, according to him. He told journalists that the government is committed to introducing high-tech farming in the State. “We are supporting modern farming techniques. The department is offering a 70% subsidy to farmers who buy machinery. The government will also employ Raitha Mitra facilitators in every village who will help farmers adopt modern techniques. This is likely to be announced in the budget,” he said. Mr. Patil reiterated his assurance to include millet in the mid-day meal scheme for school children and government hostels. He said the government will mandate the use of millet grains in schools, residential schools and colleges, and hostels run by the Social Welfare and various other departments. “This would boost the demand for these grains and provide them better prices. We have already decided to include millet-based food in agriculture universities run by our department,” he said. “With this, we are looking at fulfilling the nutrition needs of youth and at providing remunerative prices for farm produce,” he said. He inaugurated a farm equipment storage centre, a machinery leasing centre, and a gram procurement unit in the Morab APMC yard. The government will procure bengal gram at Rs. 5,100 per quintal MSP as the market price of the grain has fallen, he said. The procurement centres will be open for three months, he said. He spent the day launching road works, inaugurating the Raitha Sampark Kendra (RSK), distributing farm implement, demonstrating hi-tech agriculture machinery, and also received grievances. He also visited Shirkool, Jevoor, Alagwadi, Gobbargumpi, Belavatagi, and Navalgund villages. He spoke at a public meeting in Belavatagi. Farmers asked him to start the Kalasa Banduri Nala project, improve the Malaprabha right bank canal, and fix errors in the crop insurance scheme. Shankarpatil Munenkoppa, MLA, Vijaylakshmi Patil, ZP president, UAS Vice-Chancellor M.B. Chetti, and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-will-set-up-farm-banks-to-provide-loans-to-farmers-cooperatives/article33958325.ece
01 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Ahead of State Budget, activists say old promises still not met||With the State Budget a few days away, there are questions about the promises made in the previous budgets for the development of Belagavi district. Activists say most of these promises have remained unfulfilled. The most important among them were the shifting of offices and opening of new offices in the Suvarna Soudha, the seat of the Karnataka Assembly’s winter session. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa promised – once in Belagavi and the second time in his budget speech – that decentralisation will be the principle in shifting offices to Belagavi. He also said apart from shifting some offices from Bengaluru, some new offices will be opened in the Suvarna Soudha for the needs of local residents. But these promises have not been met. The only office to shift to Belagavi is that of the additional information commissioner, northern region. Water and electricity The second project that has dragged on is one to provide drinking water and generate hydro electricity from the Kalasa and Banduri nalas, the initial tributaries of the Mahadayi. Despite the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal allocating water at the rate of 13 tmcft for Karnataka, (5 tmcft for drinking water and 8 tmcft for hydro electricity), the State government is yet to start work on this. That is because of special leave petitions by the three riparian states, Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka in the Supreme Court regarding the project. While Karnataka wants the allocation increased to 35 tmcft, Maharashtra wants the allocation rejigged based on basin yield and length of the river ,and Goa does not want the project to take off at all, as it feels it could damage its ecology. Ramesh Jarkiholi, Water Resources Minister has said he would seek Rs. 20,000 crore, only for Mahadayi basin projects out of the State budget. He also hopes the legal wrangle would be resolved soon. Railway line The third important project, that Suresh Angadi, former Union Minister described as his dream project, is to lay a direct railway line between Belagavi and Dharwad that passes through Kittur. The 90 km line passing through Bagewadi, Kittur, Mugut Khan Hubli and Kyarakoppa is estimated to cost Rs. 990 crore. The State government has promised to acquire and transfer land to the Railways, apart from sharing half the cost of the project. This would reduce travel time between Belagavi and Hubballi by over 70%, officers say. But the process to start acquiring around 850 acres of land is yet to start. The present railway line passes through Londa and the journey between Belagavi and Hubballi takes around four hours. Ashok Chandaragi, convenor, Central Committee of Kannada Organisations, urged the government to take its budget promises seriously. “The government should release an action-taken report before every budget. It should fulfil its promises of decentralised administration by making Suvarna Soudha the second executive centre of the government outside Bengaluru, and by speeding up projects like Mahadayi and providing land and funds to the Kittur railway line,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ahead-of-state-budget-activists-say-old-promises-still-not-met/article33958327.ece

Prabhakar Kore, KLE Society chairman and former MP, inaugurated the Rani Channabhaira Devi Mahila Bazaar and Tinisu Katte next to Basaveshwara Circle in Goaves in south Belagavi. Within minutes of its inauguration, it was flooded with food lovers. Families spent hours at the katte going around from stall to stall tasting the items that were on offer. The stalls sold exotic and local foods, from Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra.  Abhay Patil, MLA, who has contributed funds to the project, said the food street was the first part of the Mahila Bazaar. “I had promised before the elections that a women's market will come up in Belagavi where women entrepreneurs will be encouraged to market their produce. We will be building other such market places where women can market their goods. The shops will be given on lease,” he said.  Mr. Kore congratulated the MLA and others for naming the street after Queen Chennabharadevi, from coastal Karnataka who fought the Portuguese in the 16th century. However, some visitors had some complaints. Rajappa Bilgi, a retired banker, said the planners should have provided exclusive parking space for the visitors to the Katte. Avatika Bhate, who attended the inauguration, said the shops need better ventilation to reduce heat and reduce the chances of fire accidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-gets-its-own-food-street/article33958322.ece

PWD engineers and officers would prepare the detailed project reports for roadworks for the year 2021-2022, he told journalists in Gokak on Sunday. He was here to inspect some department works. He said that the department had upgraded around 15,000 km of rural roads to main district roads (MDR) and around 9,600 km of roads to State highways. In Belagavi district alone, around 900 km of rural roads are being upgraded to MDR and around 555 km of MDR to State highways, he said. MLAs had been asking for this for over 10 years. The work of development and maintenance of these roads will start after April, he said. Mr. Karjol visited the work site of the bridge over the Ghataprabha in Gokak and said it would be completed by July.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/roadworks-estimated-at-rs-3500-cr-to-be-taken-up/article33958320.ece
01 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mysuru mayoral election: Siddaramaiah cut up||The coalition politics between the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) in Mysuru seems to have divided the Congress leadership as the development, in his own backyard, has not gone down well with former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. The JD(S) candidate becoming the Mayor of Mysuru with the assistance of the Congress is being read as a setback to the Leader of Opposition, who has been blaming the alliance with the JD(S) at the State level for the series of electoral setbacks that the Congress has faced since the 2018 Assembly polls. Sources said that he had not consented to this arrangement. On Sunday, Mr. Siddaramaiah was in Delhi to attend the wedding of All-India Congress Committee general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala’s son. “He has appraised some top leaders of the developments in the State Congress,” a source close to him said. While the Congress had backed JD(S) candidates for the Mayoral post in the past two terms, it was hoping to wrest the post this year over a previously agreed-upon arrangement. However, the JD(S)’s possible move towards the BJP triggered anxiety in the Congress and the local leaders, including former Minister Tanveer Sait, agreed to support the JD(S) candidate to foil a possible JD(S)-BJP tie-up. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar had also spoken to former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on the issue. Sources said that Mr. Siddaramaiah was not against the tie-up with the JD(S), but had been vocal about the post of Mayor coming to the Congress as per the previous agreement. “He also believed that if the Congress had stuck to its stand, the JD(S) would have been exposed since there was a possibility of that party going with the BJP. The surrender of local leadership to the JD(S) has annoyed him,” a source said. “The argument for the current arrangement to keep the BJP at bay does not hold water. Would the secular principles be compromised if the post of Mayor had been given to the Congress?” Visit cancelled Incidentally, Mr. Siddaramaiah has cancelled his visit to Mysuru that was scheduled on Monday. It is being seen as expression of his dissatisfaction over the developments. Instead, he will now participate in a protest by sheep and goat farmers. However, sources close to Mr. Shivakumar said that if they had not agreed to this arrangement, the party would have lost power in the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC). However, they acknowledged that ideally the Congress candidate should have become Mayor. “The argument of exposing the JD(S) does not hold water. If that is the case, Siddaramaiah should have gone to town on the JD(S) tie-up with the BJP in Tumakuru, which happened after the Mysuru development. The Congress had limited scope,” a source said. Mr. Sait is set to meet the KPCC president on Monday to brief him on the sequence of events that led to the MCC election. KPCC working president R. Dhruvanarayan, who had been sent as an observer, is also expected to file his report shortly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-mayoral-election-siddaramaiah-cut-up/article33958142.ece

Parasuraman, president BCIC and president and whole time director of Toyota Industries Engines. The actual fuel cost is approximately 1/3 of what we pay. Oil marketing companies add some 10% margins to the cost, plus logistics charges. However, the major chunk of the cost is levied towards Excise Duty and Value Added Tax by the Centre and the State. Eventually, the retail price is compounding to an astronomical 250 to 260% high, he pointed out. “There is great scope for rationalisation of this tax structure around fuel and the government should call a stakeholder meeting on a priority basis,” he insisted. According to FKCCI president Perikal M. Sundar, this kind of fuel hikes is not seen anywhere else in the world. “Such hikes are happening especially when crude oil prices are low. We don’t understand why the government should tax fuel so heavily and burden the common man and the industry,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-sharp-rise-only-in-india/article33958334.ece

The primary demand is for the State government to pay staff their salaries as per the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations and make the announcement in the upcoming budget, which is slated to be presented on March 8. Farmers’ leader Kodihalli Chandrashekar, who had led protests in December, said, “It has been more than two months, but the State government is yet to fulfil the promises it had made. The State government had said that employees of transport corporations cannot be considered as government employees but instead agreed to pay salaries as per the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. We are hoping that the announcement will be made in the budget.” He maintained that bus services would run as usual on Tuesday. “If the State government fails to make the announcement in the budget, we will decide on the next course of action,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rtc-staff-to-hold-satyagraha-tomorrow/article33958130.ece

01 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Email account of former DG&IGP hacked||The police are on the hunt for unknown cyber criminals who allegedly hacked into the email account of the former Director- General and Inspector-General of Police (DG&IGP) Shankar Mahadev Bidri and cheated one of his contacts of Rs. 25,000. Acting on a complaint filed by Mr. Bidri, the southeast cyber crime police took up a case on Friday. In his complaint, Mr. Bidri said the accused hacked into his Yahoo account. “They sent mails to all the people in his contact list seeking financial help. Pretending to be Mr. Bidri, the accused claimed the money was needed for an emergency and gave account details for the transfer,” said a police officer. Responding to the mail, one of his friends transferred Rs. 25,000 to the bank account mentioned in the mail, before calling Mr. Bidri. Realising that his email account had been compromised, Mr. Bidri alerted his contacts and approached the police. The police are now trying to track down the accused via the bank account details mentioned in the mail.

01 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Autorickshaw drivers demand increase in fare||Close on the heels of a proposal to hike bus fare, autorickshaw unions in the city have demanded an increase in fare, citing the spiralling fuel prices and inflation. Fares were last increased in 2013, but since then LPG gas prices have shot up by 78.5%, said union leaders while making their case for a fare hike. Two prominent unions have petitioned the Transport Department for a fare hike. While Adarsha Auto Union has sought the minimum fare — for 1.9 km — to be hiked to Rs. 30 from the current Rs. 25, the Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union (CITU) has demanded a minimum fare of Rs. 36. The unions have also demanded the fare be fixed in the range of Rs. 16 to Rs. 18 for every kilometre later on. “The Transport Department has assured us that the demands will be looked into. We are very stressed and if there is no relief, we will be forced to take to the streets,” said M. Manjunath, president, Adarsha Auto Union. When the fares were hiked in 2013, a litre of auto LPG gas cost Rs. 28, but the price has since risen to Rs. 49.95 a litre. “Including oil costs, an auto driver incurs a cost of around Rs. 70 per litre,” said C.N. Srinivas, general secretary, Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union. “In the last year alone, as we were severely hit by the pandemic, the gas prices have shot up by nearly Rs. 15 a litre,” he added. Over and above the fuel price hike, autorickshaw unions argue that their incomes have not increased in the last eight years. Adjusted to inflation this only means that incomes had actually dwindled considerably, said union leaders, while pointing out that insurance and other maintenance costs have also shot up. “It was also during the last eight years that cab services entered and captured a significant share of the hire ride market in the city. Though we have been incurring losses for a couple of years now, we were forced to not seek a hike in fare so as to compete with the corporates with deep pockets that have distorted the market. But that has become untenable now and unless there is a hike in fare, it has become extremely difficult for us to survive,” said Mr. Manjunath. Auto drivers and their families are fighting to make two ends meet, Raghavendra, a driver, said. “The pandemic hit us so badly, that I had to pull out my children from a private school and enrol them in a cheaper school. On top of it is the fuel hike. Many days, even taking home some money has become difficult. I know of many auto drivers who fast during the day, to take home some money by night,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/now-autorickshaw-drivers-demand-increase-in-fare/article33958129.ece
01 March 2021||Gandasi (Hassan),KARNATAKA||A struggle to care for old, ailing cows||“A cow is lying in my shed with one leg broken. I am ready to give it away for free, but no one is willing to take it,” said Kallesh, a farmer from Singatagere in Kadur taluk of Chikkamagaluru district. Already suffering from a loss with his farm giving him a low yield and finding it difficult to mobilise money for his son’s education, Mr. Kallesh was looking for someone who could relieve him of the burden of looking after his cow. “Even if I have to look after the cow for another six months, I have to spend at least Rs.3,000 every month to provide fodder and water,” said Mr. Kallesh, who had come with a pair of bullocks to the weekly cattle market at Gandasi in Arsikere taluk recently. He was expecting Rs. 60,000 for the pair, but the buyers were quoting only Rs. 40,000. Like him, hundreds of farmers from distant places gather at the weekly market on the APMC yard, close to the highways that connect Mysuru, Hassan, Tiptur, and Shivamogga. Farmers who had been visiting the market for decades pointed out that the number of cattle and buyers had come down drastically after the State government brought out a law against cow-slaughter. The earlier anti-cow slaughter law was relatively more lenient on categories of cattle that could be sold or slaughtered. “Earlier, it was easier to dispose of sick, aged cattle and male calves. But now it is impossible. Each cow gives birth to more than 10 calves in its lifetime. I have four cows, and the total calves will be more than 40. Do you expect me to take care of all of them?” asked Shambhulinge Gowda of Gandasi. The new law prohibits the slaughtering of cows, bullocks of all ages. Those violating the rule will attract penal action, besides imprisonment of up to seven years. A newborn calf consumes at least three litres of milk a day, and with that the farmer loses an earning of Rs. 75 a day. “Taking care of even one calf is a costly affair. We can look after the female calf as an investment,” said Shive Gowda, of Hosurin Arsikere taluk. The farmers expressed anger against the lawmakers for introducing the new law without estimating its consequences. “Ministers offer gau puja at programmes. Let them stay with me on my farm for a few days and understand the difficulty we face. If there is a pair of cattle, we have to depute one member of the family to take care of them throughout the day. Otherwise, that person would be earning at least 400 a day by going to work in a farm,” said Ramu, of Heggatta in Arsikere taluk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-struggle-to-care-for-old-ailing-cows/article33958135.ece
01 March 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Hassan airport work may start soon||The construction of an airport in Hassan may begin within a year as hurdles for the project are being cleared, said Kapil Mohan, Additional Chief Secretary, here on Sunday. He along with officers of KPTCL and CESC visited the land at Boovanahalli near Hassan, acquired for the airport. An airport in Hassan has been a long pending demand. The current government is interested in taking up the project. “At present, we are concentrating on clearing the hurdles. At least 2-3 km of the radius of the airport should be clear for flight operations. The power supply lines are being shifted,” he said. The State government has constructed airports at Kalaburagi and the work has been in progress at Bidar and Shivamogga. “The airport at Kalaburagi has been considered one of the fast-growing airports in the country. We have begun work at Vijaypura and taking up a project with the Indian Navy in Karwar. No other State has taken up the construction of airports as we are doing,” he said. The officer said the government would construct the airport with the available land, as it was sufficient to operate ATR-72 flights. The government would take up the project either with a private partnership or with the Airport Authority of India. The KPTCL has taken up the shifting of 220 kV powerline that passes through the land, acquired for the project. The shifting of 68 towers had begun. “The shifting would be completed in 7 months. The total cost is Rs. 20 crore and we have spent Rs. 5.36 crore so far”, said D. Nagarjuna, Chief Engineer of KPTCL. The foundation stone for the airport was laid by former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda in 2007, when the JD(S)-BJP coalition was in power. The government had taken up the project on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) model and Jupiter Aviation Services Ltd. had signed an agreement with the government. The government had acquired 536 acres of land for it. However, the private partner did not start the work as it had worked out a plan for 960 acres. The agreement was cancelled during the previous JD(S)-Congress government. In 1960, the Central Public Works Department had prepared a proposal for an airport with a capacity to handle 50 arrivals and 50 departures a day in Hassan. A preliminary notification for land acquisition was issued in 1969.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hassan-airport-work-may-start-soon/article33958529.ece
01 March 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Saving abandoned cattle||Farmers unable to sell newborn male calves in the weekly markets, following the restrictions in the new anti-cow slaughter law, are now abandoning them. In Hassan district, there have been instances of farmers letting their male calves go free in forest areas. On February 16, a male calf was found abandoned near Joyisara Halli in Channarayapatna taluk. Last month, farmers who participated in the cattle market at Channarayapatna left 32 calves at the marketplace itself. The locals brought this tothe notice of the taluk administration, which later rehabilitated them in a goshala in Mysuru. Similar incidents were reported from the marketplace at Gandasi as well. Minister for Animal Husbandry Prabhu Chavan has announced that two goshalas would be set up in each taluk to provide shelter for cattle abandoned by farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/saving-abandoned-cattle/article33958139.ece

01 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Centre urged to open CGHS centre in north Karnataka||The Association of CGHS Beneficiaries of north Karnataka has urged the Union government to open a Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) Wellness Centre or Hospital (Polyclinic) in either Hubballi or Dharwad to help the Union government employees and pensioners in north Karnataka. Addressing presspersons here recently, association president U.G. Mokashi said that in the 14 districts of northern Karnataka, there were nearly 60,000 Union government employees including those in the postal department, BSNL, Income Tax, Central Excise and others. “However there is not a single CGHS wellness centre or polyclinic in Northern Karnataka. All the 10 wellness centres in Karnataka are in Bengaluru. The employees and pensioners living in Northern Karnataka are forced to go to Bengaluru to get treatment for health issues,” he said. Mr. Mokashi said that the association had appealed to the Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi to take up the issue. Mr. Joshi had written to Union Health Minister Harshavardhan. However, nothing had happened. “According to the information secured by filing applications under the RTI, there is no proposal to set up a CGHS centre in the region, which is highly disappointing” he said. General secretary of the Association Ramesh Joshi said that although there were 10-13 CGHS wellness centres in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, they were not concentrated in one particular city but spread across. However, it was only in Karnataka that CGHS centres had been set up only in one city. Although a proposal to set up CGHS centre at Mysuru had been sent to the Finance Ministry, a final order had not been issued, yet, he said. Other office-bearers of the association B.M. Doddamani, G.P. Shivanna, Sridhar Pawar and Chetan Nayak urged the Centre to take steps to set up CGHS Polyclinic or Wellness Centre in north Karnataka. They said they would be forced to take the path of agitation if their demand was not met.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/centre-urged-to-open-cghs-centre-in-north-karnataka/article33958318.ece

01 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Accused got equipment for skimming ATM cards online’||The accused arrested by city police here last week on the charge of skimming ATM cards have told the police that they sourced cameras and other materials from an online portal The police suspect the involvement of an organised gang in skimming of over 60 ATM cards in Mangaluru, Kasaragod , Chennai, Kochi, Goa, and Delhi, which came to light following the arrest of four persons. A team of city police, led by Inspector P.D. Savitru Tej on February 24 arrested Gladwin Jinto Joy, 37 of Thrissur, Dinesh Singh Rawat, 44 from New Delhi, Abdul Majeed, 27, from Kasaragod, and Rahul T.S., 24, from Alappuzha on the charge of their involvement in skimming 22 ATM cards in the city. The accused are also suspected to have skimmed some ATM cards in Udupi too. Talking to reporters here on Sunday, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar said Joy, the prime accused, has given the name of the portal from where he has got the spy camera, batteries, memory cards, and other materials for skimming by paying around $700. “Not just the technical and software knowledge, skimming requires specific skills. We suspect association of the accused with organised gangs that that are involved in skimming of ATM cards across the country,” Mr .Shankar said. Cases of skimming ATM cards were getting filed in the cyber crime police in Mangaluru since November, 2020. The accused were inserting scanning device in the ATM machine where the customers inserted their ATM cards. That scanning device was secretly connected to a battery and a memory card from where they used to collect the data of the ATM cards inserted by the customers. Flaps connected with spy camera had been placed around the keypad to catch the PIN number while customers were entering it to draw the money. Mr. Tej said the accused took around five minutes to place the devices in the early hours of the day at the ATMs that did not have security guard. The scanning device and other devices were being removed a day later. The city police are investigating whether the accused have sold information about the ATM cards on the dark web, Mr .Shankar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/accused-got-equipment-for-skimming-atm-cards-online/article33958503.ece
01 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Nursing is a noble, selfless profession’||Registrar of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) Shivanand Kapashi has said that nursing is a selfless and noble profession. It is the largest profession in the occupational category. He was speaking at the graduation ceremony of Father Muller School and College of Nursing here on Saturday. “Nurses are expected to be team players and role models to society and it was seen during the pandemic,” he said. Bishop of Mangaluru Peter Paul Saldanha, who is also the president of Father Muller Charitable Institutions, said nurses have their hands busy with the emerging chronic diseases, which needs more care. The world noticed nursing services as being vital during the pandemic. He likened their white nursing attire to truth, apron to righteousness, shoes to readiness, face mask to a calming smile, and ointment to compassion. “We recognise the nurses with their white aprons that signify one uniform standard, one language of healing and one in compassion and love,” the Bishop said. In the graduate response, outgoing student Nikitha Lavia Dsouza remembered her stay in the campus and said how the institution has moulded her for the better growth. She said efforts of teachers, peer teaching, ample teaching and learning resources, integration of theory and practice, and inter-professional education modalities helped students to achieve pinnacles. The best outgoing students as well as students who excelled in various academic and extracurricular activities were honoured on the occasion. The ceremony was for the outgoing batches of GNM, B.Sc, PB B.Sc., and M.Sc. nursing courses. In all, 260 graduates from 2018-19 and 2019-20 batches with their parents attended the ceremony.

01 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||KCCI urges govt. to reconsider hike in consent fee||The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) has appealed to the State government to have a relook into the revised (hiked) consent fee payable under the Karnataka Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976 and the Karnataka Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1983. It has appealed to the government to keep the rate revised recently in abeyance till the fee structure is further revised suitably for the sustainability and growth of industries. In a memorandum submitted to C.P. Yogeshwar, Minister for Environment, Ecology and Tourism during his visit to the city on Saturday, president of the KCCI Isaac Vas said that the new system of paying consent fee on the basis of percentage of fee on capital investment needs to be rationalised and revised. When stakeholder’s views had been invited before increasing the fee, the industrialists had been assured that the increase would be around 30% to 40% of the existing structure. “However it is shocking to note that the increase in some cases is as much as 800% to 1,000%. There should be a cap for the fees beyond certain amount. Capital investment is needed for growth as also to reduce pollution and sustain environment too,” the president said. Paying the increased upfront fees for five years at one time adds to the huge burden and affects the cash flow and working capital, he said.  “...The present system of calculations of consent fee is on the basis of gross capital investment. This is also linked to WPI and will increase depending on the inflation. However the basic flaw in this system is Medium and Large industries with an investment of over 25 crores are penalised for their capital cost. This is a disincentive for employing environment friendly technology which naturally is capital intensive...” KCCI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kcci-urges-govt-to-reconsider-hike-in-consent-fee/article33958495.ece
01 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Proposed control room to monitor sand movement||As part of the control room proposed for continuous monitoring of sand movement from Dakshina Kannada by the district administration, the city police have given the list of 180 places where CCTV cameras have to be installed. “We have given the list of places, along with a map, where the CCTV cameras need to be installed. The district administration will shortly set up the control room to monitor sand movement. These arrangements are being made using the district mineral fund,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar told reporters on Sunday. The control room is likely to become operational in a month, he added. On Saturday morning, Mr. Shankar accompanied by Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar and a few other policemen in civilian dress arrested three persons on the charge of illegally transporting sand in a lorry from Mangaluru to Kerala via Talapady checkpost. Some personnel at the checkpost were booked for allegedly conspiring with the accused in illegal transportation of sand. A separate case was registered against six persons, who had come to escort the lorry, for use of force against police while running away from the place. On Sunday, the Ullal police seized three lorries and 12 loads of sand from Kotekar Beeri and Ajjinadka. This sand had been stocked to transport it to Kerala, Mr. Shankar said. The official said the sand seized on Sunday is among several deposits of sand found in places near the Talapady checkpost. When the police posted at the checkpost leave in the early hours daily, some lorries illegally transport the sand to Kerala side. The police, he said, have found instances of misuse of permit issued for transportation of sand from Mangaluru to Sullia. “As the permit does not mention the route to be taken by the vehicle carrying the sand, this is being used for illegal sand transport to Kerala,” he said and added that recommendation has been made to the administration to prescribe route in the permit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/proposed-control-room-to-monitor-sand-movement/article33958501.ece

Responding to the allegation by Dalit activists during the SC/ST grievances meet that the police were not acting on information about sale of cannabis or on complaints of atrocities on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Mr. Shankar asked the activists to report such incidents by dialling 112. There are dedicated police personnel on the road who will respond quickly, he said. Mr. Shankar said dedicated city police staff are now responding to an average of 40 calls every day. “We need to get an average of 120 calls per day,” he said. The caller will get a call from the control room in Bengaluru asking their feedback on the way the personnel responded, he said. When an activist sought effective action against persons involved in putting unwanted materials in the offering box of a Daivastana in Urwa and four other places of worship, Mr. Shankar said the written material seized from the offering box in Urwa was similar to the written material seized from offering boxes of four places of worship. Efforts are being made by the police to trace the accused, he said. On a complaint of a pourakarmika that he and his wife were being made to work for long hours by a gram panchayat, Mr. Shankar directed the police associated with Civil Rights Enforcement Cell to inquire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dial-112-to-report-public-nuisance-and-other-grievances-says-dcp/article33958513.ece

Mr. Sood has suspended Economic and Narcotic Crime (ENC) Wing Inspector K.K. Ramakrishna and Sub-Inspector Kabalraj, who was earlier posted in the city and who is now at the District Crime Record Bureau, Chikkamagaluru, following preliminary report by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) that is inquiring into the alleged “misconduct and dereliction of duty” by city police personnel. The police said a woman filed a complaint of cheating with the ENC police station, Mangaluru on October 16,2020, accusing proprietors of Eliya Construction and Builders Private Limited, Kadaba, of cheating her of Rs. 4.5 lakh. Later the Central Crime Branch police seized three high-end cars related to the owners of the company when they said they did not have money to return to the complainant. Later media reports said that one of the three cars which had been seized had been sold while in police custody.” The media reports alleged that CCB personnel had colluded with some police officials in “selling one of the seized cars” for enabling the accused in the cheating case to return the cheated amount to the complainant. Following the media reports, Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order) Pratap Reddy sought a report from Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar. Based on the findings of the report of the preliminary inquiry by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Vinay Gaonker, Mr. Kumar sent a report to Mr. Reddy, who asked the CID to conduct an inquiry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-police-officials-suspended-for-misconduct/article33958496.ece

01 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Janata Dal (S) ready to welcome Tanveer Sait’||If the Congress dismisses former Minister and Narasimharaja Assembly constituency MLA Tanveer Sait over the rift in the party after the recent mayoral polls in Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), the Janata Dal (Secular) is ready to welcome him, claimed former Minister S.R. Mahesh. In whichever party he is, Mr. Sait is respected by the JD(S) as a leader of the minorities, Mr. Mahesh said while fielding queries from reporters at a press conference in Mysuru on Sunday on how the party will come to the rescue of the Congress MLA, who is threatened with suspension by his party for ceding the post of Mayor to JD(S). Mr. Mahesh said all the leaders in the JD(S) including Abdul Aziz, also known as Abdullah, who was the party candidate for Narasimharaja Assembly constituency in the 2018 polls, respected Mr. Sait. When asked if the party will field Mr. Sait in the next elections, Mr. Mahesh said, “Let him come...”. Mr. Mahesh also acknowledged that Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar had telephoned him before the Mayoral polls and sought an alliance with the JD(S). “He phoned me and asked for an alliance. He also sought the Mayor’s post for the Congress,” he said. The JD(S) leader singled out former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his utterances against the party for the entire confusion surrounding the Mayoral polls. The JD(S) may even have given the Mayor’s post to the Congress, but Mr. Siddaramaiah’s hurting statements against party had led to such a situation. The JD(S) had 18 members and one BSP member in the MCC. With one MLA – G.T. Deve Gowda and three MLCs – K.T. Srikante Gowda, Marithibbe Gowda and Sandesh Nagaraj eligible to vote, the party enjoyed a voting strength of 23. But, Mr. Mahesh said the party had won over the support of two independents – K.V. Sridhar and Samiulla – besides M.V. Ramaprasad, taking its voting strength to 26, which was more than the BJP’s 25. The JD(S) was confident of winning the Mayoral polls without the support of any party and hence decided to field its own candidate. But, the plans of the JD(S) were foiled when Mr. G.T. Deve Gowda and Sandesh Nagaraj chose against turning up for the Mayoral polls. Had it not been for this, there would have been no need for the JD(S) to align with the Congress. The JD(S) had not committed to either BJP or Congress on an alliance till the last moment. When the Congress extended support to our Mayoral candidate, the JD(S) voted in favour of Congress candidate for the Deputy Mayor in a quid pro quo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/janata-dal-s-ready-to-welcome-tanveer-sait/article33958533.ece
01 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Pratap Simha seeks exclusive water supply and sewerage board for Mysuru||Pratap Simha, MP, Mysuru, has urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to set up an exclusive Mysuru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (MWSSB) on the lines of Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB). In a letter to Mr. Yediyurappa, dated February 27, 2021, Mr. Simha sought an announcement on the creation of the MWSSB in the coming State Budget. The proposed board can cater to the water supply and sewerage requirements of areas under not only the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), but Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) layouts and MUDA-approved layouts in the city. Presently, Vani Vilas Water Works (VVWW) is catering only to the localities that are in the jurisdiction of MCC. MUDA layouts and MUDA-approved layouts, which are part of gram panchayats on the outskirts of Mysuru, were now equally expansive, he said, while pointing out that the GPs did not have the required financial or technical resources to ensure water supply and sewerage facilities to the new areas. More than 50,000 residential sites had been developed in MUDA layouts and MUDA-approved layouts on the outskirts, he said. All these new extensions were being provided borewell water with fluoride content, he said. Mr. Simha sought to draw the CM’s attention to availability of drinking water sources like the Cauvery, which flows barely 15 km north of Mysuru, and the Kapila, which runs at a distance of about 20 km south of the city. Yet, the residential areas that are part of MUDA layouts and MUDA-approved layouts were not receiving proper supply of water, the MP regretted. The demand for setting up of an exclusive MWSSB for the water and sewerage requirements of Mysuru comes ahead of the start of work on Hale Unduwadi drinking water project that seeks to bring water to the city from the KRS. About 150 MLD of water is expected to be drawn from KRS under the project for supply to Mysuru in addition to the 250-260 MLD of water the city was already receiving from Belagola, Hongalli, Kabini and Melapura drinking water schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pratap-simha-seeks-exclusive-water-supply-and-sewerage-board-for-mysuru/article33958535.ece

01 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Next Mayor will be from Congress: Mahesh||S.R. Mahesh, former Minister, on Sunday said the JD(S) will leave the post of Mayor of Mysuru for the next term to the Congress. Fielding reporters’ queries at a press conference here on Sunday, Mr. Mahesh said the Congress and JD(S) had entered into a tie-up after the MCC polls in 2018 under which it was agreed that the JD(S) will have its Mayor for three terms while the Congress will occupy the post for two terms. Of the remaining two terms, the Congress and JD(S) will have its Mayor for one term each as per the understanding. The JD(S) was committed to leave the post of Mayor in the next term to the Congress, provided its party leaders do not make statements that belittle the party, Mr. Mahesh said. He said the JD(S) would have allowed the Congress to have the post this term itself, but for the critical remarks against the party by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. The party fielded its candidate in the recently held Mayoral polls just to show the party’s strength in Mr. Siddaramaiah’s home district, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/next-mayor-will-be-from-congress-mahesh/article33958534.ece

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||Remember that advertisement in which two men in a lift kept their stomachs tucked in when a pretty woman walked in? Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP) personnel are regularly doing the tummy tuck routine whenever they confront their seniors. This has happened after the Additional Director-General of Police, KSRP, Alok Kumar(in picture), set them a deadline of April 30 to reduce flab. Losing weight to gain promotion was his idea. The staff who are overweight or have a paunch are wary of even encountering him or entering his chamber for fear of being reprimanded. They are afraid of what awaits them after April 30. Mr. Kumar issued a circular on shedding weight and becoming fitter in February, after 1,000 KSRP staff were found to be overweight by at least 10 kg. According to Mr. Kumar, this extra weight makes them more prone to chronic diseases. He wants them to focus on fitness and health.     While governments speak a lot about women’s empowerment in all fields, it is so often conspicuous by its absence in public life. For instance, no woman has become Advocate General (AG) of the State government in the 75-year history of the office of the AG. This is despite the number of women advocates practising law increasing manifold in recent years. The only woman to serve as Additional AG was Vidyavathi M. Kuttur Shettar in 2019. B.V. Acharya served as AG on six occasions in different periods, starting from 1989. Some AGs have served as judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court too. On Saturday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa released a coffee table book on 24 AGs who served the State since 1946. But to the surprise of many, there was no woman AG to be found in the book. A good number of women advocates attended the function.   However much its leaders hate the idea, the Janata Dal (Secular) is often found aligning itself with either of the two national parties — the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party — in the State. In Mysuru recently for the mayoral polls, the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy(in picture)was assiduously wooed by both the Congress and the BJP for the support of the JD(S). Playing his cards close to his chest a day before the mayoral polls, Mr. Kumaraswamy made it clear that he was not impressed with either the “Hindutva” espoused by the BJP nor the “secularism” pursued by the Congress. According to him, the secularism that the Congress claimed to practice was just as “bogus” as the Hindutva of the BJP. The Congress and BJP are using secularism and Hindutva merely as tools to grab power, he said. But call it opportunism or inevitable circumstances, despite the leader’s stated attempts to create a distinct identity for his party, the JD(S) continues to yo-yo between the two parties.  imran Gowhar    Nagesh Prabhu    Laiqh A.

01 March 2021||Abdul Latheef Naha,KERALA||Malayali duo enthral audience with Odissi||Dance-lovers of Kerala were treated to a surprise Odissi performance by two Malayali women on Saturday evening. Mini Somakumar and Srudhi Ratheesh, currently living in Bangaluru, displayed their Odissi skills at Irinjalakuda, their native place, taking audiences to the nuances of the classical dance form. Thanks to Bharatam Entertainments, an Irinjalakuda-based forum for the promotion performing arts, the artistes kindled the love for classical dances, particularly Odissi, among Malayali audience. Ms. Mini began the show with a Devi Stuti praising Goddess Durga, dancing to a choreography set by Odissi exponents Gangadhar Pradhan and Aruna Mohanty. She then moved on to Vasanta Pallavi, a pure dance form choreographed by Kelucharan Mohapatra. She showed distinct poses and postures of Odissi through her solo. Then came the duet ‘Braja Juba Raja’, the most appealing segment of the show, with Ms. Srudhi. Choreographed by their teacher Madhulita Mohapatra and music given by Binod Bihari Panda, ‘Braja Juba Raja’ described Krishna’s beauty as Prince Charming through Odiya Abhinay. Growing popularity “Odissi has been growing in popularity in Kerala and is well received by Malayalis. The show by Mini and Srudhi was beautifully executed. I thoroughly enjoyed it,” said Meenakshi Menon, a young IT professional from Palakkad working in Bangaluru. Ms. Mini said that although they had performed in Thrissur before, performing in her native Irinjalakuda was a dream come true for her. Many in their village never knew they were into Odissi. “We can bring any artistes from any places. But getting our own native artistes to perform in our neighbourhood is something more fulfilling,” said Bhasiraj A.P., promoter of Bharatam Entertainments. Mr. Bhasiraj said they were organising art performances every Saturday as part of encouraging artistes. “Because of COVID-19, we have many limitations. Still we are not doing any recorded programmes. The live shows we do have an excellent response from audiences,” he said. Students of Nrityantar Academy of Performing Arts, Bangaluru, Ms. Mini and Ms. Srudhi have been learning Odissi for several years. “Our families are giving a lot of support to us. We owe a great deal to our husbands for encouraging us to take up and practice this beautiful dance form,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/malayali-duo-enthral-audience-with-odissi/article33958388.ece
01 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Rough times for NTPC’s project at Kayamkulam||The setting up of a 92-MW floating solar energy project at the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC)’s Kayamkulam unit has run into rough weather due to a delay in importing solar cells from China. The floating solar system is being set up on the lake adjacent to the NTPC’s Rajiv Gandhi Combined Cycle Power Project (RGCCPP). According to NTPC officials, the Centre imposing restrictions and curbs on imports from China following the Galwan Valley face-off has hit the project implementation. “Solar panels for setting up the floating Solar PV Power Station at NTPC Kayamkulam should come from China. However, we are yet to receive it due to restrictions. This has delayed the commissioning of the project,” said an NTPC official. The NTPC now plans to complete the project, which is running behind the schedule, before the end of this year. “As per the original schedule, the plant, albeit partly, was to be made operational a couple of months ago. We will complete the project in the next five or six months. In between, we hope to partially commission the plant and start generating power,” said another official with the NTPC. Earlier, Tata Power Solar (70 MW) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (22 MW) bagged the floating solar project work. The project is being implemented at a total cost of Rs. 465 crore. A total of 2.16 lakh solar panels will be mounted on floaters. Once completed, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) will purchase power from the Kayamkulam floating solar PV power station at Rs. 3.16 per kWh. An agreement to this effect has been signed between the KSEB and the NTPC some time ago. High cost The KSEB had stopped drawing power from the NTPC’s 359 MW naphtha-fuelled RGCCPP since 2017 due to the cost. It led the NTPC to shift its focus to solar energy. The company is in possession of around 1,000 acres of land, which includes water bodies suitable for setting up floating solar projects. In recent years, it commissioned a few small solar projects at the Kayamkulam site. Meanwhile, the RGCCPP plant will be operated for 25 days in March to use the 18,000 tonnes of naphtha being stored there since 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rough-times-for-ntpcs-project-at-kayamkulam/article33958465.ece
01 March 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Banned pesticides in use in Idukki estates||The use of banned red-labelled pesticides has become rampant in cardamom plantations in the district. Since these pesticides are not banned in Tamil Nadu, they are easily smuggled across the border. Fifteen bottles of red-labelled pesticide were seized from a jeep at the Kumily check-post by excise officials on February 24. The case was handed over to the Agriculture Department following which managers of a tea plantation at Chakkupallom were booked. From Tamil Nadu Hundreds of workers arrive from Tamil Nadu daily to work in the plantations on the border regions in Idukki. The workers are used as carriers of these pesticides. Agents too are involved in the trade. Red-labelled pesticides are widely used in cardamom plantations from January to March. Planters prefer them as they cost less and are more effective than the green-labelled ones. They are easily water-soluble. Bottles of banned pesticides are thrown in streams after use in remote plantation areas where checking is rare. Eco concerns Some of the estate managements are in Tamil Nadu and since the pesticides are not banned in that State, they have no qualms about using them. Environmentalists say that the seizure of large quantity of pesticides at the check-post has shone light on an issue that has not been given due attention. “The banned pesticides are widely used as the agents ensure their availability at many plantations,” says Jayakumar, a resident at a cardamom plantation in Nedumkandam. The manager of a pesticide outlet at Vandanmedu says that if farmers have to shift to the green- or blue-labelled pesticides, the availability of the red-labelled ones has to stop. There are some restrictions on the use of yellow category pesticides too in the State. Regular inspection Abraham Sebastian, Assistant Director, Agriculture, Peerumade, says that 15 bottles of monocrotophos were seized at the check-post. He suggests a regular inspection at check-posts for banned pesticides. “Though campaigns are organised among farmers against the use of banned pesticides, they choose short-cuts for easy gains and use red category pesticides,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/banned-pesticides-in-use-in-idukki-estates/article33958467.ece

The Malabar Kaipad Farmers Society, formed in 2010 to promote cultivation of traditional and new varieties of paddy, has been able to procure over 20 tonnes of the produce from farmers this year. Kaipad rice received the Geographical Indication tag in 2014. “From just 5,000 kg in 2019 to 20,000 kg this year, paddy procured from just four panchayats is a huge leap,” said M.K. Sukumaran, secretary of the society. Still, the society is not able to meet the demand thanks to insufficient stock, he added. Mr. Sukumaran said when Kaipad farming was launched, it was limited to around 200 acres, but it has grown to a large area, and cultivation is now done in over 2500 acres. Kaipad farming is done at Ezhome, Cherukkunnu, Pattuvam, Cheruthazham and Ramanthali panchayats. Mr. Sukumaran said that besides the traditional seed varieties of Kuthiru and Orkayama, new varieties like Ezhome 1, Ezhome 2, Ezhome 3, Ezhome 4, and Mithila were introduced last year. Major issues Labour shortage and huge production cost were the major issues facing Kaipad farming. Making matters worse, mangroves have come up in areas that were left idle for several years. “It is an issue of concern for farmers, as the Forest Department has not granted permission to remove mangroves citing environmental issues,” he informed. However, the society has been able to enhance production with the support of the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS), Pilicode. GI-tagged Kaipad rice is now sold in Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode, Thrissur and Ernakulam districts. The sale is through ecoshops, horticorp, and VFPCK outlets. Mr. Sukumaran said the procured paddy has huge export potential. A number of companies and traders have approached the society for export of the rice variety. However, the society is not able to meet their demand, as it has stock only up to August, he added. T. Vanaja, Associate Director of Research, RARS, who introduced five seed varieties for Kaipad farming, said mechanisation of farming would give a boost to the initiative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kaipad-farming-on-revival-path/article33958390.ece

According to a press release, besides delivering the foundation day lecture, the Governor will inaugurate the newly constructed guest house, ‘Nilagiri’, on the main campus. Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan will be the guest of honour. CUK Vice Chancellor H. Venkateshwarlu said that the two-storey guest house with 25,500 sq.ft. space, has four VIP suite rooms, 21 air conditioned rooms, office room, two dormitories, and a seminar hall. The building was constructed at a cost of Rs. 10.13 crore. Mr. Venkateshwarlu said that the construction of a central library, administrative block, health centre, staff quarters, solar power plant, and common kitchen for students were under way. The construction of seven hostels for 1,200 students with the assistance of the Ministry of Social Justice and the Ministry of Minority Affairs were also in progress. He informed that under the Khelo India Project of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, the university would get a Rs. 50-crore sports complex.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/governor-to-inaugurate-cuk-foundation-day-fete/article33958384.ece
01 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Anger over delay in widening approach road||Even as the Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) recently accorded administration sanction to build three bridges in the Goshree region, islanders are peeved at the inordinate delay and alleged red tape in readying a 350-metre road to establish the much-needed connectivity from the Pizhala side to the 714-metre-long Pizhala-Moolampilly bridge. The project to widen the narrow road is hanging fire, as it has not got technical sanction. This is because the Revenue Department has not surveyed the land and issued a land acquisition notification to widen the approach road. “One can imagine the situation when a two-lane bridge terminates in a dilapidated narrow lane which was built for 54 families,” said Francis Dianish, vice chairman of Pizhala Karamuttikal Samara Samiti, an NGO formed to catalyse the establishment of road connectivity. Proper road connectivity for the bridge is crucial for all 14 islands in Kadamakudy, since Pizhala, which is located at the centre of Kadamakudy isles, has a public health centre, a veterinary clinic, and panchayat and village offices. Especially so since ferries halted service once the bridge was commissioned in 2013. The Kadamakudy grama panchayat ought to take a proactive stand on the issue. Its members are on different pages on relocating four electric posts that hamper movement of vehicles on the approach road. Even worse, a meeting of landowners that was held a couple of days ago failed to reach a consensus, since officials are yet to ready a land acquisition package. Not taking landowners into confidence has made even advance possession of land a tough proposition, although they are willing to surrender their land. On its part, GIDA has said it will appoint a liaison officer to speed up the process. The Revenue and other agencies concerned must get their act together. Initiating works will not be affected by the model code of conduct, since the High Court had recently ordered speedy completion of long-pending projects, sources said. Proper road connectivity is crucial to building boat jetties that are being readied on Paliamturuth island and Pizhala as part of the Water Metro project, since barges often encounter difficulty in negotiating through shallow areas. This necessitates the need to transport construction materials through road, it is learnt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/anger-over-delay-in-widening-approach-road/article33958413.ece
01 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Municipality to name and shame fly-tippers||In a recent drive, the health squad of the Kalamassery Municipality intercepted 23 persons found surreptitiously dumping waste in public under the cover of night and netted a collective fine of Rs. 1.62 lakh from them. More than the loss of money, those caught red-handed are now probably under the fear of being publicly exposed, with the municipality having announced a ‘naming and shaming policy’ to put an end to the perennial scourge of illegal waste dumping in public spaces. “We have got the names and addresses of all the 23 and have withheld them for the time being. Unless people co-operate and stop the illegal practice, we will have to execute our decision to name the offenders,” said A.K. Nishad, chairman of the health standing committee of the municipality. Except for two who were charged Rs. 1,000, all the remaining 21 were slapped with a fine of Rs. 10,000 each. The health standing committee has fixed a fine of Rs. 2,000 for motorcycle-borne offenders, Rs. 10,000 for those travelling in cars, and Rs. 25,000 for those using bigger vehicles. Mr. Nishad said those from outside the municipal limits, especially Thrikkakara, were guilty of dumping waste within their municipal limits. Kalamassery Municipal Chairperson Seema Kannan said the health committee could not be faulted for adopting a naming and shaming policy. “We have one of the best collection and management systems for both biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste, and yet for people to dump waste is just not acceptable. There is just a nominal user fee that is not all unaffordable,” she added. The civic body charges Rs. 100 for waste collection from households and Rs. 1,000 from shops a month. However, the fact is that only 13,000 out of around 30,000 households have subscribed to the waste management system. “We are trying to bring the remaining households as well under the system,” said Mr. Nishad. The sprawling HMT campus and Seaport-Airport Road remain the favourite dumping grounds of offenders. “In the case of HMT campus, we can hardly do anything because it is spread over a huge area, while lack of street lights makes dumping easy along Seaport-Airport Road,” said Mr. Nishad. Ms. Kannan said steps had been taken to install street lights along Seaport-Airport Road and to set up CCTVs in association with HMT and the Naval Armament Depot in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/municipality-to-name-and-shame-fly-tippers/article33958409.ece

The expedition is being undertaken by Ocean Sailing Node, Kochi, under the SNC as part of the golden jubilee celebrations of the Naval Institute of Educational and Training Technology (NIETT). The institute was commissioned on April 25, 1971 in Kochi for imparting ab-initio training to all education branch officers of the Indian Navy. NIETT also trains officers and men from the Indian Army, Air Force, Indian Coast Guard, and friendly foreign countries. The crew of the sailing vessel comprises four male and two women officers from the SNC. The ocean voyage will culminate on March 5 in Kochi, after covering an approximate distance of 400 nautical miles. The aim of the expedition is to inculcate the spirit of adventure and esprit-de-corps, besides honing the nautical navigation skills of young officers, according to a release from the Navy. The skipper is Captain Atool Sinha, an Asian games medallist with over 22,500 nautical miles of ocean sailing experience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sailing-expedition-by-naval-officers-flagged-off/article33958382.ece

This is nothing but cheating the masses, said leaders who participated in the agitation. Conspiracy Many States are reducing taxes to lessen the burden on people. Kerala too must emulate them. The impression is gaining ground that the massive hike in fuel prices is the result of a conspiracy between mega corporate groups and the State/Central governments, to mobilise funds for the impending poll campaign in many States. The agencies concerned must launch a probe into this, they added. V4People chief coordinator Nipun Cherian and Dr. Vinay Raj, chief coordinator, Thripunithura region, were among those who participated in the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/v4peoples-innovative-protest-against-spiralling-fuel-prices/article33958404.ece
01 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Demand for bridge, ring road hots up||The worsening traffic congestion in the city’s densely-populated northern and north-western areas has intensified the demand to construct the long-overdue Vaduthala overbridge and the ring road, yet another pending project. Residents have for long been holding that an overbridge at Vaduthala is required to temporarily ease congestion, and that the Pachalam overbridge, which was built as part of the Kochi metro’s preparatory work, alone is not enough. The Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) had readied a project report for an overbridge here, apart from similar structures at Vathuruthy and Atlantis. The impending development of the Goshree-Mamangalam Road will increase the number of vehicles passing through the northern parts of the city. Chittoor Road, one of the foremost roads built in the State, turns extremely narrow on the Pachalam-Chittoor stretch. Such bottlenecked areas must be widened alongside the construction of the Vaduthala bridge. “The ring road, which will usher in development of the entire coastal belt, must be developed in the long run,” said Felix J. Pullooden, president of Greater Kochi Development Watch, an NGO which has been spearheading the demand to augment roads and allied infrastructure in the region. The first phase of the ring road project mooted by the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) begins from Chathiath and ends at Varapuzha, after passing through Vaduthala, Chittoor, and Kothad. The ring road can be realised easily now, since the revised Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms permit reclamation of waterbodies, if need be, for public infrastructure projects, said Ebenser Chullikat, who is among the activists who have been demanding seamless integration of commuting modes in Kochi. The GCDA, which mooted the ring road, will have to work in tandem with GIDA, under whose jurisdiction areas like Kothad fall, to realise the ring road project. Its project report says land reclaimed from waterbodies must be sold and the proceeds invested in the road project, if there is difficulty in sourcing funds. This will in turn usher in development of the city northward, what with Thanttonnithuruth and other isles too being developed in the long run, he added.

Addressing a public meeting here on Sunday during the reception accorded to the Vijaya Yatra led by him, Mr. Surendran said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, who could restore peace in Jammu and Kashmir, could very well do it in Kerala too. The threat posed by ani-national elements in the State will not succeed. Much water has flown under the bridge since the 1921 Mappila Rebellion, and the State will not budge before any such divisive forces, he said. Third alternative Kerala is yearning for a change, and time is ripe for a third alternative led by the BJP, he added. “Under the LDF regime, all fraudsters gained access to the office of the Chief Minister and other Ministers. The CPI(M) is collecting money from the corrupt and anti-national elements,” Mr. Surendran alleged. While the BJP is bringing forward personalities like E. Sreedharan, the Congress is attempting to bring back its former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, who has the rare distinction of being one of the most corrupt politicians in the State. After the Assembly elections, Thripunithura will have an effective BJP leader as its representative in the Assembly, said Mr. Surendran without naming the party candidate for the constituency. Mr. Surendran alleged that the LDF government had taken over hundreds of acres that belonged to temples. Former Kerala High Court judge P.N.

01 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Ayurveda tourism players seek easing of curbs on guests||Faced with a steep fall in demand from tourists, providers of Ayurveda and wellness tourism have written to the State government demanding relaxation of quarantine norms for guests visiting Kerala. The two sectors contribute a substantial chunk of the Rs. 40,000 crore that the State earns as revenue each year from tourism. The survival of stakeholders, including thousands of employees, is uncertain now thanks to quarantine norms. Most guests come seeking Ayurveda treatments that may extend to 14 or even 21 days. They are turning away, since the State has not relaxed norms even for guests with a COVID negative certificate, said Sajeev Kurup, president, Ayurveda Task Force, FICCI, New Delhi. “Even worse, the neighbouring Sri Lanka, which banks heavily on income from tourism, has rolled out a red carpet to tourists. After Kerala, the next choice is Sri Lanka for those seeking Ayurveda and wellness treatments. Thus the State stands the risk of losing its prime status, since trends show that Kerala-bound guests and travel agents have begun choosing Sri Lanka, which has announced a slew of tourist-friendly policies. Fearmongering Quarantine norms apart, Kerala has for the wrong reasons been portrayed in other States as a State where COVID cases are on the rise. Karnataka and Maharashtra made COVID-negative certificates mandatory for people from Kerala visiting those States,” he added. The government must prevail upon States to withdraw regulations. It must also permit tourists who have a confirmed travel and accommodation itinerary and who register on the COVID Jagrata portal to travel across the State, while adhering to the protocol. International travellers who arrive with tourist/medical visa and have confirmed booking in any hospital too must be considered similarly, he said. Former Kerala Travel Mart president Abraham George said restrictions were turning away tourists from Kerala. “Simultaneously, Sri Lanka has stepped up its marketing of Ayurveda. Apart from relaxing curbs, the government must convey the message that Kerala is safe for travel. It will help the State bounce back,” he observed. Riyaz U.C., convenor of FICCI’s tourism committee, spoke of how most Indians visited Sri Lanka for leisure. “That country banks heavily on tourists from Europe and Russia for Ayurveda and wellness. Kerala must not yield ground to Sri Lanka on the sectors. For now, the situation can improve if Kerala is able to attract domestic tourists in good numbers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-may-lose-ayurveda-tourism-to-sri-lanka/article33958464.ece

Long-distance buses as well as buses serving the city should terminate services at Kakkanad, and a centralised facility is needed immediately, the memorandum said. The association felt that most facilities in the municipality were established when it had a population of around 20,000. However, with its growing importance in the administration of the district, the growth of Kakkanad has been phenomenal.

Mohandas Nair from the MCH, Kozhikode; Shefali Gulati from All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi; Vinod Scaria from IGIB; Aman Sharma from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, Punjab; and Sumita Danda from Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, presented papers.  Mostly genetic According to IAP sources, diseases affecting less than one in 5,000 people are called rare diseases, which are around 7,000 in number. Around 75% are genetic disorders. Almost 50% of these affect small children. They said that though most of these diseases were incurable, through early detection their condition could be managed and treatment expense controlled. There were treatments for some of the diseases, but they were expensive, said the IAP sources. If one child in a family is diagnosed with a disease, techniques are now available to prevent other children getting affected, through prenatal detection. The IAP functionaries said that the genetic clinic functioning at the MCH for the past 15 years was one of its kind in the Malabar region where counselling for parents and children, diagnosis of the disease, treatment, and awareness about pre-natal detection were being done.

01 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Goods vehicle owners express concern over scrappage policy||Expressing serious concerns over the newly issued scrappage policy of the Union government, national and State-level leaders of the All India Confederation of Goods Vehicle Owners’ Association (AICGVOA) have directly approached the Union Ministry of State for Road Transport and Highways for a favourable amendment. Instead of the straight dismantling of all goods vehicles more than 15 years old, they have proposed to introduce an automated testing facility that can easily screen out all unfit ones and thus implement the plan without affecting the livelihood of a majority in the sector. Vehicle owners’ association, including the Kerala Lorry Owners’ Federation (LOF), say that such a scientific testing option will clearly give a picture of the exact engine condition of the vehicle. There should also be an option for the vehicle owners to address minor mechanical issues after such automated screening and produce it again for further clearance. Not practical Functionaries of the AICGVOA and the Lorry Owners Federation say about 50% of the goods carriers in the country will have to be dismantled if the government is planning to go ahead with the new scrappage policy. According to them, it will never be a practical option for thousands of vehicle owners. “We have made it clear that the age of the vehicle should not be considered as the sole criterion for vehicle scrappage as there are thousands of well-maintained vehicles in service with no mechanical faults at all. The fitness condition of the vehicle should be the criterion to review the permit,” says Shaju Almana, State general secretary of the Lorry Owners Federation. He also feels that Kerala will be the worst-affected State if old goods-carriers are kept off the road based on the new policy. According to him, the matter has already been discussed with Amit Varadan, Joint secretary of Road Transport and Highways, for a favourable action. “We are expecting an order soon that will propose automated testing facilities for vehicles and screen out only the unfit ones on the road,” he adds. The Union government came up with the new scrappage policy as part of the attempts to improve fuel efficiency, reduce pollution level, and promote the sales in the automobile sector. Meanwhile, the goods operators in various States came up with their protest citing that it would affect around one crore ageing vehicles. The main reason for such a protest was that the majority of older vehicles were owned by a very lower-income group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/goods-vehicle-owners-express-concern-over-scrappage-policy/article33958381.ece

Targeted cyberattacks and data manipulation attempts by fraudsters were projected as huge concerns by the experts at the summit. Delivering the keynote address, Additional Director General of Police Manoj Abraham, who is also the Nodal Officer of the Kerala Police Cyberdome, pointed out that there should be better vigil against targeted cyberattacks and the attempts to manipulate stolen data to tamper the reputation of big companies. Paradigm shift “Everything around us had a paradigm shift with the digital transition from the physical world. Acceleration of digital transformation has also taken place with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Cybercrimes are also increasing in pace with these rapid transitions,” said Mr. Abraham. New forms He said that new forms of ransomware and phishing were found creating a lot of problems during the pandemic. He said people should be ready to invest more time and energy to get advanced defence tools for cybersecurity. As many as 18 talks were held on the concluding day by experts who explained in detail the strategies to face cybersecurity threats and the loopholes to look out for. The importance of having a proper data backup plan was stressed by many of them as it would help companies minimise the impact of cyberattacks and get back on track without suffering much loss. Better training There was also a proposal to offer better training for employees on responsible and healthy use of digital resources at work and to prevent the possible entry of hackers. Some of the presentations pointed out that hackers were mostly found targeting individuals to get into the company network.  Acceleration of digital transformation has also taken place with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.

But now, the institution is struggling to stay afloat. Rehabilitation Ensuring the protection of destitute people was a challenging task for the Kozhikode district administration after the pandemic hit a year ago. Around 2,000 of them from different parts of the city were accommodated at various schools and fed from community kitchens. But after the lockdown was lifted, questions arose on their rehabilitation, and the idea of a body for their protection was mooted. Thus Udayam Charitable Society was formed. It is a joint venture of the district administration, district panchayat, Kozhikode Corporation, and the Department of Social Justice. The initiative is supported by Daya Rehabilitation Trust. The society is chaired by the District Collector, while officials from Social Justice, Revenue, Health and Police departments are its office-bearers. The services of Udayam include rescue of homeless/destitute people from streets and hospitals, psychological assessment and interventions, provision of healthcare, including psychiatric and de-addiction services, family counselling, and skill development. Over the past one year, Udayam has been able to help over 1,000 people. While around 100 of them got reunited with their families, many got jobs, and many others received appropriate health care. Vocational training With a lot of services like vocational training programme lined up, Udayam needs financial support from individuals and organisations. Three homes The destitute people are now accommodated in three homes across the city, while two new permanent homes are being planned at Vellayil and Chevayur, for which funds are essential. Those interested can contact Udayam at 0495-2371911 or 9207391138, a press release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/society-for-destitute-struggles-to-stay-afloat/article33958391.ece

Hypersensitive booths will get additional security cover by the Armed Forces based on the safety assessment report and mapping. Constituencies where the presence of Maoist activists has been confirmed by investigation teams will get high security. All such locations have been covered in the first round of field-level assessment by senior police officers. Thunderbolt Based on intelligence inputs, the proposed polling stations at St. George High School, Vilangad, Abhayagiri Government Welfare School and Indira Nagar Village Office are likely to get high-security cover this time. The presence of Thunderbolt commandos will be ensured along forest areas where the presence of Maoists has been confirmed. A decision on the deployment of Central forces will be taken after the final round of vulnerability assessment covering hypersensitive areas such as Thottilpalam, Koorachundu, Valayam and Peruvannamoozhi. There will be regular patrolling in these areas till the end of the election process. The movement of vehicles and suspicious persons will be monitored by plainclothesmen. Police sub divisions The number of police sub divisions will be increased in city and rural areas. In the rural limits, the existing three sub divisions will be increased to eight for better security management. In the city limits, there will be four sub divisions. A meeting of senior police officers will be convened shortly to discuss the mapping process and other safety issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ahead-of-polls-police-begin-vulnerability-assessment-in-district/article33958396.ece

According to functionaries of Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics (CAPSULE) Kerala, a platform under the KSSP, one ration card holder is getting two face masks each. The Civil Supplies Department is distributing them through the public distribution system. The criterion for distribution is not clear though it has been presumed that they are for the prevention of COVID-19. As society is yet to completely recover from the pandemic, people may view distribution of face masks only as a preventive measure. U. Nandakumar, CAPSULE functionary, pointed out that the cloth masks were found to be single-layered and porous. “If the face masks are to protect people from the infection, they should at least be double-layered and should not be porous. The World Health Organisation’s guidelines say that fabric face masks should have more than two layers. Distribution of single-layered face masks is not only unscientific, but also carries risks for those who wear them,” he said. The CAPSULE functionaries said the authorities should ensure that the face masks being provided to the people were following the existing protocol. Meanwhile, people who received the masks have also reportedly raised complaints through social media. In some ration shops, the stock has been exhausted. It is learnt that some officials too are not happy with the quality of the face masks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/substandard-face-masks-being-given-through-ration-shops/article33958395.ece

Speaking to a mammoth crowd of predominantly youngsters at the Democratic Youth Federation of India's ‘Yuva Maha Sammelanam’ here on Sunday, he said that the past five years were spent in laying the foundation for this, the fruits of which will be visible sooner. Mr.Vijayan spent the better part of the speech in comparing his government’s record in these sectors over the past five years to that of United Democratic Front’s performance in the previous tenure. “Though the Kerala model has been much lauded in the past, it had fallen into a rut. During the previous UDF government’s tenure, five lakh students had shifted out of our schools, while during the LDF’s tenure 6.8 lakh students have been newly enrolled, thanks to improvement in infrastructure and academic standards. All of these were funded through KIIFB, which the Opposition had initially dismissed as a pipe dream. Now, the higher education sector is set to witness even bigger changes. Cutting edge courses have been introduced. Many students have been going outside for higher studies.This is set to change with Kerala becoming a higher education hub,” he said. He said that the government plans to provide digital skills training to 50 lakh youth so that they can match up to the changing work culture. More than 55,000 youth and 200 companies have registered with a job portal launched by the government recently. The overnment has also set a record by providing employment for 1,57,911 persons through the PSC. Mr.Vijayan accused the ‘right-wing’ media and the opposition of trying to mislead the public on this and several other issues. But, the public who are aware of these tricks did not fall for it, he said. He said the recent controversies including the one around deep sea trawler deal was a result of the opposition's frustration at local body poll results. Flays Rahul Hitting out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, he said that Mr.Gandhi, who is a ‘good tourist’, is never seen campaigning in States where the Congress is in direct fight with the BJP.

01 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Hectic discussions on to finalise seats||Seat-sharing talks gathered momentum both in the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Sunday. By one account, Congress leaders were engaged in marathon talks with the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). The IUML has reportedly demanded more seats. Sources put the number at seven. The Congress is likely to cede to the IUML three more seats. The IUML had contested in 24 seats in 2016. A UDF insider said the IUML leadership was keen to avoid the optics of dictating terms to the Congress. The LDF had portrayed IUML as an Islamist party and said that it would eclipse a ‘weakened’ Congress in the UDF soon. Apparently, the IUML does not want to provide more sensational grist to its opponents. Kerala Congress (M)’s [KC(M)] P.J. Joseph faction reportedly remained a stumbling block to an early seat-sharing settlement. Mr. Joseph had demanded 15 seats contested by the KC(M). The Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) has sought four seats. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that the UDF would finalise seat-sharing on Monday. The front would make a public announcement on March 3. He is also likely to unveil the UDF’s election manifesto. District panels’ list The LDF is also expected finalise seat-sharing soon. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and the Communist Party of India (CPI), the two major constituents of the front, have reportedly stated that they are not opposed to giving up a few seats to accommodate the KC(M) and Loktantrik Janata Dal. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has reportedly demanded four seats. The CPI(M) has also asked its district committees to submit a panel of candidates with a high chance of success. The CPI has also initiated a similar exercise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hectic-discussions-on-to-finalise-seats/article33958428.ece
01 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Moray eel at capital zoo gets fresh lease of life||A 600-g moray eel exhibited in the aquarium at the city zoo has got a new lease of life. The female eel that had been attacked by a fellow eel and left severely injured has a shot at staying alive, courtesy the zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander. On Saturday morning, the eel that was exhibited in a glass tank had been found by a keeper with its stomach bitten and the contents, including internal organs, hanging out. Challenge Dr. Alexander who was informed saw the need for emergency surgery to put back the stomach contents inside the fish. The challenge though was how to operate upon fish that live in water. Special anaesthetic and equipment had to be procured for the surgery. While giving the nod for the surgery, zoo director Abu S. had also asked Dr. Alexander to look into whether such a procedure had been performed on fish earlier. Two Chengannur veterinary surgeons Tittu Abraham and Amritha Lakshmi K.U. who had done their internship training at the city zoo and had prior experience with the procedure came on board immediately and reached the city to assist Dr. Alexander. The three veterinarians performed the surgery the same afternoon. The fish tank was moved into the operation theatre and the eel then placed in a tray placed on the operation table. One bucket was filled with normal water and another with anaesthesia. When the need to increase anaesthesia was felt, anaesthetic water was pumped and when it was felt to be adequate, normal water would be pumped in a bid to manage vital signs. After nearly two-and-a-half hours of surgery, the eel was released into the water, and after the anaesthesia wore off, it displayed righting reflex and was soon swimming. The eel was coming along fine on Sunday, Dr. Alexander said. However, it could not be said to be out of the woods yet as its stomach and internal organs had prolapsed during the attack. Though vital organs mostly remained intact, its ovary, with plenty of small eggs, had to be removed before the eel could be stitched up again, he said. Specialisation Dr. Alexander said the surgery had shown that such procedures could be performed, and more specialisation should be made available to facilitate these. It also underlined that like any other animal, a fish experiencing pain needed relief. However, such treatments or surgeries were not frequent. Neither were these taught to students in veterinary colleges. It was high-time that training was given to students in such surgical procedures so that the suffering of fish and other creatures too could be alleviated, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/moray-eel-at-zoo-gets-new-life/article33958460.ece
01 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Cases among health staff come down||Vaccination is a powerful tool to break the transmission of COVID-19 and while it is early days yet, the initial indications from Kerala also point towards the fact that new infections are on the way down amongst the vaccinated group. The percentage of health-care workers amongst the new cases of COVID-19 reported in the State has been going down, after the vaccination for health staff as a priority group was initiated on January 16. “It is too early to make sweeping statements but it is a fact that the percentage of health-care workers amongst the new COVID-19 cases reported in Kerala has gone down by 40% after they began to be vaccinated. If the proportion of health-care workers amongst those infected was around 1-1.2%, it now constitutes only about 0.6%,” says Arun N.M., an infectious diseases expert, who examined the data. ‘Good protection’ “Remember that most of the health workers have received only one dose (the second dose uptake process is still on). This indicates that even with just one dose, the vaccine (Covishield), offers good protection, as Oxford-AstraZeneca studies demonstrated,” he adds. The proportion of new infections in the vaccinated and unvaccinated group would give the actual picture but this data is not available in the public domain, Dr. Arun says. The proportion of health-care workers who got infected after receiving the first dose/both doses of vaccine and whether there were any hospitalisations amongst the health workers who got infected after vaccination are valuable data that the State should be looking at. The second dose is being administered after four weeks but the uptake of the second dose of vaccine has been slow amongst health-care workers mostly because many want to delay it beyond eight weeks, as advised by the WHO. Inter-dose interval Increased efficacy with longer inter-dose interval has been clearly demonstrated in the three-nation Phase III trial data of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine efficacy was reported to be 76% after a first dose, with protection maintained till the second dose . With an inter-dose interval of 12 weeks or more, vaccine efficacy increased to 82%. The pre-print of the study in The Lancet said that the vaccine was safe and effective in preventing COVID-19, with no severe cases or hospitalisations, more than 22 days after the first dose. The fact that new infections have begun to come down amongst those who received a single dose of vaccine in Kerala too should dispel any vaccine hesitancy among the public. However, a public health expert pointed out that the State should sequence viruses affecting vaccinated persons as a matter of priority.  Most health-care workers have received only one dose because many want to delay the second dose beyond eight weeks, as advised by the WHO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cases-among-health-staff-come-down/article33958433.ece
01 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||With eye on continuity, LDF campaign hinges on Pinarayi||Feel good videos and inspirational memes released so far by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) to woo voters seem to feature Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan solely. The ruling front’s mainstream and social media outreach seemed to have pushed the perception that Mr. Vijayan and none else is the LDF’s next Chief Minister candidate. Many viewed the LDF’s apparent gambit to project Mr. Vijayan as its “trump card,” a break with the past. Customarily, the LDF has sidestepped feelers about the Chief Minister candidate during the campaign phase. Tellingly, the LDF leaders had tiptoed around the question when “factionalism” was at its peak in the CPI(M) ahead of the 2016 Assembly polls. Both Mr. Vijayan and former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan were in the fray then. Notably, on Sunday, LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan invited Mr. Vijayan to accept the ruling coalition’s election catchphrase: “For sure it is the LDF.” At a stroke, the LDF appeared to signal continuity of leadership if voted to power. Criticism By placing Mr. Vijayan at the centre of its re-election bid, the LDF could arguably open itself to the Opposition criticism that it has set the incumbent Chief Minister at the centre of a personality cult befitting an identity-centric monolithic party. The Congress and the BJP had often portrayed Mr. Vijayan as an authoritarian. The LDF’s clear pitch for Mr. Vijayan as its next Chief Minister candidate has arguably put the onus on the United Democratic Front (UDF) and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to indicate their choices for the post. However, the UDF appeared hard-pressed given the galaxy of top leaders in the fray. They purportedly include former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran. The NDA is also fielding an assemblage of top BJP leaders, making it potentially awkward for the coalition to identify any one person as its Chief Minister candidate. The names include V. Muraleedharan, Kummanam Rajasekharan, P.K. Krishnadas and M.T. Ramesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-eye-on-continuity-ldf-campaign-hinges-on-pinarayi/article33958426.ece

State-run institutions should be free of religious interventions and the contest of education is better left to the professionals in each discipline, she said. She was participating an online lecture series on ‘India – secularism, democracy and socialism’ organised jointly by Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC), Kerala Council of Historical Research (KCHR) and Chintha Publishers in honour of historian K.N. Panikkar on Sunday. Cautioned Prof. Thapar, Professor Emeritus at Jawaharlal Nehru University, also cautioned against allowing religion to legitimise politics and political activity. “While democracy required political parties to distance themselves from religion, there is often an attempt to construct a new sect while maintaining a facade over this distance. This is done in a way that it allows a religion to be used politically. A clear example of this is Hindutva,” she said. Autonomy She felt secularism did not require a denial of religion as a legitimate belief system, but an autonomy of civil institutions from religious control. It also implied the dismissal of existence of majority and minority communities that were identified by religion. Noted economist Prabhat Patnaik said the ongoing farmers strike has shown that contemporary neo-fascism that could be ruthless and even subvert democracy and secularism for a brief while lacked the wherewithal to acquire the kind of legitimacy that they would have otherwise acquired if they had a credible economic programme. Prof. Panikkar, in his reply speech, said that idea of secular nationalism has come under severe strain. The Indian society in recent times has been subjected to considerable irrationality and social obscurantism as well as political backwardness. The tradition of modern India seems to be slipping towards medieval irrationality. Modernity is being discarded in preference to notions of belief. Social welfare measures have been discarded in favour of capitalism development and in the process, democratic values have given way to authoritarianism, he lamented Irfan Habib, Professor Emeritus, Aligarh Muslim University; Rajeev Bhargava, Professor, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies; KSHEC vice-chairman Rajan Gurukkal, KCHR chairman Michael Tharakan also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/keep-religion-out-of-education-romila/article33958597.ece

Election officials had flagged 1,33,005 PwD voters on the final voters’ list published on January 20. Work on the preparation of the supplementary voters’ list is in progress in the State. The present campaign was necessitated by the fact that the actual number of PwD voters could be much higher, as per the data on differently abled persons available with the Social Justice Department. More than 2 lakh This data are now being used to pinpoint eligible voters of voting age who can be included on the PwD voters’ list. “The campaign has already helped identify more than two lakh PwD voters,” a senior election official said. The campaign is meant to guarantee special facilities such as postal ballots to all eligible PwD voters, the official said. An option for voluntary disclosure by an elector for inclusion in the PwD category was launched during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in the State.

Mande has warned that the COVID-19 crisis is far from being over and that allowing a ‘third wave’ by lowering our guard could have serious consequences. He was speaking on ‘Ïndia’s response to COVID-19 from S & T perspective’ at the virtual “National Science Day Lectures,”organised by Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology here on Sunday. RGCB Director Chandrabhas Narayana moderated the digital lectures. Dr Mande expressed the hope that the COVID-19 vaccines would be effective against virus variants. The evidence “is not very strong” that the vaccines would not work against the mutated virus. “We would like to believe that the vaccines are effective against the variants as the vaccines worked against the entire virus while the mutations took place on just a part of the virus,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-crisis-far-from-over-csir-chief/article33958600.ece

They identified six new species of cuckoo wasps collected from various parts of the country. The team, research scholar Aswathi P.G. and Bijoy C. of Shadpada Entomology Research Lab (SERL), zoology department, Christ College, along with Italian researcher Paulo Rosa, conducted the study. Updated checklist They prepared an illustrated and updated checklist of the Indian Chrisididae with synonyms and distributional summaries. The list includes 105 species in 20 genera. Among them, six species are described as new. “This is an exclusive study on Indian cuckoo wasps after the British study of 1903. So far, 105 species of this family have been reported from India. The study discovered six new chrysidids,” noted Dr. Bijoy. Cuckoo wasps trespass the nests of wasps and breed there as cuckoos do to crows’ nests, hence the name.  Endemic species  According to the study, of the known Indian chrysidid species, 47% are endemic to India. It was published in the latest edition of international journal Zootaxa. Elampus gladiator (collected from Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh); Chrysis aswathiae, Chrysis baldocki, and Chrysis bernasconii (collected from Tamil Nadu), Chrysis polita (collected from West Bengal and from Uttaranchal) and Chrysis travancoriana (collected from Kerala and Tamil Nadu) are the new species identified during the study. One of the new species is named after Ms. Aswathi (Chrysis aswathiae). The SERL is the only research laboratory in India concentrating on research of cuckoo wasps. Solitary bees, antlions and grasshoppers are the other focal areas of the SERL. The study is funded by CSIR, New Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/six-new-species-of-cuckoo-wasps-identified/article33958578.ece

Infrastructure Kerala Ltd (Inkel), which is implementing the project, floated a tender a few days ago for the remaining civil work and mechanical, plumbing and electrification work, at a cost of Rs. 152.54 crore and a contract period of 24 months. “Hopefully this will speed up the process. Only around 40% of work has been completed so far,” said Dr. Moni Kuriakose, Director, CCRC. Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), which is funding the project, had directed Inkel to stop the construction of the centre in December last year on the grounds that the contractor’s work was delayed and of poor quality. The contractor had later filed a petition in the High Court challenging the termination of contract. The total project cost is Rs. 379 crore, including specialised medical equipment for the centre, according to an official with Inkel. “Civil work had been awarded to the contractor for Rs. 89 crore. The medical equipment itself amounts to over Rs. 100 crore,” the official said. Work on the centre began in July 2018. Meanwhile, the cancer centre, which has been functioning out of the Ernakulam General Hospital and the Indira Gandhi Co-operative Hospital, will soon move back to the premises of the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) at Kalamassery. From March 2 till 8, the centre will work from both the General Hospital and the MCH. From March 8 onwards, the centre will work full-time at the MCH. When the MCH was declared a COVID-19 care centre last year, the cancer centre moved to the General Hospital and used the operation theatres of the Indira Gandhi Co-operative Hospital for surgeries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ccrc-work-being-retendered/article33958402.ece

The newly enrolled members will be trained in all aspects such as popularising the party policies and building a credible network in the rural areas,” Mr. Manohar told The Hindu during his recent four-day tour of East Godavari district. Training “All the members will undergo basic training before working for the party in their respective areas. They will also be connected to the respective wings in the party to enable them to find solutions to nagging issues,” Mr. Manohar said. Motivating factor In the gram panchayat elections, more than 500 aspirants supported by the JSP had won the sarpanch seats, Mr. Manohar claimed. A sizeable number of candidates backed by the JSP had won the ward member posts too, he added. “The results and vote share in the panchayat election are the key motivating factors,” he observed. “The Rs. 500 being charges towards membership fee may be exorbitant, but it will mostly be spent on the welfare of the party workers, particularly in the event of health emergency,” Mr. Manohar said, and added that the party had designed a robust accident claim policy for its active members.

01 March 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Officials worry as cases in villages bordering Karnataka on the rise||The sudden spike in coronavirus cases in Chittoor district, from its daily average of 20 to 41 on Sunday, had the health officials worried. New cases have emerged in Madanapalle, Punganur, Palamaner and Kuppam mandals, which border with Karnataka. Detection of three new cases in Kuppam which included an aged couple and their pregnant daughter-in-law, on Saturday has set alarm bells ringing with the officials scurrying to identify the contacts of them. It was found that the family had travelled to Kolar district in Karnataka in the recent weeks. With restoration of road and rail services between Bengaluru and Chennai via Kuppam, the passenger traffic has been growing. From Kuppam and its surrounding hamlets, close to two thousand people, mostly youth, travel daily to Bengaluru as they work there as daily wagers or doing outsourced jobs. Similarly, people have resumed their regular works for which they travel to Bengaluru, Chintamani and Kolar. This has put officials on alert as Karnataka has been witnessing a spike in daily cases, with the number crossing 400. Coming to the eastern mandals in Chittoor district, an 8-year-old girl tested positive at Veluru in Pitchatur mandal, which aggravated the fear among the people. The officials said that the girl’s family had a travel history to Chennai. Contact-tracing intensified Detection of new cases in Puthalapattu mandal prompted District Panchayat Officer Prabhakar Reddy to visit the villages concerned. He asked the field staff to intensify tracing of secondary contacts of the patients, and their travel history. District Medical and Health Officer M. Penchalaiah said arrangements were being made for the vaccination drive for those who fall in the age bracket of above 60 years and 45-plus with co-morbid conditions. “The ground level staff are educating the people to not let their guard down and wear masks and use sanitisers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/officials-worry-as-cases-in-villages-bordering-karnataka-on-the-rise/article33958555.ece
01 March 2021||Harish Gilai,ANDHRA PRADESH||Unfulfilled promises make residents of Venkatapuram sick||Located at the foothills of Simhachalam and five km from NAD Junction, not many knew about RR Venkatapuram about a year ago. But the village with about 3,500 people grabbed global attention on May 7, 2020, after styrene vapour leaked from LG Polymers, a chemical plant located in the village, killing 11 persons and making hundreds of persons sick. Almost 10 months have gone by, but the assurances given by the State government to the residents still remain on paper. With the municipal elections ahead, the locals are now questioning about the unfulfilled promises. One of the main promises the government had given to the villagers is to set up a hospital in the village. As a temporary measure, a small clinic was opened in in a school. The locals allege that though the officials promised to ensure availability of doctors round the clock, the only doctor in the hospital is irregular . “We have been suffering from stomach ache, headache, allergies, skin issues and respiratory issues, but officials not addressed our problems,” they complain. K. Gopi, a resident of RR Venkatapuram, who lost his father K. Satyanarayana in the incident, said that his family members have been suffering from stomach ache and skin allergies very often. “But the doctor here provides just basic treatment and refers us to King George Hospital (KGH). We are forced to spend expenses for the treatment,” he said. B. Appalaraju, a resident of Venkatapuram, said that since the LG Polymers incident, he had spent about Rs. 20,000 as medical expenses for himself and his family members. It may be noted that the building in which the hospital is being run is actually a government school. Due to the COVID-19 situation and closure of schools, the hospital was run in all the three rooms of the school. After reopening of schools, the hospital was shifted to one small room, where there is space for just one single bed. When this correspondent visited the hospital, the doctor was unavailable. The staff said that the doctor would be coming soon. When questioned about the number of patients the hospital receives, the staff informed that at least 20 patients approach them daily. “Most of the patients approach us with skin allergy, fevers, stomach aches and other issues,” the staff said. “Moreover, we were promised regular clinical check-up, as per the long-term health monitoring that was recommended both by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that was set up to inquire into the incident,” Mr. Appalaraju said. Locals from the SC Colony, who were also affected by the incident, said that they fear consuming the groundwater. While many locals purchase water cans, those who cannot afford them consume the water released by the municipality after boiling it. Kumari, a resident of Venkatapuram, who runs a bakery, said that none of the officials had come to the village and enquired about their living conditions or whether they had any health issues. She said that the government has promised to provide health cards to the villages. But only a book was given, she added. “Despite taking appointment several times, the new management is not giving us a chance to meet them,” said Chinni, a former contract worker of LG Polymers and a resident of Venkatapuram. Crop loss The locals also allege that several farmers had lost their crops last year due to the pollution that resulted from the vapour leak. “After the incident, I had to dump many bags of rice. The paddy crops which were laid was also damaged last year. I had to suffer a loss of more than Rs. 50,000,” said Mr. Appalaraju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/unfulfilled-promises-make-residents-of-venkatapuram-sick/article33958630.ece

Though the land owners accosted the civic officials and demanded them to produce the order copy, the latter reportedly dodged and evaded a reply. The theatre owners also came in support of the tea stall, saying it was well within their land and hence the civic officials had no business to demolish the same. The TDP leaders said the wife of the tea stall owner, a contestant in the civic polls on behalf of their party, had allegedly been receiving coercive calls from the ruling party leaders to withdraw from the fray. “ the YSRCP leaders are bent on striking at the financial roots of their opponents,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/demolition-drive-takes-political-turn-in-tirupati/article33958565.ece

BJP national secretary and State co-in-charge Sunil Deodhar squarely blamed Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for the alleged diversion of fund and said that the YSRCP government had no qualms in siphoning off the funds sanctioned for the development of the city. Mr. Deodhar, who has been camping for the byelection to the Tirupati parliamentary constituency, participated in the campaign for the municipal elections on Sunday. He took part in the electioneering for BJP candidate for the 29th ward (Nehru Nagar) Kondeti Ratna and appealed to the voters to strengthen the party’s hands.  ‘High-handed behaviour’ “The YSRCP is neck deep in corruption. Even as the Centre has sanctioned Rs. 500 crore for the development of Tirupati, the YSRCP government diverted it and did not spend a single rupee as intended,” he alleged. Referring to the only eleven nominations filed on behalf of the BJP – Jana Sena alliance, Mr. Deodhar blamed it on the high-handed behaviour of the ruling party workers, who he said had prevented the alliance candidates from filing nominations. Mr. Deodhar also took potshots at the TDP. “Having lost the support of the people, the TDP now is fighting to get at least the second or third position,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/deodhar-accuses-ysrcp-govt-of-diverting-central-funds/article33958079.ece

01 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Keep ward volunteers away from civic polls, says SEC||State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar on Sunday directed the District Collectors and District Election Authorities to completely keep the ward volunteers away from the process of elections to the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in order to maintain strict neutrality, and not entrust to them (volunteers) the distribution of authenticated photo voter slips. The volunteers should be restrained from direct or indirect participation and, thereby, prevented from influencing the outcome of elections by leveraging and misusing their reach to the public as a conduit of government benefits and schemes. Mr. Ramesh Kumar also instructed that the movements of ward volunteers be closely monitored and their phones kept in safe custody as the database of the beneficiaries was likely to be leveraged and misused. ‘Ensure neutrality’ The SEC stated in a press release that serious complaints related to ward volunteers, as in the case of the gram panchayat elections, were brought to his notice during the consultative process with the political parties. He observed that the elections to the ULBs were qualitatively different from the gram panchayat elections as they were fought on party lines. There was a need for strict neutrality of all categories of government servants, and the volunteers were no exception, he said. The Commission, therefore, resolved to completely isolate the ward volunteers from the process of ULB elections being fought in a highly charged atmosphere.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/keep-ward-volunteers-away-from-civic-polls-says-sec/article33958570.ece

In a statement on Sunday, the federation’s State president S. Ramakrishna pointed to the steady increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the State, especially in Chittoor district. He said cases were also reported from schools in that district. Referring to the resurgence of the pandemic in Maharashtra where the government had declared a holiday for schools till March 14, Mr. Ramakrishna said the Centre had also asked the States to strengthen measures to curb the spread of the virus. ‘Implement norms strictly’ He urged the authorities concerned to ensure strict implementation of the basic guidelines of COVID-19 in schools. Each classroom should not have more than 16 students, relaxation of the ‘compulsory attendance’ rule for students and teachers and declaration of half day schools in view of the early summer heat. The federation leader also wanted the government to order cancellation of exams for Classes 1 to 9 and promote students to the next class. He said the traditional pattern of written examination for the 10th class should be done away with and instead, an objective type question paper using OMR sheets should be prepared and the exam should be completed by May. This would not only spare teachers the spot valuation process but also save money, he suggested. He said the system of imparting classroom lessons through television channels should be revived.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-vaccine-sought-for-teachers-students/article33958084.ece

Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS) extended its support to the camp by sending a ‘pink bus’ to conduct free cancer detection tests for the rural women. Inaugurating the health camp, APGDA secretary P. Ravi Raju said that their prime objective was to stress the importance of conducting tests. Free of cost “As cancer detection tests cost thousands of rupees, the SVIMS is conducting them free of cost at the camps. Experts will also extend medical and surgical treatments to the ones diagnosed by referring them to higher institutes,” Dr. Ravi Raju said, adding that that the treatment would be covered under the YSR Arogya Sri and Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Pranadhana schemes. SVIMS Director B. Vengamma said the mobile units had conducted cancer tests on 7,600 women free of cost in the rural areas. Earlier, the APGDA members felicitated Dr. Vengamma for successfully completing 67 camps in a very short span, benefiting the target group in the rural areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pink-bus-to-perform-cancer-test-in-rural-areas/article33958553.ece

01 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID-19 vaccination for high-risk citizens from today||From Monday, the State Health department will start administering COVID-19 vaccine to people aged 60 years and above, as well as those in the 45-59 years age bracket having co-morbidities. While officials had said one can either register online for the vaccination or by walking into a vaccination centre, only the former mode would be allowed for the first few days. Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said people can register on ‘cowin.gov.in’. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has said that registration will open at 9 a.m on Monday and can also be done through other IT apps such as Aarogya Setu. On Monday, the immunisation will be rolled out at 93 centres across the State which will be increased to over 1,000 centres in a week. They will include government and private hospitals. The jabs will not be given at home, outside hospitals or at other health centres. To begin the registration, mobile number has to be provided. One-time password (OTP) will be sent to mobile number. Verifying the OTP will lead to ‘Registration of vaccination’ page. Seven identity cards such as Aadhaar and Electoral Photo Identity Card are listed which can be used for the registration. Beneficiaries have to enter their basic details such as name, gender, age, ID card details, and others. After creating an account, three more people can be added with the same phone number. Beneficiaries can select date and vaccination centre of their choice. Dr Srinivasa Rao said the second dose should be taken within 29 to 42 days after the first dose. However, he advised people to ideally take it on 29th or 30th day. Beneficiaries will not be provided with an option to choose a vaccine and the brand for the first and second dose will be the same. Those who want to get vaccine on March 1 can register till 3 p.m. on Monday. Vaccine charges The vaccines will be administered free of cost at government health facilities. However, people have to shell out money if they choose to get the jab at a private hospital. Senior officials said people have to bear expenses if they get admitted for any Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI). Dr Srinivasa Rao said one dose of vaccine costs Rs. 150, and private hospitals can charge a maximum of Rs. 100 as service charge over. He said it is the prerogative of a private hospital to waive off the service charge or bill it for less than Rs. 100. Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy directed private hospitals to ensure that their regular patients do not get mixed up with vaccine beneficiaries. This is to avoid possible transmission of coronavirus from patients to beneficiaries. Therefore, a doctor has to be present at the vaccination centre. Officials have urged people not to crowd vaccination centres as the drive will be conducted for four to five months. Dr Ramesh Reddy said online registrations helps to schedule appointment according to convenience. Co-morbidities In case of people who are in the 45-59 year age group with co-morbidities, they would be asked to upload certificate of co-morbidity during the registration and carry it along with them to the vaccination site. Proforma of the certificate will be accessible on the cowin website. List of 20 conditions or illnesses which qualify as co-morbidities will be listed in the certificate. Dr Ramesh Reddy said the proforma has been sent to all doctor associations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-19-vaccination-for-high-risk-citizens-from-today/article33958350.ece
01 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KTR urges BCCI not to leave out Hyderabad for IPL matches||Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao has appealed to the BCCI and the IPL Governing Council to ensure that Hyderabad was one of the venues for this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. The tweet said: “Open appeal to @BCCI and @IPL office bearers to include Hyderabad as one of the venues for upcoming IPL season. Our effective COVID containment measures are reflected in our low number of cases among all metro cities in India & we assure you of all support from the Govt.’’ Though officially the BCCI has not so far announced the venues for the upcoming 2021 IPL, season media reports said that Hyderabad may not be part of this season, and Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Delhi will be the venues due to COVID-19 related measures. The Minister’s argument is that if COVID19 was the issue Hyderabad was better managed than most of the other cities being considered. The city cannot be denied the opportunity to host the IPL matches on Covid-19 grounds. Hyderabad is the official venue for Sun Risers Hyderabad team. Mr. Rama Rao apparently took upon himself to ensure that Hyderabad is not missed out on the final venues as the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) looked helpless at the BCCI doorsteps due to its internal squabbles. The HCA is plagued by differences with its president Mohd. Azharuddin and another group led by Secretary R. Vijayanand at loggerheads due to some organisational issues. Recently, six members of the Apex Council held a meeting, which Mr. Azharuddin preferred to ignore and call it unofficial as well. There is a difference of opinion among Mr. Azharuddin and other members over the conduct of the Annual General Meeting. Cricket lovers feel their differences have seriously affected Hyderabad players. In fact, not a single player from Hyderabad is part of the Sun Risers Hyderabad team. In the recent IPL auctions no player from Hyderabad was picked up by the SRH franchise leading to criticism. The TRS MLA and former Minister, Danam Nagender expressed his displeasure on the exclusion of city players openly and also called for an answer from the SRH franchise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-for-hyderabad-as-ipl-venue/article33958362.ece
01 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre for district-wise crop pattern||The Central government has suggested to the State to take up promotion of identified agriculture and allied sectors’ products in a cluster approach through convergence of Central government schemes envisaging increase in the value of the products with an ultimate aim of increasing the income of farmers. To be taken up under the One District One Focus Produce (ODOFP) programme, the list of products have been finalised after taking inputs from States/Union Territories and deliberations between Union Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare and Food Processing industries. The identified products would be supported under the PM-FME scheme of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries that provides incentives to promoter and micro-enterprises, the Union Agriculture Ministry said in a letter addressed to Chief Secretaries of all the States/UTs. Accordingly, products have been prioritised for all the districts across the State as part of the focused approach. The Centre suggested cultivation of chillies in Bhadradri-Kothagudem, Khammam, Bhupalpalli, Mahabubabad and Mulugu districts and groundnut in Jogulamba Gadwal, Narayanpet and Wanaparthy districts. Yadadri-Bhongir, Sangareddy and Siddipet have been preferred for milk-based products and Jagtial, Mancherial and Nagarkurnool for mangoes while cultivation of turmeric has been recommended for Nizamabad. Cultivation of soybean has been recommended in Adilabad, Kamareddy and Nirmal districts while Vikarabad and Rangareddy are favoured for vegetable cultivation in clusters. Hyderabad with other urban centres Medchal-Malkajgiri, Medak and Warangal Urban should promote industries dealing with ready-to-eat snacks. The Centre said in its letter that many products included convergence of resources and approach from other departments. The Union government would take steps to support ODOFP from its ongoing centrally-sponsored schemes like RKVY and thus, no separate funding would be required. The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairy have also been requested for similar convergence, the letter said. The converged resources approach would make the programme robust and sustainable and would help in making it a success. The State governments were accordingly requested to plan for implementation of the programme, which could benefit farmers and provide support for realising the expectations of value addition and subsequently enhancing agricultural export.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-for-district-wise-crop-pattern/article33958366.ece
01 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TSRTC faces crushing losses||It is a double whammy for the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC). On the one hand it is dealing a decrease in earnings per kilometre, and on the other, given the COVID – 19 pandemic, it is struggling to increase its occupancy ratio which was 56.72 in January 2021. What has exacerbated the problem is the continuous rise in diesel prices. The transport juggernaut procures diesel by means of the consumer mode of pricing. This is different from retail mode pricing which is applicable on the average vehicle owner. As on Saturday, the retail mode of pricing stood at Rs. 88.85. As compared to retail mode of pricing, the consumer mode of pricing is marginally lesser. But despite this, the sources said that the TSRTC is facing crushing losses as there is no increase in revenues for different reasons, including an ageing fleet. Data indicates that earnings per kilometre (EPK) up to January 2020 was Rs. 31.30. Upon comparison with the EPK from April 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021, the EPK stood at Rs. 26.12. This despite the fact that TSRTC improved its kilometre per litre efficiency from 5.13 kmpl up to from April 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020 to 5.43 from April 1, 2020 to January this year. The loss incurred from April 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020 was over Rs. 400 crore. This increased in the next year over the same period to approximately Rs. 1,950 crore. Data shows that the gross EPK till January 2020 was Rs. 38.41. But on account of uses going off the roads due to the lockdown, and other important factors, such as high diesel prices, this plunged to Rs. 27.46. “The steady increase in diesel prices have have a crippling effect on the revenues. The TSRTC uses lakhs of litres per day for its operations. As you can see, the fuel efficiency increase too is not helping much. The pandemic and the lockdown primarily have had a massively negative effect on the revenues,” a sources said. TSRTC unions, such as the TSRTC Employees Union, have been demanding that the State government ease the burden on the corporation by exempting Value Added Tax diesel procurement. They have also indicated that loss of revenue be compensated by the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tsrtc-faces-crushing-losses/article33958592.ece
01 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||PM lauds TS farmer in his ‘Mann ki Baat’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has complimented a farmer from Telangana, Chintala Venkat Reddy, for developing breeds of rice and wheat with vitamin D and getting patent rights for it from the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Speaking to people over All India Radio on Sunday as part of the 21st episode of his ‘Mann ki Baat’ 2.0 programme, he termed the achievement of Mr. Venkat Reddy as one of the innumerable examples of people contributing to ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, which he said has become a sentiment flowing in the hears of the common folk. “When we talk of science, then many a time people restrict it to physics-chemistry or labs. But, the spread of science is much more than that and there is a lot of contribution of the power of science in the Atmanirbhar Bharat Campaign”, the Prime Minister said underscoring the need to move science forward with the mantra of ‘Lab to Land’ . The Prime Minister stated a doctor friend of Mr. Venkat Reddy had told him (the farmer) about the diseases caused by deficiency of vitamin D and the dangers thereof. “Our government is fortunate that Mr. Venkat Reddy was also honoured with Padmashri award last year,” the Prime Minister mentioned. Union Minister of State for Home, G. Kishan Reddy was instrumental in taking Mr. Venkat Reddy’s achievements to the notice of the Prime Minister. Mr. Reddy felt that mention of the farmer’s achievement by the Prime Minister in his popular programme would be an inspiration for farmers across the country. The Minister had earlier recommended his name for Padmashri as well. Food for thought Making mention of Hyderabad again, Mr. Modi said that even a very small and simple question rankles the mind sometimes. “Although such questions are not very long and are very simple, they make us think. A few days ago one Aparna Reddy of Hyderabad had asked me one such question”. She asked: “You have been PM for so many years and were CM for so many years. Do you ever feel that something is missing?” Her question seems simple but was equally difficult. “I pondered this over and told myself that one of my shortcomings was that I could not make much effort to learn Tamil, one of the oldest languages in the world,” Mr. Modi said. The Prime Minister stated that he could not make himself learn Tamil. Many people had told him a lot about the quality of Tamil literature and the depth of the poems written in it. On the ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ to be held in March he requested all exam warriors (students), parents and teachers to share their experiences and tips on “MyGov” platform and Narendra Modi app. Along with the youth, parents and teachers were also invited to ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ this time, the Prime Minister noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-farmer-lauded-in-mann-ki-baat/article33958356.ece
01 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KTR urges Centre for scheme on ITIR lines||Information Technology and Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao has requested the Central government to consider providing a scheme or initiative in place of IT Investment Region (ITIR) to ensure that cities like Hyderabad continue to flourish and provide employment to youngsters. “The youth of Telangana are eagerly waiting for new employment opportunities that could be created with the support of the Central government in the IT sector. Cities like Hyderabad are the economic engines that contribute immensely for the country’s economy and it was therefore, important that such cities should be rewarded by way of new policy initiatives and incentives,” the Minister said. In a detailed letter addressed to Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Mr. Rama Rao said it was amply clear that the Union government was not inclined to continue the ITIR scheme. “I make an earnest request on their (youth) behalf to use your good offices to announce an initiative on the lines of ITIR,” he said. He recalled that numerous appeals were made on behalf of the Telangana government during the last six years to sanction funds for the ITIR in Hyderabad. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on multiple occasions, both personally and through official letters, to provide assistance to the ITIR project. “As the IT Minister for the State, I have also met you and requested you to release funds for the ITIR project,” he said. However, there was no response whatsoever from the Union government on this important initiative. Valuable time was lost as the State government kept pursuing the ITIR project without any response from the Union government. “Considering the importance of the IT sector and its contribution to the overall economy, a prompt response on this important matter would be appropriate. Lakhs of local youth have been deprived of employment due to the ‘lackadaisical attitude’ of the Union government,” he lamented. He also said that the ongoing pandemic had severe impact on several sectors across the globe, but the technology industry in Hyderabad faced minimum disruption in conducting its activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-urges-centre-for-scheme-on-itir-lines/article33958360.ece

Rama Rao for “cool, calm and an open discussion” at the University College of Arts and Social Sciences of Osmania University, at 11 a.m. on March 11, on the contribution of the government towards employment generation, expenditure on higher education, and employees issues, among others. In a communication to the MA&UD Minister, a copy of which was marked to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the media, on Sunday, Mr. Rao said that he was ready to withdraw from the contest if Mr. KTR was able to successfully answer the questions posed on the following issues or the latter has to apologise for making “uncalled for insinuations” against him. “How many jobs have been created in the last seven years? Why are there no vice-chancellors for most universities for the last few years? What happened to the 50,000 jobs’ notification? What happened to the TS Public Service Commission’s notification for Group I and II jobs? What is the amount spent on universities and the Rs. 200 crore announced for OU centenary celebrations?” The BJP leader also said that the ‘iconic’ Arts College was chosen as the venue for debate because it was the epicentre of the Telangana State agitation. “What I did as an MLC in the last six years is in public domain and it is for the graduates to take a call. But, I am not in the government and can only highlight people’s issues. The core issue is what has this government and the Chief Minister done,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-mlc-dares-ktr-for-open-debate/article33958364.ece

They alleged that Mr. Sanjay continued to hold the age-old view of demeaning Dalits and claimed that it reflected the mindset of BJP. “He represents a party that wants to ensure Dalits remain at the lower level of society and not progress in the modern age,” the MLAs argued in the letter. Mr. Sanjay, while participating in Santh Ravi Das birthday celebrations recently, had reportedly said that Dalits were not only good in making shoes but also have power to insert nails to harm politicians taking them for ride.

The TSRTC bus crew worked on the front line during lockdown in operating mobile outlets for distributing essential commodities in containment zones in adherence to the safety protocols last year, recalled TSRTC Employees’ Union Khammam region secretary P. Appa Rao. Several TSRTC employees tested positive and a few of them succumbed during the peak of the pandemic last year, he said. Bus drivers and conductors besides mechanics are at an increased risk of exposure to coronavirus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/call-for-free-vaccination-of-tsrtc-employees/article33958375.ece

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||A season of challenges in Telangana||Polls raise the heat The campaign for the upcoming election to Legislative Council seats under Graduates constituency quota have generated significant political heat. Graduates and employees being the focal point of the polls, contesting parties, the TRS and Congress, are resorting to challenges and counter challenges in terms of jobs provided by their respective governments. BJP too, chipped in with “facts and figures” while there is no holds barred contest on social media from both sides. The release of list of jobs provided during the six-year rule of the TRS by KTR has only accentuated the situation with opposition leaders calling him for a public debate on the issue. Mr. KTR has so far not communicated his intentions on whether or not he accepted the challenge though. It is high time parties focus on providing jobs rather than using the issue for political purposes. Teething problems Commencement of agricultural land transactions through Dharani portal brought cheer to farmers across the State and the process picked up considerably. Problems, however, are said to be persisting in some areas around the State capital causing hardships to farmers. Several farmers are given pattas over land in areas like Maheshwaram and Kandukur mandals and they had been cultivating them since the last few decades. The status of these lands in the Dharani portal was said to be displaying as those under the possession of the government. These lands are hence, placed under the auto lock facility preventing any transactions on them. Farmers desirous of selling/buying the lands are said to be making rounds to the offices of Tahsildars, but in vain. Hopefully, the government will show the same enthusiasm to solve this matter with which the portal was launched amid much fanfare. Skills for a cause! Fete -The Utsav, a day-long food-cum-recreation extravaganza held at MCRHRD on Saturday, was not just another day in training, as part of the special foundation course for the 121 trainee civil servants but an opportunity to showcase a different set of skills – as chefs, salespersons and businesspersons. It was an event that turned the academic ambience into fun and frolic coupled with exhibition of skills. The trainee civil servants from 22 States did not let go the opportunity to showcase their talent, albeit differently. As part of their learning, the trainee civil servants not only prepared and dished out some mouth-watering delicacies but sold them as hard-core salespersons to those present at the event – officials of the institute and others. The ‘profit generated’ through their endeavour was donated to an NGO as contribution towards a socially-relevant cause. The trainee civil servants believed in their abilities not only to cook but also make the event memorable.  (M. Rajeev and B.

01 March 2021||Mumbai,||10-day Budget session from today||The Budget session of the Maharashtra legislature will begin on Monday under the shadow of a surge in COVID-19 cases in the State, and is likely to be a stormy affair with the opposition BJP expected to corner the government over various issues. The 10-day session will have eight working days and the Budget will be tabled on March 8. Bills pertaining to departments such as Revenue, Higher Education and Home are likely to be taken up. A draft of the Shakti Act, which provides for strict punishment for crime against women and children, is under consideration of a joint select committee of both Houses. The Budget session is normally held for six weeks, but in view of the current pandemic situation, it has been curtailed. The BJP recently alleged that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government was trying to curtail the session on the pretext of the novel coronavirus situation to run away from a debate on its “failures”. However, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab on Thursday claimed that it was Opposition parties which wanted a one-day session. The session will start with the address of Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to the joint sitting of the Assembly and Council. The State government will also table supplementary demands on the first day. The House would hold a discussion on the Governor’s speech on March 2, while the next two days were reserved for a discussion on supplementary demands, Mr. Parab said. The Governor has so far not approved 12 names recommended by the State Cabinet for nomination to the Legislative Council. According to Mr. Parab, the legislature would discuss proposals of Opposition parties on March 5 and some Bills would also be tabled. There will be no sittings on March 6 and 7. Mr. Parab had claimed that the Opposition suggested a one-day session due to the COVID-19 situation, “but we decided to have a 10-day session”. Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis recently pointed out that election of the new Speaker was not on the agenda of the meeting. The post fell vacant following the resignation of Nana Patole, who has taken over as the Congress’s State unit chief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/10-day-budget-session-from-today/article33958448.ece
01 March 2021||Mumbai,||96% people faced drop in earnings during last year’s lockdown: survey||Nearly 96% of the people surveyed under a food rights campaign in Maharashtra faced a drop in their earnings during the novel coronavirus-induced lockdown last year, a social body claims. Job losses and non-availability of casual work were the key reasons for this, and every fifth respondent was forced to go hungry because of no money to buy food, Mukta Srivastava, the State’s convener for the Anna Adhikar Abhiyan, told reporters on Saturday. The abhiyan, comprising a group of activists from food and nutrition sector, surveyed a total of 250 people in May and September last year in Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Pune, Nandurbar, Solapur, Palghar, Nashik, Dhule and Jalgaon. The Centre announced a nationwide lockdown in March last year following the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Later, after a few months, restrictions were gradually eased in a phased manner. “Around 96% people out of those surveyed admitted that their earnings dropped sharply in the lockdown period, and their situation remained the same five months after the lockdown was lifted,” Ms. Srivastava said. Of the total respondents, 52% were from rural areas and the rest from urban limits. Those surveyed included 60% women, she said. Before the lockdown, nearly 70% of the respondents had a monthly income of Rs. 7,000, while the remaining earned about Rs. 3,000 per month, Ms. Srivastava said. “The drop in such already low incomes underscores how hard they would have been hit,” she said. Nearly 49% of respondents of the survey, conducted as part of the nationwide Right to Food Campaign, had to borrow money from friends and relatives to buy food, she said. Asked about the earning status of respondents in the first few months after the lockdown came into force last year, Ms. Srivastava said, “During April and May, 43% people had no income at all. Only 10% of them have come back to their pre-lockdown income levels.” The situation of 34% respondents, who had no income in April and May, remained unchanged till September-October, she said. The findings also revealed that 12% of these people sold their jewellery while 3% sold their land during the lockdown to buy food, Ms. Srivastava said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/96-people-faced-drop-in-earnings-during-last-years-lockdown-survey/article33958450.ece

Yogesh Nilkanth Warkad, regional deputy director (RDD), Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), Western Region, said every elephant in Kerala was tagged and it was not permitted to domesticate elephant from other State. “The accused, V.

The information was passed on to the Maharashtra Forest Department by Kerala chief wildlife warden Surendra Kumar. “We started looking for Mr. Shaji, who was wanted in five different cases of illegal dealing of live captive elephants registered at Kollam in Kerala and had been absconding for six months. Since his mobile was switched off, tracing him was a challenge,” Mr. Warkad said. Mr. Warkad then contacted Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Pravin Kumar Patil and requested his coordination in apprehending the accused. Two joint teams of WCCB and the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch carried out a search and identified two suspected locations. Finally, on Wednesday, Mr. Shaji was arrested from Koparkhairane. “He was taken to the office of the RDD, WCCB, and later produced before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Vashi. We obtained a transit remand till midnight of Sunday. Meanwhile, a Kerala Forest Department team reached Navi Mumbai and the accused was handed over to the team on Friday evening,” Mr. Warkad said.

He told the police that he had been staying in a relative’s vacant house in Koparkhairane for the last one month. As per his identity card, Mr. Shaji is a resident of Pattambi in north Kerala while the cases registered against him are in south Kerala. Further investigations are being conducted by the Kerala Forest Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/kerala-man-wanted-in-5-captive-elephant-smuggling-cases-nabbed-in-navi-mumbai/article33958454.ece
01 March 2021||New Delhi,||A survival story||On Tuesday, it will be a year since the first COVID-19 case was reported in the city and like most cities of the world, Delhi has suffered, resisted and eventually survived the pandemic through grit, determination and planning. Despite mounting casualties at one juncture, the city did not lose its heart but fought hard to counter the pandemic. From a single case on March 2 to more than 8,500 cases in a day in November and about 200 daily cases now, it was a roller-coaster ride. As many as 10,910 people lost their lives, countless lost jobs, almost every other business sector was hit, chaos and anarchy reigned in the early days of the lockdown. But the city showed its fabled resilience, and life is steadily acquiring normalcy, now that the pandemic is under control, with only 1,335 active cases, as opposed to over 40,000 active cases in November. Vaccine, the blessing The vaccine is seen as light at the end of the tunnel and the government has shifted its focus to increase the coverage of vaccination. Though the situation is currently more or less under control, it was not always like that. There were days when Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was worried and exhorted people to take extreme precautions. He even accepted the government’s shortcomings, as the daily count shot up steeply in the months of June, September, and peaking in November. On November 11, 8,593 cases were reported in 24 hours. Soon after, the number of tests was increased, with the highest recorded on December 17, when 90,354 tests were done in 24 hours. Early planning Even before the first case was reported, the government started reserving beds in hospitals for COVID-19 patients and eventually ordered many hospitals to be reserved only for treating the infected. In the initial months, there were complaints of insufficient PPE kits for healthcare workers, but the situation gradually evened out. In May and June, as cases started to mount, there were numerous complaints about people being forced to hop from one hospital to another in search of beds. Many said they were unable to find a bed, even as beds were available as per official data. In a video statement on June 27, the Chief Minister had to accept the shortcomings. “In the first week of June, there was a shortage of beds in Delhi and there were fewer tests. Due to shortage of beds, some people did not get beds, and the number of deaths also started to increase,” he said, adding that he used to get calls late in the night about the shortage.  To redress the scenario, the government roped in more private hospitals and even hotels were attached to hospitals to increase the number of beds. But there was a hitch. Many private hospitals started demanding that patients deposit amounts ranging from Rs. 3 lakh to Rs. 8 lakh for admission. Apart from the deposits, there were numerous cases of “exorbitant” rates charged from COVID-19 patients. In early June, the Chief Minister asserted that the government won’t allow “black marketing” of beds in private hospitals. Then on June 20, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), headed by the Lt. Governor, accepted recommendations of a committee for fixing rates for COVID-19-related treatment in private hospitals. In contrast to Delhi, the municipal corporation of Mumbai had capped the prices of isolation beds for COVID-19 patients in private hospitals in the city at Rs. 4,000 a day as early as mid-March. Controversies galore There was no dearth of controversies either. On June 7, Mr. Kejriwal said government and private hospitals will be reserved for people of Delhi and Central government hospitals will be for anyone from across the country. The decision came under flak, and on June 8, Lt. Governor Anil Baijal overruled the decision. This led to a confrontation between the Delhi and Central governments. Following this, on June 14, Union Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the condition of Delhi in a meeting with the L-G and the Chief Minister. Since then, the Central government has intervened in the COVID-19 management of the city. Both worked hand in hand and the situation improved. Within days, based on the Central government directions, the price of COVID-19 testing in Delhi was capped at Rs. 2,400. Gradual control When asked about the toughest time during the pandemic, a health department official said: “Though we had the highest number of cases during the second surge in November, by then we were prepared. The systems were in place. But during the first surge in May - June, people were actually finding it difficult to find beds. It was the time when officials were leaving offices at 10 and 11 in the night. That was the toughest time.” Delhi was one of the worst affected cities of the country. The State government reasoned that the large number of flights, which brought back people stuck in other countries, landed at the Delhi airport and this was the reason behind the high number of cases. Even three Ministers of the AAP government — Satyendar Jain, Manish Sisodia, and Gopal Rai — tested positive and were admitted to a private hospital at some point of their treatment. “Despite various challenges, Delhi fought the virus and brought down both the positive as well as the death rates,” the Health Minister’s office said in response to a query by The Hindu . “The Delhi government did not step back, we proactively worked and adapted ourselves to the situation and came up with several initiatives that brought the cases down and our initiatives have been copied and followed widely by the entire nation and world,” it added. The descent After the peak in November, new cases decreased, despite an increase in testing. The daily new cases have been less than 1,000 for two months and have been staying below 200 cases for almost a month. But there has been a small rise in the past few days with four consecutive days recording 200 or more cases last week. “There is nothing to worry about. Fluctuations of minor level will happen and the disease won’t completely disappear like that. The virus will infect people, who have not been infected, till people have antibodies,” said Dr. Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital, adding that the current increase has to be observed over a longer period of time to draw any conclusions. The Delhi government official said that the government was yet to find out any particular reason for the current slight increase in cases, but it was looking for possible reasons. The fight, meanwhile, is unceasing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/a-survival-story/article33958258.ece

01 March 2021||New Delhi,||Plea seeks action over non-filling of vacancies at IHBAS||A petition filed before the Delhi High Court has sought initiation of contempt proceedings over the non-filling of over 75% vacant posts of doctors and healthcare workers at the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS). The petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni said that the IHBAS, a premier mental health and neurosciences institute of the country, has been suffering from acute shortage of doctors and healthcare workers. Mr. Sahni said that over 75% posts of doctors and health workers are vacant at the IHBAS and hence, patients with psychiatric and clinical psychological disorder have been suffering since long due to acute shortage of medical and other staffers. “This post-pandemic landscape will be a breeding ground for an increase in chronic stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol dependence, and self-harm,” Mr. Sahni had said. “With such widespread rise in the number of cases of mental disorder patients, it is immensely crucial to have adequate psychiatrists and other staffers to deal with such kind of situation,” he added. He said that this vacancy has continued despite an order of the Delhi High Court in September last year directing the IHBAS to fill up vacancies of faculty and staffers as early as possible. Mr. Sahni, also a social activist, said he made a representation to the government for tackling shortage of staffers at the IHBAS, but no action has been taken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-seeks-action-over-non-filling-of-vacancies-at-ihbas/article33958250.ece

01 March 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra Forest Minister quits Cabinet||Maharashtra Forest Minister and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rathod on Sunday resigned from the Cabinet for his alleged connection with the death of a 23-year-old woman from the nomadic banjara community in Pune. Mr. Rathod, who has been under fire from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for nearly three weeks following the incident, tendered his resignation to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday. While Mr. Thackeray said that he had accepted the resignation, he criticised the Opposition for targetting Mr. Rathod before the completion of an impartial probe. Stating that the affair was a “ploy” to defame him, Mr. Rathod said he would assist in the investigation even as former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis criticised the Maharashtra police and Mr. Thackeray over the handling of the affair. The Chief Minister retorted that linking Mr. Rathod to the girl’s death was “a case of dirty politics” by the Opposition. “The MVA government has always believed that investigations must be conducted impartially, without regard to the office of the person. At the same time, the probe should not needlessly malign someone. Regrettably, the opposition wants the investigation to be conducted in its own way…without proper evidence, they were hell-bent on Mr. Rathod’s resignation. We had ordered a probe the day we came to know of the incident,” said Mr. Thackeray. He further censured the Opposition’s lack of faith in the Maharashtra police and observed that even the deceased girl’s family had written to the Chief Minister stating that no person must be needlessly defamed on mere suspicion. “If the girl’s family has faith in the investigation, then why does the Opposition lack faith in the Maharashtra police? It is speculated that Independent MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli Mohan Delkar committed suicide under alleged pressure from some BJP leaders. So, how would it look if I demanded these leaders be brought to justice on mere suspicion?” asked Mr. Thackeray. Sena Minister Anil Parab informed that a probe against Mr. Rathod under an Accidental Death report was underway. Meanwhile, pointing to the inordinate delay by the police in probing the case, Mr. Fadnavis said that despite Mr. Rathod’s resignation, a formal FIR had yet to be lodged. “This [resignation] has come too late … the current state of Maharashtra’s law and order situation is deplorable. Despite so much evidence against Mr. Rathod, why has no FIR still been lodged against him? This case has exposed the Thackeray government’s true colours,” he alleged. Mr. Fadnavis further said that while the Minister should have been made to resign immediately after the incident, the MVA government continued to shield him until Mr. Rathod’s position finally became untenable. “It is clear that this case was being suppressed right from the first day…Mr. Rathod had the blessings of this government, which has similarly shielded scandal-tainted NCP leaders Dhananjay Munde and Mehboob Shaikh,” he said. The BJP leader demanded that the government probe the tardiness of police officers entrusted with this case and sought their suspension. Mr. Fadnavis said that the BJP would continue to agitate until justice was served to the deceased lady’s kin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-forest-minister-quits-cabinet/article33958458.ece

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||China Parliament to mull expanded border drone use||The annual convening of China’s National People’s Congress (NPC), or Parliament, on March 5 will hear a proposal for the wider deployment of more advanced drones along border areas, with a legislator proposing the move in the wake of last year’s clash between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The proposal is being submitted by one of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) representatives at the NPC, which is widely regarded as a ceremonial legislature that usually approves most of the proposals it receives. The Communist Party of China exercises control over all branches of state, including the legislature. The NPC convenes every year and approves policies, including government work report that sets the policy agenda, and the defence budget for the military. ‘Limitations exposed’ Hou Yun, commander of a border defence regiment with the PLA Tibet Military Command who is among the military’s NPC delegates, told State media he will submit a proposal “suggesting that China should enhance border management and control by deploying more smart equipment like drones, as his experience and research indicate huge room for improvement despite the wide use of such devices” by the military. Last year’s clash in the Galwan Valley, he suggested, had exposed limitations in the current deployment of drones. “To tackle current issues, which include the short endurance, high dependence on weather conditions and insufficient payload capacity resulting from the initial commissioning of only easy-to-use, small drones, the PLA could use more sophisticated, larger drones in its arsenal,” the Party-run Global Times reported, adding that “the proposal comes after a months-long border standoff” with India. He said the goal was “to resolve three key problems: to see where people can’t see, hear where people can’t hear and go where people can’t go.” The report said he had “recently led a patrol team to a Valley at an elevation of 4,000 meters” and while drones were in wide use, they faced limitations, including short endurance and vulnerability to harsh weather conditions. To address those problems, the military is pitching for the use of “larger, fixed-wing drones like the GJ-1 and GJ-2 armed reconnaissance drones” which “can stay in the air for dozens of hours and are equipped with more sophisticated payloads”. The report said the PLA had used drones for reconnaissance during the Galwan Valley clash last year. Chinese media reported last week that one Shenzhen-based private drone manufacturer had honoured two of its employees who had been deployed to assist the PLA in the Galwan Valley by carrying out drone reconnaissance missions on India’s deployments. Public sentiment While the PLA would not necessarily require the NPC to approve the deployment of drones, the proposal comes amid renewed public attention in China on last year’s border clash. The June 15, 2020, clash in the Galwan Valley has been among the most widely discussed subjects in the lead-up to this year’s Congress, having received belated attention in the wake of the PLA, on February 19, honouring five soldiers, four of them posthumously. Twenty Indian soldiers died in the clash, that marked the worst violence along the border sine 1967. The PLA announcement, eight months after the clash and a week after India and China announced disengagement along some areas of the LAC, triggered an outpouring of sentiment on Chinese social media. Some NPC proposals in the past have often grappled with topics in the public spotlight, with the broader aim of underlining how the government was addressing those issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-parliament-to-mull-expanded-border-drone-use/article33957982.ece
01 March 2021||Dhaka,||Clashes in Dkaka over writer’s death||Dozens were injured on Sunday as Bangladeshi police fired rubber bullets and tear gas in a third day of protests sparked by the death of a prominent writer and government critic in jail. Mushtaq Ahmed, 53, collapsed in a high-security prison and died late on Thursday, 10 months after being arrested under a “digital security” law that critics say is being used to silence dissent in the country of 168 million people. Live footage on Sunday from television station Channel 24 showed a road and footpath in front of the National Press Club turning into a battleground as police beat protesters with batons to disperse them. Student activists from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) hurled rocks and attacked officers with bamboo and plastic pipes, prompting police to retaliate by “firing rubber bullets and tear gas”, Deputy Commissioner of Dhaka police Sazzadur Rahman said. BNP spokesman Rizvi Ahmed said about 30 partymen were injured in the clashes. International and local rights groups have demanded a swift probe into the death of the writer, who was arrested over comments posted on social media criticising the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ambassadors from 13 countries, including the U.S., France, Britain, Canada and Germany, expressed “grave concern” over the case. He had been detained under the Digital Security Act, passed in 2018, which rights groups say has been used to silence critics with hefty fines and lengthy prison sentences. Ahmed was denied bail at least six times. Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina on Saturday shrugged off concern over the Internet law, Ahmed’s death and criticism of her government’s rights record.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/clashes-in-dkaka-over-writers-death/article33957984.ece
01 March 2021||Orlando,||Trump set to take spotlight with post-presidency speech||Donald Trump returns to the political spotlight on Sunday, determined to regain control of a Republican party that is out of power and pondering whether the flawed former President can win again in 2024. The 74-year-old will address the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando in a highly-anticipated speech during which he is expected to tease attendees about his political future — including the possibility of another presidential run. A hero’s welcome He is sure to be greeted like a returning hero by a loyalist crowd as he calls for party unity — and perhaps rips some of his critics — on the final day of the nation’s largest conservative gathering. “We are not starting new parties, and we will not be dividing our power and our strength,” Mr. Trump will say, according to Fox News. “Instead, we will be united and strong like never before.” U.S. political parties usually face a reckoning after a string of losses such as those the Republican Party saw under Mr. Trump in 2020: losing the White House, ceding the Senate and failing to take back the House of Representatives. The party is also marked with Mr. Trump’s repeated lies about his election loss to Joe Biden, his impeachment for inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, and the extraordinary faultline his actions have caused between establishment Republicans and pro-Trump populists. But, instead of jettisoning its failed leader and charting a new path to relevance, much of the Republican party still sees Mr. Trump as retaining a vice-like grip on its future. It is a perception he has encouraged, setting himself up as a Republican kingmaker. On Friday, he endorsed an ex-aide against an Ohio Congressman who voted to impeach him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-set-to-take-spotlight-with-post-presidency-speech/article33957995.ece
01 March 2021||Hong Kong,||47 HK activists charged with subversion||Dozens of Hong Kong dissidents were charged with subversion on Sunday in the largest use yet of Beijing’s sweeping new national security law, as authorities seek to cripple the finance hub’s democracy movement. Police arrested 55 of the city’s best-known pro-democracy campaigners in a series of dawn raids last month. On Sunday, 47 were charged with one count each of “conspiracy to commit subversion” — one of the new national security crimes — with police saying the group would appear in court on Monday morning. Democracy supporters described the move as a body blow. “Every prominent voice of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong now is either jailed, in exile, or charged for subversion of state power,” activist Sophie Mak wrote on Twitter. The EU’s office in Hong Kong said the charges were of “great concern”. “The nature of these charges makes clear that legitimate political pluralism will no longer be tolerated in Hong Kong,” the office added. Beijing is battling to stamp out dissent in semi-autonomous Hong Kong after swathes of the population hit the streets in 2019 in huge and sometimes violent democracy protests. The security law, imposed on the city last June, criminalises any act deemed to be subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces. Those charged are routinely denied bail until trial and face up to life in prison if convicted. The activists charged on Sunday represent a broad cross-section of Hong Kong’s opposition. On Tuesday, authorities also unveiled a new law that will vet the political views of all public office holders. Joshua Wong, one of the city’s most recognisable pro-democracy figures, was among those charged. ‘Defiant note’ John Clancey, an American lawyer and long-time Hong Kong resident who was with the initial group arrested, was one of the few not charged on Sunday. Many struck a defiant tone as they prepared to report to police on Sunday to hear the charges. “Democracy is never a gift from heaven. It must be earned by many with strong will,” Jimmy Sham, a key organiser of 2019’s huge protests, told reporters outside a police station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/47-hk-activists-charged-with-subversion/article33957986.ece
01 March 2021||Los Angeles,||Golden Globes to launch awards season||Hollywood’s award season kicks off on Sunday at a very different Golden Globes, with a mainly virtual ceremony set to boost or dash the Oscars hopes of early frontrunners like Nomadland and The Trial of the Chicago 7 . Usually a star-packed, laid-back party that draws Tinseltown’s biggest names to a Beverly Hills hotel ballroom, this pandemic edition will be broadcast from two scaled-down venues in California and New York, with frontline and essential workers among the few in attendance. Deprived of its usual glamour, the Globes — which also honour the best in television — remain a coveted prize, and a high-profile source of momentum in the run-up to the season-crowning Oscars, which were pushed back this year to April.  Nomadland , Chloe Zhao’s paean to a marginalized, older generation of Americans roaming the West in rundown vans, has long been viewed as a frontrunner for the top prize. But it will face stiff competition from Aaron Sorkin’s  The Trial of the Chicago 7  , a courtroom drama about the city’s anti-war riots in 1968 with a mouth-watering ensemble cast including Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen. Both films are fuelled by their timely themes of protest and joblessness. “I think that it’s likeliest between them,” said The Hollywood Reporter’s awards columnist Scott Feinberg. “And then the spoiler, if something were to come out of left field, would probably be Promising Young Woman, which is just unlike anything else in recent memory.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/golden-globes-to-launch-awards-season/article33957988.ece
01 March 2021||Riyadh,||Houthi missile attack thwarted, says Riyadh||Loud explosions shook Riyadh on Saturday as a Saudi-led military coalition said it thwarted a missile attack launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, which sent debris raining down on civilian homes. Iran-backed Houthi fighters have intensified operations against the kingdom as air strikes by the Saudi-led military coalition pound rebel positions in the north of Yemen, in a bid to stop their offensive to seize the government’s last northern stronghold of Marib. Saudi Arabia said on Saturday it thwarted a Houthi missile that targeted Riyadh. “The operation was carried out with a ballistic missile and 15 drones... targeting sensitive areas in the enemy’s capital of Riyadh,” said Houthi spokesman Yahya al-Saree, according to the rebels’ Al-Masirah TV channel. Fragments of the missile scattered over several Riyadh neighbourhoods, damaging at least one home but no casualties were reported, Saudi’s state-run Al-Ekhbariya television said. AFP correspondents in the Saudi capital reported hearing multiple loud explosions. The night sky lit up with a bright flash following the interception of a missile, state television footage showed. Separately, the coalition said it intercepted six Houthi drones targeting the kingdom, including the southern cities of Khamis Mushait and Jizan. The assaults came as Saudi Arabia hosted a Formula E championship on the outskirts of Riyadh, which state media said was attended by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The Houthis have escalated cross-border attacks on the kingdom even after the U.S. delisted the rebels as terrorists and stepped up efforts to de-escalate the six-year conflict. The designation, imposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, had been widely criticised by aid agencies, which warned it would hamper their efforts to alleviate a humanitarian crisis in Yemen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/houthi-missile-attack-thwarted-says-riyadh/article33957993.ece

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||More about Big Government than Big Tech||Last week, the Union Government issued a set of rules under the Information Technology Act, noting that it was superseding rules issued under Section 79 of that statute in 2011. Those earlier rules had specified the due diligence obligations that Internet intermediaries had to follow in order to qualify for the limited immunity for legal liability regarding user content, which Parliament had strengthened in 2008 when it amended that law. Without discussion The notification of these new rules, however, do not merely represent the executive branch superseding previous subordinate rules under a law with newer regulation. They represent a dramatic, dangerous move by the Union Government towards cementing increased censorship of Internet content and mandating compliance with government demands regarding user data collection and policing of online services in India. This has happened in the absence of open and public discussion of the full swathe of regulatory powers the government has sought to exercise, and without any parliamentary study and scrutiny. Indeed, these rules at the outset appear unlawful even with respect to whether they could have been issued under the Information Technology Act in the manner chosen by the government, leave alone their constitutionality with respect to fundamental rights. The Union Government has chosen to pass these rules under the requirement to outline the due diligence that Internet intermediaries — ranging from telecom providers, search engines, Internet platforms hosting user generated content to cloud providers — have to follow in order to be able to claim their qualified legal immunity under Section 79 of the IT Act. Curious stand The government’s gazette notification has further claimed that the rules were also issued under the legal authority to specific procedure for blocking web content under Section 69A of the IT Act. This is curious, given that rules overseeing government web content blocking powers have already been issued for that section in 2009, and not superseded. Indeed, they form the core of the increasing number of web content censorship orders issued by the Union Government in recent years, including the most recent controversial stand-off with Twitter following the farmer protests. The ability to issue rules under a statute — i.e. to frame subordinate legislation — is by its nature a limited, constrained power. When the Union Government issues subordinate rules, it is limited to the substantive provisions laid out by Parliament in the original act passed by the latter — the executive branch is subordinate to what Parliament has permitted it and cannot use its rule-making power to seek to issue primary legislation by itself. Directives and mandates Unfortunately, with the present Internet content and social media rules, the Union Government has done precisely that. Instead of specifying the basic due diligence requirements intermediaries had to perform in order to make use of the Section 79 safe harbour provision, the executive branch has created new rules that apply only to “significant social media intermediaries” — a term that appears nowhere in the Information Technology Act. It has included mandates for retention of user data by such intermediaries for use by government agencies and clauses on how popular messaging services have to enable the tracing of the original creator of a message (which is regarded as not possible for end-to-end encrypted messaging services without introducing flaws in their systems) even though the sections in the law cited by the government do not give them that power. The rules have grown to include a chapter on how digital news sites have to be registered before the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and further laid out a mechanism by which streaming video sites featuring original content (which are generally not regarded as intermediaries for the purposes of Internet law) have to agree to a government-supervised “self regulatory system”. This, even though digital news service registration is not required under the IT Act and streaming video content has not been included under the ambit of the Cinematograph Act. In any other situation, the package contained in this gazette notification last week would be instead included in a bill sent to Parliament for its consideration — and which would be regarded as ambitious and controversial for any administration. The message is clear Why has the Union Government created this legally uncertain, sprawling house-of-cards-like regulatory instrument? To understand these new Internet content control rules — for that is what they essentially are — you need to not only see what they directly give to the government, but what the government is seeking to get done behind a shadow of regulatory pressure. It appears that the government wants to send a message to all Internet ecosystem players that they desire compliance with their desires — formal or informal — regarding what content should be taken down, along with a removal of any push back against over broad demands for user data and other surveillance orders by government agencies. The Government of India already has significant legal powers, with practically no institutionalised oversight or true checks and balances, to force censorship and surveillance on Internet platforms and other web services in India. However, the increasing public discussion of concerns regarding the usage of these powers and challenges being made by firms and impacted individuals against their abuse is something that the Union Government would like to avoid. Why issue direct formal orders when one can instead force compliance in less visible, more institutionalised ways? Indicating that the government has made up its mind to force these mandates by notifying them, even with doubtful legal validity, is a key signalling effect to Internet ecosystem players, especially firms keen to avoid public battles and smaller entities who do not have the resources or political position to be able to contest overboard government directives. The Union Government, when issuing these rules, made reference to increased global interest in regulating Big Tech. However, in advancing Internet content control interests and increased requirements around government demands for user data, while not advancing surveillance law reform or enacting a strong statutory data protection framework, it appears that the interest is more in advancing Big Government and trying to force technologists to fall in line, no matter the cost to our fundamental rights in our Internet age.

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to Parliament in Nepal||On February 23, Nepal’s Supreme Court reinstated the House of Representatives, which had been dissolved by Prime Minister K.P. Oli on December 20, responding to an attempt to unseat him from leadership of his own parliamentary party in the lower house. After hearing more than a hundred lawyers from both sides, amidst a polarised political environment, the five-judge Constitutional Bench led by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher J.B. Rana delivered a verdict that throws the ball back to the House. Dissolution of Parliament Some hoped and others worried that the Bench would go along with the dissolution, allowing the general elections as had been called for in April-May by Mr. Oli. The Bench preferred a strict reading of the Constitution, which asserts that Parliament may not be dissolved until all options to form a government (by majority party, a coalition, a minority party, or by a member of the House trusted by the President) have been exhausted. These tight provisions were placed in the Constitution by the framers, including those in Mr. Oli’s cohort who were then members of the Constituent Assembly, to ensure continuity in governance, especially given the quick and easy dissolutions in the past and ensuing instabilities. The Constitution has other unique provisions to ensure political stability, including one that does not allow a vote of confidence to be brought for the first two years of a Prime Minister’s five-year term. A no-confidence vote must include the name of the prime ministerial candidate, and if the vote fails, another motion may not be brought for a year. Before the Bench, the Prime Minister’s side argued that the Constitution’s declaration of Nepal as a parliamentary democracy had no meaning if a Prime Minister commanding majority in the House did not have the right to disband it. In its unanimous judgment, the Bench maintained that Nepal did not need to look at the procedures of other parliamentary democracies in the instant case; that national experience and provisions of the Constitution should suffice. Even though the Constitutional Bench did not censure him for mal-intent as demanded by the petitioners, Mr. Oli would be feeling out on a limb. While the healthy future of parliamentary practice may require constitutional amendment to allow a sitting Prime Minister to recommend dissolution and elections, for now, the Supreme Court has removed constitutional uncertainty. There was method to what some might see as Mr. Oli’s madness, and it has to do with his inability to manage the ambitions of his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) co-chairman, Pushpa Kamal Dahal (‘Prachanda’). In 2017, during the Dasain (Dushhera) holidays, Mr. Oli had secretively reached out to Mr. Dahal to unify the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) with his Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist). It was a strange coming together of a communist party that had accepted multiparty democracy and the Maoists led by a sweet-talking demagogue. The unification was a windfall for Mr. Dahal and his fast-declining party. It also seemed an unworkable experiment that sooner or later would bring grief to the polity. Even as Mr. Oli took the reins of power, Mr. Dahal initiated his two-pronged strategy of selective media capture and weaning away UML stalwarts by feeding their sense of grievance and powerlessness vis-à-vis the imperious Mr. Oli. In particular, Mr. Dahal worked on former Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, who had been defeated by Mr. Oli for the post of Chairman in the UML general convention. Mr. Dahal dangled the carrot of presidency before former Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal. Mr. Dahal moved quickly to encircle and tie down the Prime Minister. Using the proxy of his Maoist subordinate Agni Sapkota, made Speaker even with a murder charge pending before the Supreme Court, Mr. Dahal blocked constitutional appointments and sabotaged the government’s attempt to receive a $500 million U.S. grant to expand the national electricity grid. Increasingly, the so-called ‘Secretariat’ of senior NCP leaders sought to direct government affairs, as if Nepal’s was a single-party communist system. It was when Mr. Oli got word that the Dahal group was registering a no-confidence motion that he moved immediately to dissolve Parliament. The motion arrived in the Parliament office after the dissolution declaration, but Mr. Sapkota forged the paperwork to bring forward the time of registration. A reckoning on that episode is still required, now that the House is restored. Mr. Oli’s dissolution of Parliament triggered a vehement response with many accusing him of authoritarian tendencies. President Bidya Devi Bhandari was pilloried for having readily okayed the Prime Minister’s move. She might have sat on his communication for a day or two, but the 2015 Constitution does not give the President leeway to question the chief executive’s recommendations, not even the privilege of consultations which was available to former President Ram Baran Yadav under the interim Constitution of 2007. Mr. Dahal threatened a violent movement should the Justices decide to certify the dissolution and elections. A civil society stalwart warned that “the people would drag the Justices out on to the streets” if they approved Mr. Oli’s recommendation. Four former Chief Justices published a statement against dissolution in what could be seen as an attempt to influence the Bench. Neither could former President Yadav hold back. Only in Nepal With the verdict given, it is not clear what the inter-party permutations and combinations will deliver in the days to come, or what fate awaits each of the topmost players. But without doubt, the role of Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba will be decisive because of the MPs he holds — whether to become Prime Minister himself, back the Dahal combine, or allow Mr. Oli to serve out the next two years. The Supreme Court has ordered the House to convene before March 8, and rather than wait for a no-confidence motion to be brought by the Dahal group, Mr. Oli is likely to seek confidence of the House. However, because the present crisis is not one between the opposition and party in power, but within the latter, the future course will rest on Mr. Dahal’s ability to unseat Mr. Oli as parliamentary party leader. At present, the Oli-Dahal support in the NCP parliamentary party is said to be more or less equal, each numbering in the 80s. (Altogether 138 MPs are required to form the government.) For all the hullabaloo, the NCP party has not split formally, although the chasm within the leadership is deep. Even if the rank and file seek unity for the sake of elections, it is unlikely that the feuding leaders will be able to patch up. For the long-term health of the polity, a decisive divorce between the former Maoists and the erstwhile CPN-UML is recommended. Ideology does not bind the two — the ‘democrat communists’ in the UML fold and the Maoists led by Mr. Dahal, whose concept of governance does not include democracy if he can help it, and who is yet to concede the need for accountability for grievous crimes committed during the 10-years of the rebellion he led. Meanwhile, one cannot even make an educated guess as to who will become the next Prime Minister among the four former Prime Ministers — Mr. Deuba, Mr. Nepal, Mr. Oli or Mr. Dahal.

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Spurring a reawakening with National Science Day||National Science Day, which fell on February 28, commemorates a path-breaking discovery at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Calcutta in 1928, that came to be known as the Raman Effect. Three more physicists from Calcutta, namely Jagadish Chandra Bose who was C.V. Raman’s senior, Satyendra Nath Bose and Meghnad Saha, both of whom were Raman’s juniors, had by then made major contributions that were globally acclaimed. But Raman’s discovery marks the pinnacle for which he would win the Nobel Prize in physics two years later, making him the most visible face of Indian science. Pursuing scientific truth It seems very thoughtful and rational that our National Science Day celebrates a discovery and not the birthday of its discoverer. Raman, as a person, was not beyond criticism. The circumstances of his exit from Calcutta where he spent his most productive years, the reasons for his relinquishing the post of Director of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore before completion of his term, differences with Meghnad Saha, and non-sharing of credit for his discovery with K.S. Krishnan make him appear as arrogant, and not above common human foibles. But none of these can diminish Raman’s unquestioned scientific prowess and his life-long devotion to the pursuit of scientific truth (through physics). Objective assessment It is thanks to the untiring efforts of Dr. Rajinder Singh, noted historian of science from the University of Oldenburg, Germany, who has authored six books and 28 essays on Raman, that a clear picture of Raman and his time emerges. While Dr. Singh has dispelled with supporting evidence many myths such as Raman’s breaking into tears while accepting the Nobel Prize because he felt humiliated as the honour had to be received under the British flag, or that Raman had worked with very little equipment and insufficient support, these books, read together, (most of which are available in digital version) provide an objective assessment of Raman, the man and the scientist. Two books in particular, Nobel Laureate C.V. Raman’s Work on Light Scattering (Logos Verlag, Berlin, 2004) and C.V. Raman’s Laboratory and Discovery of the Raman Effect (Shaker Verlag, Aachen, 2018) analyse the process, essence and significance of his work. Since history judges a person by the peaks of his achievement, Raman’s standing as an outstanding physicist remains unscathed.  India has progressed a great deal in about a century after the major advances made by the Bose(s), Saha and Raman. Even though none so far, working in India, has personally scaled those heights, our achievements, on the whole, on the application of science and technology in fields such as atomic energy, space research, agriculture and biotechnology have been impressive. Noted historians of science and practising scientists have also been articulating their views on how India can develop as a hub for world-class scientific and technological innovation. Two recent developments, namely the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) and the draft National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy 2020 (draft STIP), despite having limitations that characterise any government publication, underscore some of the pathways to this direction. The importance of languages has been highlighted in the NEP. S.N. Bose and others had been advocating from the 1940s for the use of the mother languages for science teaching and popularisation. This is an area that requires serious attention. Similarly, the setting up of the National Research Foundation, for instance, to encourage and fund research and development activities, hopefully with much greater and intensive involvement of our university system than hitherto, seems to be a step in the right direction. Fostering research The draft STIP has also mooted substantial ideas in order to promote research and innovation and develop ‘a robust system for evidence and stakeholder-driven STI planning … and policy research in India’. The proposal for a Research Excellence Framework for higher educational institutions, once reconciled with the relevant provisions of the NEP, can make a qualitative difference. Likewise, fostering science and technology-enabled entrepreneurship and mainstreaming grassroot innovation and traditional knowledge systems (validated by modern scientific methods of evaluation and assessment) are proposals worth pursuing. It is hoped that the final document would seriously take cognisance of the comments and criticisms on the draft STIP and facilitate India transforming itself to a forward-looking, science-enabled and science-respecting nation. Though the state has a key role to play in this process, science requires to be handled with a light hand. The revised guidelines of the Education Ministry this January, about prior permission to be taken, under certain circumstances, before conducting even online/virtual conferences, etc., caused anxiety among some scientists and academics who had voiced their displeasure. Fortunately, this revision has been withdrawn. Keeping the flame burning The celebration of National Science Day with the basic objective of spreading the message of science and its importance in improving the lives of people, must be taken forward in the days ahead and should spur a national reawakening instead of being just a ritual. India has a long history of secular enquiry and free thoughts. From Aryabhata, Varāhamihira and Bhāskarācārya to the great scientists of modern India, the tradition of illuminating the world of science continues. Illustrious women like Janaki Ammal (botanist), Asima Chatterjee (chemist), Bibha Chowdhuri (physicist) and Gagandeep Kang (medical scientist) have kept this flame burning. Collectively, we have to take forward the legacy instead of wasting our time indulging in obscurantism, unscientific and unsubstantiated claims. It is only then that the purpose of observing the Day will be fulfilled and the spirit of Raman’s unswerving dedication to science be honoured.

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Big brother is watching you||The new governmental guidelines to regulate digital content raise a fundamental legal and ethical question: are they contra constitutional? For many advocates of the freedom of expression, the guidelines virtually undermine the enabling provisions of Article 19 of the Constitution and weaponise the restrictive clause of reasonable restriction, without really spelling out what constitutes reasonable restriction. Under the guidelines, it appears as if the citizens have been empowered and that there is now a fair grievance redressal mechanism for users of digital platforms. The guidelines include social media sites, messaging apps, over-the-top streaming services (popularly known as OTT services), and digital news publishers. Tricky new rule Some tend to confuse the grievance redressal officers to be appointed under the new directive with a news ombudsman and argue that the government has come up with a “soft touch” self-regulatory mechanism. The idea of self-regulation is to have a visible mechanism to correct errors that creep into the public sphere despite the existence of a multi-tiered gate-keeping process. There is an accepted value system, defined in codes developed over a period of nearly a century. However, while looking at the details of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, it is clear that there is executive overreach and this is not an attempt to empower citizen’s right to free speech and free expression. The tricky new rule states that big social media companies will have to take down unlawful content within a specific time frame of being served either a court order or notice by an appropriate government agency. There has been no satisfactory answer from the government on what basis it issues a takedown instruction, which is always euphemistically called a takedown request, to major social media platforms.  Since Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015), the debate over the constitutionality of the content takedown regime under Section 69A of the IT Act (and the Blocking Rules issued under it) has been raging. For instance, constitutional lawyer Gautam Bhatia has pointed out three important elements in the ‘Blocking Rules’. One, the Rules do not provide for an appeals process. Two, there is a contradiction between Rule 15 that requires that Designated Officer to maintain records of blocking requests and actions taken and Rule 16 that stipulates that “strict confidentiality shall be maintained regarding all the requests and complaints received and actions taken thereof.” Three, for the last five years, he has been arguing that there is need to file a review petition to seek clarity on a host of issues arising out of this judgment. The new rules pave the way for more opacity and secrecy rather than transparency and accountability. Unbridled power for the executive If the earlier regulatory framework was murky with many lines blurred and the onus of responsibility constantly oscillating between the originator and the intermediaries, the new guidelines give the executive unbridled power without any checks and balances. From arbitrary takedown notices to selective shutting down of Internet services, the executive has been arming itself against the citizens, and the two important estates of the democracy — the legislature and the judiciary — are not sufficiently reflecting on the question of overreach. In a polarised environment, an informed debate is restricted to some print and online organisations. While presenting the guidelines, Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the guidelines constituted a “soft touch oversight” mechanism to deal with issues such as the persistent spread of fake news and other misinformation. He added: “Social media is welcome to do business in India… they have got good business and have also empowered ordinary Indians. But it is very important that crores of social media users be given a proper forum for resolution of their grievances in a time bound manner against the abuse and misuse of social media.” This reminded me of the good old saying that ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions’. For those who are working on issues relating to individual privacy, the introduction of end-to-end encryption was seen as a technical solution to a truly vexatious issue. However, under the new rule, social media intermediaries must enable tracing of the originator of information on their platform if required by a competent authority. This is indeed a new panopticon. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/big-brother-is-watching-you/article33957976.ece
01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A murder, and business as usual||The case of the “smoking saw”, to use U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham’s phrase, is solved. The declassified version of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report on journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder states in no uncertain terms “that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved [the] operation…to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.” It bases this conclusion on the evidence that the persons responsible for the crime were members of the security detail of the Crown Prince, who is popularly known as MBS, and reported to his close advisers. It argues that an operation of this nature could not have been conducted without his approval. Although the declassified version does not provide the gory details of the heinous act, it is common knowledge, thanks to revelations made by Turkish intelligence, that Khashoggi’s body was dismembered with an electric saw before its final disposal. A short-term recalibration The U.S. Congress had been demanding for over a year that the report be declassified but former President Donald Trump had refused to do so because of his and his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner’s cosy relationship with MBS as well as Mr. Trump’s interest in selling massive amounts of arms to the petrostate. However, the release of the report does not mean a major reversal or even re-evaluation of America’s relationship with Saudi Arabia. It only signifies a short term “recalibration” of Washington’s approach towards the Kingdom. It is primarily a public relations exercise undertaken to assuage Congressional anger and to appease the human rights constituency. This was indicated by the fact that although some sanctions were imposed on a few Saudis, MBS was not subjected to any penalties. President Joe Biden’s call to King Salman the day before the document’s release reinforces this message. It made no mention of the imminent release of the damning report and instead assured the Saudi monarch of America’s continued support for his country’s security. According to the White House, Mr. Biden “discussed regional security, including the renewed diplomatic efforts led by the United Nations and the United States to end the war in Yemen, and the U.S. commitment to help Saudi Arabia defend its territory as it faces attacks from Iranian-aligned groups.”  Balancing act These actions demonstrate that Mr. Biden is engaged in a balancing act aimed at assuaging domestic anger at the Saudi government’s role in the murder of an American resident and a columnist for The Washington Post while preserving America’s long-standing strategic and economic relationship with the Saudi regime. Saudi Arabia’s strategic importance for Washington derives from the fact that it is America’s principal regional partner in its efforts to contain Iranian influence in West Asia. Riyadh’s strategic value has increased with the sequential normalisation of Israel’s relations with Arab countries allied to it since the success of this process is heavily dependent upon Saudi approval. Such normalisation suits Washington, for it relieves pressure on it to address the Palestinian issue. Furthermore, Mr. Biden cannot afford to alienate the Saudi regime beyond a point because this could intensify Riyadh’s opposition to his stated intention of returning to the Iran nuclear deal. Saudi Arabia may decide to go public on this issue in conjunction with Israel, which also considers Iran its mortal enemy. While the U.S. is no longer dependent on Gulf oil, the importance of Saudi Arabia as the swing producer of oil for the health of the global economy on which U.S. prosperity depends rules out any possibility of the Biden administration punishing the regime for its human rights transgressions. Once the brouhaha over the CIA report blows over, one can expect Washington and Riyadh to return to business as usual. Realpolitik will, as has always been the case, trump human rights concerns.

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||A wolf in watchdog’s clothing||The new rules introduced by the Centre last week to regulate all types of digital platforms, with the idea of redressing user grievances and ensuring compliance with the law, are deeply unsettling as they will end up giving the government a good deal of leverage over online news publishers and intermediaries. This holds troubling implications for freedom of expression and right to information. Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, while launching ‘The Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021’, presented it as a “soft-touch oversight mechanism”. A government press note termed it “progressive” and “liberal”. It also claimed the rules seek to “address people’s varied concerns while removing any misapprehension about curbing creativity and freedom of speech and expression”. The soft tone notwithstanding, these rules force digital news publishers and video streaming services to adhere to a cumbersome three-tier structure of regulation, with a government committee at its apex. This, in itself, is unprecedented in a country where the news media have been given the space all along to self-regulate, based on the mature understanding that any government presence could have a chilling effect on free speech and conversations. That the new rules pertain only to digital news media, and not to the whole of the news media, hardly provides comfort, as the former is increasingly becoming a prime source of news and views. Further, it is of significant concern that the purview of the IT Act, 2000, has been expanded to bring digital news media under its regulatory ambit without legislative action, which digital liberties organisations such as the Internet Freedom Foundation have flagged. The three-tier regulatory mechanism will seek to redress complaints with respect to the digital platforms’ adherence to a Code of Ethics, which among other things includes the ‘Norms of Journalistic Conduct’, compiled by the Press Council of India, the Programme Code of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, as also a negative list of content that shall not be published (essentially what one would encounter under law as reasonable restrictions to free speech). While there is not much that is wrong with the Code of Ethics per se , what is problematic is that it will take little to bring this regulatory mechanism to vicious life. According to the rules, “Any person having a grievance regarding content published by a publisher in relation to the Code of Ethics may furnish his grievance on the grievance mechanism established by the publisher.” So, literally anyone could force a digital platform to take up any issue. It has to be taken up first, under the new rules, by the digital platform’s grievance officer. If there is no resolution or if the complainant is dissatisfied, this can be escalated to a “self-regulating” body of publishers. This can then be escalated to the highest level, the government’s Oversight Mechanism, according to which an inter-departmental committee will be set up to address the grievance. Apart from imposing a compliance burden on digital publishers — many are small entities — this also opens the floodgates for all kinds of interventions. The potential for misuse is enormous. The new rules have increased the compliance burden for social media platforms too. The bigger of these platforms will have to appoint chief compliance officers, to ensure the rules and the laws are adhered to, and a nodal officer, with whom the law enforcement agencies will be coordinating, apart from a grievance officer. Such platforms in the messaging space will have to “enable the identification of the first originator of the information on its computer resource” based on a judicial order. Thus, the rules require messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal to trace problematic messages to the originator. While the triggers for a judicial order that require such an identification are serious offences, it raises uneasy questions about how such apps will be able to adhere to such orders, as their messages are encrypted end-to-end. There is no denying that there are problems with online content, which the government has rightly highlighted now. Its release has referred to a 2018 Supreme Court observation that the government “may frame necessary guidelines to eliminate child pornography, rape and gangrape imageries, videos and sites in content hosting platforms and other applications”, besides making a mention of discussions in Parliament about social media misuse and fake news. Some amount of tightening of policy is inevitable given new challenges. But it would be wrong to imagine that by implanting itself in the grievance redress process or by making platforms share more information, the government can solve these problems. It could prove counterproductive in a country where the citizens still do not have a data privacy law to guard themselves against excesses committed by any party. Regulation has an important place in the scheme of things, and no one advocates giving a free pass to the digital platforms. But then, as this newspaper argued earlier, the laws to combat unlawful content are already in place. What is required is their uniform application. It is also far from reassuring that this government has had an uneasy, sometimes unpleasant, relationship with media in general. The appetite for criticism, so vital in a democracy, is just not there. Some weeks ago, the government had a run-in with Twitter after it defied orders to ban certain hashtags and handles. And given an environment where people are sensitive to content, the regulatory mechanism could become an operational nightmare. Worse, the casualties could be creativity and freedom of expression. The government would like to see itself as a watchdog of digital content in the larger public interest, but it comes across as a predator.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-wolf-in-watchdogs-clothing/article33957966.ece
01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Repairs of shrine.||The question of repairs of the sacred shrine at Srirangam, dedicated to Sri Ranganathaswamy, has already been the subject of comments in our columns and our attention is now drawn to a memorial submitted to H.E. the Governor of Madras, by the Vishnu Bakthas and those interested in the preservation of this ancient temple from decay and destruction. The memorial refers to the report of the Collector of Trichinopoly dated 14th February 1828, where it is stated, “As the allowance of the pagoda was formerly so much higher than it, at present is, the pagoda should always possess claims on the Government for the performance of such repairs as it might actually require.” The government seem to have approved of the suggestion of the then Collector, and they have, since then, been paying Rs. 35,000 per year retaining in their hands “as a trust” the withheld portion of the former allowance of Rs. 40, 178-14-3 for repairs. It is also stated that the order of transfer of temple management from Government to Trustees did not refer to repairs, nor were the surplus funds “admittedly in deposit” handed over to the Trustees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/repairs-of-shrine/article33957973.ece

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||ASK US||Q.I am a government employee and my parents are senior citizens. The upper limit for medical expenditure/insurance in respect of senior-citizen parents is Rs. 50,000. Further, for individuals, the limit is Rs. 25,000. 1. Kindly help clarify whether one can claim the benefit of Rs. 50,000 deduction for medical expenditure under 80D for parents only for certain specified illnesses or for any regular treatment from a recognised hospital or medical practitioner. 2. Since I am covered under government and private insurance, can I claim deduction for my medical expenditure (for which I have not claimed benefits either from the government or from the private insurer) apart from the insurance premium? If yes, then why doesn’t the ITR page provide space for the filling up of personal expenditure details? Kindly also suggest further reading to have in-depth idea of benefits under 80D. Ayodhya Sahu  N. Sree Kanth replies:  A.For non-senior citizens, deduction is available only for medical health insurance premium paid for themselves and dependent family up to Rs. 25,000. However, you may claim expenses incurred for preventive health check-up up to Rs. 5,000 for yourself and dependent family subject to the overall limit of Rs. 25,000. You may refer Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for an in-depth idea.  (N. Sree Kanth is partner, GSS Associates, Chartered Accountants, Chennai)  Q.My mother is a beneficiary of family pension. Her 80C & 80D are full and I was looking to invest in NPS to get benefits under 80CCD. Please advise whether beginning investments into NPS at age 58 is advisable. Are there other investment options to save on tax? Vivek Keshri  Vidya Bala answers:  A.While NPS investment is allowed till the age of 65, we think liquidity is more important for her at this stage than saving tax. Consider investing in a mix of short-term FDs and low-risk, short-term debt mutual funds from which she can withdraw money when she wants to. With debt funds, tax efficiency will kick in after three years when it becomes long term in nature and she can get long-term capital gain indexation benefit. However, if you are still keen that she enters NPS, make sure you invest only in the corporate bond and gilt options instead of equity. Also note that there will be compulsory part-annuity conversion requirement. You cannot fully withdraw the amount. Q.I am a retired senior citizen, aged 71. I have invested about 50% of the retirement corpus (along with my wife) in major PSBs and NBFCs. The balance is distributed among SCSS (maximum limit reached), LIC Vaya Vandana scheme (earlier scheme), PPF, RBI (7.75%) bonds, and debt funds. Some of our bank and NBFC FDs will mature soon. Bank and NBFC interest rates are coming down sharply. Kindly advise on other secure investment options available (regular income) with better returns, as we are dependent on our interest income. (Name withheld on request) A.In the current rate scenario, RBI Floating Rate Bond 2020 is a superior option. And if rates do go up, you will see this bond paying you higher rates as it is a floating-rate instrument. So, lock more into this. Next, lock into 6-12-month bank fixed deposits, low rates notwithstanding. When they mature, chances are that rates will be up. You can lock into longer duration, then. Some near-term income sacrifice may be necessary to ensure your capital is safe. You will benefit once the rate cycle moves up. Q.I am 38 years old, currently working with a private company and earning Rs. 54,000 per month. I am paying Rs. 1,10,936 as LIC premium. I pay Rs. 24,000 annually towards PPF, Sukanya Samriddhi scheme Rs. 36,000 and SIP Rs. 2,000 per month. I have three daughters. Kindly advise whether my existing financial plan is good, or if I need to change anything to get better returns in future. (A majority of my existing LIC policies will be maturing by 2025). Sajan A.On your investments, you have chosen quality government schemes, but they account for less than 10% of your earnings. A good chunk goes towards traditional policies. While we will be unable to comment on the policies without knowing the details, in general traditional policies earn low returns. Hence, if there are policies where you can discontinue premiums (check on the repercussions), please do that, and focus on increasing your investments to at least 15% of your income. PPF and Sukanya Samriddhi are good. If you can take risks, then add in equity mutual funds. Keep it simple by using passive index funds such as the Nifty 50 and small sums in passive international index funds (Nasdaq 100 or S&P 500).

01 March 2021||SURAT,||Hyderabad prevails in a thriller||Hyderabad pulled off a thrilling, two-run win over Goa in a Vijay Hazare Trophy Elite Group-A match here on Sunday. Chasing a challenging target of 346, Goa seemed to be on course for an improbable win before it faltered at the last hurdle despite impressive centuries by Eknath Kerkar (169 n.o.,143b, 19x4, 2x6) and Snehal Kauthankar (116, 112b, 15x4). The two put on 225 runs for the second wicket to push Hyderabad onto the backfoot.  It was left-arm spinner Tanay Tyagarajan’s crucial blow removing Kauthankar which brought Hyderabad back into the game in the 42nd over. Left-arm spinner B. Sandeep dismissed Amit Verma (12) and pacer T. Ravi Teja chipped in with two quick wickets to reduce Goa to 291 for four in 47th over. This even as Eknath was in a zone, determined to guide the team through.  Goa needed 20 runs off the last over bowled by pacer Rakshann Readdi to win. With a four needed off the last ball, Kerkar could only get a single from a yorker, leaving himself and the team disappointed as it fell short so narrowly. Earlier, captain and southpaw Tanmay Agarwal (150, 131b, 19x4, 1x6) and Tilak Varma (128, 9x4, 5x6) put on a mammoth first wicket stand of 264 in 41.3 overs to help Hyderabad pile up 345 for six in 50 overs. It was the second centuries for the two batsmen in this edition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hyderabad-prevails-in-a-thriller/article33958336.ece
01 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka seals quarterfinals berth||Devdutt Padikkal (145 n.o., 125b, 9x4, 9x6) and captain R. Samarth (130 n.o., 118b, 17x4) powered Karnataka to a 10-wicket victory against Railways in their last Vijay Hazare Trophy group stage match at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Sunday. The comprehensive win helped Karnataka (16 points) seal a quarterfinal berth, as the Group ‘C’ topper.  Uttar Pradesh and Kerala, tied with Karnataka on points but behind on net run rate, have a very good chance of qualifying after recording thumping victories of their own. At Alur (3) ground, Kerala chased Bihar’s 148 in only 8.5 overs. Robin Uthappa (87 n.o., 32b, 4x4, 10x6), Vishnu Vinod (37, 12b, 2x4, 4x6) and Sanju Samson (24 n.o., 9b, 2x4, 2x6) threw the kitchen sink at the hapless Bihar bowling. The incredible hitting boosted Kerala’s net run rate and its chances of making the cut. At Just Cricket ground, Uttar Pradesh chased Odisha’s 148 in 21.4 overs to stay alive in the competition. The final list of qualified teams will be clear after Group ‘D’ and Group ‘E’ matches conclude on Monday. It was a dream outing for the Karnataka opening pair of Padikkal and Samarth. Padikkal recorded his third consecutive century, to go with scores of 52 and 97 in the first two matches. Newly-appointed captain Samarth brought up his second century of the tournament, to go with two fifties. For Railways, Pratham Singh (129, 138b, 12x4, 3x6) starred with the bat, but it was not enough on the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/karnataka-seals-quarterfinals-berth/article33958093.ece

01 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Rohit has proved himself in tougher home conditions||Despite making his India debut 13 years ago, Rohit Sharma is still not perceived to be a reliable Test batsman. In fact, thanks to the huge gap between his batting average at home (81.05) and overseas (27.00), he is referred to by some as a flat-track bully in Test cricket. Consistent showing In the last two months, however, the Mumbai maverick has evolved into a reliable opening batsman in challenging conditions. While he gave India a start in three of the four innings he played in Australia last month, February has seen Rohit consistently making a mockery of the England bowlers on spin-friendly tracks. His 161 in Chennai in the second Test and 66 in the first innings of the pink-ball Test here have been instrumental in India making a strong comeback in the ongoing series and being on the cusp of qualifying for the World Test Championship final. While a majority of batsmen from both the teams struggled to get their act together on excessively spin-friendly surfaces in the second and third Tests, Rohit appeared to be at his dominating best. Besides his aggressive mindset, his defensive technique against spinners has also been a standout feature of his performances. Wrong reasons At the start of the year, however, Rohit was in the news for all the wrong reasons. Having made a hasty return for the Indian Premier League Playoffs, Rohit missed the limited-over leg and the first two Tests in Australia. Ever since landing in Australia after undergoing a rigorous rehab at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru and serving a 14-night quarantine Down Under, Rohit ensured he was back in shape in time for the New Year’s Test in Sydney. “I knew once I finished the quarantine, I had just five-six days to get ready for the Test. It wasn't the first time I would’ve had that much time to get ready for a game, so I knew what exactly had to be done. “It’s not easy but a lot of people helped me get there. It was a good journey with a lot of learning personally,” Rohit said ahead of the third Test. The learnings have reflected on the ground, in far more challenging conditions than he has faced earlier in whites at home. Thanks to his consistent outings — only two of his last 10 innings have been single-digit scores — Rohit has emerged as India’s highest run-getter at the start of the year. India will be hoping that his run of form continues not just in the last rubber of the series starting March 4 but also for the crucial assignments in whites later in the year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohit-has-proved-himself-in-tougher-home-conditions/article33958060.ece
01 March 2021||Indore,||Audacious Andhra makes quarterfinals||On an exciting final day of the league stage, Andhra pipped Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand on net run rate (NRR) to top Elite Group-B and qualify for the quarterfinals of the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Sunday. Audacious effort Even as Tamil Nadu chased down Vidarbha’s total of 150 in 11.2 overs to post a five-wicket win, Andhra produced an even more audacious effort as it chased Jharkhand’s 139 in just 9.5 overs to end the league stage with 12 points with an NRR of +0.732 while Tamil Nadu had a NRR of +0.652. Asked to bat, Vidarbha was skittled out for 150 thanks to three-wicket hauls from off-spinner B. Aparajith (3/10) and medium-pacers J. Kousik (3/22) and M. Mohammed (3/33). Leading the way In reply, N. Jagadeesan led the way with an 18-ball 48 (4x4, 4x6) before Mohammed chipped in with an unbeaten 37 off 14 balls (3x4, 3x6) to help TN reach the target in quick time. In the other match, Andhra medium-pacer M. Harishankar Reddy justified his team’s decision to field by scalping four-wickets (4/39) as Jharkhand was bowled out for just 139.  Needing to get the job done quickly, openers Ashwin Hebbar (44, 18b, 4x4, 4x6) and Ricky Bhui (57 n.o., 5x4, 5x6) went on the rampage, adding 82 runs in just 5.5 overs. Bhui ensured he stayed unbeaten and shocked Jharkhand which was leading the table heading into this match with a NRR of +1.399. Vasu’s take Tamil Nadu coach D. Vasu said, “We produced a clinical effort today, but it wasn’t enough in the end. A case of so near, yet so far. “Overall, it was a good season for us and every player delivered when given an opportunity and we just need to build on this for our big goal which is winning the Ranji Trophy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tamil-nadu-misses-the-bus-on-nrr/article33958148.ece

The Hindu understands that Ashish Bhowmick, the Board of Control for Cricket in India chief curator who has been overseeing the preparation of the pitch at the new stadium, is set to offer a spinning track yet again. According to a BCCI insider, despite the uproar over the third Test pitch, which led to England captain Joe Root saying it was up to International Cricket Council to determine the quality of the pitch while India’s camp defending the track to the hilt, the India camp doesn’t want to “take any chances by offering a flatbed and risk its chances of progressing to the World Test Championship”.

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Mumbai beats ATKMB to top table, bags ACL berth||Mumbai City FC scripted a 2-0 triumph over ATK Mohun Bagan (ATKMB) at the GMC Stadium in Bambolim on Sunday to bag the ISL League Winners Shield and the coveted AFC Champions League spot that comes with it. Mumbai and ATKMB finished level on 40 points, but the former claimed first place with a better head-to-head record. Sergio Lobera’s side went ahead in the the seventh minute via a thumping header from Mourtada Fall off a perfectly flighted free-kick from Ahmed Jahouh. In the 39th minute, Bartholomew Ogbeche doubled the lead, reacting fastest after Hernan Santana’s sublime free-kick had rattled the crossbar. ATKMB came out stronger in the second period, but Mumbai sat back and defended its lead successfully. Earlier in the day, a goal-line clearance by Ivan Gonzalez and a leaping save by Dheeraj Singh, both deep into injury time, secured FC Goa the point it needed to bag the last playoff spot, against Hyderabad FC at Fatorda. It is the sixth time in seven years that Goa has made the last four, including four on the trot from 2017. Three minutes into stoppage time, with the game locked at 0-0, Gonzalez cleared the ball from underneath the feet of an onrushing Liston Colaco after Dheeraj had palmed away a powerful shot from Roland Alberg.

01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Interpreting Vedic mantras||During weddings, a yoke is placed on the bride’s head. The mantra recited is a reference to the story of Apala, who had a skin disease. She prayed to Indra, who got rid of her disease. The mantra says Apala glowed like the Sun, when she was cured. A woman is compared to the cool Moon, not the glaring sun. So why the equation to the Sun? Here a reference to Andal’s ‘kadirmadiyam pol mugathaan’, would be useful, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. She says Krishna was like ‘kadir’ the burning rays of the Sun as far as the Kauravas were concerned. But to the Pandavas, He was pleasant like the Moon. There is also a story in the Adi Parva of Mahabharata, about two brothers — Sunda and Upasunda. They had a boon, that none could kill them. The only way for them to die would be if they killed each other. Armed with this boon, they created havoc everywhere. So finally, Brahma sent a beautiful woman called Tilottama to get the brothers to fight each other. The two brothers fell in love with her, and fought over her and killed each other. When Tilottama went back to Brahma, he blessed her and said she would glow like the Sun, and that none could look at her with wrong intentions. Now back to the Vedic mantra. Apala glowing like the Sun, is to indicate that none would be able to have wrong thoughts about her, for such would be the fierceness of her glow. So, obviously, the prayer through this marriage mantra, is for the bride to be protected from lustful eyes. She will be affectionate and pleasant to behold, as far as her husband is concerned, but for others, she will be akin to the Sun. Vedic mantras are not easily explained. That is why Ramanujacharya said that one cannot attempt to explain them without reference to Itihasas and Puranas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/interpreting-vedic-mantras/article33958061.ece

01 March 2021||Ghaziabad,||Rise above social barriers: Tikait||Delivering a stirring speech in Saharanpur on Sunday, Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said 2021 has seen the rise of farmer as a religion and caste and asked peasants to rise above social barriers. Underlining the importance of strengthening social ties, Mr. Tikait said the movement would be a success only when “the landowner joins hands with the farm labour.” “I appeal to you to worship the Valmiki community before entering any temple. You may build palaces and forts but without their support, you cannot keep them clean,” he said. At the Ghazipur protest site, a farmer with 50 bighas of land was sharing a tent with one who has only two bighas, he said. “This bonhomie should reflect in villages as well. Those who are busy with the movement, their crop will be harvested by others in the villages,” the BKU leader said, urging farmers to form committees in villages in this regard.  ‘Parties cautioned’ Cautioning political parties not to harvest votes out of the non-political movement, Mr. Tikait said a weak Opposition was also dangerous for the country. “If it had raised voice in the Parliament, these Bills would not have been passed.” On January 28, he said, the principles of Constitution were about to be violated as the goons of the ruling party were ready to attack and humiliate the farmers returning from the protest. “There was no Opposition party in sight,” he remarked. Giving hints of the road ahead, Mr. Tikait said “political parties will not change the fortune of the farmer. Country’s public will alter the fortune of the farmer, this non-political organisation will change the plight of the farmer.” ‘I will go to Bengal’ Towards the end of the speech, he said he would go to the poll-bound West Bengal as well. Addressing the massive gathering of farmers in Lakhnaur village of Saharanpur, Mr. Tikait said after its tactics to divide farmers failed, the government was silent for the past 10 days. “I appeal to you stay united because I fear they might come up with new ‘funda’ (ploy).” He reiterated that “camera aur kalam” (the media) were working under the shadow of the gun and farmers should not believe everything that was being shown and written in the name of news.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rise-above-social-barriers-tikait/article33958236.ece
01 March 2021||March 01 2021 00:00 IST,||Kejriwal gives wings to his party’s U.P. ambitions at kisan panchayat in Meerut||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday described the new farm laws as “death warrants” for farmers and gave flight to Aam Aadmi Party’s political ambition to cross the Yamuna and enter Uttar Pradesh. Promising to control the erring sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh on the lines of power distribution companies in Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal asked a kisan panchayat in Meerut to vote for his party with the right intent. He said farmers were in pain for 70 years because they have been cheated by different governments and parties. Now, the three farm laws have made it a matter of life and death. “The farmers have been asking for right price of their produce,” he said. Party manifestoes, he said, promise the right price of their crops but when these parties come to power, they forget about their commitment. He said the BJP had left the Colonial government behind in tormenting the farmers. Mr. Kejriwal said farmers were sitting on the road in the cold because “these laws would reduce them to labourers on their own land. It has come down to a do or die kind of situation.” He said that in 2014, BJP asked for votes by promising to implement the Swaminathan Committee Report. “However, within three years in power, it submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court that said minimum support price could not be 50% more than the cost of the produce. It amounts to backstabbing the farmers.” He charged the BJP government of planning the Red Fort incident. “As a Chief Minister, I meet different people. I have been told that farmers were deliberately guided towards the Red Fort. Our farmers can’t be anti-national.” Responding to the PM’s promise that MSP will remain, Mr. Kejriwal said he wanted to see a mandi in U.P. where the crop is being bought at MSP. He also ridiculed U.P. CM Yogi Adityanath for not being able to stand up to sugar mills. “Their Ministers say that guaranteeing MSP would cost Rs. 17 lakh crore to the exchequer. I say without spending a single extra penny, the government could buy 23 crops at the MSP. In return, the government would get the crops that it would sell in the market. It might lead to profit or loss but in the long run, it all evens out.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kejriwal-gives-wings-to-his-partys-up-ambitions-at-kisan-panchayat-in-meerut/article33958242.ece
01 March 2021||Guwahati,||Grand alliance advised to target 70 seats||Hours after severing ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joining the Congress-led ‘mahajath’ or grand alliance, Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) chief Hagrama Mohilary said it would be more realistic to target 70 seats to form the next government in Assam. Before the BPF became its seventh constituent, the grand alliance had eyed more than 100 of Assam’s 126 Assembly seats in response to the BJP’s “Mission 100”. “We need to win 64 seats to form the government. Since it is unnecessary to win more seats, let’s ensure 70 seats and let the others share the remaining seats. It can be difficult to manage if we win more than necessary. I am sure we can attain simple majority,” Mr. Mohilary told journalists on Sunday. He had virtually taken centre-stage among leaders of the seven allies who addressed the media.  RJD may join alliance Apart from the BPF and the Congress, the grand alliance constituents are the minority-based All India United Democratic Front, Communist Party of India, CPI (Marxist), CPI (Marxist-Leninist) and the regional Anchalik Gana Morcha. The Rashtriya Janata Dal is expected to join the alliance. Mr. Mohilary said countering BJP’s slogans in their language would serve no purpose. “Let us not repeat their absurd claims (of winning 100 seats). Unlike some parties, we will not have to buy support from others to form the government. We can form the government without bribes because people want the BJP’s misrule to end,” he said. The BPF chief and former head of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) also panned Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for resorting to horse-trading in the December 2020 BTC polls. “We don’t want to form the government adopting the methods Himanta Biswa Sarma used after the BTC elections. He abducted elected representatives, kept them confined in hotels and formed the government there. As a consequence, they have already started fighting among themselves,” Mr. Mohilary said.  Single-largest party The BPF, which ruled 40-member BTC for 17 years, had emerged as the single-largest party in the council polls with 17 seats. But its rival United People’s Party Liberal (12 seats), the BJP (10, after an elected Congress member defected) and the Gana Suraksha Party (one) forged a post-poll alliance to form the council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/grand-alliance-advised-to-target-70-seats/article33958234.ece
01 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Some protesters at Ghazipur border find shade under flyover, crowds thin||With the summers approaching and the temperatures on the rise, the protesters at Ghazipur border have started to move under the flyover at U.P. Gate for shade. The crowd at the main stage has thinned as the protesters are keeping to their tents. An organiser, who did not wish to be named, when asked about the low turnout of protesters at Ghazipursaid many have gone back to their homes to finish pending work at farms. ‘Precautions in place’ “The movement is moving with full pace and strategically. Taking care of protesters especially old age people, we have requested them to remain inside tents. The plastic sheet that was used in tents in winters has been replaced with bamboo blinds and jute pads,” said the organiser. A protester, Kamal Singh, said as their leader is busy mobilising farmers in other States. “We have made a rotational shift to ensure 2,000 protesters are at the Ghazipur border at any time of the day. We are talking to Ghaziabad administration overpower supply issue at the site. We will also arrange for fans and coolers...the protesters will not face any inconvenience,” said Mr. Kamal. Food menu changed Ravinder, who was on duty at langar, said they have started providing lunch to the elderly people inside their tents as queuing in hot weather will be tough for them. “We have started distributing lassi and other beverages to keep the protesters hydrated. Food menu has been changed accordingly because, in summers, people need a light diet,” said Mr. Ravider. The tents, which were earlier erected on the highway in the open, have now shifted to under the flyover. However, due to space crisis, only a few tents could be accommodated under the flyover and the remaining have to be in open. “We have changed the pattern of our protest and all kinds of activities have been shifted to post 5 p.m. Staying under the sun is not a big deal for farmers because, during sowing season, we work under direct sun for days. Keeping the health of elderly protesters in mind, we have moved their tents under the flyover or shades,” said Kishore Singh, a protester.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/some-protesters-at-ghazipur-border-find-shade-under-flyover-crowds-thin/article33958246.ece

01 March 2021||New Delhi,||Find designated area for feeding stray dogs in Vasant Kunj: HC||Ordering a solution to the perennial problem of feeding street dogs inside a residential colony in Vasant Kunj here, the Delhi High Court has directed the Animal Welfare Board of India to intervene and find a specified spot that can be used for the purpose. The issue has been a major cause of conflict between resident animal lovers in Sector E Pocket 2, Vasant Kunj and the Residents Welfare Association (RWA). The animal lovers had moved the court contending that they have been met with “enormous resistance” by the local residents when they try to feed the dogs. On the other hand, the RWA raised the point that the menace of street dogs has reached an alarming point because people fear to come out without a stick and many residents, including children, have been bitten by these dogs. Justice Prathiba M. Singh said there has not been a consensus in identifying a suitable spot for feeding the street dogs. In order to maintain peace and harmony in the locality, the court ordered AWBI to send two representatives on March 8 to hold a meeting. “During the meeting, the members of AWBI and RWA shall interact with the residents and also the petitioners [animal lovers] and identify a spot, which is not used by children, senior citizens and other residents so that it can be used for the purpose of feeding and taking care of street dogs etc.,” the High Court said. “Once the said spot is identified, the petitioners would feed and take care of the street dogs at that particular spot. No hindrance, whatsoever, shall be caused to the petitioners in carrying out any activities in respect of the street dogs at the said spot,” the court ordered. “It shall be the duty of the SHO concerned to ensure that peace and harmony among the RWAs and petitioners,” the court ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/find-designated-area-for-feeding-stray-dogs-in-vasant-kunj-hc/article33958240.ece

The Chilika Development Authority (CDA), the regulatory body for the lake, has begun planned eviction of prawn gherries (enclosures) from Sunday. “We are beginning eviction of illegal gherries from the Krushnaprasad block of Puri district. Three platoons of police and senior officials were deployed to ensure smooth eviction,” said CDA Chief Executive Susanta Nanda. In 2017, CDA had uprooted enclosures over 160 sq km. “This time we are going for eviction in 40 sq km area,” said Mr. Nanda. A few years ago, satellite imageries had found 14,590 hectare of the lagoon under manmade gherries for illegal prawn cultivation. During COVID-19 pandemic last year, a few net gherries had again come up, though in smaller numbers. District administrations of Puri, Ganjam and Khordha have been intimated of the exact status. Endangered Irrawaddy dolphins were the first beneficiaries of the eviction drive. The mammals could move unhindered in Chilika Lake. In Rambha sector, dolphins were sighted for the first time in three decades. Besides, there was sudden increase in the population of ducks who prefer to dive in open water. Their population was noticed during the current season, particularly in the prawn gherries evicted areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/eviction-of-prawn-gherries-restarts-at-chilika-lake/article33958238.ece
