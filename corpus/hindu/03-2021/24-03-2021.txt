24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||As cases rise, govt. gives nod to inoculate all over 45 from April 1||Citizens above the age of 45, irrespective of co-morbidities, will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccination from April 1, the government announced on Tuesday. At present, only citizens above 60 and those over 45 with co-morbidities are allowed to get the vaccination. “This decision has been taken by the Union Cabinet on the basis of the advice of the COVID task force and experts,” said Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, while making an appeal to eligible citizens to register for vaccination. According to him, over 4.85 crore people had received at least one dose of the vaccine. He added that 80 lakh had recei-ved the second dose so far.The cut-off date for the 45+ years category is those persons born before January 1, 1977, the Health Ministry said. Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan has on Tuesday written to the States/UTs stating that while the government has expanded the prioritised age group to include all persons aged 45 years and above for COVID-l9 vaccination, accordingly there will now be no need for a comorbidity certificate for people aged 45 years to 59 years, from April 1. Software modified “The Co-WIN software is also being suitably modified for doing away with the need for confirmation of co-morbidities,” he said. The Secretary added that the registration on Co-WIN would begin from April 1 and directed officials to immediately undertake measures for expansion of the vaccination drive. “While ensuring wider dissemination of information for increased uptake of vaccination services, the focus should be on optimal utilisation of the capacity of COVID-l9 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) while minimising the wastage of vaccines,” noted Mr. Bhushan in his letter. Meanwhile, with India currently seeing a surge in COVID cases former national president of the Indian Medical Association Ravi Wankhedkar said there is an urgent need to rework the vaccination strategy and encourage “vaccination on demand” to eligible people, high risk people, frontline workers in all fields and those interacting with large numbers every day and exposed to risk of infection. “Fortunately India is having more than adequate vaccine production capacity and we should involve the private health sector in a greater way to increase reach of vaccination and decrease vaccine hesitancy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/all-over-45-to-get-jab-from-april-1/article34145949.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Refund penal interest on EMIs, SC directs lenders||The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed banks and financial institutions to refund compound interest, interest on interest or penal interest collected on EMI for loans during the period of moratorium from March 1 to August 31 last year. “It is directed that there shall not be any charge of interest on interest/compound interest/penal interest for the period during the moratorium,” a Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R. Subhash Reddy and M.R. Shah said in a 148-page judgment. The court said the amount accumulated as compound/penal interest or interest on interest during the six-month moratorium on term loan EMIs should be given as “credit/adjusted in the next instalment of the loan account”. Justice Shah, who authored the judgment, reasoned that additional interest in form of compound or penal is usually collected from loan defaulters. When the payment of instalments had already been deferred during the moratorium, what was the need to burden borrowers, already reeling under the financial loss of a pandemic and lockdown, the court asked. The judgment also spelt relief for banks and lenders with the court lifting its nearly six-month bar on them from declaring accounts of borrowers as non-performing assets (NPAs). In October last, the top court had stopped banks and lenders from declaring accounts of borrowers as NPAs. The judgment concluded that the government’s scheme to restrict the waiver of interest on interest to loans worth only up to Rs. 2 crore as irrational. This scheme, introduced in October, was limited to debts in MSME, education, housing, consumer durables, credit card, auto, personal and consumption categories within the Rs. 2 crore limit. “There is no justification shown to restrict the relief of not charging interest on interest with respect to the loans up to Rs. 2 crore only, and that too, restricted to the aforesaid (eight) categories. There is no rationale to restrict such relief,” Justice Shah noted. But the court refused to entertain complaints from petitioners that the government did not do enough to ease the burden of financial strain during the pandemic. “By and large, everybody has suffered due to lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. Even the Government suffered due to non-recovery of GST... Merely, since the reliefs announced by the Union of India/RBI may not suit the desires of the borrowers, the reliefs/policy decisions related to COVID-19 cannot be said to be arbitrary or violative of Article 14 of the Constitution,” the court said. The apex court further refused the insistent pleas of the borrowers for a total waiver of interest for EMIs falling within the moratorium period. It also declined to extend the moratorium till December 2020 or, as some of the petitioners sought, another six months from August 31, 2020. The court said a total waiver of interest on loan EMIs would hit the banks and depositors hard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/refund-penal-interest-on-emis-sc-directs-lenders/article34145951.ece

24 March 2021||COLOMBO,||India abstains from UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka||India on Tuesday abstained from a crucial vote on Sri Lanka’s rights record at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. The resolution on ‘Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka’ was, however, adopted after 22 states of the 47-member Council voted in its favour. Colombo rejects move Sri Lanka, which had earlier deemed the resolution “politically motivated”, was quick to reject the UN move to collect and preserve evidence of war crimes in the country, committed by the armed forces and the LTTE. “Without the consent and acceptance of the country concerned, it cannot be implemented,” Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said at a media conference in Colombo. The statement made clear Sri Lanka’s resistance to the process envisaged in the resolution to prosecute war criminals through an international evidence gathering and investigation mechanism. The money allocated — an estimated $2.8 million — for the effort would find better use towards providing housing for the war-affected people, the Minister said, even as scores of Tamils continue seeking their lands, new homes and jobs from his government. Ahead of the vote, both the government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), which sought the exact opposite outcomes on the resolution, had expressed hopes of obtaining India’s support. On Tuesday, both sides appeared sympathetic to India’s abstention that effectively amounts to support for neither party. However, in an indication that Sri Lanka had construed abstentions as support, Mr. Gunawardena in a tweet thanked the 14 countries, including India, Japan and Nepal, that abstained from voting, while extending a “warm thank you” for the “solid support” shown by the 11 countries, including China, Pakistan, Russia and Bangladesh, that voted against the resolution, and in support of the Sri Lanka. On the other hand, welcoming the Council’s adoption of the resolution, the TNA said India must have decided to abstain after “careful consideration” of various factors. “We are, however, greatly encouraged by India’s statement ahead of the vote,” TNA spokesman and Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran said, pointing to India’s reference to “two fundamental considerations” — of supporting the Tamils for equality, justice, dignity and peace, and ensuring the unity, stability and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Amid strained bilateral ties over the Rajapaksa government’s recent decisions on strategic projects involving India and China, India pledged support for the international community’s call for the Sri Lankan government to fulfil its commitments on the “devolution of political authority” — which the resolution mentions — including through conduct of early polls to the country’s Provincial Councils and ensuring their effective operation, in accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution that followed the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-abstains-in-unhrc-vote-on-sri-lanka/article34145981.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||Delay debate on GNCTD amendment Bill in RS: TMC||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has urged Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu to postpone the discussion on the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 till all the members are able to attend Parliament. In a letter to Mr. Naidu, TMC’s Parliamentary Party leader for Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, argued that party MPs cannot be present in Parliament because of the upcoming Assembly elections in West Bengal. Voting for the first phase of polls in the State is scheduled for March 27. ‘Important legislation’ “This is an extremely important piece of legislation that has a significant impact on all of India. Each and every member of Parliament should be given the opportunity to express themselves when the House takes up discussion on the Bill,” Mr. O’Brien said in his letter. The Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on Monday and is likely to be taken up in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. Mr. O’Brien said holding a debate when many members of the House are away for elections in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry goes against the “spirit of deliberative, responsible governance that the Parliament embodies”. He said, “It further lays down a bad precedent regarding passage of important laws.” The MP said it would be a “gross miscarriage of justice” if the Bill is hastened through the Upper House. “I urge you to personally look into this matter and consider postponing the discussion and passing of this Bill till all members are able to attend Parliament,” he wrote. The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 gives the Lieutenant-Governor overarching powers above the elected government of Delhi and has been vociferously opposed by the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delay-debate-on-gnctd-bill-tmc/article34146179.ece
24 March 2021||Mumbai,||Hiren death: ATS probing involvement of more||The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Jaijeet Singh, Additional Director General (ADG) of police said on Tuesday that investigations are on to find out if more people are involved in the murder of automobile parts dealer Mansukh Hiren. Following the recovery of an SUV laden with explosives from outside industrialist Muukesh Ambani’s house in Mumbai, the ATS was asked to take over the probe on March 6. When officials recorded the statement of Hiren’s wife, she reportedly named the now arrested and suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze as responsible for his death. Mr. Singh said Mr. Vaze was a “prime accused” in the case. Mr.Vaze was arrested by National Investigation Aency (NIA) and ATS would approach the special NIA court for his custody. Their investigations revealed that Mr. Vaze had used five SIM cards procured from Gujarat through Naresh Ramniklal Gor and police constable Vinayak Shinde. “We found that the phones in which the SIM cards were used have been destroyed by the accused,” said Mr. Singh. ATS officials had procured CCTV footage from Mumbai and Thane, and efforts were on to recover footage that may have been destroyed. “We have also recovered a Volvo car from Daman which was allegedly used by the accused. FSL Kalina is carrying out forensic investigations,” said Mr. Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hiren-death-ats-probing-involvement-of-more/article34146467.ece

The order said that if the gatherings happen, it may pose a “considerable threat” of spread of the virus.  Also, there are many “super spreader areas” in the city such as weekly markets, metro services, religious places and others, the government said in another order and directed all DMs to “greatly intensify their enforcement efforts”. “The past fortnight has seen a persistent increase in the COVID-19 cases in Delhi and positivity is also on the rise. It has been observed that COVID-appropriate behaviour is not being followed amongst the general public,” the order said. Random testing The government has also decided to conduct random testing of people coming from other States. “All District Disaster Management Authorities shall conduct random testing (RAT/RT-PCR) of passengers coming from the States where COVID-19 cases are surging/rapidly increasing, at all airports, railway stations, inter-State bus terminals (ISBT) and other alighting points (for private buses) in NCT of Delhi. It shall be ensured that samples are taken randomly at the alighting points for conduct of tests,” said another order. Passengers who are found COVID-19-positive, shall be mandatorily quarantined at their place of stay or a government facility for 10 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-public-celebration-on-holi-other-festivals/article34146137.ece

24 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Prevent brazen use of public funds for campaigning, Madras HC tells ECI||The Madras High Court on Tuesday said the Election Commission of India (ECI) can put guidelines in place to ensure that public funds are not brazenly used by Ministers for campaigning purposes. It observed that the ECI had sufficient authority to put in place checks and balances allowing Ministers and the like to enjoy their official status while preventing them from spending government funds for campaigning or election purposes. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said that in an ideal world, there should be a level-playing field so that government functionaries don’t use the perks and benefits of their office while campaigning for elections. “Such standards were met by many a politician once upon a time, but are out of fashion these days,” the judges said, while disposing of a public interest litigation petition. The Ahimsa Socialist Party, represented by its president, T. Ramesh alias Gandhian Ramesh, had filed the PIL petition seeking a direction to the ECI to consider the representations made to it to prohibit Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and all others holding public office from campaigning on behalf of their party’s candidates. The party alleged that these people end up misusing their public office during elections, much to the disadvantage of the other candidates in the fray. Concurring with the sentiments expressed by the petitioner party, the first Division Bench said, “There are also other considerations which come into play in the modern world. There are security concerns. Thus, even though a Minister may be willing to shed his official bandobast to attend a rally merely as a politician, the very status of the Minister and the requirement to give him security cover may not permit the freedom that would be required for the purpose.” “This goes more so with higher officials like Chief Ministers and those holding Cabinet positions at the Centre. To such extent, the petitioner’s idealism may be slightly out of place. However, a strict Election Commission can, nonetheless, put some guidelines in place, in addition to the existing guidelines indicated in the model code, at least to ensure that government funds are not brazenly used for campaigning purposes as is usually being indulged in at present,” the judges added. “The Election Commission of India has sufficient authority to put checks and balances in place that allow a Minister or the like to enjoy their status and yet not spend official funds for campaigning or election purposes. However, the malaise is now deep-rooted. One has to wear allegiance to a political leader, if not on the sleeve, at least visibly crying out of the pocket. And these are not only in election time but adopted as a perennial measure almost as a talisman to ward off the evil eye,” the court observed. Finding some force in the arguments advanced by the petitioner’s counsel, T. Sivagnanasambandan, the judges said, “For whatever it is worth, the Election Commission of India shall deal with the petitioner’s representation for future elections, if not for the upcoming elections.” ECI counsel Niranjan Rajagopalan brought to the notice of the court that the model code of conduct prohibited Ministers from making use of official machinery or personnel for electioneering. “The code also states that Ministers should not combine their official visits with electioneering. The Prime Minister alone has been exempted from this,” he said. The Ahimsa Socialist Party, represented by its president, T. Ramesh alias Gandhian Ramesh, had filed the PIL petition seeking a direction to the ECI to consider the representations made to it to prohibit Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and all others holding public office from campaigning on behalf of their party’s candidates.

Personnel of the police’s District Reserve Guard (DRG) were returning in the bus to Naryanpur, 300 km from capital Raipur, after a counter-insurgency operation, said IGP (Bastar range) Sundarraj P. “Five DRG personnel, including the driver, were killed in the explosion,” he told PTI . Reinforcements were rushed to the spot. The bodies were removed and the injured personnel were evacuated from the forest. The injured were being airlifted to Raipur in an IAF chopper for treatment, the IG added. Earlier, DGP D.M. Awasthi said over 20 security personnel were on board the bus. The bus was passing along the under-construction Barsoor-Palli road, surrounded by dense forest of Abhujmad, when the naxals triggered a landmine near a culvert, said a police official. The bus fell off the culvert in the impact. This is the second major Naxal attack on DRG personnel — the frontline anti-naxal force of the State police — in the span of one year. The DRG personnel are recruited from among local youth and surrendered Naxals in Bastar division. Seventeen security personnel, including 12 from DRG, were killed in a Naxal ambush in Sukma district of the region on March 21, 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/five-policemen-killed-in-chhattisgarh-ambush/article34145980.ece

24 March 2021||Gwalior,||12 women among 13 killed in Gwalior road accident||Twelve women and a man were killed after the autorickshaw in which they were travelling collided with a speeding bus in Old Chawni area of Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday morning. The accident took place at 5 a.m. on the Gwalior-Morena road when the bus driver apparently tried to avoid hitting a person on the road, said State Transport Minister Govind Singh Rajput while announcing an inquiry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over the incident in a tweet. “I am deeply pained by the death of 13 persons in an accident in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior. I express my condolences to the kin of those killed and pray for the speedy recovery of those injured,” Mr. Modi tweeted. The women, who worked as cooks at an anganwadi kendra in Stone Park area in Old Chawni Ganga Malanpur locality, were returning home after work, Gwalior Collector Kaushlendra Vikram Singh said. The victims were residents of Gole ka Mandir and Jaderua areas in Gwalior. They were supposed to travel in two autorickshaws, but one of them was out of order, so they crammed into one vehicle, Mr. Singh said. Bus passengers unhurt While eight women and the autorickshaw driver died on the spot, the others succumbed to injuries in a hospital, District Superintendent of Police Amit Sanghi said. Passengers in the bus escaped unhurt, a senior official said, adding that the driver fled the spot leaving behind the vehicle. The Prime Minister approved an ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each for the kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 for those injured seriously from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, the PMO said. Expressing grief, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also announced an ex gratia of Rs. 4 lakh for the kin of the deceased. “It appears that the accident took place as the bus driver, while trying to save a milkman, hit the autorickshaw,” Mr. Rajput said. He added that the bus had a valid fitness certificate, insurance certificate and its permit was valid till 2026. Transport Commissioner Mukesh Jain, who reached the spot to conduct an inquiry, clarified that the Gwalior RTO had not been suspended as the probe was going on. “Till we get the inquiry report, no action will be taken against any official,” he said. Rajya Sabha member and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and State Congress president Kamal Nath also condoled the deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/12-women-killed-as-bus-autorickshaw-collide-in-mp/article34146183.ece

24 March 2021||Alappuzha,||Govt. did nothing to anger NSS: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the Left Democratic Front government has done nothing that qualified a rebuke from the Nair Service Society (NSS). Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, he said, “The NSS has its own stance. They mostly maintained equidistance. It also sometimes adopted right distance policy. Those levelling allegations should realise that the people will not accept baseless criticism against the government.” Different things The Chief Minister said that the LDF was committed to protecting the faith of believers of all religions. He said that religious belief and theocracy were two different things and there was a need for everyone, including believers, to join hands to defeat communal forces. “Actions of Sangh Parivar organisations have created insecurity among minority communities. However, organisations like the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Social Democratic Party of India are trying to exploit the situation. There will be no compromise on majority and minority communalism,” the Chief Minister said. Rejection of papers The rejection of nomination papers filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-National Democratic Alliance candidates in Thalassery, Guruvayur and Devikulam had led to fresh allegations of tacit understanding between parties. Mr. Vijayan said that people would not believe the papers were rejected due to carelessness. “There is some kind of agenda being worked out. If people suspect it will help the United Democratic Front (UDF), they could not be blamed. The Congress had received BJP votes in the past. There is a mutual agreement between the two parties,” the Chief Minister said, adding that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was a gentleman but the policies of the Congress and the BJP were the same. He said the Congress was compromising on its secular ideology. “The Congress is in decline and its leaders, including women, are deserting the party. It is rejecting secularism and warming to communal forces.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-doesnt-deserve-nss-rebuke-cm/article34146394.ece

24 March 2021||JAIPUR,||Farmers will sell crops outside Parliament, says Rakesh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said on Tuesday that farmers affected by the Centre’s agriculture sector laws would once again march to Delhi and sell their crops outside Parliament. “Last time, 3.50 lakh tractors entered Delhi on Republic Day. We will do this again,” he said. Addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat at Vidyadhar Nagar Stadium here, Mr. Tikait said the government had told the farmers that they could sell their crops anywhere, under the new farm laws. “We will sell our produce outside the State Assemblies, Collector’s offices and Parliament.... No mandi can be better than the Parliament,” Mr. Tikait said in the presence of Swaraj Abhiyan’s Yogendra Yadav and Bhim Army’s Chandrashekhar Azad. He called upon the farmers to lay siege to Delhi from all directions. The farmers would observe a day’s bandh on March 26 all over the country to protest against the farm laws. The BKU leader said while the government was trying to divide the country on the lines of caste, creed and religion, the farmers would defeat its designs and show unity to get their rights. The cultivators were faced with a situation where big companies had already built their warehouses and the laws were subsequently being enacted to protect their interests, he said. The rally, organised under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, received support from a large number of organisations, including the CPI, CPI(M), Rajasthan Jat Mahasabha, Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad and Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. This was the first major event of Samyukta Kisan Morcha in the State Capital, after the mahapanchayats in several districts of Rajasthan. Sudden rains and strong winds uprooted the tents at the rally and led to commotion. One person was injured when a pipe of the tent fell on him. The thin attendance at the rally, attributed to bad weather conditions, left the organisers disappointed. The farmer leaders paid homage to Bhagat Singh on his death anniversary. An announcement was made on the appointment of Jat Mahasabha president Raja Ram Meel as BKU’s State unit president and K.C. Ghumaria as general secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-will-sell-crops-outside-parliament-says-rakesh-tikait/article34146382.ece
24 March 2021||Guwahati,||BJP promises ‘corrected’ NRC in Assam||The BJP has pledged to release a “corrected” version of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) but avoided any reference to the implementation of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and Clause 6 of the Assam Accord. Assam was the first State to oppose the CAA as protesters said it violated the spirit of the 1985 Assam Accord that prescribed the midnight of March 24, 1971 as the cut-off date for detecting and deporting illegal immigrants. The CAA seeks to fast-track the citizenship of non-Muslims who fled religious persecution in three neighbouring countries and took refuge before December 31, 2014. Clause 6 of the Assam Accord guarantees Constitutional safeguards for the indigenous communities. Releasing the BJP manifesto containing “10 commitments” in Guwahati on Tuesday, party president J.P. Nadda said the objective of publishing a “corrected” version was to enlist genuine Indian citizens while identifying illegal migrants and residents who could not substantiate citizenship claims. “We will work towards protecting the rights of the Assamese people with a corrected NRC, which means taking into account the mandate given by the Supreme Court. We will protect the genuine Indian citizens and detect the infiltrators so that Assam can stay Assam,” he said. The final draft of the NRC was published on August 31, 2019. The document left out 19.06 lakh of 3.30 crore applicants. Unhappy with the outcome, the BJP has been demanding a re-verification of the NRC. It has promised to get it done if its alliance government is voted back to power. ‘Flood-free Assam’ Among the other commitments are ensuring a flood-free Assam through dredging of rivers and building large reservoirs for excess rainwater, strengthening namghars (community prayer halls) and creating a taskforce to recover lands of satras (Vaishnav monasteries) and places of worship of tribal people from illegal encroachment. It also said it would bring in appropriate laws to tackle and end the menace of “land jehad” as well as “love jehad”. Though the manifesto did not mention the CAA, Mr. Nadda said the party’s stand on it was unchanged. “Parliament passed the CAA. It will be implemented when it needs to be,” he said, insisting that implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord was under process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-promises-nrc-correction-in-assam/article34145902.ece
24 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||81% of positive samples in Punjab of U.K. strain||With 81% of the 401 COVID-19 samples sent by the State for genome sequencing turning out positive for the U.K. variant, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday appealed to the people to get themselves vaccinated. He urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to widen the vaccination ambit to cover those under 60 since this mutant had been found to be infecting young people more. The process needed to be expedited, he said, pointing to the fact that experts had found the existing Covishield vaccine to be equally effective against the U.K. variant — B.1.1.7.  Capt. Singh also urged people to strictly adhere to all safety protocols, including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. The appeal came after State’s expert committee head K.K. Talwar apprised him of the developments on the new variant, which has been witnessing a surge in the last few weeks. The Health Department had sent 478 positive samples to the NIB, the IGIB and the NCDC for genome sequencing, of which results of 90 samples were received and those showed only two samples for the new N440K variant. Thereafter, 401 more samples, collected between February 1 and March 10, were sent to the NCDC for genome sequencing. The result of these samples was worrying, as it showed presence of B.1.1.7 variant in 326 of them, said Dr. Talwar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/81-of-positive-samples-in-punjab-is-uk-strain/article34145925.ece
24 March 2021||Mangaluru,||Stall owner finds plastic bag in large fish||At a time when concerns are being raised about massive plastic pollution of waters, a fish stall owner in Mangaluru on Monday discovered a large plastic bag inside a bulky fish weighing about 10 kgs while preparing its meat. College of Fisheries Dean A. Senthil Vel said while it had become common to find fish consuming micro plastic, the presence of a plastic bag inside a fish showed that plastic had reached deep seas as the fish must have been caught in trawl fishing. Hasiru Dala Convener Nagaraj Raghav Anchan, who has been campaigning against plastic pollution in rivers, particularly the Netravati along with the Anti-Pollution Drive Foundation, said one cannot tell fish not to consume plastic but the least humans could do was stop throwing plastic into waterbodies. The fish stall owner, a friend of Mr. Anchan, shared the details with him, he said. Mr. Anchan said the initiative, ‘Namma Netravati, Namma Javabdari’, (Our Netravahi, our Responsibility) becomes more significant in this backdrop. The fish stall owner, who did not wish to be named, said it was for the first time in his two-decade old profession that he saw a full plastic bag inside a fish. “I was shocked,” he said. “Killing fish and other marine life through plastic waste is something unpardonable,” he added. It was a Reef Quad (Muru) fish, about 10 kg in weight and four feet in length. Prof. Vel told The Hindu the incident was an unusual one. “It is disturbing,” he said, after going through the video and photographs. More plastic than fish Fishermen were catching more plastic than fish in the seas with the increasing menace of plastic pollution of rivers, said Prof. Vel. Plastic amounts up to 40% of what comes within fishing nets, Prof. Vel said adding there was an urgent need to end plastic pollution. Fish normally consume micro plastic that toxifies their body and those of human beings that consume them. Abandoned fishing nets in deep seas or ghost nets too contribute to the plastic menace, apart from the large volume of plastic waste disposed off in waterbodies. A majority of plastic waste flows into seas through rivers and the administration could build fence bridges across rivers to prevent all kinds of solid waste joining the sea, Prof. Vel suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stall-owner-finds-plastic-bag-in-large-fish/article34145978.ece

Basavaraju, the Congress members rushed to the well of the House and resumed their dharna. They displayed CDs in a symbolic gesture and shouted slogans. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, who spearheaded the protest, declared that they would not co-operate with the government as it had not heeded to their demand. Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri adjourned the House for sometime as the protesters did not heed to his repeated appeals to withdraw the stir. He held a meeting with members of both ruling and the Opposition parties at his chambers to broker peace. After the meeting, the Congress slightly modified its stand on the probe. When the House resumed, Mr. Siddaramaiah said: “We are not asking for a judicial probe. Let the Special Investigation Team (SIT) continue, but the probe should be supervised by a High Court Chief Justice.” The Congress continued their protest after the House re-assembled post-lunch. Expressing dissatisfaction over this, the Speaker told the protesting members not to stall the House proceedings for settling scores with the government. “If you have any differences with the government, you can use any forum outside the House. But please do not prevent the House from conducting its business,” he said.  Meanwhile, JD(S) members staged a walkout to express their anger over not getting an opportunity to discuss drinking water crisis in the State. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai launched a counter-attack by reading out a notification issued by the erstwhile Congress government led by Mr. Siddaramaiah while ordering an inquiry related to a CD scandal involving then Minister H.Y. Meti. “Even this order is similar to what we have issued with respect to Mr. Jarkiholi,” he said, accusing the Congress of “double standards”. He said the Congress was indulging in “false propaganda”. Taking serious exception to this, Mr. Siddaramaiah accused the government of being stubborn. “The government is trying to protect a person who indulged in rape. The victim is not getting justice. Should we keep quiet?” he asked. “Why are you afraid of the probe being monitored by a HC CJ?” he sought to know. As there was no sign of protesters withdrawing the dharna, the Speaker took up adoption of two Bills as well as a resolution before adjourning the House for the day. There are indications of the Congress continuing its protest on Wednesday too as Mr. Siddaramaiah said the party wants to take the issue to a logical end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/stalemate-continues-in-karnataka-assembly/article34145872.ece
24 March 2021||Kolkata,||West Bengal election: BJP announces 13 candidates||The BJP on Tuesday announced the names of 13 candidates, including economist Ashok Lahiri and Lt. Gen. Subrata Saha (retd.), for the West Bengal Assembly poll. Mr. Lahiri’s name was initially announced for the Alipurduar constituency, but the party later replaced him with Suman Kanjilal, a local leader, after protests erupted over his candidature. Mr. Lahiri, who is a member of the 15th Finance Commision and a former Chief Economic Adviser, will contest from Balurghat, a relatively safe seat. Lt. Gen. Saha (retd.) will contest from the Rashbehari seat in south Kolkata. The party also replaced its candidates for the Chowringhee and Kashipur-Belgachia seats. The ones announced earlier refused to contest, leading to embarrassment for the party. The fresh candidates are Shivaji Singha Roy in Belgachia and Debrabrata Majhi in Chowringhee. The list includes candidates from the three hill constituencies of Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong. Darjeeling sitting MLA and Gorkha National Liberation Front leader Neraj Zimba is the party’s candidate for the seat again. At Kalimpong, the BJP has nominated Subha Pradhan, and at Kurseong, it is Bishnu Prasad Sharma. In Bagdha, the BJP has named former Trinamool MLA Biswajit Das as its candidate, while Subrata Thakur, a prominent Matua leader, will contest from Gaighata.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/west-bengal-election-bjp-announces-13-candidates/article34145904.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indus water panel holds meeting||After a gap of more than two and half years Indian and Pakistani delegations on Monday began the 116th Meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission here. The meeting which coincided with the National Day of Pakistan is being viewed as part of the broader process of normalisation of bilateral ties between the two neighbours. The two-day meeting of the Commission is being led on the Indian side by Indus Water Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Saxena. The Pakistani delegation is led by Pakistan's Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Mohammad Mehr Ali Shah. The last meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission was held on August 29, 2018. Hours after the conclusion of the first day's meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind greeted Pakistan on the occasion of its National Day which marks the March 23, 1940 Lahore Resolution which paved the way for the creation of Pakistan. At an event to mark the National Day, organised in the Pakistan High Commission, Aftab Hasan Khan, Charge'd Affaires, said, “Pakistan wants to have friendly relations with all countries including India. To achieve peace between India and Pakistan both countries shall resolve all outstanding issues.” The positive backdrop of the talks between the two delegation has indicated that the interaction is likely supported by the reported back channel talks that are taking place between India and Pakistan. The Hindu has reported earlier that the United Arab Emirates is playing a role in connecting India and Pakistan through back channel negotiations. The issue, however, did not draw a response from the Ministry of External Affairs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indus-water-panel-holds-meeting/article34145916.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||OTT case: SC stays all pleas in HCs||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the proceedings in High Courts in cases seeking regulation of content shown on over-the-top (OTT) platforms. A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud listed the case for hearing after the Holi break. The hearing was based on a plea by the Centre to transfer the cases in the High Courts to the Supreme Court. The Bench was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that despite the apex court’s earlier order issuing notice on the transfer plea filed by the Centre to club all such petitions filed in various High Courts, the Punjab and Haryana High Court is still proceeding in the matter pending there. Mr. Mehta said several fresh petitions were being filed in different High Courts on the issue. Counter affidavit A counter-affidavit filed by the Information and Broadcasting Ministry in another case said Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules of 2021 provides a “comprehensive” mechanism to check content on OTT platforms. The Ministry said the Rules was based on a globally recognised model and keeps a fine balance, considering the major audience these OTT platforms had while at the same time providing a healthy classification of content based on age groups. Recently, another Supreme Court Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan had criticised the 2021 Rules as lacking teeth to punish violators or to screen offensive content. Centre’s offer In that case, Mr. Mehta, speaking on behalf of the Centre, had agreed to consider drafting new regulations or even legislation to address the concern raised by the court about OTT platforms. The court had recorded in its order that the new Rules notified days back were “more in the nature of guidelines” and there was “no effective mechanism for screening or to take appropriate action” against violators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ott-case-sc-stays-all-pleas-in-hcs/article34145919.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||BJP MPs raise Deshmukh issue again||The treasury benches in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday again raked up the allegations made by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of running an extortion racket. The ruckus started a little before noon when BJP MP Sushil Modi sought to speak towards the end of the Zero Hour, demanding dismissal of Mr. Deshmukh. House Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu immediately shot down the demand, leading to protests from the treasury benches. Many BJP MPs stood up and started shouting slogans. Later, speaking outside the House, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, “It is the duty of the treasury benches to run the House. It is most unfortunate that the ministers themselves are leading the charge to disrupt the House. The Chair must name such ministers and advice them to conduct themselves. .” Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Modi said the events in Maharashtra were unprecedented and therefore, the reactions to it would also be “equally unprecedented”. “It is not a question of treasury benches or the opposition benches. This is a critical allegation against the Home Minister of such a big State like Maharashtra,” he said. Mr. Sushil Modi said Mr. Singh is not the only one to make such allegations. “A lady IPS officer has also accused the State Home Minister of taking money for transfers and postings. Then there is the case of IPS officer Sanjay Pandey who has filed a case in the SC, challenging the appointment of current DGP. So over all there is chaos in Maharashtra,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-mps-raise-deshmukh-issue-again/article34146144.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||India stronger despite pandemic: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday told BJP MPs that despite very challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, cyclones, earthquakes and tensions at the India-China border, the country had emerged stronger, with the world also acknowledging this fact. He was addressing a meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party, where he also touched upon the controversial farm laws. Mr. Modi cited the party’s good performance in the panchayat elections, where the “good intentions” behind the farm laws were clearly communicated to the people, and said it was a reason for remaining firm on them. He made a specific reference to the panchayat election in Pali in Rajasthan, the Lok Sabha constituency of former Union Minister P.P. Chaudhary, as an example. The BJP won more than 90% of the seats in the election, which took place amid protests against the farm laws. “Sharing his experiences of corona pandemic, Prime Minister Modi also told MPs that during that period, the country was not only facing the challenge of the virus, but on others fronts as well as there were tensions on LAC, cyclones, earthquakes and then there was locust swarm attack but despite all these odds, India emerged stronger and the entire world realised its potential,” Minister of state for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal said at a media briefing after the meeting. Mr. Modi also said he has been holding public office — earlier as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and now Prime Minister — for more than two decades without taking an off day. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also addressed the meeting. Mr. Jaishankar emphasised that India’s stature rose in the world during the pandemic for its medical diplomacy — first in providing antibiotics and testing kits and later for its vaccine diplomacy, Mr. Meghwal said. Ms. Sitharman emphasised that despite the economic impact of the pandemic, the government did not impose any additional tax on the public and came up with a comprehensive budget for all.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-stronger-despite-pandemic-pm/article34145895.ece

24 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Even acid attack couldn’t stop gritty woman from pursuing her dream||A local court in Rae Bareli on March 19 provided 22-year-old Pooja (name changed) a sense of closure two years after she was brutally attacked with acid. The court awarded the accused, her distant relative, life imprisonment for allegedly throwing acid on her in April 2019 when she was going for screening for a job in the police force. Pooja had suffered 29% burns; the acid burnt her neck, chest, abdomen, back and elbow and spent almost two months in hospital. The tragedy, however, did not deter her from chasing her ambition. In February 2020, ten months after the acid attack, Pooja joined the police and has been posted in a police station in east Uttar Pradesh. “When there is passion in the heart for something, nothing comes in the way. I could only see my goal and was bent on achieving it,” she says. On April 16 morning, Pooja, then 20, was on her way to a coaching centre for competitive exams in Unchahar when the accused Pradeep, her brother-in-law’s cousin, was allegedly waiting for her on the side of the road with a bottle in his hand. Pradeep allegedly caught hold of her cycle and poured acid on her back. As a crowd gathered, the accused fled the scene. Due to the pain and burning sensation, Pooja lost consciousness after four-five minutes. Pooja is reluctant to speak about the background behind the crime. Deputy Superintendent of Police Vineet Singh, who investigated the case, says the accused attacked Pooja because she rejected his marriage proposal. “Acid is mostly used to deface the girl when she refuses to continue the affair or marry,” he said. In her statement to the court, Pooja said she knew the accused for five years and that he would phone her and message her expressing love and asking for marriage apart from sending her indecent texts. Due to this, she said, she started avoiding his calls. While convicting Pradeep under Section 326 A of the IPC, special judge Heera Lal said there was no ground for any “empathy” for such persons who disfigure a woman by pouring acid on her. The convict was also fined Rs. 50,000. Given the low conviction rate in acid attacks, Pooja is content with the disposal of the case. When she was attacked she had not only cleared the exam for police constable but also the Railway Protection Force. However, she missed the physical examination as she was admitted to the hospital then. Now, she is preparing for examinations to qualify for a higher rank than a constable. Pooja says women should not give up their career due to fear of boys or society. “Some even stopped going to college due to fear after such incidents happened to others. Women should focus on being self-dependent,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/even-acid-attack-couldnt-stop-this-gritty-girl-from-pursuing-her-dream/article34145920.ece
24 March 2021||KOCHI,||Speaker funded college in Sharjah: Swapna||The registration of a criminal case against unnamed officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has further intensified its face-off with the Left Democratic Front government with the investigation agency now making public a deposition of Swapan Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, regarding the investment of Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan in a college in Sharjah. The statement has been attached to a petition challenging the registration of a criminal case against unnamed ED officials in Kochi for forcing Swapna to make statements against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The statement was given by Swapna before the Deputy Director of Enforcement at the women’s prison at Attakulangara in Thiruvananthapuram on December 15. Request to Sharjah ruler Swapna had reportedly deposed that the Speaker wanted to start a branch of Middle East College in Sharjah and he had requested the ruler of Sharjah to provide land. He also told her that he had made an investment in the college. Swapna had stated that Lafeer, a Non-Resident Indian from Ponnani, district was the owner of the college and that she was introduced to Mr. Lafeer and Kiran, a native of Thiruvananthapuram and Dean of the college, by the Speaker and M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister.  Mr. Sreeramakrishnan, Mr. Sivasankar, Mr. Kiran, and Mr. Lafeer wanted her to relocate to Sharjah and head their business development wing in West Asia. The group was “dedicatedly working for the project,” she reportedly told the ED. Oman visit “As instructed by Mr. Sivasankar, I visited Oman in April 2018 to the premises and to meet Khalid, an Omani national who was also one of the directors of the college in Oman, to discuss the way forward and how to take the process further. At that time Mr. Sivasankar also came to Oman directly from France and he accompanied me during the meeting with Mr. Khalid,” Swapna had stated.  When the ED asked her how did she know that the Speaker had requested the Ruler of Sharjah to provide land for the college in Sharjah, Swapna replied that during the visit of the ruler to Thiruvananthapuram, the Speaker had “requested an opportunity to meet him.” “A meeting was arranged between Mr. Sreeramakrishnan and the ruler at Leela Palace, Kovalam, and during that meeting, the ruler had verbally agreed to provide land for the the college in Sharjah,” she had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/speaker-funded-college-in-sharjah-swapna/article34145876.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Quota percentage should be left to the States, T.N. tells SC||Tamil Nadu told a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the percentage of reservation should be left to the “subjective satisfaction” of individual States. The State urged the five-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan to recognise a State’s complete discretion to identify its socially and educationally backward classes and fix the percentage of reservation for them in State government jobs and educational admissions. Another southern State, Karnataka, also came in support of its right to specify a particular community as ‘socially and educationally backward’ for inclusion in the State List for grant of reservation benefits. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka agreed with Maharashtra that the 50% ceiling limit on reservation introduced in the Indira Sawhney judgment by a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court was not “cast in stone”. Senior advocate Shekhar Naphade and advocate Yogesh Kanna, for Tamil Nadu, contended that the Indira Sawhney judgment required a re-look. The ground situation had changed a lot since that judgment in 1992. Mr. Naphade and Mr. Kanna asked the five-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan to refer to an 11-judge Bench. The Bench, which is examining the Maratha quota law, is also looking into larger questions of law like whether the Constitution (One Hundred Second Amendment) Act of 2018, which introduces the National Commission for Backward Classes, interferes with the authority of State Legislatures to provide benefit to the social and educationally backward communities in their own jurisdiction. The Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act of 2018, which provides 12% to 13% quota benefits for the Maratha community, takes the reservation percentage in the State across the 50% mark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/quota-percentage-should-be-left-to-the-states-tn-tells-sc/article34145887.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||‘No mandi can be better than Parliament’||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Tuesday said the farmers afflicted by the new laws would march to Delhi once again and sell their crops outside the Parliament. “On Republic Day, 3.50 lakh tractors had entered Delhi and we will do this again,” he said. Addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat at Vidyadhar Nagar Stadium here, Mr. Tikait said since the government had told the farmers that they could sell their crops anywhere under the new farm laws, “we will prove it to them by selling our produce outside the State Assemblies, Collectors’ offices and the Parliament.” “No mandi can be better than the Parliament,” Mr. Tikait said in the presence of Swaraj Abhiyan’s Yogendra Yadav and Bhim Army’s Chandrashekhar Azad, while calling upon the farmers to lay siege to Delhi from all directions. He said farmers would observe a day’s bandh on March 26 all over the country to protest against the new laws. The BKU leader said while the government was trying to divide the country on the lines of caste, creed and religion, the farmers would defeat its designs and show unity to get their rights. The rally, organised under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, received support from a large number of organisations, including CPI, CPI(M), Rajasthan Jat Mahasabha, Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad and Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. After the Mahapanchayats in several districts of Rajasthan, this was the first major event of Samyukta Kisan Morcha in the State Capital. Bad weather The sudden rains and strong winds in the city uprooted the tents at the rally and one person was injured. The thin attendance at the rally, attributed to bad weather conditions, left the organisers disappointed. The farmer leaders paid homage to freedom fighter Bhagat Singh on his death anniversary at the stage in the rally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-mandi-can-be-better-than-parliament/article34146492.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi should have a bigger role in peace process: Afghanistan||Afghanistan wants a larger role for India in the peace and reconciliation process, said visiting Foreign Minister Haneef Atmar, adding that he had discussed President Ghani’s new peace plan, the ongoing Intra-Afghan dialogue and “Extended Troika” talks in Moscow last week with the Indian leadership. Mr. Atmar met National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Tuesday, after holding bilateral talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Monday. “India has legitimate interests in the peace and security of Afghanistan and we are seeking a greater role for India,” Mr. Atmar told journalists at the Indian Women’s Press Corps after his official meetings in Delhi. “We are negotiating to make sure that Afghanistan does not become a safe haven for international terrorists who are keen to turn it not just in their battlefield but into a safe haven including, unfortunately, against India as well. So, India has a role not just in Afghanistan but with other regional and international partners,” he said. After his meeting with Mr. Doval, the Afghanistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said Mr. Atmar had discussed the Ghani government peace plan, which is understood to include fresh elections within the year if the Taliban agrees to a ceasefire, and for Mr. Ghani to hand over power to the elected government. The plan runs counter to the U.S. proposal, revealed in a leaked letter from US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, that suggests Afghan-Taliban negotiations for a power sharing arrangement, and for an interim government to take over from President Ghani’s government. “[Mr. Atmar] said the plan would pave the way for a lasting peace based on the will of the Afghan people and strengthen Afghanistan’s role as a bridge for connectivity and cooperation between regional countries and the international community,” an MFA readout of the meeting said, adding that Mr. Doval had said “the unity among Afghans and consensus at regional and international levels were essential factors for achieving sustainable peace”.

24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Foreigners can apply under CAA after rules are notified: Centre||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday told the Lok Sabha that “foreigners” covered under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, “may submit applications for grant of Indian citizenship after appropriate rules are notified by the Central government”. Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said in a written reply in the Lower House that the CAA was notified on December 12, 2019 and came into force from January 10, 2020. “The foreigners covered under this Amendment Act may submit applications for grant of Indian citizenship after appropriate rules are notified by the Central government. The Committees on Subordinate Legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have granted time up to April 9, 2021, and July 9, 2021, respectively to frame these rules,” the reply said. Without the rules being notified, the Act remains ineffective. The CAA is one of the major issues in poll-bound West Bengal and Assam. Union Home Minister Amit Shah had earlier said the CAA rules will be framed after the COVID-19 vaccination drive was concluded. The election manifesto of the BJP in West Bengal said it will be implemented in the first State Cabinet meeting if the party came to power. The CAA provides citizenship on the basis of religion to six undocumented non-Muslim communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India on or before December 31, 2014. Foreigners Tribunal In a separate reply, the Minister said the final National Register of Indian Citizens (NRC) in Assam had not been issued. To a question by Congress member Abdul Khaleque in the Lok Sabha about the number of appeals made to the Foreigners Tribunal [FT] within the stipulated 120 days by those who were excluded from the Final NRC list, the Minister said, “Any person, not satisfied with the outcome of the decisions of claims and objections under paragraph 7 of the Schedule to the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Card) Rules, 2003 may prefer an appeal before the designated Foreigners Tribunal within 120 days from the date of such orders. However, the final National Register of Indian Citizens in Assam has not been issued. Consequently, a certified copy of the rejection order has not been issued to the persons excluded. Hence, the number of appeals made to the Foreigners Tribunal by those excluded from the final NRC list is ‘Nil’ as on date.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/foreigners-can-apply-under-caa-after-rules-are-notified-centre/article34145905.ece
24 March 2021||Patna,||Work progress under Bihar CM’s scheme unsatisfactory: CAG report||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India report tabled in the Bihar Assembly on Tuesday underlined that the work done under Mukhya Mantri Nishchaya Yojna has not been “satisfactory”. The CAG report for the year that ended on March 31, 2018-19, tabled on the State Assembly floor stated that the “progress of works under Mukhya Mantri Nischaya Yojna was not satisfactory as only 15% and 24% was completed in test checked in Gram Panchayats and Municipalities, respectively”. The report also stated “at State-level only 9% to 41% work completed”. The Mukhya Mantri Nishchaya Yojna is considered as CM Nitish Kumar’s ambitious programme. Medical sectors The report also highlighted shortfalls and deficiencies in medical sector in Bihar. “Against construction of 12 medical colleges, including a dental college, taken during 2006-07 to 2016-17, only two colleges became functional till 2018. Construction of only two nursing institutes could be completed till 2018 against 61 planned. The Bihar government did not take effective efforts to increase seats of existing medical colleges,” said the report. It has also underlined “shortage of teaching and non-teaching staffs, significant deficiencies in infrastructure and shortage of medical equipment” in medical colleges in the State. “Only 75% amount was spent under the plan head during 2013-18, which is attributable to poor progress of construction works taken up under different schemes of State government,” it added. The CAG report also said: “Works valued at Rs. 424.67 crore were started without obtaining Technical Sanction in 13 packages and an excess payment of Rs. 3.57 crore was made on road marking work under three packages in the Road division. Also, an excess payment of Rs. 99.05 lakh was made on PM work under Road Division, Molinari and Sitamarhi.”  Excess payment “Irregular sanction of lead by road in place of rail, led to excess payment of Rs. 12.04 crore,” it added. The report further highlighted “additional burden on State Exchequer by action of Bihar Renewable Energy Development Agency to execute agreement with the agency without taking Performance Guarantee and not taking any legal action to recover PG led to additional financial burden of Rs. 5.93 crore on State Exchequer due to re-tendering”. It also underlined “misappropriation of municipal revenue and fraudulent payment” in the department. While making reference of “incomplete projects”, the CAG report said: “A total 68 projects were due for completion during the period 2011-12 to 2018-19. Since the details of all 68 projects with an estimated cost of Rs. 790.99 crore were not furnished by the departments, their revised cost was not exhibited in the Finance Accounts and was thus not ascertainable”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/work-progress-under-bihar-cms-scheme-unsatisfactory/article34146180.ece

The Secretary added that the registration on Co-WIN would begin from April 1 and directed officials to immediately undertake measures for expansion of the vaccination drive. “While ensuring wider dissemination of information for increased uptake of vaccination services, the focus should be on optimal utilisation of the capacity of COVID-l9 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) while minimising the wastage of vaccines,” noted Mr. Bhushan in his letter. Meanwhile, with India currently seeing a surge in COVID cases former national president of the Indian Medical Association Ravi Wankhedkar said there is an urgent need to rework the vaccination strategy and encourage “vaccination on demand” to eligible people, high risk people, frontline workers in all fields and those interacting with large numbers everyday and exposed to risk of infection. “Fortunately India is having more than adequate vaccine production capacity and we should involve the private health sector in a greater way to increase reach of vaccination and decrease vaccine hesitancy. Instead of generalised lockdowns, speedy massive vaccination along with effective disease surveillance should be urgently implemented,” Mr. Wankhedkar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-over-45-to-get-vaccines-from-april-1/article34145881.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Refund penal interest on EMIs, SC tells lenders||“There is no justification shown to restrict the relief of not charging interest on interest with respect to the loans up to Rs. 2 crore only, and that too, restricted to the aforesaid (eight) categories. There is no rationale to restrict such relief,” Justice Shah noted.  But the court refused to entertain complaints from petitioners that the government did not do enough to ease the burden of financial strain during the pandemic.    “By and large, everybody has suffered due to lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. Even the Government suffered due to non-recovery of GST... Merely, since the reliefs announced by the Union of India/RBI may not suit the desires of the borrowers, the reliefs/policy decisions related to COVID-19 cannot be said to be arbitrary or violative of Article 14 of the Constitution,” the court said. The apex court further refused the insistent pleas of the borrowers for a total waiver of interest for EMIs falling within the moratorium period. It also declined to extend the moratorium till December 2020 or, as some of the petitioners sought, another six months from August 31, 2020. The court said a total waiver of interest on loan EMIs would hit the banks and depositors hard. “To grant such a relief of total waiver of interest during the moratorium period would have a far-reaching financial implication in the economy of the country. Banks and lenders have to pay the interest to the depositors. Their liability to pay the interest on the deposits continued even during the moratorium period… Continuing to pay interest to depositors is not only one of the most essential banking activities but it shall be a huge responsibility owed by the banks to crores and crores of small depositors, pensioners, etc, who survive on the interest from their deposits,” Justice Shah reasoned. Besides, the court said numerous welfare funds schemes survive on the interest generated from bank deposits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/refund-penal-interest-on-emis-sc-tells-lenders/article34145883.ece

No separate permission, approval or e-permit will be required,” the Ministry said. MHA said the proportion of RT-PCR tests among the total number of tests to detect COVID-19 should be up to 70%. It said the main focus of the guidelines is to consolidate the substantial gains achieved in containing the spread of COVID-19, which was visible in the sustained decline in the number of active cases, continuously for about five months. “Keeping in view a fresh surge in COVID-19 cases, which is being witnessed in some parts of the country, the guidelines mandate the State/ UT governments to strictly enforce the test-track-treat protocol,” it said. The Ministry directed that the new positive cases detected due to intensive testing should be isolated and quarantined at the earliest. The Ministry said States may also consider administrative actions including imposition of fines to enforce “wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing”. MHA said all activities have been permitted outside containment zones and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been prescribed for various activities which include movement by passenger trains, air travel, metro trains, schools, educational institutions, hotels and restaurants, shopping malls, multiplexes and entertainment parks, yoga centres and gymnasiums, exhibitions, assemblies and congregations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/test-track-and-treat-mha-advises-states/article34145888.ece

On Tuesday, both sides appeared sympathetic to India’s abstention that effectively amounts to support for neither party. However, in an indication that Sri Lanka had construed abstentions as support, Mr. Gunawardena in a tweet thanked the 14 countries, including India, Japan and Nepal, that abstained from voting. ‘Solid support’ He also extending a “warm thank you” for the “solid support” shown by the 11 countries, including China, Pakistan, Russia and Bangladesh, that voted against the resolution, and in support of the Sri Lankan government. On the other hand, welcoming the Council’s adoption of the resolution, the TNA said India must have decided to abstain after “careful consideration” of various factors. “We are, however, greatly encouraged by India’s statement ahead of the vote,” TNA spokesman and Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran said, pointing to India’s reference to “two fundamental considerations” — of supporting the Tamils for equality, justice, dignity and peace, and ensuring the unity, stability and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka resolution was the first to be voted on using the extraordinary e-voting procedures established for the UNHRC 46th Session, which has been held virtually.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-abstains-from-resolution-on-sri-lanka/article34145889.ece

Wearing black scarfs Congress Legislature Party leader Bhatti Vikramarka, MLAs D. Sreedhar Babu, D. Seetakkha, Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy and MLC T. Jeevan Reddy staged a protest the Gun Park in front of the Assembly. Mr. Bhatti said their voice was being suppressed and they wanted to give a letter to the Speaker, Pocharam Srinivas Reddy.  Delayed PRC Later, Mr. Jeevan Reddy said it was strange that the employee unions were celebrating the PRC announcement though it was delayed by two years and the recommendations were not even prospective. Earlier, governments used to give interim relief, which was denied by the TRS government and still the employee union leaders were celebrating. “What is it for?” he asked. Moreover, the arrears benefits that were to be given right now will be given after 10 years and this was of no benefit to the employees. The employees must realise how the government was denying them the benefits that were their right, he said and demanded that the 33 months arrears be given immediately. He also wanted the government to announce unemployment allowance immediately as promised by TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao during the MLC elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-mlas-stage-protest/article34146290.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘No panchayat system in Assam tribal areas’||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that “presently, there is no proposal to implement Panchayat system in Sixth Schedule areas of Assam”. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution protects tribal populations and provides autonomy to the communities through creation of autonomous development councils that can frame laws on land, public health, agriculture and others. As of now, 10 autonomous councils exist in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said the specified tribal areas are the North Cachar Hills, Karbi Anglong and the Bodoland Territorial Area in Assam, Khasi Hills, Jaintiya Hills and Garo Hills in Meghalaya, Tribal Areas in Tripura, Chakma, Mara and Lai districts in Mizoram. Mr. Reddy said, “There is no Panchayat system in Sixth Schedule areas of Assam. Presently, there is no proposal to implement Panchayat system there.” On January 23, 2019, the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had approved amendments to increase the financial and executive powers of the autonomous councils. The Constitution (125th Amendment) Bill, 2019 was subsequently introduced amid din in the Rajya Sabha on February 6, 2019 that provides for elected village municipal councils. The Bill that is still active proposes that The State Election Commissions will hold elections to the autonomous councils, village and municipal councils. The Bill was introduced in the Upper House so that the legislation remains active even as the House was adjourned sine die before the 2019 general elections. The Bill would have lapsed if it was introduced in the Lok Sabha as its life would have been co-terminus with that of the Lower House.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-panchayat-system-in-assam-tribal-areas/article34145900.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Supply side constraints for Covaxin: NITI Aayog||Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin currently constituted only around 8% of the doses administered so far as there were “supply side” constraints, NITI Aayog Member (Health) V.K. Paul said at a seminar on Tuesday. “We’d like them (Bharat Biotech) to increase the output. As per our current estimate, Bharat Biotech is expected to deliver 120 million (12 crore) doses until August and 480 million is expected from Serum Institute. Serum supplies about 60 million doses now and we’d like that to increase to 80 or 100 million,” Dr. Paul said, speaking at an online seminar organised by the Sun Pharma Science Foundation. From July and August more vaccines, including from different companies, were expected, he added. According to the most updated figures available on the government’s CoWin website, about 42 lakh doses of Covaxin had been administered so far, compared to the roughly 4.4 crore Covishield doses. So far about 48.6 crore vaccine doses have been administered with about 2.1 crore doses given to healthcare and frontline workers.  The Hindu reached out to Bharat Biotech for comment but didn’t get a response until the time of going to press. Both Covishield and Covaxin were rolled out under emergency use authorisation but the lack of efficacy data resulted in a significant degree of hesitation. “Now that interim efficacy data is out, there is more confidence in the vaccine,” Dr. Paul added. He, however, denied that this was affecting the overall pace of India’s vaccination programme. “We are able to administer vaccines as per need,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/supply-side-constraints-for-covaxin-niti-aayog-member/article34145912.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,||‘New tools needed to control spread of TB’||Amid concerns over a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts have warned that there is a need for new interventions and tools to control the increasing pace of spread of tuberculosis (TB) and also improve the cure rate of the disease. Ashok Mahasur, senior chest consultant, P.D. Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, said those with lower immunity are prone to develop tuberculosis and TB patients with low immunity may develop COVID-19 and this was inter-related. On the positive side, the use of masks during the pandemic has reduced cases of TB and chronic respiratory diseases. It is a useful tool to prevent spread of TB, he said. The discussions were part of a webinar on ‘Eradicating Tuberculosis-The Clock is Ticking’ on Tuesday, organised as part of The Hindu Wellness Series presented by Macleods. S.K. Katiyar, past president, Indian College of Chest Physicians and Indian Chest Society said there was a rise in new cases of TB every year. He underlined the need for new interventions like vaccines and new drugs would help reduce burden of TB. Nearly 55% of the TB cases emerge due to malnutrition, which also hampers response to drugs, he said. Shilpa Joshi, vice-president, Indian Dietetic Association, elaborated on the need to follow balanced nutritious diet post treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-tools-needed-to-control-spread-of-tb/article34145914.ece

24 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||Daily wage of tea workers increased||The Indian Tea Association has enhanced the daily wage of tea plantation workers in Assam to Rs. 193 with effect from February 22. The decision on an interim hike of Rs. 26 came a day after Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma warned the tea gardens to either add Rs. 50 to the existing Rs. 167 or be prepared to pay Rs. 350 per day. It has come as a relief to the BJP, which was perceived to be under pressure across the tea belt after the Gauhati High Court stayed the State government’s order on February 23 to hike the daily wage by Rs. 50. In a March 22 letter to all member companies with interests in Assam, ITA secretary-general Arijit Raha said the association’s national committee reviewed the High Court’s order on March 16 and decided on the interim hike over the existing level of daily wages with effect from February 22 until the issue is finally decided by the court. The ITA and 17 companies had challenged the government’s order in court. The court told the government not to take any coercive action on the tea companies in pursuance of the impugned order. “The court, however, gave the companies the liberty to pay an interim enhancement as they deem fit. This was taken note of to decide to increase the daily wage by Rs. 26,” an ITA official said. The daily wage of the workers, a decisive force in at least 45 of the 126 Assembly seats, has been a major poll issue. The Congress has promised to increase it to Rs. 365 if it comes to power. The BJP had in its 2016 election vision document promised to increase the daily wage from Rs. 137 to Rs. 351. The Sarbananda Sonowal government made interim enhancements through two orders — first by Rs. 30 to Rs. 167 and then by Rs. 50 to Rs. 217. The tea companies challenged the second order before deciding to take the “middle path”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/daily-wage-of-tea-workers-increased/article34145893.ece

Campaigning for the DMK candidate for Tiruchuli Assembly constituency, Thangam Thennarasu, he said that NEET had claimed the lives of 14 medical aspirants in the State but the DMK president M.K.

24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Will not quash order on examination’||The Madras High Court on Monday refused to quash a government order (G.O.) issued on February 5 for promoting State Board students of Classes 9, 10 and 11 without conducting the written annual examinations due to the threat of COVID-19. The court said just because the order had referred to a speech made by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, it could not be construed that the executive decision was taken without any discussion or deliberation. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, however, pointed out that the G.O. did not preclude individual schools from devising their own methods, such as the conduct of online tests, to assess the aptitude of Class 10 students who had to be accommodated in different streams while admitting them in Class 11. They said the School Education/Department could issue the necessary guidelines on assessing those students. ‘Off the cuff remark’ The orders were passed while disposing of a public interest litigation petition filed by an association of private schools. Senior counsel S. Silambanan, representing the petitioner association, said the decision to cancel the annual examinations for the school students did not appear to have been taken after due deliberations and it appeared to be a decision taken following an off the cuff remark made by the Chief Minister. He wondered why State Board students alone should be exempted from writing examinations when students studying in Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) schools had to take up examinations to graduate to the next class. The senior counsel also pointed out that the Class 10 marks were crucial to assess whether a student would fit into the science or the commerce stream in Class 11.  Just because the order had referred to a speech made by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, it cannot be construed that the executive decision was taken without any discussion||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-not-quash-order-on-exam/article34146537.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘People want better quality of life, not freebies’||A.J. Sherine, 28, of the Naam Tamilar Katchi, will be contesting from the Thousand Lights constituency in the coming Assembly election. A postgraduate in Maths, she is currently pursuing her doctorate. She decided to take the political plunge in 2016 and also contested the 2019 Parliamentary election. Excerpts from an interview:  Why did you decide to get into politics and choose the Naam Tamilar Katchi? I wanted to give back to society in some way. The party’s ideology of Tamil nationalism, its vision to improve the living conditions of the people and its efforts to protect natural resources through its environment wing drew me to it. We have been involved in desilting and restoring waterbodies. In the last Parliamentary election, the party's vote share crossed just 3.5%. Do you think it will change this time? Yes. We are confident that it will improve significantly in this election. The media have not been showcasing our work adequately. What makes you think the people will vote for the NTK? Is the party’s ideology relevant enough to draw a significant share of the vote? First of all, we see that many are fed up and angry with the ruling party, as just in the past year itself, their needs were ignored during the pandemic. Simply offering freebies, like washing machines, won’t help. When the people are living in matchbox-size houses with no water supply, where will they even keep their appliances? The NTK has promised free and quality education and healthcare. We will help the people get better jobs and improve their living conditions instead of giving away things for free. The NTK has allotted 50% seats to women. But internally, are your voices being heard and your opinions valued? Yes. Whenever a meeting is convened, it never happens without the women's wing. We get equal importance, and many of our opinions have translated into decisions. You have two strong competitors — Khushbu of the BJP and N. Ezhilan of the DMK. How do you plan to take them on? I just see them as opponents. Their respective parties are only seeking alliances, but we are fighting alone across the State. I will humbly put forth to the voters what we plan to do and explain how beneficial it would be to them to have a change of government. If elected, I will transform Thousand Lights into a model constituency for the State.  The NTK’s ideology of Tamil nationalism, its vision to improve the living conditions of the people and its efforts to protect natural resources through its environment wing drew me to it||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-want-better-quality-of-life-not-freebies/article34146086.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||University of Madras signs pact to offer online programmes||The Institute of Distance Education of the University of Madras will soon start offering online programmes — for certificate, diploma and degree courses. This is in line with the vision of the soon-to-be implemented National Education Policy. University Vice-Chancellor S. Gowri and Consortium for Educational Communication’s (CEC) director Jagat Bhushan Nadda signed a pact for the same on Monday. The CEC, established in 1993, is an autonomous inter-university centre of the University Grants Commission (UGC). The CEC has been involved in developing online programmes and has over 500 courses in 74 subjects. The consortium is trying to expand its repository by signing up with universities to create more courses. Mr. Gowri, who produced seven online courses as the director of Educational Multimodal Research Centre at Anna University, said the courses had the highest number of registrations. Expansion plans Madras University proposes to initially start with available courses and then expand the course base. “We will ask our subject experts to enrich and equip our IDE,” he said. Online programmes would be interactive with the participation of students and teachers during the class. Mr. Nadda said with the Union government aiming to double the gross enrolment ratio in the country to 50%, online programmes were the best choice. The CEC has prepared content in 74 subjects, over 6,000 videos and 24,000 e-modules. H. Devaraj, former Vice-Chairman of the UGC, cautioned against diluting the quality of the programmes in the name of expansion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/university-of-madras-signs-pact-to-offer-online-programmes/article34146592.ece

24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu schools close hostels, ensure safety norms are in place||Following the announcement that schools will be shut for Classes 9, 10 and 11 in Tamil Nadu, institutions have sent their residential students back home, shut hostels and ensured that COVID-19 safety measures are being followed strictly on the campus by the remaining students and staff members. “Parents began to take the students back home since Sunday morning. For the students in the CBSE stream of Classes 10 and 12, who will be writing the Board examinations in May, the hostels will be kept open and we will ensure that physical distancing is strictly followed both in the hostels and on the school campus,” said C. Satish, director, Paavai group of schools. The focus now would also be on ensuring that students strictly continue to follow the safety measures in place. “We have been constantly insisting on mask-wearing as well as physical distancing among students and will continue to do so,” said the head of a government school in the city. The School Education Department had released detailed standard operating procedures specifying guidelines in January, which schools had to follow when they reopened for senior students, and are expected to continue implementing them on campus. In Chennai, several government, private and State Board school students will begin their first round of revision examinations from March 22. “All schools will get a common question paper and it is a good practice for Class 12 students, who will be taking up the Board examinations this year,” said P. Saravanan, headmaster, Chennai Higher Secondary School, Bunder Garden Street, Perambur. Practical exams for State Board students of Class 12 are scheduled from April 16. The government order (G.O.) for the closure of schools for Classes 9, 10, and 11 has exempted students of Class 10 from other Boards, who have to write their Board examinations this year. “While students from the CBSE in Class 10 have an ongoing school test series ahead of their Boards, Class 12 students are currently in the middle of their practical examinations,” said Vishnucharan Paneerselvam, correspondent, Shree Niketan Group of Schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-schools-close-hostels-make-sure-safety-norms-are-in-place/article34146539.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Panneerselvam open to examining Sasikala’s re-entry into AIADMK||AIADMK coordinator and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who had rebelled against former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s aide V.K. Sasikala in 2017, has now said he had nothing against her at any point in time. In an interview to a TV  channel, he claimed that he had no doubts about Ms.Sasikala on Jayalalithaa’s death but had sought an inquiry only because if she was given a clean chit, it would “erase” her bad name. Also if Ms.Sasikala was willing to re-enter the party, accepting the status quo, he was for considering it. ‘Non-political person’ When asked about Mr. Panneerselvam’s stance, party senior leader and former Finance Minister C. Ponnaiyan, who had backed him during the rebellion, contended that there was no need for any discussion on Ms. Sasikala’s re-entry into politics as she is “now a non-political person”. The Deputy Chief Minister had also recalled that Chief Minister and the party co-coordinator, Edappadi K.Palaniswami had rejected the possibility of her being taken back into the party. “This [Mr.Panneerselvam’s remarks] has meant that she should not aspire for the post of general secretary of the AIADMK. A system is in vogue as per the amended constitution of the party [under which the post has been abolished]. The existing position will continue,” Mr. Ponnaiyan said. Referring to Ms. Sasikala’s statement made earlier this month, the former Minister contended that this had showed that she, who was “nowhere connected to the party,” wished the AIADMK success in the Assembly election. However, G. Palanithurai, veteran academician, said Mr. Panneerselvam’s statement was aimed at “mellowing down the vehemence” of Mr. Palaniswami’s position against Ms.Sasikala’s re-entry. Also, it might serve the purpose of stalling the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam’s general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran from walking away with a huge chunk of votes of the Mukkulathor community in southern districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panneerselvam-open-to-examining-sasikalas-re-entry-into-aiadmk/article34146076.ece

24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court grants bail to C.S. Karnan||The Madras High Court on Tuesday granted conditional bail to its former judge C.S. Karnan, who is in jail since December 2, 2020, in connection with nine criminal cases booked for having reportedly circulated 33 videos on social media abusing sitting as well as former judges, their spouses, lawyers, court staff and others using “vulgar, scandalous, vituperative and obscene” words. Justice V. Bharathidasan granted bail to the former judge in the 10th case registered for having allegedly trespassed into the residence of a former Supreme Court judge in Chennai and threatening her daughter and son-in-law in filthy words. The relief was granted after the petitioner filed two affidavits tendering unconditional apology to all concerned and undertook not to repeat such behaviour in future. He also gave an undertaking that he would not interfere in the investigation in any of the 10 cases and would not attempt to tamper the evidence or influence the witnesses. After recording the undertaking, Justice Bharathidasan made it clear that the bail would stand cancelled if any of the undertakings were violated. He directed the petitioner to refrain from issuing derogatory or abusive statements. It was also made clear that the bail was being granted only considering the health condition of the petitioner, who had tested positive for COVID-19 after he was imprisoned and now required medical attention. The judge also said that the previous bail applications filed by the petitioner in the same cases were dismissed since he had not filed affidavits expressing unconditional apology for his acts earlier. The judge decided to grant the relief after senior counsel G. Rajagopal, representing the petitioner, pointed out that his client was already in prison for more than 110 days. Senior counsel S. Prabakaran, representing the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and Additional Public Prosecutor M. Prabhavathi, however, opposed the plea for bail and contended that he did not deserve any leniency. Ms. Prabhavathi told the court that the former judge had accused police officers investigating the cases against him of having made casteist remarks. He had also lodged a complaint with a metropolitan magistrate, accusing some police officers of having stolen jewels from his house.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-grants-bail-to-former-judge-karnan/article34146089.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Patients with post-COVID-19 neurological conditions treated||Doctors at Kauvery Hospital have treated three patients who developed neurological complications after contracting COVID-19. A release by the hospital said the first case involved an 18-year-old, whose family members tested positive, but she remained asymptomatic. Many weeks later, she developed difficulty in walking, giddiness and sensory changes on the left side of her body. While her symptoms were similar to multiple sclerosis, she was subsequently diagnosed with Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, which refers to inflammation in the brain or spine. A test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies came out positive as well, the release said. Sivarajan Thandeswaran, senior consultant, stroke and neurovascular medicine, at the hospital, said the girl’s condition improved considerably within a week of her admission. Another case was that of a 69-year-old man who had symptoms similar to dementia along with cold and fever. While the diagnosis for dementia returned negative, he tested positive for COVID-19. He was affected by COVID-19 encephalopathy and recovered after five days, Dr. Thandeswaran said. The third case involved a 68-year-old woman, who already had numbness on her feet due to diabetic neuropathy. She had sudden loss of control over the movement of hands and feet. The antibody test for COVID-19 came positive and it was found that the patient had symptoms similar to COVID-19 a few weeks ago. Her neurological condition was diagnosed as Guillian Barre Syndrome and was treated successfully with the initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin, the release said. With more cases of post COVID-19 illnesses getting reported, Aravindan Selvaraj, co-founder and executive director, said the hospital introduced wellness centres early on and was thus able to provide healthcare support for a variety of conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/patients-with-post-covid-19-neurological-conditions-treated/article34146063.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Encourage youngsters to vote for change: Sneha Mohandoss||“Did you not expect me to be a candidate for the upcoming election,” asked Sneha Mohandoss with a laugh, addressing a small group of curious onlookers in Saidapet on Tuesday. The 29-year-old founder of the NGO Foodbank India, who is the Makkal Needhi Maiam’s candidate for the Saidapet constituency, embarked on a door-to-door campaign at Jothiammal Nagar after she gave a short speech from a bright red autorickshaw retrofitted for her political campaign. Accompanying her were a small group of MNM members, all of whom held placards with their party symbol and kept up a steady chant of slogans. A sizeable number of Telugu speaking people in the area meant that Ms. Mohandoss’ party members, fluent in the language, had to help her as she approached residents while canvassing for votes. “Voting for change is something I constantly reiterate every time I speak to a resident in the constituency. I want to remind the people to give newcomers and youngsters like me a chance and emphasise on the need for change,” she said. Interacting with residents there, she informed them about the right to recall process, which MNM has promised, wherein an MLA can be recalled if he/she do not carry out their responsibilities and fail to address concerns in the constituency. When an octogenarian resident of the area stopped to speak to her about drains overflowing there, Ms. Mohandoss encouraged her to vote for change and ensure that their basic concerns are addressed. Voters there, like R. Bagyalakshmi and P. Koteeswari, hoped women candidates would address a host of concerns and bring about meaningful development. “Many of us women here would like to form a self-help group or would also like to be given basic training in tailoring or embroidery. Job creation or helping us earn an income is overlooked by most elected representatives,” Ms. Bagyalakshmi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/encourage-youngsters-to-vote-for-change-sneha-mohandoss/article34146067.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Suspended police officer alleges larger conspiracy behind harassment charge||The Madras High Court on Tuesday refused to take into consideration an impleading petition filed by a suspended special Director-General of Police (DGP) explaining his stand on the sexual harassment charge levelled against him by a woman Superintendent of Police (SP). The court held that the accused would be entitled to defence only before the trial court and not before the High Court, which had decided do nothing more than monitor the probe. ‘Monitoring progress’ Justice N. Anand Venkatesh wrote: “It must be mentioned here that the accused person may not have any locus standi to insist upon this court to take into consideration, during the course of the investigation, his stand in the case. During this period, this court is not deciding on the merits of the case. It is only monitoring the progress made in the investigation. The defence of the accused comes into play only during the course of trial in criminal case.” When advocate Abdul Saleem, representing the suspended special DGP, claimed that the prosecution was attended with mala fides and that there was a larger conspiracy behind the allegations levelled against his client, the judge said: “If this court is to give any finding based on the stand taken by the accused person during the course of investigation, it will directly interfere with the exclusive domain of the investigating officer [IO].” Earlier, special senior counsel A.L. Somayaji, representing the State government, submitted before the court a government order (G.O.) issued on March 18 placing the accused on suspension with immediate effect.  ‘Provide confidence’  After taking the G.O. on file, the judge said the suspension would not only provide confidence to the IO, in the rank of Superintendent of Police, to investigate the case without intimidation, but also reinforce confidence in the minds of general public who had been keenly following the issue. The judge also recorded the submission of Additional Public Prosecutor (APP) M. Mohamed Riyaz that 87 witnesses had been examined so far and their statements recorded in connection with the criminal case booked against the suspended special DGP as well as of the male Superintendent of Police who had reportedly waylaid the victim police officer at a toll plaza when she was on the way to lodge a complaint. He had forced her to talk to the prime accused on the phone. The APP also informed the court that the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) had seized five different sets of CCTV footage and that all of them were being analysed by experts. The suspended special DGP had handed over his mobile phone, too, on March 15 and it had been submitted before the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Villupuram. The IO told the court that he would require six to eight weeks to complete the investigation and file a final report. ‘No compulsion’ Appreciating the IO for having spent a lot of energy and time in the case, the judge said there was no compulsion that the investigation should be completed within eight weeks since a time limit could lead to a hasty investigation. Impressing upon the need to conduct an effective investigation, the judge said the officer could always seek further time, if required, from the court after filing the next status report on April 30.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/larger-conspiracy-behind-charges/article34146082.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Panels to boost vaccination, monitor virus situation||The Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday decided to constitute an expert group to intensify the COVID-19 vaccination drive in the districts and urban centres where the spread of the infection is high. The expert group would undertake a targeted vaccination approach. In a statement, Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan said the government had also decided to constitute a core group, comprising senior officials, to monitor the COVID-19 scenario on a daily basis and submit its report to him. It would also come up with a road map for managing the surge in cases and preventing the spread of the virus. The panel would have senior officials from the Revenue, Health, Local Administration and Police Departments, among others, and officials from the Greater Chennai Corporation and district administrations. The decision to form these panels was taken at a meeting chaired by Mr. Ranjan at the Secretariat and attended by senior officials and public health experts. The Union Health Ministry’s decision to include those above 45 years of age (even without comorbidities) in the vaccination drive from April 1 had facilitated the vaccination of those in this age group, the statement said. “Eateries in commercial complexes and cinema halls should strictly comply with the Standard Operating Procedures issued in this regard. Those managing these [outlets] and the general public should realise that violating the guidelines would only lead to additional restrictions,” it added. Action would be taken against event organisers and managers and owners of indoor venues in case of violation of norms restricting audiences to 50% or not more than 600 people. The organisers have to ensure that those in the audience wear face masks. Encourage vaccination Factories and companies with 100% employees reporting for work should ensure compliance with SOPs issued in this regard. They should encourage their employees to get vaccinated as per norms. The government said it would increase the number of COVID Care Centres in the districts and set up Mobile Sample Collection Centres for undertaking RT-PCR tests. It appealed to the public to strictly comply with the COVID-19 safety guidelines. Ensuring COVID-19-appropriate behaviour, like wearing face masks, washing hands with soap at regular intervals and maintaining physical distance, was part of the solution, it said.

By replacing the present route relay interlocking mechanism with the Kyson system, train movement would be speeded up on the newly-installed third line between Tambaram and Chengalpattu, said an official. In addition to this, the fourth line, which is expected to come up in future, can get connected with the Tambaram yard without any major modifications, leading to the faster operation of trains on all lines, he added. The new electronic interlocking system work involved replacing nine signal points, one track crossing and 1 km length of railway track with 17 new signal points and crossings. As part of the interlocking project, the Railways have installed five integrated power supply provision units at various junctions to ensure round the clock power supply. The Southern Railway has initiated work on the 29 km third line between Tambaram and Chengalpattu, as part of which the third track has been completed from Guduvancheri to Chengalpattu. The Commissioner of Railway Safety, southern circle, Bengaluru, completed the speed trial on March 3. Work on the remaining 11 km portion of the line would be completed by the end of May, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/electronic-interlocking-system-now-at-tambaram-terminal/article34146594.ece

Her daughter, Vanitha, alleged on Twitter that Jayanthi had suffered extreme physical, emotional and mental abuse at the hands of her employer. When she left the home to complain to the police and the Indian Embassy a few months ago, she was returned to the employer. The officials there said it was difficult to send her back during the pandemic. “My mother Jayanthi went to Qatar 15 months ago. From the beginning, she has had problems there. They forced her to work when she was unwell and harassed her about her work. They have also beaten her... We have informed the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Embassy,” Ms. Vanitha said. “Five days ago, my mother decided to go to the [Indian] Embassy to file a complaint.

24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin, Vaiko condemn India’s abstention from vote on Sri Lanka||DMK president M.K. Stalin and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) general secretary Vaiko on Tuesday condemned India’s abstention from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) vote on the resolution on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, terming it a “betrayal” of Sri Lankan Tamils. Mr. Stalin and Mr. Vaiko accused the Indian government of enacting a drama by abstaining from the vote as an Assembly election is scheduled in Tamil Nadu. Otherwise, the Indian government would have voted in favour of Sri Lanka, both of them said in separate statements. “The nine crore Tamils living across the world will never forgive this betrayal of the Sri Lankan Tamils by the Indian government. This is against the Tamil race and is highly condemnable. It also raises the question as to why this Indian government is bowing to the compulsions of the Sri Lankan government,” Mr. Stalin said. Mr. Vaiko accused the government of misleading Indian citizens by not voting on the resolution. In a statement, Mr. Vaiko said it was an “unforgivable betrayal” of the Sri Lankan Tamils. CPI (M) criticises Centre The Communist Party of India (Marxist) also strongly criticised the Narendra Modi government over its decision. In a statement, CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan said, “India should have voted in support of the resolution and against Sri Lanka.” Ideally, India should have moved the resolution against Sri Lanka to protect the Sri Lankan Tamils, he added.  The nine crore Tamils living across the world will never forgive this betrayal of the Sri Lankan Tamils by the Indian government. This is against the Tamil race M.K.

24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Residents protest against Corporation’s COVID-19 Care Centre in Athipet||Following the launch of a COVID-19 Care Centre by the Greater Chennai Corporation in Athipet in Ambattur zone, residents launched a protest against the centre on Tuesday. The residents claimed that the officials of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board had handed over a few vacant blocks on the premises to the Greater Chennai Corporation to develop a COVID-19 Care Centre without consulting them. The residents started the protest at 10 a.m. on Tuesday and tried to meet with the TNHB officials, demanding a refund of the amount paid to purchase the houses last year. ‘Officials not responding’ “We have not received any response from officials. We will continue to protest. The residents are worried about the public health on the premises,” one of the protesters said. Over 50% of the 2,394 houses in the apartment complex were handed over to buyers a few months ago. Many of the buyers, who belong to the low income group, have occupied them after the lockdown. The decision to shift COVID-19 patients to the care centre in ambulances on Monday led to the protests, residents said. The decision to construct houses for low income groups of residents in Athipet was taken by former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa in 2016, residents said. Officials of the Corporation said the COVID-19 Care Centre in Athipet would accommodate 5,000 patients. “All the patients in the care centre are asymptomatic. We are yet to take a decision about shifting the centre to a new premises,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-protest-against-corporations-covid-19-care-centre-in-athipet/article34146065.ece
24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Alliance with BJP is just electoral, says AIADMK||The ruling AIADMK on Tuesday reiterated that it had only struck an “electoral alliance” with the BJP and not an “alliance on policies”. This assumes relevance in light of the BJP including in its manifesto the provision of a 10% quota for the economically weaker sections in the general category, implementation of the National Education Policy “in its entirety” and the formation of a separate board, comprising Hindu scholars and saints, for the administration of Hindu temples [in place of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department]. As for the 10% quota, the AIADMK government does not favour it even though the State has been issuing income certificates to prospective beneficiaries of the quota for education and jobs in Central institutions. On the NEP, the ruling party has been sticking to the two-language formula. On the issue of a new body for running the affairs of temples, the official position, as articulated in a case before the Madras Hight Court six months ago, is that the government, despite being secular in nature, is entitled to administer temples through the HR&CE Department. C. Ponnaiyan, AIADMK organisation secretary and former Minister, said the purpose of his party coming together with the BJP was to “defeat the DMK-led coalition in the Assembly election”. He said the AIADMK had been opposing “certain policies of the BJP, tooth and nail”. “There is no mingling of ideologies. We never compromise on our polices and ideals,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alliance-with-bjp-is-just-electoral-says-aiadmk/article34146040.ece

The message was communicated to all field officers in the State to ensure total compliance. The communication also said there had been a few incidents over the last couple of days where BJP workers with their flags were prevented from entering the streets by members of a certain religion. “This is a disturbing trend and a probable fore-runner for some major conflagration waiting to erupt,” the advisory said. Advising the officers to take steps to nip things in the bud, Director General of Police J.K. ripathy has instructed that all unit officers should hold meetings with the religious heads and ensure that such instances do not recur. The officers should take appropriate action and report compliance. Each district has been given a target of obtaining willingness from 60% of the able bodied ex-servicemen to work during the election. Since 22,000 additional booths are going to be set up for the election, the unit officers have been instructed to expedite the process of obtaining willingness of the ex-servicemen. The COPs, Zonal IGPs and the DIGs have been asked to monitor the process closely on an hourly basis. Sources said about 30,000 ex-servicemen were likely to be mobilised in addition to the personnel from the police department and central paramilitary forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-police-officers-asked-to-be-vigilant-during-election/article34146540.ece

24 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tumour taken out from skull base of child||Doctors of Rainbow Children’s Hospital removed a large tumour from the base of the skull of a four-year-old boy from Oman. According to a press release, the child was brought to the hospital with symptoms of headache, impaired vision, appetite loss and vomiting. After performing tests, the patient was found to have a large “tennis ball-sized” tumour in his skull base, which was compressing the nerves to his eyes. The tumour was a large hypothalamic chiasmatic glioma. A team of doctors decided to do a surgery using a complex skull base approach. In an eight-hour-long surgery, the tumour was completely removed with the preservation of his vision as well as pituitary gland. K. Santosh Mohan Rao, consultant paediatric neurosurgeon at the hospital, said the child underwent a modified one-piece extended transbasal craniotomy level 2 — an approach to reach the midline section of the skull base, a translaminar terminalis approach, which was a technique to remove tumour and fluid, and a total microsurgical procedure for removing the tumour. After four weeks of post-operative care, the boy and his parents travelled back to Oman, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tumour-taken-out-from-skull-base-of-child/article34146597.ece

24 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||A face off between AIADMK and DMK in Coimbatore North||This will be the third Assembly election in the Coimbatore North Assembly constituency after the Election Commission of India carved out the constituency after the 2007 delimitation exercise by including areas that were spread over the then Coimbatore West, Coimbatore East and Perur Assembly constituencies. The constituency is now spread over 19 wards of the Coimbatore Corporation, extending from Marudhamalai foothills in the west to Gandhi Managar in the east and comprising those areas that are north of the NSR Road in Saibaba Colony and Sanganoor Road. Though the constituency is within the municipal limits, it has both urban and peri-urban characteristics, the latter predominant in Vadavalli and Veerakeralam, which became a part of the city only a decade ago. In the last two Assembly election, the AIADMK had won the seat contesting against the DMK. In the 2011 election, former Coimbatore Mayor T. Malaravan defeated M. Veeragopal by 40,098 votes. In the last election, P.R.G. Arunkumar defeated Meena Logu by 7,724 votes. In the ensuing election, the AIADMK will have a direct face-off with DMK as the former has pitted Amman K. Arjunan against DMK’s V.M. Shanmugasundaram. And, incidentally, both the nominees began their public life by being representatives in local bodies. The constituency residents’ major demands included infrastructure development, civic amenities and resolving the long-pending issue of compensation for those who sold their lands for the establishment of Bharathiar University. Mr. Arunkumar, the incumbent, said among his achievements he would like to highlight the State government allotting over Rs. 35 crore for widening the Textool bridge-Surya Hospital stretch of Sathyamangalam Road, an elevator to take devotees from the car parking lot to the Marudhamalai temple, a bus terminus in Vadavalli and commissioning of the Kavundampalayam-Vadavalli drinking water supply augmentation scheme. But very little had been done on the ground, countered K.K Pudur resident M. Ravi. There’s no electric crematorium in and around Saibaba Colony or Sanganoor. Mr. Arunkumar had also failed to have the MGR Wholesale Vegetable Market shifted to a more spacious place, dredge the Sanganoor Canal or build a road along the Canal, connecting Mettupalayam Road to Sathyamangalam Road and areas east thereof. Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon said Vadavalli and Veerakeralam residents wanted Edayarpalayam Road and Thudiyalur Road widened for better connectivity to the northern parts of the city. The next MLA should also focus on improving the amenities at the Marudhamalai foothills and work to have good infrastructure for the weekly market. And, in added areas, he should ensure that the civic amenities were on a par with the city – more water, underground drainage and storm water drainage system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-face-off-between-aiadmk-and-dmk-in-coimbatore-north/article34146120.ece
24 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Tumour removed, woman saved from amputation||Doctors at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) recently removed a giant cell tumour from the thigh bone of a 24-year-old woman from Udhagamandalam and fitted a custom-made megaprosthesis for the resected portions of the knee joint, saving her from amputation. The surgery costing around Rs. 10 lakh, which is performed in the Government sector only in Chennai, was done free of cost under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Insurance Scheme. The woman came to CMCH with complaints of swelling on the right thigh in December 2020 and was diagnosed with a bone tumour. According to doctors, since the size of the tumour was large, preserving the limb was a challenge due to the extent of bone involvement. A below knee amputation is done in most such cases. Based on the advice of Dean A. Nirmala, cancer surgeons and orthopaedic surgeons decided to perform a limb salvaging surgery. A custom-made megaprosthesis was also ordered. The team of doctors from the Department of Surgical Oncology led by its head A. Suresh Venkatachalam, surgeons Balamurugan, Selvaraj and Senthilkumar removed the tumour-affected parts of the knee joint with the support of anaesthesiologists Kalyanasundaram and Poonguzhali. Doctors S. Vetrivelchezian and Mugunthan from the Department of Orthopaedics fitted the custom-made megaprosthesis to create an artificial knee joint. According to Dr. Nirmala, the woman recovered well after the physiotherapy for mobilisation of the leg. “This surgical technique saved the young woman from amputation and she can lead a normal life. All the expenses of the procedure is covered under the insurance scheme,” said Dr. Venkatachalam. This procedure was planned for a few more patients diagnosed with bone tumour, he said.

Rajamani on Tuesday. According to him, 20-odd brick kilns close to the boundary were sealed on February 19 and action will be taken against others in the coming days. On Tuesday, activists, who have been demanding sealing of illegally operating brick kilns, met Mr. Rajamani and complained that a few brick kilns which were sealed on February 19 were still functioning. Mr. Rajamani said that further instructions were given to ensure that they do not function after sealing. The activists in their petition demanded closure of nearly 200 brick kilns and chambers in five village panchayats of the valley. The petition accused a few government officials of not following the order issued by the Madras High Court on February 10 and colluding with the brick makers. It said that only 22 brick kilns were sealed during the joint visit of officials from the Departments of Revenue, Geology and Mining, Forest, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation on February 19. Though owners of the remaining brick kilns were advised to close on their own, failing which sealing will be done by district administration, they are still functional, said the petitioners.  The petitioners also alleged that a lunch was organised for the officials at Mangarai on February 19 which was attended by two office bearers of the Coimbatore Brick Manufacturers’ Association. They alleged that assistant director Geology and Mining S. Ramesh Kumar and Coimbatore north tahsildar T. Mahesh Kumar avoided further sealing by way of getting a common letter from the association in which it assured of closing all brick kilns voluntarily “Not even a single brick kiln of the office bearers of the association has been sealed. Some of them own many brick kilns. They have stocked huge stocks of red earth and brick making is being continued,” alleged S. Ganesh, one of the petitioners.

Earlier, most of these places were used for parking. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) R. Mutharasu said no parking sign boards were placed at places where construction of pillars were under way. Some of these places fall in busy areas of Avinashi Road with shops and establishments situated on the sides. People, who visit such places, are now unable to park vehicles on the sides of the road. On Tuesday, the traffic police imposed fines to persons who parked vehicles in no parking areas on the stretch between Lakshmi Mills Junction and Anna Silai Junction. Some of the motorists who were fined were unaware of the new parking restrictions. Mr. Mutharasu said the police would continue to declare such no parking zones based on the requirement for the construction works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-parking-zones-introduced-on-avinashi-road/article34146112.ece

24 March 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK manifesto is genuine currency: OPS||Accusing the DMK of projecting false promises in its manifesto, Deputy Chief Minister and AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam on Tuesday said his party has fulfilled its promises in the past and will continue to do the same. “Our manifesto is genuine currency. Their [DMK’s] manifesto is counterfeit… As assured, a washing machine and six free LPG cylinders per year will be given [if we come to power] to each family. We [AIADMK] will do what we say. We say only what we do,” he said. Mr. Panneerselvam was campaigning for the AIADMK alliance candidates contesting in Mettupalayam, Avinashi, Kavundampalayam, Coonoor, Gudalur and Udhagamandalam at Mettupalayam. He said the social security schemes of the “Amma government” were made so as to take the tax collected from the people and give it back to them in their own hands. The amount given as assistance under various schemes was increased during the two tenures of the AIADMK government and they would be increased as said in the manifesto, he added. Campaigning for the candidates, including Minister S.P. Velumani, at Malumichampatti near Coimbatore, Mr. Panneerselvam said the AIADMK government had brought industrial investments to the tune of Rs. 6.85 lakh crore from 2011. Terming Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the real “jallikattu hero”, he said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) regime brought development to the country and protected the rights of minorities . “Tamil Nadu got 11 medical college hospitals and an All India Institute of Medical Science in Madurai during the NDA regime,” Mr. Panneerselvam said. He campaigned for candidates contesting from Thondamuthur, Pollachi, Coimbatore north, Coimbatore south, Kinathukadavu, Singanallur, Sulur and Valparai constituencies at Malumichampatti.

A press release from the Association said that price of kraft paper has gone up from Rs. 20,000 a tonne to Rs. 38,000 a tonne and the cost of cardboard production has multiplied.

24 March 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK breached ethics of coalition dharma’||DMDK treasurer Premalatha Vijayakant, in an interview on Tuesday, insists that her party has a presence across Tamil Nadu and cannot be written off from the political landscape. She accuses the AIADMK of breaching coalition dharma during seat-sharing talks. Edited excerpts:  Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had all along maintained that the AIADMK’s alliance, formed during the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, of which the DMDK was a constituent, would continue for the Assembly election. What went wrong during negotiations between the AIADMK and the DMDK? When the question of sharing seats emerged, there was a virtual dilly-dallying on the part of the AIADMK. Despite the two parties holding four rounds of talks on seat-sharing, the AIADMK dragged its feet and did not make any commitment on the number of seats or constituencies that would be earmarked for the DMDK. After several rounds of talks, the AIADMK started with single digits and finally decided to earmark 13 seats, which was not acceptable to the district secretaries of our party. Our deputy general secretary, L.K. Sudhish, also met Mr. Palaniswami. However, there was no change in their stand and they did not agree to change even one number. The DMDK wanted 25 seats, and subsequently, brought it down to 23, and even agreed to settle for 18. However, the AIADMK refused to budge. Captain [Vijayakant] did not agree. The alliance appeared to be inconsistent and it became clear that the AIADMK would only set apart an insignificant number of seats. They did not even mention the name of the constituencies. They took a stand that we should first ink the agreement on seat- sharing and only then the names of the constituencies would be announced. The AIADMK breached the ethics of coalition dharma , which struck at the root of the alliance. The DMDK always wanted to be treated on a par with or better than the PMK in the alliance. Why? This is utterly baseless. We have never compared ourselves with other parties. We know our strengths and have only asked for our rights. There is no need for us to make comparisons. AIADMK leaders have hinted that the DMDK’s vote share has reduced and therefore, it should have agreed to contest in fewer seats. What is your response to this? If the AIADMK is of the view that the allocation of seats must be on the basis of percentage of votes polled, they should also make it clear whether 18% votes secured by the AIADMK in the 2019 Lok Sabha election will be a yardstick, since the alliance drew a blank. It is also wrong on the part of the AIADMK to belittle coalition partners. This was a reason for the failure of the alliance. After the talks broke down, Mr. Sudhish said the AIADMK would lose its deposit in all constituencies. Do you endorse this view? This was only an outburst and it concerns the treatment that was meted out to the DMDK at the last minute during the seat-sharing talks. This should not be exaggerated. I know of an alliance partner in the AIADMK front that made disparaging comments against the Chief Minister. I have proof of 10 videos of such talks by the leader of an alliance partner, and they are now friendly and amiable. Did you find common cause with the AIADMK at any point? There is no common cause. Even during a meeting of our district secretaries, we tried to contact the Chief Minister through his personal assistant to have a final picture of the AIADMK’s stand on allying with the DMDK. But the AIADMK remained stubborn and it made it clear that it would not climb down. The decision to exit the alliance was taken by Captain with a heavy heart. The present leadership of the AIADMK did not have a consummate attitude as was seen on the part of madam [Jayalalithaa]. Had they announced the list of seats sought by us, the seat-sharing deal would have been finalised the same day. You have been with Mr. Vijayakant since the time the DMDK was formed. Why did you delay your political entry all these years? The situation is different now. In the previous election, I, along with Captain, campaigned for the party’s candidates and those of our allies to ensure their victory. I did not have the intention to become an MLA or a Minister. Due to Captain’s health, he has been unable to campaign. He will campaign in the final phase while Mr. Sudhish and my son, Vijay Prabhakaran, will campaign in all segments. From being the third largest party in Tamil Nadu, the DMDK has been reduced to a player with just over 2% vote share. Do you think the party took some wrong decisions, say going with the third front in 2016 when Karunanidhi was waiting for the DMDK? Our vote bank is strong and the DMDK has a strong presence in every nook and corner in the 234 Assembly segments. No force can make inroads into our assured vote bank. Hence, no one should have a wrong opinion that the DMDK’s vote bank has shrunk. This is an incorrect assessment. If there was any decline, it was because we worked out an alliance. When we join an alliance, an assessment is made on vote percentage based on the number of seats earmarked to the party, and not on the party’s vote share in the Assembly segments. While victories and defeats may come and go, the DMDK will remain a formidable force and will reach greater heights.  It is also wrong on the part of the AIADMK to belittle coalition partners. This was a reason for the failure of the alliance||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-breached-the-ethics-of-coalition-dharma/article34146049.ece
24 March 2021||Dindigul,TAMIL NADU||Lacking in development, Dindigul poses a test for Minister||The Dindigul Assembly constituency, from where Forest Minister Dindigul C. Srinivasan is seeking to get re-elected, has returned Congress and CPI(M) candidates several times since it came into being in 1957. Jamal Mohideen of the Congress won the first-ever election here. Only in 1984 did AIADMK’s Premkumar win the seat. The DMK registered its first victory in the constituency in 1996, when Manimaran became its MLA. The constituency is compact and its population has a mix of various castes, including Pillaimar, Vanniyar, Naidu and Sourashtra, besides Muslims and Christians. The constituency has not witnessed any tangible development worth mentioning, say its residents. Places like Kodaikanal, Sirumalai and Palani could have been developed in a big way, they felt. Mr. Srinivasan, who has also served as a Member of Parliament, is a familiar figure. But a section of the electorate felt that he had not done much on the development front. For instance, work on the Balakrishnapuram bridge has been going on for almost seven years. The AIADMK government upgraded the Dindigul Municipality into a Corporation but residents are yet to benefit from the move. Many roads have been dug up and motorists have a harrowing experience navigating them. Dindigul, which connects Madurai and Tiruchi with Tiruppur, was once famous for its lock industry. However, over the years, the sector has gone silent. The city does not have a state-of-the-art bus stand. The promise to set up a park for weavers has not materialised. Similarly, farmers growing onion and garlic do not have any storage facility. There are around 30 to 50 small and medium leather/tannery units. They, too, have not got any support from the government. Even before Gandhi Market could be constructed fully, the AIADMK inaugurated it in a hurried manner. The Minister said the Cauvery water scheme, which had been initiated by the DMK, was completed by the AIADMK. “The ‘Kudimaramathu’ scheme has benefited the district in a big way. The yield of agricultural produce has increased,” he added.  Admitting that ongoing development work may be posing difficulties, he said they would improve the standard of living in the coming years. He said the Balakrishnapuram flyover would be completed by 2021. The DMK has given the seat to its ally, the CPI(M), which has fielded N. Pandi, who is regarded to be accessible. He is confident of emerging the victor. The DMK-CPI(M) and their allies are confident of garnering a majority of the votes in Begumpur, which has a large Muslim population. Similarly, the AIADMK is relying on votes of Pillaimars and Vanniyars. AMMK, NTK and MNM candidates are also in the fray. The battle seems to be largely between the two Dravidian alliances, but other players are confident of springing a surprise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lacking-in-development-dindigul-poses-a-test-for-minister/article34146043.ece
24 March 2021||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||Women voters ask AIADMK candidate to go back||Shouting slogans and asking the sitting MLA and minister Dindigul C Srinivasan to go back, women in many villages including Pallapatti said that they had not got potable water for the last one month. The minister, who is seeking to represent the people of Dindigul in the Assembly, has been campaigning for the last eight days. Even as he reached Pallapatti and began to address the people, some women shouted at him for ignoring their basic needs. Intervening, when Mr Srinivasan asked them to spell out their grievances. The women simply said, ‘Go back... Do not come here asking votes.’ When he repeatedly asked, some among them said that they wanted drinking water. He said that he would immediately check with the authorities and try to solve the issue and left the spot. The minister, who was accorded a rousing reception in urban pockets, said establishment of the Government Medical College and Hospital for Dindigul at a cost of Rs. 325 crore, now under construction, was the biggest achievement. The government led by Edappadi K Palaniswami had implemented basic needs. The medical college here would not only encourage more students to join but also benefit the poorest of the poor to get world class treatment. The minister said that he also considered laying roads in Dindigul as an achievement. Many roads, which were not laid in the last 15 years or so, were given a new look now, Mr Srinivasan said and claimed that the kudimaramathu work had helped conserve water and promised to fulfil other demands, if elected again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/women-voters-ask-aiadmk-candidate-to-go-back/article34146214.ece
24 March 2021||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||PMK candidate demands action against DMK cadre||Alleging that some of the DMK functionaries attacked the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) cadre, the PMK’s Athoor Assembly constituency candidate and party’s state treasurer Thilagabama resorted to a sit-in stir at Veerakal Pirivu on Dindigul-Batlagundu Road here on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters, she said that when they were campaigning in the constituency over the last two days, a section of DMK cadre led by Koothampatti Panchayat vice-president Kangeyan and others objected to certain remarks made by the PMK against the DMK and its candidate I. Periasami. Even as they were engaged in a war of words, the PMK candidate claimed that the DMK men assaulted them. They threatened and abused me in filthy language. Some among the cadre demanded withdrawal of the statements made against Mr. Periasami, the PMK functionaries said. The PMK, during the campaign, appealed to the voters to give their candidate a choice to represent them in the Legislative Assembly as Mr Periasami had done nothing to them in the last 20 years or so as their representative. As the traffic was affected for over 90 minutes, the police and other officials came to the spot and assured to look into the complaint. Meanwhile, the DMK functionaries clarified that they only objected to the charges made against their candidate as baseless. It was exaggeration to say that the candidate was assaulted or abused in filthy language. Further investigation is on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-candidate-demands-action-against-dmk-cadre/article34146219.ece

The civic authorities had intensified checks in all check posts and Kodaikanal too had come under scanner, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-shops-sealed/article34146225.ece
24 March 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Industrial pollution, water shortage are key issues in Perundurai||Acute shortage of water, both for irrigation and farming, pollution by industries and quarries, depletion and contamination of water continue to be a problem in Perundurai Assembly constituency. Due to the discharge of effluents in the open by industries at Sipcot Industrial Estate for many years, farm wells and water bodies in villages located around the industrial estate have been polluted. The problem had worsened to such an extent that villagers formed Perundurai Sipcot Affected People’s Welfare Association, demanding the removal of sludge, rejuvenation of water bodies, monitoring the industries and seeking compensation for farmers who had given their land for establishing the industrial estate 25 years ago. Industrial activities at Sipcot and the Special Economic Zone complex at Perundurai provide thousands of jobs to locals and migrants. The presence of the Government Erode Medical College and Hospital, engineering colleges and polytechnics, and regulated markets keep the town busy. Turmeric, paddy and banana are widely cultivated, but farming activities are dependent on the Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) canal. Since the region is arid, it paves way for more industrial activities than farming. Water is supplied under the Kodiveri Combined Water Supply Scheme (CWSS) and the New Tiruppur Area Development Corporation Limited (NTADCL) scheme to many areas in the constituency. Work is nearing completion for another CWSS to benefit 5.47 lakh people in panchayat union and panchayats in Uthukuli and Kunnathur, after which the drinking water problem is expected to get solved. Though the constituency is expected to benefit from the Athikadavu-Avinashi Ground Water Recharge and Drinking Water Supply Scheme, people want 25 more water bodies to be included under the scheme. Though there is a medical college hospital, people are disappointed that the All India Institute of Medical Sciences was not established at Perundurai. As a compensation, they want the medical college and hospital to be upgraded as a multi-speciality hospital. Uthukuli is famous for its ghee. But, the product is losing its market and the producers want G.I. tag for it. Also, palm jaggery is produced in large quantities in Kunnathur and the workers involved are seeking welfare measures. The constituency has been represented eight times by AIADMK, twice by Congress and four times by other parties. Incumbent Thoppu N.D. Venkatachalam of AIADMK, who was denied a ticket by the party this time, has filed his nomination as an independent. J.K. alias S. Jeyakumar of AIADMK and K.K.C. Balu of Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi fight the election with a promise to solve drinking water and pollution problems. C.K. Nandakumar of Makkal Needhi Maiam is also in the fray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industrial-pollution-water-shortage-are-key-issues-in-perundurai/article34146237.ece

24 March 2021||KARUR,TAMIL NADU||DMK leader M. Chinnasamy set to come back to AIADMK||M. Chinnasamy, former Minister and senior DMK leader in Karur, is all set to rejoin the AIADMK in the presence of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who is scheduled to visit Karur on Wednesday. Though there was speculation over his possible exit from the party on earlier occasions too, Mr. Chinnasamy, a former MP and three-time MLA with the AIADMK, caused a stir by issuing a full page advertisement in a vernacular daily on Tuesday, announcing his decision to quit the DMK and join the AIADMK as he was “unable to bear the insult in the DMK despite being a true worker”. He had joined the DMK a decade ago.  ‘No place for hard work’ Mr. Chinnasamy told The Hindu that he had been working for the development of the DMK for the last 10 years. But his hard work and loyalty had gone unnoticed, he said. There was no place for hard work and hard workers in the DMK, he added. Mr. Chinnasamy said DMK president M.K. Stalin was being “remote-controlled” by a group. The Opposition leader could not act and take decisions independently, and believed everything that his coterie said. It was not good for the party, which was founded on the principles of self-respect, democracy and social justice, he added. Mr. Chinnasamy is the secretary of the farmers’ wing of the DMK. The AIADMK leadership, on the other hand, had shown maturity in all aspects of governance and party affairs, Mr. Chinnasamy said. Mr. Palaniswami had been accessible even to commoners, he added. It is said that Mr. Chinnasamy had sought a DMK ticket to contest from the Aravakurichi Assembly constituency. But the party had fielded R. Ilango, son of former MLA Mojanur Ramasamy, in the constituency, reportedly on the recommendation of V. Senthil Balaji, district organiser of the DMK. A few days ago, Kamaraj, a former MLA of the Krishnarayapuram constituency, quit the DMK and joined the AIADMK in the presence of Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar, in protest against Mr. Senthil Balaji’s style of functioning.  M.K. Stalin is being been remote-controlled by a group.

24 March 2021||Krishnagiri,TAMIL NADU||Human-elephant conflict, a major electoral issue in Thally||The moniker of “Little England” given by the British for Thally’s cold weather round the year and the romanticism of that fancy name is a far cry from the poor socio-economic indicators of the constituency. Thally shares the border with Karnataka along some of the most difficult and inaccessible hilly terrains. And like its neighbouring Hosur constituency, this shared border has reflected in Thally’s electoral history that has shown a consistent gravitation towards the national parties, similar to that of Karnataka. Primarily agrarian with millet cropping pattern, horticulture, and littered with granite quarries, the constituency is overwhelmed by underdevelopment reflected in the low human development indices. High incidence of anaemia in women, child marriages, early and multiple pregnancies, home deliveries and maternal mortality on the one hand; malnutrition, poor universal retention, high school dropout rates, accentuated by seasonal migration of a predominantly tribal population on the other have added to the low human development indices . The block continues to pose challenge to social workers on the human development index front. Some of the most backward blocks such as Kelamangalam and panchayats like Bettamugilalam and Kodagarai are home to scheduled tribe population that migrate to the forests for seasonal employment. Lacks of roads in hilly areas, understaffed primary health centres and inaccessible proximal health care, lack of electricity, unreliable drinking water supply, and poor nutritional support through anganwadis are among the woes of the constituency. The topography contiguous with North Cauvery Wild Life Sanctuary, which is the migratory route of elephants, has spawned human-elephant conflict – one of the main electoral issues for this constituency. Crop depredation by elephants and wild boars, and human causalities are festering issues. The constituency has consistently aligned with the Congress, and since 1996 with the Communist Party of India (CPI), with the exception of 2001, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the seat. In 2016, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) won the constituency to become the first Dravidian party to win the seat, pushing the CPI to the second place. The CPI fighting under the DMK alliance has fielded T. Ramachandran, who is vying for a third term as an MLA, since he first became an MLA in 2006. In 2006, when denied a CPI ticket, he contested against the CPI candidate as an independent and won the seat. In 2011, he contested under the party and won CPI the seat. Mr.Ramachandran’s business interests in granites, real estate and allied activities predate his electoral foray and his affluence is perhaps a misnomer for a cash-strapped party. However, his candidature is overshadowed by an affidavit filled with six murder charges, brief arrest, violations under the mines and minerals act, among others. Yet, the CPI is dependent on his cult image in the area, something that has not gone down well with other progressive outfits. Dravidar Vidudalai Kazhalam leader Kolathur T.S. Mani had flayed the nomination of Mr.Ramachandran by CPI and declared his outfit’s decision to not support the CPI in Thally. Caste factor BJP has fielded a novice, a 35-year-old medical doctor C. Nagesh Kumar, a Gowda by caste, whose uncle was a chairman albeit under the Indian National Congress. The BJP announced its candidate only on March 18, the penultimate day of the closing of nominations, signalling an indecision to face-off the CPI’s Ramachandran, widely seen as a winner. By fielding a Gowda, the BJP has appeared to bank on Gowda votes, a community that constitutes a sizeable population in Thally constituency. With a predominant Kannada speaking electorate, with mix of Lingayats, and Gowdas and a significant tribal population, voting is presumed to be not entirely affected by the caste factor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/human-elephant-conflict-a-major-electoral-issue-in-thally/article34146239.ece
24 March 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK should clarify India’s abstention on UNHRC resolution’||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday called upon the AIADMK to clarify its stand on India’s abstention on the United Nations Human Rights Council(UNHRC) resolution against Sri Lanka for war crimes. Campaigning for the AIMIM candidate contesting in alliance with the AMMK, Mr.Owaisi said in Krishnagiri, “[Prime Minister] Modi led India into abstaining from a vote in the UNHRC. I need to ask the AIADMK government, ‘are you supporting those who killed the Tamils’?” Mr.Owaisi also slammed the AIADMK’s support to the BJP that brought in the Citizenship Amendment Act. “In the name of documentation, they were marking out Muslims and the AIADMK stood by the BJP,” he said. The DMK and the AIADMK had taken turns in supporting the BJP to retain power and neither had the right to speak of secularism, said the AIMIM leader. Mr.Owaisi alleged that the DMK came to the aid of the BJP and helped it retain power. It remained silent, when Gujarat riots happened. ‘No moral authority’ According to Mr.Owaisi, the DMK has no moral authority to talk of secularism, when it had aligned with the Congress that is supporting the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. “Uddhav Thackeray has owned up the demolition of Babri Masjid by the Shiv Sena and the Congress has aligned with that party.” Dismissing naysayers, Mr.Owaisi said, the AMMK-AIMIM alliance will lead a third political force in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-should-clarify-indias-abstention-on-unhrc-resolution/article34146084.ece
24 March 2021||Krishnagiri/Salem,TAMIL NADU||‘EPS govt. more corrupt than 1991-96 regime’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Tuesday claimed that the Edappadi K. Palaniswami government was more corrupt than the 1991-96 AIADMK regime headed by Jayalalithaa. “This was a regime marked by corruption, commission and collection mixed with dictatorial rule that needed to be booted out,” he said. Campaigning in Vepanahalli constituency, Mr. Stalin also targeted AIADMK candidate K.P. Munusamy. “There is a man contesting on behalf of the AIADMK from this constituency. He functions as a minister without being a minister. He is called 30% Munusamy,” he charged. Claiming that Mr. Munusamy’s political life was resurrected only after the death of Jayalalithaa, he alleged, “Mr.Munusamy was booted out as a minister by Jayalalithaa, when she found out his nickname was 30% Munusamy, implying he demanded commissions”. He said Mr Munusamy went on a ‘fast’ in Krishnagiri demanding an inquiry into the ‘mystery’ into the death of Jayalalithaa and “latched on to OPS (O. Paneerselvam)”. He questioned why Mr. Munusamy wanted to contest in the Assembly election when he still had four-and-a-half years of his term as Rajya Sabha MP left. The DMK leader accused him of being a “PMK agent”. Later, while Mr. Stalin was campaigning in Salem, former Tamil Maanila Congress leader and legislator Kovai Thangam joined the DMK. At Kottai Maidan, Mr. Stalin said even if one AIADMK candidate won, he would enter the Assembly only as a BJP representative. He alleged that O.P. Ravindranath, the sole AIADMK Lok Sabha MP belonged to the BJP now. “His letter pad has the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. OPS’s son, who won the elections on behalf of AIADMK, listens to the BJP government and has openly declared Modi as his leader,” he said. Mr. Stalin said the DMK regime had increased reservation for backward classes from 21% to 31%, and for the scheduled caste from 16 % to 18%. Highlighting the various development schemes implemented during the DMK regime in Salem, Mr. Stalin challenged the Chief Minister on whether he would be able to list the development schemes implemented here. He accused the AIADMK government of stalling various development works started during the DMK regime, such as the development of Salem IT park, completion of UGD scheme and development of Salem Government Hospital. Mr. Stalin also said that the IT park would be developed and a perfume manufacturing unit would be set up in Omalur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eps-govt-more-corrupt-than-1991-96-regime/article34146127.ece

Campaigning at Kottai Maidan, he said even if one AIADMK candidate won, he would be entering (the Assembly) only as a BJP representative. He charged that O.P.

He said the Chief Minister had started talking about social justice now. It was the DMK regime which provided reservation for all communities. It was the DMK regime which increased reservation for backward classes from 21% to 31%. Reservation for the SCs was increased from 16% to 18%.

24 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Cylinder sets parties’ campaign trails blazing||Large models of cooking gas cylinders has now become a common sight in Tirupparankundram assembly constituency. For the contestants from All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Communist Party of India (Marxist), cooking gas cylinder has become the main topic during campaigns, but with a contrasting viewpoint. V.V. Rajan Chellappa, AIADMK candidate for Tirupparankundram assembly constituency, has been using a large model of gas cylinder as a campaign tool for the last one week. The model, measuring around 15 feet in height, is used to symbolise the AIADMK'S announcement of providing six free cooking gas cylinders for each family every year as part of their election manifesto. This announcement will be very beneficial for women, especially for those from lower economic families, says Mr. Rajan Chellappa. "Since cooking gas cylinders are an essential commodity, providing six free gas cylinders will eliminate a huge expenditure from each family," he says. A functionary of the AIADMK says that campaigning with large models of cooking gas cylinders easily captures the attention of voters. "Although there are other AIADMK'S announcements like cash assistance of Rs. 1,500 to the woman head of the family having ration cards and free washing machine for all, the free cooking gas cylinder announcement has attracted the voters," he claims. In contrast to this viewpoint, the CPI (M), which is an ally of the DMK, has begun campaigning with large models of cooking gas cylinders to indicate the rising price of gas cylinders. Madurai CPI (M) MP Su. Venkatesan launched this cooking gas cylinder campaign on Tuesday in the presence of members of Students Federation of India and Democratic Youth Federation of India. The model showed that the price of a gas cylinder which was at Rs. 410.50 in March 2014 had risen to Rs. 874 in March 2021. S. Ponnuthai, CPI (M) candidate contesting in Tirupparankundram assembly constituency, says that women are the most affected due to the rise in prices of cooking gas cylinders. "Even though the AIADMK was in power for the last 10 years, no steps were taken to contain the rising price of cylinders," she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cylinder-sets-parties-campaign-trails-blazing/article34146426.ece

Thiagarajan, here on Tuesday. Mr. Thiagarajan convened a meeting with the members of TamilNadu Foodgrains Merchants Association to discuss the problems faced by the merchants. He said that a good government must work to ensure food security in that region. But, AIADMK has failed to perform their duties in the areas of food security and GST. Based on the revenue earned, the government must function keeping in mind the welfare of industries and labourers. But, the AIADMK government has failed to towards the development of Tamil Nadu, he added. The Association members submitted various petitions to the MLA. They said that the appointment of Food Safety Officer has to be done in a transparent manner. The State government must work to reduce the GST imposed on food products. While it requires only Rs. 500 to obtain a license for packaging, the officials are demanding around Rs. 20,000, the merchants complained. Merchants who sell idli batter said that it was unfair to charge a GST of 18% on idli batter. Renowned economist Jeyaranjan also participated in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-will-address-the-issues-of-foodgrains-merchants-says-madurai-central-mla/article34146420.ece

Balakrishnan. Addressing the media persons here on Tuesday, Mr. Balakrishnan claimed that several surveys predict that Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led alliance will win the upcoming assembly elections. The public is criticising the ruling government in the wake of rising prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas. “The AIADMK has announced that they will distribute six cooking gas cylinders in a year free to each family. However, the people are questioning why no step has been taken to reduce the price or distribute free gas cylinders, all the while when the AIADMK was in power,” he asked. Mr. Balakrishnan criticised the BJP’s announcement that the administration of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department temples would be handed to a separate board comprising Hindu scholars and saints. “First of all, how do we identify who are the scholars who can be part of the board? Apart from being places of religious importance, the temples have many sculptures which have a significant historical importance. Can they all be preserved, if administration of temples is to be given to this board?” he asked.  CPI (M) Polit Bureau member G. Ramakrishnan said that CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury had written to the Chief Election Commissioner demanding 100% tally of all EVM machines with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) for the coming assembly elections. "We are demanding that this must be implemented in assembly elections that are scheduled on April 6."||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-and-bjp-distribute-money-to-canvass-voters-cpi-m/article34146228.ece

24 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Advisory to extend interval for second dose of vaccine to be implemented in U.T||The implementation of a Central advisory to extend the interval for injecting the second dose of Covishield vaccines to between six and eight weeks of the first jab will cover a significant proportion of the vaccinated population, health officials said. To date, 47,558 persons have been vaccinated in the Union Territory. This includes 20,732 healthcare personnel, who were the first group to be targeted when the national immunisation programme was rolled out on January 16, 7,614 frontline workers and 19,212 members of the public. An estimated 70% or more of the vaccinated population have received their first shot and are awaiting their second dose. The vaccination programme has completed 47 days for healthcare personnel, 35 days for frontline workers and only 19 days for members of the general public. Health Secretary T. Arun said the Government of India advisory on extending the second dose of Covishield from the current 28 days to between six and eight weeks of the first dose would be implemented in the Union Territory. Automated text alerts from the CoWIN portal on the second dose would indicate a date range for the beneficiary to choose from. Letter from Centre In a letter to the States/Union Territories on Monday, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan cited emerging scientific evidence globally to recommend extending the interval between the two doses of Covishield as advocated by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and subsequently by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) in a recent meeting. The recommendation has been revised to provide the second dose of Covishield between six and eight weeks interval after the first dose, instead of the earlier practice of between four and six weeks. This decision of a revised time interval between the two doses is applicable only to Covishield and not Covaxin. “The spacing out of the second dose is being advocated as studies have shown a vastly improved efficacy of immunity,” S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health, said. Twin track campaign Meanwhile, the Health Department is driving the twin-track campaign for continued adherence to masking, sanitising and social distancing amid another wave of cases and increased adoption of vaccination. On Wednesday, the Directorate of Health Services is organising a mega COVID-19 vaccination camp at the MGMCRI. Meanwhile, the toll in the Union Territory went up to 677 after another a 84-year-old Covid patient died in Karaikal even as 81 new cases were reported on Tuesday. With this, the toll in Karaikal stood 73. The toll by region is Puducherry (549), Yanam (45) and Mahe (10). The new cases, which were confirmed from 1,972 tests, were reported in Puducherry (50), Karaikal (34) and Mahe (three). The test positivity rate was 4.14%, case fatality rate 1.67% and recovery rate 97.14% With 18 patients discharged in the last 24 hours, the active cases in the Union Territory aggregated 480. Of this, 212 were in hospitals and 268 in home isolation. So far, the Health Department has carried out an estimated 6.55 lakh tests, of which over 6.08 lakh returned negative.

Narayanasamy-led government, BJP national youth wing leader and MP Tejasvi Surya said on Tuesday. Addressing a press conference in Puducherry after campaigning for BJP candidates, he said the Congress government had failed to deliver on its electoral promises. “Mr. Narayanasamy is scared to contest from any of the 30 constituencies. His leader Rahul Gandhi could not contest in any of the seats from Uttar Pradesh during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and hence migrated to Kerala [Rahul contested in Amethi in U.P. too]. Unlike his leader, the former Chief Minister cannot migrate to another State,” he said. The non-performance of the Congress government had led to a growth in the unemployment rate. People of the Union Territory want the revival of textile mills, IT parks and more tourism projects so that they could improve their standard of living by getting good jobs, he said. The BJP would bring allround development to the Union Territory, he claimed, adding the region had tremendous scope to progress in tourism and education.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-of-ut-will-reject-congress-dmk-bjp-mp/article34146530.ece

He said that the DMK, under his leadership, would build dwellings for the fishermen. Apart from the COVID-19, the floods and cyclones had ruined their livelihood. The new government would give them sops with which the fishermen could start from the beginning. As the prices of petrol and diesel had touched new high in the BJP government, the DMK government would give substantial subsidy so that the fishermen would be able to sustain their occupation. The AIADMK and the Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had neglected the downtrodden all these years, he said. The AIADMK claimed to have implemented many programmes. ‘Don’t believe them. It is all only on paper.’ He went on to charge that Mr. Palaniswami had given advertisements in the newspapers with public money. He would face the music soon for all his misdeeds, he said. The AIADMK, which was in sleep mode since December 2020, suddenly turned themselves into active mode. Announcement after announcement came on the media. There it ends. After the polls, they would again go back to silent mode, he claimed. According to him, the DMK’s manifesto had been well crafted after the committee interacted with the people and the community across Tamil Nadu. The party’s manifesto would be implemented in full for all the sections. ‘You will experience a new life in Tamil Nadu,’ he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-promises-dwellings-for-fishermen/article34146221.ece

Speaking to reporters, he said that the government led by Edappadi K Palaniswami had failed to even keep up the promise made by their own leader in 2016. She had stated that the old pension scheme would be implemented and promised to do away with liquor in the State in a phased manner. However, Mr Palaniswami, by joining hands with the BJP, had neglected them, he charged and said the people were determined to throw them out through the ballot on April 6. As the D-day was fast approaching, a wave had formed in Tamil Nadu. The secular front led by the DMK would sweep the polls here, he said and added the misrule by the AIADMK for the last 10 years and the anti-people measures of the BJP at Centre would seal their fate. Comparing the farmers’ protest in New Delhi with that of the pre-Independence struggle, Mr Mutharasan said that the agriculture laws amended by the BJP had generated anger among every Indian, except the BJP and the AIADMK. For doing so, the people were waiting to punish them through the ballot on April 6, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/voters-annoyed-with-aiadmk-govt/article34146216.ece

Accompanied by officials from the district administration and the Agriculture Marketing Committee, he went to each outlet at the sandhai and interacted with the people about the significance of exercising their vote. The pamphlets appealed to voters to cast their votes without fear. Accepting money to vote was a criminal offence and punishable under the law, he told them. A few customers answered correctly when the officials asked the date of election. Some even had the polling station in their locality at their fingertips. The district administration, which has targeted cent per cent polling, earlier conducted a number of campaigns involving various stakeholders. For the womenfolk, a rangoli competition was held. Students participated in competitions in which they were asked to write about elections and their importance. Passengers were given stickers at bus stands Police and non-government organisations too joined the initiative. Two days ago, the Collector pasted stickers on LPG refills that were ready for delivery to homes from the premises of agents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/theni-aims-for-100-voting/article34146212.ece

24 March 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Teach a fitting lesson to AIADMK, DMK: PT leader||The voters should teach fitting lesson to the AIADMK and the DMK, which are facing the elections with money power, Puthiya Thamizhagam founder K. Krishnasamy has said. Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, Dr. Krishnasamy, who had electoral alliance with the AIADMK and the DMK in the past, said the people were tired of both the Dravidian parties which were in power since 1967 without bringing in any desirable change in Tamil Nadu. The people, who were getting ready for a ‘change’ in Tamil Nadu, should boycott both the parties if they wanted to see a real change which they were desperately waiting for. The AIADMK and the DMK, which were relying upon the ‘money power’, should be taught a fitting lesson by the people. On its part, the Election Commission should check the use of money power in this election. “Both the parties believe in the ‘money power’ and the Election Commission should check the distribution of cash and gifts to votes by optimally using its power. The PT will also strive hard to check the distribution of cash and gifts for votes,” he said. He said the PT, which would contest the election on its own, had been allotted the ‘Television’ symbol in which the party had two MLAs in 2011 – from Nilakkottai and Ottapidaaram. “When I represented the Ottapidaaram constituency, I’ve done something good to the people… I’ve checked illicit sand mining so that the people will elect me again,” he said. He said there was no use to the people following the change of 7 sub-sects of Scheduled Caste as ‘Devendrakula Velaalar’ without removing them from the list of Scheduled Caste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pt-allotted-television-symbol/article34146124.ece
24 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||It is seamless switchover to online mode now||The State government's latest instruction to higher educational institutions to resume online classes has not come as a complete surprise to teachers and administrators in the wake of the upsurge in COVID-19 cases across Tamil Nadu. The indications to the development were there in the government’s announcement earlier this month ordering closure of schools for students of classes 9 to 11 from March 22, for this instruction, college teachers say. Bharathidasan University, accordingly, has issued instructions to wardens that the hostels be kept open only till month-end, since the government had permitted holding of practical examinations till then. Only Ph.D. scholars will be permitted to stay back to make sure that their research activities are not affected. The standard operating procedure will be strictly be adhered to while allowing the researchers to remain in the hostels, University Registrar Gopinath Ganapathy said. University faculty have taken the stand that research activities that gained momentum over the last few months will be impacted substantially otherwise. While there is no problem in conducting classes online, research activities can happen only in laboratories, a professor pointed out. One section of faculty is of the view that the government, while permitting political gatherings, temple events and other functions, has adopted a different yardstick for educational institutions. Nevertheless, college teachers are not unduly worried about getting back to online mode. The offline classes began in December last and the teachers say they have completed over 70% of the portions. “"The rest of the content can easily be covered through online classes,” a professor of a city college said. When their opinion was sought on resumption of online classes, Vice-Chancellors of universities conveyed to the government that most of the portions have been covered through offline classes since December. Emergence of clusters in colleges and hostels in the region has indeed caused unease among the teachers. One major factor is implementation of the standard operating procedure. For instance, permitting only 50% of students in classrooms has been a tough task for the teachers. Students have heaved a sigh of relief over resumption of online classes, but not all colleges have allowed their faculty to teach from home. Some of the colleges are understood to have instructed their teachers to handle online classes from classrooms, which a majority of faculty say, is not an absolute necessity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-is-seamless-switchover-to-online-mode-now/article34146201.ece

A Lok Pal with teeth would be a deterrent for corruption, Mr. Kamal Haasan said campaigning for his party candidates at Mayiladuthurai and Pudukottai. The people of the State had been cheated for the past 50 years, Mr. Kamal Haasan said and urged the younger generation to be part of a political revolution to usher in a change in governance. Callling upon the people to discard freebies, he said they were being given from the tax money looted by the rulers. The rulers were giving 'thaali' free of cost and getting back the money through TASMAC outlets and pawn shops, he said and wondered whether this was “dharma”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-have-been-cheated/article34146211.ece
24 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Positive response from people: Congress leader||The Secular Progressive Alliance that registered resounding victory in the 2019 Parliamentary poll is all set to repeat similar results in the Assembly elections too as the people of Tamil Nadu are receiving the candidates of the SPA and enthusiastically attending the electioneering by the leaders, Congress secretary Sanjay Dutt said. Addressing the reporters here on Tuesday, Mr. Sanjay Dutt said he, who had travelled widely in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for electioneering, could see positive response from the people. The recent tour by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had touched the hearts of voters of Tamil Nadu at a time when the government elected by them had let them down by being a puppet to the BJP-led Centre. Besides making all-out attempts to smother Tamil language, the Tamils, their culture and tradition, the BJP had made it clear that Hindi, Hinduism and Hindustan were their ultimate goal so that the people believed firmly that the SPA would revive the lost glory of Tamil Nadu. The competitive examinations being conducted by the Union government to fill posts in the departments of the Centre were in Hindi and English. As a result, over 3,000 Tamil youths had lost their chances of taking these examinations. The AIADMK government had not objected to the sinister designs of the BJP and in fact was misleading the Tamils by giving false promises. Coming down heavily on Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the Congress leader said the AIADMK, after supporting the Farmers Act and the CAA in the Parliament, was attempting to hoodwink the people by promising in the manifesto that it would stop these laws in a bid to get votes. He also said the law and order in Tamil Nadu was in shambles with the crime against women and the children was on the rise after Mr. Palaniswami became the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/positive-response-from-people-congress-leader/article34146422.ece

24 March 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||DMK front fields first timer against AIADMK in Avinashi||In the upcoming election, Speaker of Legislative Assembly P. Dhanapal, who has been renominated to contest from the Avinashi (Reserved) Assembly constituency, will face off against founder and president of the Aathi Thamizhar Peravai R. Athiyamaan fielded by the DMK front, who will be contesting elections for the first time. Both the candidates are from the Arunthathiyar community. As per the data from the Election Commission, the candidates from the AIADMK have won in Avinashi in all the four Assembly elections held from 2001. Mr. Dhanapal, who became the first Dalit Assembly Speaker in 2012, won here in the 2016 Assembly elections with a margin of over 30,000 votes. While schemes such as inauguration of the long-pending Athikadavu – Avinashi Ground Water Recharge and Drinking Water Supply Scheme and establishment of a Government Arts and Science College in Avinashi have come to the benefit of the voters, political observers say that the contest might be tougher for the AIADMK this time. CPI(M)’s Avinashi Union Secretary S. Venkatachalam said that while the Avinashi (Reserved) constituency might be regarded as being a stronghold of the AIADMK for the past two decades, the anti-incumbency factor among the voters might play out against Mr. Dhanapal. “He usually visits the constituency only to inaugurate projects or to meet prominent people,” he alleged, further claiming that he was not approachable for the people of his constituency during his term. Civic issues such as re-laying of damaged roads and improvement of facilities at the Avinashi Government Hospital have also not been addressed in the past five years, according to Mr. Venkatachalam. D. Prabu, convener of the Federation for Athikadavu Avinashi Ground Water Recharge Scheme Struggle Committee, alleged of bureaucratic negligence in the planning of the project’s first phase as many water bodies were allegedly left out in Avinashi and in other places where the project works are being carried out. While it was initially expected that the first phase will be completed by March, the officials cited the COVID-19 lockdown for the delay and it is now expected to be completed by December, he said. In August 2020, officials from various departments and the Tiruppur district police rescued over 150 minors who were found to be working in spinning mills near Avinashi. According to C. Nambi, executive director of Avinashi-based Centre for Social Education and Development, there seems to have been an increase in child and adolescent labour after the lockdown. The Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health must step up vigil by inspecting more industries to ensure that minors are not made to work against their will, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-front-fields-first-timer-against-aiadmk-in-avinashi/article34146100.ece

24 March 2021||ULUNDURPETTAI,TAMIL NADU||Voters here want upgrading of hospital, government college||Three-time legislator belonging to AIADMK R. Kumaraguru is trying his luck to see whether he can extend his winning streak to the fourth time in a row. He is pitted against DMK’s A.J. Manikannan from the Ulunderpettai Assembly segment in Kallakurichi district for the 2021 Assembly poll. An AIADMK strongman in the region, Mr. Kumaraguru shifted to Ulundurpettai in 2011 Assembly election after winning his first electoral battle from nearby Thirunavalur constituency in 2006. In the 2011 poll from Ulundurpettai, Mr. Kumaraguru won the seat, contesting against the VCK’s M. Mohammed Yousuf, by a margin of 53,508 votes. He retained the seat in the 2016 poll fighting against DMK’s G.R. Vasanthavel, though his victory margin came down to 4,164 votes. His supporters argue that the dip in margin was largely due to the lone fight by the PMK in the last poll. PMK candidate K. Balu captured 20,233 votes. The constituency is dominated by the Udayar and Vanniyar communities, followed by Dalits. The DMK candidate, Mr. Manikannan, is trying his electoral fortunes once again after he successfully won the election in 1996 from Thirunavalur constituency, which was merged with Thirukovilur and Ulundurpettai in 2011. As for the people, who think Ulundurpettai is the link connecting Chennai with other parts of Tamil Nadu, their long pending demands are still to be addressed by the successive governments. S. Karthik, a resident of Elavansurkottai, said upgradation of the Government Hospital at Ulundurpettai had been a long-pending demand. For any medical emergency, people have to be rushed to the Mundiyampakkam Medical College or to JIPMER in Puducherry. There are also no government colleges for students of the region to pursue higher education, he said. Rising fuel prices His friend, S. Ezhumalai, who operates a mini van, said nobody was bothered about the price of petroleum products. “We can’t pass on the burden of petroleum products to customers who want to transport goods. No political party is talking about the rise in prices of diesel or petrol.” he said. K. Lalith kumar, a resident and activist, said for the last 20 years, people of the region had been demanding the setting up of an advanced trauma care centre at the GH. People also wanted advanced facilities at the hospital to treat cardiac and other critically ill patients. He said the stretches from Thozuthur to Villupuram and Athoor to Villupuram were accident-prone areas. “If any accident happens near our place, the patient has to be taken to Salem, Villupuram or Puducherry. By the time the patient is taken there, precious time will be lost. The government could even think of setting up a medical college. So much land is available on either side of the highway,” he said. He also demanded the stoppage of express trains at Ulundurpettai. Currently, the passenger train running between Madurai and Villupuram stops at the station. More than 20 express trains run through the station. “We have to either travel to Vriddhachalam or Villupuram to board express trains. There are a large number of people from our place working in other parts of the country,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/voters-here-want-upgrading-of-hospital-government-college/article34146532.ece
24 March 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||‘Women not safe in AIADMK rule’||CPI (M) state secretary K Balakrishnan on Tuesday alleged that AIADMK cadre were not willing to work for the victory of BJP candidates in the Assembly elections. Though former AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa had declared that she would not ally with the BJP, its leaders have forged an alliance with the national party. Addressing a public meeting to seek votes for DMK Virudhunagar candidate A.R.R. Seenivasan on Monday, he said that Jayalalithaa had confessed to have made a wrong move in allying with the BJP in the past. She had vowed that the AIADMK would never join hands with the party. “The BJP leaders in Tamil Nadu, who wanted to make a piggyback ride on the AIADMK to win the election, were complaining that the AIADMK cadre were not cooperating with them,” he said. The BJP is trying to sow the seeds of manudharma in Tamil Nadu. It is important to prevent such an attempt, he said. The present election is fought not only for a change of guard but to determine the future of Tamil culture, heritage and language also. The advertisements of the AIADMK claimed that the women were safe in the State. “Will the Chief Minister dare to say this at a public meeting in Pollachi,” he asked. If the AIADMK’s claim that its close relationship with the BJP-led Centre was to get more benefits for Tamil Nadu, how come the Deputy Chief Minister, O. Pannerselvam, said that the Centre has not given Rs. 14,500 crore due for the State, he questioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/women-not-safe-in-aiadmk-rule/article34146223.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Women, unemployed youth will unseat AIADMK government, says Kanimozhi||Blaming the Edappadi K. Palaniswami government for the rise in the unemployment rate, DMK MP M. Kanimozhi on Tuesday said jobless youth and women would unseat the AIADMK regime. Campaigning for party principal secretary K.N. Nehru, who is seeking re-election from Tiruchi (West) constituency, she said unemployment had been rising since the AIADMK government assumed office in 2016. It had failed to win the confidence of entrepreneurs and investors. The poor growth and unfriendly government had ultimately rendered the youth jobless. Moreover, most of the vacant positions in the government had not been filled up for so long in spite of a growing number of educated youth. The opportunity that they were waiting had come and they would vote out the AIADMK government. Claiming that women had no protection in the State, Ms. Kanimozhi said that crime against them was on the rise. The Pollachi sexual assault case was a typical example to prove that several women were sexually assaulted. The AIADMK governmenttried to shield those involved in the crime. The women should use the voting power in the elections to teach a fitting lesson to the AIADMK government, Ms. Kanimozhi said and added that if the DMK was voted back to power, it would set up special courts in all districts to deal with cases of crime against women. The MP said the AIADMK government had failed to keep the promises given to the electorate in the 2016 election. The much-touted scheme of distributing scooters to working women was only on paper. Similarly, the promise of smart phones had not been implemented at all. But, with a view to hoodwinking voters, the AIADMK had come out with new promises. The voters, who were given a raw deal during the last five years of the AIADMK, could not be fooled again. They would totally reject the AIADMK and its alliance candidates, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/women-unemployed-youth-will-unseat-aiadmk-government-says-kanimozhi/article34146205.ece

Ramesh alias Gandhian Ramesh, had filed the PIL petition seeking a direction to the ECI to consider the representations made to it to prohibit Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and all others holding public office from campaigning on behalf of their party’s candidates. The party alleged that these people end up misusing their public office during elections, much to the disadvantage of the other candidates in the fray. Concurring with the sentiments expressed by the petitioner party, the first Division Bench said, “There are also other considerations which come into play in the modern world. There are security concerns. Thus, even though a Minister may be willing to shed his official bandobast to attend a rally merely as a politician, the very status of the Minister and the requirement to give him security cover may not permit the freedom that would be required for the purpose.” “This goes more so with higher officials like Chief Ministers and those holding Cabinet positions at the Centre. To such extent, the petitioner’s idealism may be slightly out of place. However, a strict Election Commission can, nonetheless, put some guidelines in place, in addition to the existing guidelines indicated in the model code, at least to ensure that government funds are not brazenly used for campaigning purposes as is usually being indulged in at present,” the judges added. “The ECI has sufficient authority to put checks and balances in place that allow a Minister or the like to enjoy their status and yet not spend official funds for campaigning or election purposes. However, the malaise is now deep-rooted. One has to wear allegiance to a political leader, if not on the sleeve, at least visibly crying out of the pocket.” Finding some force in the arguments advanced by the petitioner’s counsel, T. Sivagnanasambandan, the judges said, “the ECI shall deal with the petitioner’s representation for future elections, if not for the upcoming election.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prevent-use-of-public-funds/article34146199.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Prevent brazen use of public funds for campaigning, HC||The Madras High Court on Tuesday said the Election Commission of India (ECI) can put guidelines in place to ensure that public funds are not brazenly used by Ministers for campaigning purposes. “as is usually being indulged in at present”. It observed that the ECI had sufficient authority to put in place checks and balances allowing Ministers and the like to enjoy their official status while preventing them from spending government funds for campaigning or election purposes. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said that in an ideal world, there should be a level-playing field so that government functionaries don’t use the perks and benefits of their office while campaigning for elections. “Such standards were met by many a politician once upon a time, but are out of fashion these days,” the judges said, while disposing of a public interest litigation petition. The Ahimsa Socialist Party, represented by its president, T. Ramesh alias Gandhian Ramesh, had filed the PIL petition seeking a direction to the ECI to consider the representations made to it to prohibit Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and all others holding public office from campaigning on behalf of their party’s candidates.

24 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Heart transplant successfully carried out in Belagavi||It was an emotional moment at KLE Society’s Prabhakar Kore Hospital when relatives of a young heart patient thanked the family members of a heart donor for saving their child’s life. This meeting happened after a month of the hospital’s doctors successfully conducted the second heart transplant in the hospital’s history. The relatives of the recipient had tears in their eyes when they thanked the now deceased donor, his relatives and the doctors and staff of the hospital. Society chairman Prabhakar Kore told journalists here on Tuesday that a 17-year-old boy had got a new lease of life with the transplantation of the heart of a brain dead person. He thanked the team of surgeons led by Richard Saldanha for conducting the procedure successfully. The surgery was performed free as the beneficiary was covered under the Arogya Karnataka-Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme of the Union and the State governments, Mr. Kore said. Dr. Saldanha narrated the story of the patient and the donor. The teenaged patient from a low socio-economic background came to the hospital from a village in Belagavi taluk. He was admitted on February 8. Paediatric cardiologist Veeresh Manvi, who saw the patient, diagnosed him with end-stage heart failure (Dilated Cardiomyopathy). This is a rare condition that causes weakness of the heart muscle making it difficult to pump blood properly. The boy had difficulty in breathing and was kept on oxygen support. He could barely walk and had swelling in his legs. The team of consultants lead by Dr. Saldanha, chief of Cardiac Surgery Department, carried out extensive investigations and reached a conclusion that heart transplant was the only option. All the relevant investigations for heart transplant were conducted and he was registered with Jeevasarthakathe, the Organ Transplant Authority of the State government. Doctors found a donor in the same hospital, with the help of senior physician V.A. Kothiwale who was treating a 52-year-old male in the Intensive Care Unit. The patient’s brain had suffered irreversible damage and he was on ventilator. Dr. Kothiwale and the transplant coordinators counselled the relatives of the man and created awareness about organ donation. The parents voluntarily and willingly consented for heart donation. Ambarish Nerlikar, Head of Neuro-Medicine, issued brain death declarations twice in a span of six hours as per protocol. It was confirmed that the patient was brain dead and the heart function was good enough for retrieval and transplantation. Jeevasarthakathe consented for the heart transplantation. The donor heart was retrieved and transplanted to the 17-year-old recipient on February 26. Perfect synchronising was ensured between retrieval and the implantation team. The orthotopic heart transplantation technique was used in heart transplantation, according to Dr. Saldhana. On transplantation and anastomosis of arteries, the heart started beating to a normal rhythm. The post-operative care was jointly managed by a team of cardiac surgeons, anaesthetists, cardiologists, intensive care nurses and physiotherapists. The recipient boy has accepted the heart and all the medical parameters are found to be well within normal limits, Dr. Saldanha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/heart-transplant-successfully-carried-out-in-belagavi/article34146260.ece
24 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Speculation over BJP candidate creates buzz on social media||Speculation over the BJP planning to pick a surprise candidate for the Belagavi Lok Sabha bypolls has led to a flurry of responses from party workers and sympathisers. Several memes were created and circulated on social media about the surprise candidate. There were also comparisons between Suresh Angadi and the likely candidates. It is believed that the surprise candidate is supposed to be under 50 years of age, with a Sangh Parivar family, well-educated, English speaking and from a non-political background. Some speculated that it was Mahantesh Vakkund, an NRI engineer who returned from Germany to set up an NGO in Belagavi. His followers set up social media handles such as Mahant Vakkund for MP. They are drawing parallels between him and young BJP leaders, including Pratap Simha and Tejasvi Surya. He has shared pictures and videos about his social service projects such as distribution of food to flood victims on his web pages. Hailing from Belagavi city, Mr. Vakkund studied in GA High School, completed BE in Hirasugar Institute of Technology and post-graduation in Mechanical Engineering from VTU. He has served as a design engineer in MNCs in Italy and Germany. After he returned to Belagavi a few years ago, he set up an automobile firm. The young Lingayat leader joined the BJP Yuva Morcha some years ago. He was later made the district BJP unit secretary. He has been actively pushing his case. He has made a few trips to New Delhi and met senior leaders, including B.L. Santosh and J.P. Nadda. The other candidate is a senior bureaucrat on the verge of retirement. Hailing from Belagavi district, he has served in senior positions in Bengaluru. He is now posted in New Delhi. The officer belongs to the Kuruba community. BJP and RSS leaders from the district who are considering nominating a non-Lingayat candidate are said to be in touch with his family members in Belagavi. The officer, however, is not said to be interested. Party insiders, however, say nothing has been finalised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/speculation-over-bjp-candidate-creates-buzz-on-social-media/article34146248.ece

24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Locals in leadership role: KDA to conduct survey of corporates||The Kannada Development Authority (KDA) is planning to conduct a study to understand the presence of locals in corporate leadership jobs in the State. Karnataka is a hub of world-class talent, including that of leadership. There is, however, a general impression that ‘A’ category and leadership jobs always go to “imported talent” and locals are only receiving lower category jobs, according to the KDA. “Corporates are given red carpet welcome into the State. Still, in most cases, they hire locals only for ‘C’ and ‘D’ category jobs while leadership roles always go to imported talent,” said T.S. Nagabharana, chairman of the KDA. Mr. Nagabharana said the KDA would launch a study to understand the leadership profile of corporates in the State, eventually to know if locals were receiving their due share in leadership roles. ‘Probable injustice’ Citing a case of “probable injustice” by a corporate firm in Bengaluru to one of its senior executives, who is a Kannadiga/local, Mr. Nagabharana said the affected senior executive had officially reached out to the KDA saying he was “sacked wrongfully” during the pandemic without any valid reason or prior notice because he used to report incidents of indifference to local workers to the management. The complainant used to work in the real estate division of the company in a senior position. “Based on the complaint, we have written to the company asking for its explanation,” he added. During his tenure in the company, the complainant had noticed “a culture that differentiated employees based on regional orientation” and suitable head positions were denied to them in various departments, Mr. Nagabharana said. The complainant, Rajendra V., who used to be a senior project manager in the company from 2017 to 2020 and was later terminated from service, said, “All department heads of this company are from States other than Karnataka, even when eligible candidates are available locally. I had written to the management regarding this discrimination. May be that is why they terminated my service without any reason or notice.” The KDA has sent a copy of its letter to the Labour Commissioner, asking for his intervention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/locals-in-leadership-role-kda-to-conduct-survey-of-corporates/article34146023.ece
24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Four lakh vaccine doses to arrive in State today||Denying reports of a vaccine shortage in the State, Health Minister K. Sudhakar on Tuesday said that Karnataka will receive four lakh doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from the Centre on Wednesday. “The consignment of four lakh Covishield doses will arrive by a special flight on Wednesday. Apart from this, the State will receive another 12.5 lakh doses by next week,” he said reacting to reports on vaccine shortage. “We have discussed this with the Government of India and the Centre has assured us that there will be no shortage of vaccines. The second wave has begun in the State and the number of cases are increasing in several parts. People should be vigilant and follow COVID-19 precautions and avoid functions and public gatherings,” he warned.  Current stock Meanwhile, the State Health Department in an official statement said the State still has 10.74 lakh doses of vaccine. So far, Karnataka received 38.85 lakh doses from the Centre and has safely vaccinated 28,11,974 beneficiaries till 7.30 p.m. on March 23. “The vaccine received from the Centre is being distributed to regional and district vaccine stores from time to time and from district-level stores to all government and private health facilities as per their requirement and consumption. Re-allocation and redistribution of vials is happening as per requirements of health facilities within the district and also among the districts based on their coverage,” the statement said. Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said vaccine usage is being closely monitored at the taluk, district and State levels daily so that there is neither shortage nor unnecessary excess vaccine stocked. Stating that there is no need to panic on shortage, the official said: “The Centre has reaffirmed that vaccines will be sent to all States in regular consignments as per their coverage and vaccine availability.” All eligible persons should continue to register and book appointments for vaccination on www.selfregistration.cowin.gov.in or Arogya Setu and also avail the facility of on the spot registration and vaccination at vaccination centres, the official added. More expected Meanwhile, with the government opening up vaccination for all above the age of 45 (even without comorbidities) from April 1, hospitals are expecting more people to come forward. Although there was vaccine hesitancy during the first phase among the healthcare and frontline workers, this turned into eagerness when senior citizens and those above 45 years with comorbidities were allowed to get vaccinated. COVID-19 experts and doctors had been asserting that age should not be a bar to get vaccinated.  Above 18 years Sudarshan Ballal, chairman, Manipal Hospitals, said the government should soon open up vaccinations for all above the age of 18 years. “We need mass vaccination at the earliest to prevent the disease, to reduce the severity of the illness and more importantly reduce the transmissibility of the disease,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, also said there a need for opening up vaccination for 18 and above once vaccine prodution meets the demand as this group is the most active working group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-lakh-vaccine-doses-to-arrive-in-state-today/article34145993.ece
24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BMCRI PG students stop COVID-19 duty||Demanding that the existing non-COVID-19 beds should not be converted into COVID-19 beds again in the wake of a second wave as it will hit the academic year again, nearly 700 post-graduate students from Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) stopped attending to COVID-19 duties from Monday. In a memorandum to the Chief Secretary and other top BMCRI authorities, members of BMCRI Resident Doctors Association urged that the government should make alternative arrangements for managing COVID-19 patients so that the post-graduates can concentrate exclusively for non-COVID-19 patient care. “This will help the non-COVID-19 patients and as well as the post graduate and under graduate students. This will also ensure the continuity of medical education in a teaching hospital. We also suggest using of non-teaching government hospitals for COVID-19 care and recruitment of non-academic junior residents/duty doctors for managing the same,” according to the contents of the memorandum. Dayanand Sagar, president of Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors (KARD), said the post-graduates of BMCRI are worried they will lose one more year of their academic career if they are made to continue with COVID-19 work. “With no non-COVID-19 work, we are worried we will come out of the institute as incompetent doctors. We are willing to do any amount of non-COVID-19 duties under our respective departments where learning is possible and skills can be enhanced. With every passing day, we are losing valuable time for acquiring clinical skills,” he said. “Since the beginning of March 2020, the post-graduates of BMCRI have dedicated their entire year towards COVID-19 care. This has resulted in a huge loss in our academics and skills for the sake of which we choose to do post-graduation in BMCRI. No other medical college student in Karnataka was hit as badly as us due to COVID-19,” he said. The post-graduate students conducted a walkathon within the institute on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmcri-pg-students-stop-covid-19-duty/article34145999.ece
24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Banks collecting hefty loan pre-closure fee to face action||Private banks operating in the State have been accused of collecting hefty pre-closure fee and other fees from those wishing to close loans. On Tuesday, JD(S) member H.M. Ramesh Gowda raised the issue in the Legislative Council, and said he himself faced the problem that led him to register a case with the police. “I know of another case where the person wanted to close the education loan taken for his daughter’s education. Against the loan of Rs. 9 lakh, he was made to pay a pre-closure fee and other fees of Rs. 93,000,” he said. Elaborating further, Mr. Gowda narrated his experience with the HDFC Bank in Bengaluru. “When we approached the bank to close a loan of about Rs. 5.5. crore taken by my wife, we were asked to pay a pre-closure fee of Rs. 16 lakh and other fees of Rs. 30 lakh, totalling to Rs. 46 lakh. Only after I approached the police against this and a FIR was filed that the banks waived them. How many common persons can do it?” he asked. He further said it was difficult to meet the bank high-ups, and accused the private banks of collecting pre-closure fee of anywhere between 2% and 3%, which was against the guidelines of the RBI. “With most bankers not knowing Kannada, it is difficult to communicate with them,” he added. Responding to Mr. Gowda, House Leader Kota Srinivas Poojary acknowledged that this was a big problem. “The government brought this matter to the notice of the State-Level Bankers’ Committee, which in turn asked the private banks to stop this. The SLBC also informed the regional director of RBI and requested him to take action against such banks,” he said. The RBI has informed the State government that any specific cases brought to its notice will be dealt with, Mr. Poojary said, adding that the State government will also coordinate with RBI to prevent such harassment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/banks-collecting-hefty-loan-pre-closure-fee-to-face-action/article34146014.ece

When the announcement was made, it was seen as a move to placate the Veerashaiva-Linagayats, when the reservation movement was gathering pace and an allocation of Rs. 500 crore was announced. As much as Rs. 100 crore was to be immediately released. On Tuesday, the issue was raised by Congress member P.R. Ramesh during his speech on the Budget, in the presence of Chief Minister B.S.

24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Denying defence assistance to hearing-impaired employees is a human rights violation: HC||Observing that an employee with 98% hearing-impairment cannot be treated like a normal employee that general rules apply to during departmental inquiries, the High Court of Karnataka has set aside a public sector bank’s decision to demote the employee based on the outcome of an inquiry, conducted without allowing him to take the help of a defence assistant. The court termed the bank’s action a ‘human rights violation’ while directing the bank to restore his position prior to his demotion, and pay full retirement benefit with consequent promotions and pay hikes as he had retired from the service during the pendency of his petition before the High Court. Justice M. Nagaprasanna delivered the verdict while allowing a petition, filed by A.K. Siddalingappa, who retired from the post of in-charge manager of stationary pool of SyndicateBank, questioning the 2014 decision of the bank to demote him based on findings of the inquiry. “...any employer is morally and legally bound to treat such employee who has a disability of any kind differently as they are differently-abled persons. This right of such hearing-impaired employees not only flows from various international covenants but is a right recognized even on our constitutional canvas,” the court said, while observing that the bank treated the petitioner like a normal employing denying him the benefit of persons with disabilities though the bank was fully aware that he had a 98% hearing impairment. “...when a normal employee facing a departmental inquiry becomes tongue-tied, the status of the petitioner being disabled to the tune of 98% would, without a shadow of a doubt, become incapacitated even to submit any defence,” the court observed on petitioner’s plight. Referring to a judgement of Kerala High Court, which has brought deafness and dumbness within the purview of mental infirmity, Justice Nagaprasanna said that penalty imposed on petition is unsustainable as he remained defenceless for want of a proper defence assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/denying-defence-assistance-to-hearing-impaired-employees-is-a-human-rights-violation-hc/article34145996.ece

Ashok on Tuesday announced that an inquiry would be conducted and action initiated into the allegations of land grab by Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj and his followers in Mahadevapura village. His response came after Congress member M. Narayanswamy alleged that about seven acres of government land in survey number 199 had been encroached by the Minister, who represents the K.R. Puram Assembly constituency under which the said land comes, and his followers. He also said that the encroachers have built homes on the government land and later sold them. The Revenue Minister said the extent of government land in survey number 199 was seven acres and 18 guntas of which 20 guntas have been earmarked for government school while 2 acres and 28 guntas has been earmarked for Ambedkar Bhavan. “For several years now, 100 homes have been there on two acres. We will identify homes that have been newly built and remove them,” he added. The Congress Chief Whip said: “They have even constructed commercial buildings and rented it out. Though I have given complaint along with appropriate documents more than a year ago, the Tahsildar, assistant commissioner, and DC have not acted on it.” He also said that a complaint has been filed with Lokayukta over the Minister’s involvement in land grab following which a notice has been issued. “However, no action has been taken,” he said. Assuring action, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said officials will be sent for inspection and survey will be conducted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/land-grab-charge-against-minister-will-be-probed-says-ashok/article34146017.ece
24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||What is the profile of posts?||The issue of the profile of posts held by Kannadigas/locals figured in the Legislative Council on Wednesday. Based on the information provided by Medium and Large Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar that as many as 3.69 lakh of the total 4.86 lakh people employed in medium and large industries in Bengaluru Urban were Kannadigas, Congress Chief Whip M. Narayanswamy asked the Minister if the government had any information about the profile of the posts in which locals had been appointed. “Despite farmers and land-losers’ children completing engineering, diploma or ITI courses and being technically qualified, Kannadigas are being considered for lowly paying menial jobs. The industry owners are filling highly paid technical posts with people from their State. Do you have any idea about the posts held by 1.17 lakh non-Kannadigas in the industry?” He said that even in ‘D’ category posts that are reserved completely for locals, industries are bringing people from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Nepal, among other places, and no action had been taken against them. Mr. Shettar said action would be initiated against any industry that violates the employment norms, and that enquiries coming for setting new factories were factoring in the strict norms. “While government is doing random checks, it is also counter-checking the claims of the companies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/what-is-the-profile-of-posts/article34146024.ece

24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Criticism of circular on payment to contractors||A BBMP circular asking contractors to provide an affidavit that they would not seek payment for works done now, for the next two to three years, came under attack in the Legislative Council. Raising the issue, Congress member P.R. Ramesh pointed out that such a circular would lead to poor quality of work and wondered about the legal sanctity of such a circular. The circular stated that an agency or contractor should “abide to submit an undertaking on stamp paper of Rs. 200 for the expenditure to be incurred in execution of the work not be substantially claimed for the payment till the next minimum of two to three years from the date of submission of the part/final bill and completion certificate endorsed by the competent authority.” The circular stated that the COVID-19 pandemic situation was the reason for seeking such an affidavit from contractors. It has asked officials to seek the affidavit before handing over any work order. Mr. Ramesh feared that such a move would affect citizens as contractors, who cannot seek money against bills, would end up delivering shoddy work. “Moreover, it will lead to corruption and instances of double payment,” he pointed out. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who was present in the Council at that time, immediately informed the House that the order had been issued without his knowledge, and that directions will be issued to withdraw it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/criticism-of-circular-on-payment-to-contractors/article34145983.ece
24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Garbage burning near Vrishabhavathi river||Residents of communities around the Vrishabhavathi river valley in Kengeri had a scare on Monday after a mound of garbage was set on fire on the banks of the river. The fire started to spread and came dangerously close to an apartment complex nearly a kilometre away. Fire tenders had to be rushed to the spot to put out the blaze. This was not an isolated incident. Rakesh Kumar, a resident of a nearby gated community, said garbage is routinely set on fire in the private land next to their community on the banks of the river. “As recently as a month ago, garbage was set on fire in a similar manner. We put it out using a water tanker. This time, the shrubs on the bank also caught fire, which then spread rapidly,” said Mr. Kumar. He added that the blaze came dangerously close to an apartment that was more than 700 metres away from where the garbage was set on fire. Senior BBMP officials said they would look into the issue if a complaint is lodged. “We are trying our best to prevent garbage burning in the city. Strict enforcement in the city seems to have pushed miscreants to the outskirts. We will take stringent action against anyone found burning garbage and also against landlords of the plots where this is happening,” a senior official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/garbage-burning-near-vrishabhavathi-river/article34146004.ece

24 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Submit details on night shelters, survey on urban homeless: HC||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State government to submit details of night shelters provided across the State and the result of a survey about urban homeless persons. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the direction during the hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) petition by the People’s Union of Civil Liberties, Karnataka. As the government has not submitted the details of the survey of urban homeless, the Bench observed that failure to provide basic shelter to urban homeless may amount to violation of the right to life guaranteed under the Constitution of India. The Bench noted that the Union government had told the apex court that night shelters were required to be set up in all major cities having a population more than 5 lakh, and the State government had assured the apex court on establishing one shelter per one lakh population. Also, the Bench noted that the State government did not submit the data of night shelters set up in Karnataka and the outcome of the survey of urban homeless. The petitioner had sought direction to the State government to implement the operational guideline of Urban Homeless Shelters issued in 2014 by the Union government while challenging the constitutional validity of some of the provisions of the Karnataka Prohibition of Beggary Act, 1975.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/submit-details-on-night-shelters-survey-on-urban-homeless-hc/article34146021.ece

Members of All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) and All India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) along with students and sportspersons observed the 91st martyrdom day of the revolutionaries at R.N. Shetty Stadium, KCD Ground, Rani Chennamma Stadium at Karnatak University, Jakani Bhavi Circle, Old Bus Station and various schools and colleges in Dharwad. On March 23 in 1931, revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, who fought for India’s freedom, were hanged to death by the British rulers. Addressing small gatherings, the speakers recalled the sacrifice of the revolutionaries and urged youths and children to learn from their lives. They said that there was a need for concerted efforts and sacrifice by youths of the nation to achieve what the revolutionaries had dreamt about before they laid down their lives for the nation. They said that Bhagat Singh had dreamt about a nation where there were no social evils such as hunger, poverty and unemployment. He wanted education, healthcare and social security for all citizens. However, his dream is yet to materialise and to fulfil the dreams of the revolutionaries, there was a need for concerted efforts, they said. AIDSO and AIDYO office-bearers Bhavanishankar Gouda, Hanumesh Huded, Mahanthesh Beelur, Shashikala Meti, Ranajit Dhoopad, Arund Kadagad and others addressed the participants at these programmes and urged the youth to read the writings of Bhagat Singh. Both the organisations will be holding week-long events at schools and colleges, including photography exhibition, film screening, group discussion, sale of books on revolutionaries and pamphlet distribution as part of the 91st martyrdom day. In Hubballi, the revolutionaries were remembered in a programme held at APMC Shramik Bhavan and tributes were paid. CITU State Secretary Mahesh Pattar said that while Bhagat Singh fought against the British, now people had to fight against their own government which was acting like a puppet of the corporate houses. Bhagat Singh had dreamt about an egalitarian society which is yet to materialise and people should come forward to fight against fascist forces, Mr. Pattar said. Amrut Ijari, Gurusiddappa Ambiger and others took part in the programme. ABVP members observed the martyrdom day at PC Jabin College in Hubballi and paid floral tributes.

Ashraf and Co. on Azizuddin Road without masks, Dr. Rajendra directed the Mangaluru City Corporation to impose fine of Rs. 5,000 and warned the owner that his showroom will be closed down if the same violation is repeated. Similar action was taken against an outlet of USA Enterprises on the same road. Asking officials to collect fine from an autoricksshaw driver for not wearing mask on J.M. Road, Dr. Rajendra directed the driver not to allow any passenger without mask to board his vehicle. Udupi Deputy Commissioner G .Jagadeesha too carried out COVID-19 awareness and enforcement exercise in Udupi. In a virtual meeting with officials, Mr. Jagadeesha directed officials to collect hefty fines from those not wearing masks and for violation of social distancing norms. Meanwhile, no testing and screening staff were present at the Talapady check-post in the morning when The Hindu visited the spot. The Health Department, however, said that testing personnel worked in two shifts at the check-post from 8 a.m., while admitting that there was no round-the-clock checking.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/twin-districts-enforce-safety-norms-to-check-covid-19/article34146453.ece
24 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||KNR Constructions bags contract for four-laning 48 km on NH 75||Hyderabad-based KNR Constructions has bagged a Rs. 1,100-crore contract for four-laning 48 km on National Highway 75 between BC Road and Periyashanthi (Dharmasthala Cross) proposed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). In a filing before the BSE (formerly Bombay Stock Exchange) on Monday, the company said, “We herewith intimate to the Exchange that the Company is in receipt of Letter of Acceptance for four-laning of Bangalore-Mangalore section from KM 270+270 (Periya Shanti) to KM 318+755 (Bantwal) including 6-lane flyover at Kalladka town in KM 311-KM 314 on NH-75 on EPC basis in the state of Karnataka, worth Rs. 1100,88,00,000 (Rupees One Thousand One Hundred Crore and Eighty-Eight Lakhs Only) including GST. The said project is to be completed within a period of 24 months from the appointed date.” NHAI initiated the four-laning work on NH 75 in two packages — BC Road to Addahole in Dakshina Kannada and Maranahalli to Hassan in Hassan district — in 2017. While Hassan district’s contractor, Isolux Corson, slowed down the work following financial constraints, Dakshina Kannada’s contractor Larsen and Tuobro foreclosed the contract after NHAI wanted to change the scope of work to include wildlife corridors between Periyashanthi and Addahole. Hassan district’s work is now being continued by sub-contractor Rajkamal Builders with NHAI expecting the project to be completed by March next. The NHAI invited fresh bids under two packages for Dakshina Kannada. KNR Constructions has bagged the contract for the first package. NHAI’s Regional Officer for Karnataka R.K. Suryavanshi told The Hindu tha the regional office was yet to receive details from the headquarters. The contract could be signed in April and NHAI wants the work to start before the onset of monsoon. The contractor would have two years time from the appointed date to complete the project. According to a bulletin from the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, technical bid for the 15-km forest stretch between Periyashanthi and Addahole (second package) in the forest area was opened and under consideration of the NHAI. Mr. Suryavanshi said that the authority has, meanwhile, sought forest clearance from the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/knr-constructions-bags-contract-for-four-laning-48-km-on-nh-75/article34146439.ece

24 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Vulnerable section should take vaccine at the earliest: DHO||While stressing the need for those aged 60 and those aged above 45 with co-morbidities getting vaccinated at the earliest, Dakshina Kannada District Health and Family Welfare Officer Ramachandra Bairy on Tuesday said that people should continue to wear mask and follow social distancing when they are in public places. During a Meet the Press programme at the Press Club here, Dr. Bairy, who is set to retire on March 31, said that vaccination for a vulnerable section and compliance of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour were the two main aspects to break the chain of transmission of the pandemic. One dose of vaccine, he said, will help in building anti-bodies in the vulnerable section and they can receive the booster second dose between six and eight weeks after the first dose. “By receiving the first dose (of vaccine), we can prevent vulnerable sections from going to a critical state following infection,” he said. Vaccination is being done free at 66 primary health centres, 12 urban primary health centres, six community hospitals, four taluk hospitals and the district hospital in the district. There were 35 private hospitals administering the vaccine by collecting a fee of Rs. 250. Vehicle arrangement is being made to bring senior citizens to the nearby health facility for vaccination, he said. Stating that there were no studies so far to say that the virulence of COVID-19 has come down, Dr. Bairy said that it was important for people to continue wearing masks and follow social distancing. Dr. Bairy said that as it was practically difficult to check all motorists coming from Kerala at the Talapady check-post, they were opting for random testing. Educational institutions have been asked to ensure RT-PCR tests for their students coming from Kerala. Travelling Ticket Examiners are facing difficulty in screening passengers on trains coming from Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vulnerable-section-should-take-vaccine-at-the-earliest-dho/article34146450.ece

As nine such positive cases were reported from a locality in Vamapadavu, it was also declared as a containment zone. District COVID-19 Nodal Officer H.

24 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Protest against police over biker’s death||Blaming the traffic police for the death of a motorcyclist, who was run over by a tipper-truck on the Outer Ring Road near Hinkal here on Monday, a group of people on Tuesday staged a demonstration at the Hinkal flyover junction and sought compensation to the deceased biker’s family. The protesters, led by MCC councillor K.V. Sridhar, former Deputy Mayor V. Shailendra and former councillor K.V. Mallesh, raised slogans against the police and the government and later formed a human chain at the junction. The protest disrupted traffic on the busy highway for some time. Demanding the resignation of Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Police Commissioner Chandragupta owning moral responsibility over Monday’s incident, the protesters demanded that the government announce compensation to the family of the deceased. The protesters countered the manner in which the traffic policemen in Mysuru were conducting vehicle checking. They hide behind trees and buildings and catch motorists in the name of document checking and helmetless driving. The riders are stopped even though they were wearing helmets, they claimed.  Arguing that the police can maximise the use of latest technologies, including installing more number of cameras, for booking traffic violations instead of roadside checking causing harm to the motorists, they alleged that the police are harassing the public on the pretext of checking vehicle documents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-against-police-over-bikers-death/article34146473.ece
24 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Daily cases cross 100 mark||The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be peaking in Mysuru after a long gap as 100 positive cases were reported on Tuesday, the highest since the last four months. The second wave of the pandemic, as feared over the last few days, is looming large with the sharp rise in cases, putting the health authorities on alert. Out of 100 cases on Tuesday, 78 are from the contacts of the infected persons while 17 are ILI cases and five SARI. With this, the number of active cases has touched 416 with 85 admitted in designated COVID-19 hospital and 169 in various private hospitals. The number of infected persons in COVID-19 care centres set up by the government and the private hospitals also rose. However, no deaths were reported on Tuesday. Sources in the Health Department told The Hindu that the cases may rise further as testing had been scaled up with nearly 6,000 swab tests being done daily. Nearly half of the cases detected on Tuesday are linked to students of a nursing college here and a school in Bannur town, after testing in schools, colleges and hostels was escalated to contain the upsurge. “More nursing colleges are under the lens since many students from Kerala are pursuing courses there. A Kerala student tested positive soon after her return recently. Though she was asymptomatic, a few other students tested positive after the testing was done based on the contact tracing and also en masse testing,” a senior health official said. Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri has told the airport, railway and KSRTC authorities to keep a tab on passengers from Punjab, Maharashtra, Kerala and Chandigarh which have reported a spike, based on the government directions issued on March 22. “COVID-19 negative report after a test done in the last 72 hours is a must and they must ensure it from the passengers ascertaining to which State they belonged,” she said. The airlines should consider issuing boarding passes to passengers from these States who bring the negative reports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/daily-cases-cross-100-mark/article34146482.ece

24 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Farmers cry foul over land acquisition||Scores of farmers from Kochanahalli on the outskirts of Nanjangud launched an indefinite stir from Tuesday demanding back the farm land acquired from them in lieu of jobs. The issue pertains to land acquisition between 2004 and 2007 when a private entity showed interest in investing and developing a golf course in the area. The local farmers were enticed to sell their land and promised a job for each family apart from assurances of taking up development works in the village. The indefinite stir is backed by Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), Hasiru Sene, Swaraj Abhiyan, DSS and other groups under the banner of Kochanahalli Raitha Horata Samithi. The KRRS said the private entity displayed interest in village development during the early phase of the land acquisition talks. It used to offer a garland and Rs. 5,000 to the immediate family members in case of any death, to build a rapport. Even the local school was developed after which 400 acres of land was acquired from the farmers of the area at the rate of Rs. 1.25 lakh per acre. Over 200 farmer families of the region were lured into selling their land for a pittance on the promise of a “permanent job’’. The private firm also conducted a programme to distribute job “offer letters’’ in which even the government officials took part, according to KRRS and Hasiru Sene. But the land was registered in the name of a third party, making it a benami transaction, and it was explained away as due to “technical reasons’’. But neither the promised jobs materialised nor did the golf course take shape and the farmers – the original land owners of the plot – ended up as daily wagers clearing what was once their own land. The farmers formed a union and approached the labour court to demand their share of regular wages. But the firm closed shop even before taking up the project, leaving the farmers in the lurch. Since the last few years the farmers are tilling the land though it is not in their names anymore and hence are deprived of any institutional loans or government benefits. The farmers are now disconcerted that the same swathe of land is being acquired by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board at the rate of Rs. 47.5 lakh per acre and is pressuring the farmers to vacate the land, according to the Samithi leading the protest. It said the KIADB has already acquired 180 acres of land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-cry-foul-over-land-acquisition/article34146477.ece

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Labourers fear prospect of another lockdown||Rajesh Kumar, a carpenter hailing from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh was one among the scores of migrant labourers who made the arduous journey from Bengaluru to his home on foot, after the lockdown last year, vowing to never return. Exactly a year after the Union government imposed the 21-day lockdown, he is back, this time in Mumbai amidst a second wave raising fears of another lockdown. “The lockdown days in Bengaluru were tough. Even getting two meals a day had become difficult. I vowed never to return to a city again, but agriculture in the village doesn’t sustain the family,” he said. “I came to Mumbai four months ago. But with the number of cases rising, there is talk of a lockdown. Just the thought of another lockdown sends shivers down my spine. I plan to return to my village this week,” he told The Hindu over the phone on Tuesday. Migrant labourers who suffered during lockdown and fled Bengaluru last year have returned to the city, but fear that a second wave will see them get trapped in another lockdown. Mohammed Haroon, a painter from Bihar, returned to Bengaluru barely a fortnight ago. “There is no work in the village. The summer months are going to be even worse. So I came back,” he said. He, too, is worried about the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the city and the prospect of the government imposing restrictions that will affect his livelihood. “One of my relatives went to Rajasthan for work and found that night curfews had been imposed. I don’t want to be stuck in another lockdown,” he said. Firoz Ahmed, a barber from Uttar Pradesh working at a shop on Tannery Road, had left the city on one of the trains organised by the government last May. He returned four months later. He is more optimistic. “Though the number of cases is rising, going by media reports, neither the State nor the Union government seems to be willing to impose a lockdown. I don’t think there is anything to fear,” he said, adding that though lockdown was tough in the city, he was also a recipient of kindness from strangers who provided food. Jadhab Burman, a carpenter from Siliguri in poll-bound West Bengal, said he returned to Bengaluru a month ago as ‘elections are not a good time to stay in the village’. “In a hotly contested election like this, even if one wants to keep out of the scuffles, you are dragged into it if you are in the village, and their consequences last for years. So I returned to Bengaluru. Besides, there was no work back home,” he said.

We are now awaiting regulatory approvals to commence operations,” said a spokesperson for BIAL. A BIAL source added that inspections by the DGCA have been completed. The north runway, which had been operational for over 12 years, was closed for strengthening, resurfacing and installation of centre line lights. “Two operational runways will give KIA a capacity boost in terms of frequency of landing and take-off, resulting in seamless operations,” the spokesperson added. The runways will be used for both international as well as domestic flights. The new south runway, which is 4,000 metres long and 45 metres wide and is powered with LED lighting, is part of the KIA’s ongoing expansion project, which is estimated to cost Rs. 13,000 crore. Since becoming operational, the new south runway has been upgraded to CAT-III B to enable flight operations during poor visibility conditions. The north runway is CAT I compliant. “It will be upgraded with the installation of LED centre line lighting, runway edge lights and taxiway centreline lighting, giving BLR airport the flexibility to operate both runways in low visibility conditions,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kias-refurbished-north-runway-set-to-reopen/article34146007.ece

Police gave the names of the arrested as Venkatesh, Vinay, Madhu, Dandappa, Raghu, Swami, Arun, Somashekar, Akshay, Srikanth, Vasanthkumar, Mariswamy and Mohan. The accused are aged between 25 and 35. The tipper-truck driver, Dhananjaya, has also been arrested while the truck owner Bharat and a few others are absconding. Meanwhile, the police on Monday night released a video where a person, named Suresh, claiming to be a friend of the deceased and who was riding pillion on the motorcycle, explaining about the incident. In the video, the person says there is no connection between the incident and the traffic police conducting vehicle checking. “Both of us were wearing helmet, and Devaraj had all documents with him. A few metres before the place where the police were conducting checking, a tipper-truck hit the bike from behind and I was rendered unconscious. When I gained my consciousness, I asked for Devaraj and I was told about the incident,” he said, giving a clean chit to the traffic police who were blamed for the incident. Through this video, the police countered the accusations against them and argued that the mob linked the accident with the police conducting checking which was untrue. The two policemen who were attacked by the mob were being treated in a hospital. Mr Gowda said the jurisdictional police are further investigating the incident. Also, the police have also clarified that the police vehicle that was damaged in the violence had insurance and the social media post alleging that the insurance for the vehicle had been expired was false. Mr. Gowda said the PCR vehicle KA-55 G-0430, a Maruti Ertiga LDI model, has been insured till the midnight of December 19, 2021 and it is insured in the name of Commissioner of Police, Mysuru. The insurance cover has been given by the Karnataka Government Insurance Department (KGID), Motor branch, Bengaluru, he further said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/13-held-for-attack-on-police/article34146000.ece

He was responding to reporters’ queries on the offer of political protection extended to him by JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy. Mr. Sait, however, said said he had written a letter to the party leadership again to specify the charges against him. For, he should know what wrong he had committed. “If going with the JD(S) during mayoral polls was wrong, the alliance has continued even during the elections to the members of the Standing Panels of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC)”, said Mr. Sait, who represents Narasimharaja Assembly segment in Mysuru. He said the alliance with the JD(S) was not new as the two parties were partners in the MCC for the last three years. “What was my fault?. Was it wrong to accept the Deputy Mayor post ? The confusion reigning in the party is not good”, he said. No communication Though he had replied to the notice served to him, there is no further communication from the party leadership, he said adding that a delay by the party to clearly specify the charges against him will affect the party. He said the party had issued notices to eight Congress workers in Mysuru for their alleged involvement in anti-party protest out of whom seven had replied. Three of them had been suspended. Following this, about 140 party leaders had resigned from their posts as presidents of different wards and booth committees. “I have told the party workers that everything will be fine. Let us abide by the party leadership’s decision. We have built the party. Let us weather the small disturbances and rebuild the party again”, he said. He said he is at a loss to understand what is happening in the party. He said his leaders had asked him to keep silent and he is abiding by it. Support Asked if efforts are being made to isolate and target him in the constituency, Mr. Sait said the voters of the constituency have supported him and he has trust in the people of the constituency.

However, in the absence of an elected council, it is likely to be presented by BBMP Administrator Gaurav Gupta. He said that the budget had been prepared and was ready to be presented. Senior officials claimed that the budget outlay was likely to be around Rs. 8,000 crore. This is over Rs. 3,500 crore less than the outlay of the 2020-21 budget, presented by the BJP-ruled council in April 2020. The outlay of the previous budgets presented by the Congress-Janata Dal (S) combine and BJP during the past five fiscals had ranged between Rs. 9,300 crore and Rs. 11,700 crore. The last budget that was presented by a government-appointed administrator was in 2015-16, by former Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar. He had presented a budget with an outlay of Rs. 5,411.25 crore. Former Opposition Leader Abdul Wajid attributed the huge outlays to various welfare schemes and projects approved by the elected council. “That is not the case when the budget is prepared by the administrator, which will mainly have fund allocation for ongoing works and administrative expenses, as in the case of the 2015-16 budget,” he said. Inputs from citizens Meanwhile, late last year, several citizens gave their inputs for the BBMP budget, as part of Janaagraha’s ‘My City My Budget’ campaign. The campaign garnered over 9,700 inputs from citizens on footpaths and toilets. Sapna Karim from Janaagraha told The Hindu that based on the inputs, costing for both toilets and footpath repair and improvements was taken up by the BBMP following verification by civic officials and marshals. The survey revealed a requirement for 236 public toilets as well as the need for repairs and improvements to footpaths in over 5,000 locations. “Our eyes will be on the allocation for footpaths and toilets. If it is attributed to inputs from ‘My City My Budget’, it will be for the first time that citizens’ inputs have been incorporated in the city’s budget,” said Ms. Karim.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-budget-to-be-presented-on-friday/article34145985.ece

It’s mandatory. Those entering the district through the checkpost must carry the report,” he said, adding that the Wayanad DC had been requested to spread awareness about Karnataka’s guidelines for compliance. Clarifying that the district border with Kerala and Tamil Nadu will not be closed, Mr. Ravi said any such move will cause disruption to the movement of essentials from both ends. Therefore, everybody has to take precautions and get the COVID-19 test done for free movement. The people of Chamarajanagar visiting Wayanad can get their tests done in the district and carry the report with them. “A lot of people, including farmers and traders, visit Kerala and Tamil Nadu from Chamarajanagar.

Shivaram Karanth Layout, are planning to hold a protest on Wednesday demanding that the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA) drop the project. Farmers’ leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, who recently caught the ire of the three-member apex court appointed committee in connection with the layout, will lead the protest outside the BDA head office. On Tuesday, BDA issued a statement claiming its hands were tied as the apex court had ordered formation of the layout. It sought to inform farmers that the protest against the layout would be against the order of the Supreme Court. The BDA appealed to farmers to instead cooperate with the formation of the layout, and accept an appropriate compensation package. Mr. Chandrashekhar responded saying that they [farmers] at no point had opposed the apex court and their protest was against the BDA. “It was the BDA that approached the apex court appealing against a High Court order that had effectively quashed the layout formation. Large-scale de-notifications by successive chief ministers and irregularities by BDA have been swept under the carpet. The BDA has misled the apex court. The incumbent BDA chairman had written to the Chief Minister earlier asking for the layout project to be dropped,” said Mr. Chandrashekhar. Criticising the layout, he said, “It is not a good development that attempts are being made to gag the farmers and quell protests in the name of the apex court,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-plan-protest-against-shivaram-karanth-layout/article34145989.ece

24 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Two women fight for a ‘no man’s land’||The Kayamkulam Assembly constituency could not be dubbed as a stronghold of any particular political front. It has sided with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF), where victory margins were often narrow. That said, the constituency tilted Left in the previous three elections (2006, 2011 and 2016). In the 2016 polls, U. Prathibha of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI (M)] defeated her nearest rival M. Liju of the Congress by a margin of 11,857 votes. This time an intense contest is in the offing between two women candidates. The CPI(M) has fielded Ms. Prathibha again, while the Congress has given ticket to Youth Congress leader Aritha Babu. Giving them a strong challenge will be National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) candidate Pradeep Lal of the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS). The LDF, which is hoping to retain the seat, is banking on the development and welfare initiatives in the past five years. Along with other factors, the UDF largely pins hopes on the candidature of Ms. Babu, 27, the youngest candidate of the Congress party in the State, to wrest the seat from the LDF. Previously she was elected to the Alappuzha district panchayat from the Krishnapuram ward at the age of 21 in the 2015 local body polls. Since the 1957 Assembly polls, it is the first-time that women candidates of two leading parties are fighting it out in the constituency. NDA role Although it is expected to be a fight between the LDF and the UDF, the growing presence of the NDA is likely to influence the result. In the 2011 polls, the BJP candidate, who finished a distant third, had secured a paltry 3,083 votes. However, five years later, BDJS candidate Shaji M. Panicker garnered 20,000 votes in the constituency. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the NDA further increased its vote share by polling 31,660 votes in the Assembly segment. In the 2020 local body polls, the LDF had an upper hand in the constituency where merchants, farmers and fishermen have a significant presence. The LDF won the Kayamkulam municipality along with four of the six grama panchayats which form part of the constituency. The results of the 2019 general election and 2020 local body polls favoured the LDF. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the LDF candidate had polled 4,297 votes more than the UDF in the Kayamkulam segment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fight-for-a-no-mans-land/article34146410.ece

He was speaking at an LDF election rally at the Raja’s School ground at Neeleswaram in Kasaragod on Tuesday. Mr. Yechury said the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was trying to destroy secularism and democracy in the country. However, during the past five years, the Left government in the State had shown the world how to combat it with humanitarian alternatives. The government had not slowed down the welfare of the people and development even during the time of the floods and the COVID-19 epidemic, he observed. Of the 600 promises made in the manifesto five years ago, 580 had been implemented. It was a record as compared with other States, he said. In contrast, farmers in Delhi had been on strike for months in protest against the Central government’s anti-farmer policies. More than 300 farmers had died on the streets, he said. But, the Centre had not listened to the farmers nor addressed their concerns. The Modi government was selling the assets of the country. These included banks, PSUs, insurance, Railways and airlines. It sought to overthrow the Constitution and use Governors to usurp the rights of States. It was also using agencies such as the CBI and the ED to put the States into crises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/modi-govt-eroding-political-morals-says-yechury/article34146308.ece

Mr. Chennithala, who was campaigning in Kasaragod for the Assembly elections, told mediapersons on Tuesday that over four lakh multiple/‘bogus voters’ were included on the voters’ list by officials owing allegiance to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He demanded that the names of those falsely included on the list be deleted so that only genuine voters could exercise their franchise. Mr. Chennithala said the Election Commission had now taken action against officials who allegedly added five people to a booth in a constituency. Officials who had added voters in this manner must be identified and disciplinary action should be taken against them. Fraudulent voting He said booth agents were not ready to sit in many booths in Kasaragod and Kannur for fear of violence by the CPI(M). Fraudulent voting was rampant there. Bogus voters were deliberately included to subvert the will of the people, he alleged. The Leader of the Opposition said a complaint had been earlier lodged alleging that fake voters were created by repeating the photo and information of the same person. Now, it had been found that fake voters were created under other names and addresses using a photo of the same person. A complaint had been lodged with the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Chennithala said.

Mr. Chennithala, who was in Kasaragod as part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) poll campaign on Tuesday, said that surveys could only be considered as a gift to the government for giving the media advertisement worth crores. “The actual survey will be conducted by the people on April 6,” Mr. Chennithala said. He alleged that the government was conducting fake opinion polls with the help of PR agencies. Mr. Chennithala added that he had lodged a complaint with the Election Commission against surveys in which only two hundred to three hundred people in a constituency participate. ‘Disputes resolved’ All disputes in the UDF over candidates were resolved. The candidate list was released by Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran in a transparent manner after discussions with all concerned, he said.

24 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Demand grows for diversion roads before metro’s extension work||The demand is gaining momentum that KMRL develop alternative routes to divert vehicles, prior to commencement of construction works for Kochi Metro’s Kakkanad extension. The Centre had on February 1 given the go ahead for the 11.20-km extension from Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium, Kaloor, up to Infopark in Kakkanad, which is expected to cost Rs. 1,957 crore. Even before that, widening of tarred portion of Seaport-Airport Road through which the metro viaduct would pass had begun, since the State government had sanctioned the project in 2019. Ever since the Kakkanad extension got the Centre’s nod, residents’ associations and others have been demanding that alternative roads be developed to divert vehicles, especially from the narrow and heavily-encroached upon Civil Line Road when the stretch is barricaded to build the metro viaduct. People’s representatives, including councillors from the region, and through whose divisions motorists travelled when Palarivattom NH Bypass Junction was barricaded for flyover works, have been demanding that KMRL ready a traffic diversion plan and also develop byroads that link NH Bypass with Seaport-Airport Road. “The KMRL and DMRC had together widened and resurfaced alternative roads in the city and also rebuilt the narrow Ernakulam North overbridge as a four-lane one, prior to barricading work sites as part of metro’s phase one works - in the Aluva-Pettah stretch. The KMRL, which is now single handedly going to develop the Kakkanad extension, must do the same, failing which chaos will prevail on Civil Line Road and on pocket roads that link the city with Kakkanad,” said sources in the Kochi Corporation. Even otherwise, alternative corridors like the Puthiya Road-Vennala-Palachuvadu-Eachamukku Junction (located on Seaport-Airport Road) are severely congested due to unevenly-wide roads, bottlenecked junctions and encroachments. A councillor from the region expressed concern at the State government not allotting funds for the access-controlled road that was proposed a decade ago from NH Bypass to Seaport-Airport Road. “This would have provided respite to motorists during the metro extension’s construction stage.” A senior Traffic Police official expressed the hope that a meeting involving different stakeholders would be convened at the earliest in order to ready a traffic re-routing plan and to develop roads. Responding to this, KMRL officials said traffic plans were discussed within the agency, to ready a draft report. “We hope to finalise a plan of action once the polls get over,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-grows-for-diversion-roads-before-metros-extension-work/article34146338.ece

Varghese turns vocal, as he points to the site of the proposed Gift City project while recalling protests by local residents. “It’s just half-a-kilometre from here. We wanted the government to avoid acquiring populated areas for the project,” he says. A parody of the hit number Theeyame from Angamaly Diaries is heard from a distance, as Roji M. John, sitting Congress MLA, arrives at the junction amid bursting of crackers. A local leader of the Mahila Congress takes charge of the microphone and reminds voters of the alleged nepotism and protests by youth demanding jobs during the LDF regime. Mr. John loses no time to run towards a woman standing alone in front of her house and seeks her blessings. “We are behind schedule by an hour, as the previous meetings got stretched owing to the overwhelming response of the people,” he says. There is no high-voltage speech by the candidate, but only a few words requesting the electorate to vote for a government led by the United Democratic Front (UDF). The blazing sun has not withered the spirit of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) supporters at Elavoor in Parakkadavu panchayat as the clock strikes one. An activist of the Mahila Morcha critiques the successive governments led by the LDF and the UDF. “Is it not time for a change?” she asks a small crowd of women and children, as they get ready to welcome K.V. Sabu, the NDA candidate. “I knew the people of this area right from the time of peaceful protests against the Left government’s decision to permit women under 50 years to enter Sabarimala. As a lawyer, I had filed bail petitions for the protesters,” he says, as the front campaign managers call for an afternoon break.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/campaign-heat-blazes-in-angamaly/article34146330.ece
24 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Will fresh entrants play spoilsport?||The potential of new political formations which went on to become political parties to play spoilsport with candidates’ prospects will be a key factor in the Assembly elections, especially in Ernakulam and to a lesser extent in Kottayam. While Twenty20, V4People, and One India One Pension (OIOP) have fielded medical doctors, doctorate holders, entrepreneurs, and people from other professions as candidates, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided not to contest, focusing instead on building its strength at the grassroots to be ready for the 2023 Lok Sabha elections and other polls likely to occur in the coming three years. Twenty20, which was floated in 2012, got brute majority in Kizhakkambalam grama panchayat for the second time in succession in the local body polls, while winning overwhelming majority in neighbouring Kunnathunad, Mazhuvannur and Aikkaranad grama panchayats. Similarly, V4Kochi (which went on to become V4People) won 10.20% of the vote share in the local body polls in Kochi within three months of its formation. These parties endeared themselves to people by taking up public causes (by improving basic infrastructure and rolling out a slew of welfare measures in the case of Twenty20) and fielding professionals engaged in various fields as candidates. Incidentally, and it has caused consternation among the three prominent fronts. OIOP OIOP has fielded candidates in over two dozen constituencies in central Kerala. “They include professionals from different fields,” said Johnys P. Stephen of the party. He went on to become president of Uzhavoor grama panchayat with UDF support. The party has fielded its State president Vinod K. Jose at Kaduthuruthy in Kottayam, a region where it wields influence. It has also announced candidates for Puthupally and Changanassery. “Our main plank is the Rs. 10,000 pension for all who have crossed 60 years of age, followed by a fight against corruption and extravagance,” he said. Twenty20 Twenty20 has fielded candidates in eight constituencies in Ernakulam. Party president Sabu Jacob said it was done so that an MLA position must not become one’s sole income source. “We envisage a modern Kerala without corruption, where peace, happiness, and security prevail,” he said. V4People V4People has fielded candidates in Kochi (where its campaign controller Nipun Cherian is in the fray), Ernakulam and Thrikkakara constituencies. “The feedback is that people across age groups are yearning for alternatives. Political polarisation of votes is lessening,” Mr. Cherian said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/will-fresh-entrants-play-spoilsport/article34146322.ece
24 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Women journalists stalked by anonymous letter writer||A disturbing case of stalking of women journalists by an anonymous letter writer has emerged with not less than 55 journalists from across the State complaining of receiving letters with explicit sexual content for years dating as far back as 2014. The victims found common ground and realised that many of them were receiving similar letters, which they believe to be from the same person going by the content and handwriting, after one of the victims who had received over 10 letters since 2019 shared a Facebook post on the matter earlier this month. “I decided to take up the matter as the last few letters were outrageous even by the writer’s standards and had graphical reference to rape and paedophilia. I am worried for the safety of children and women in his family and neighbourhood,” said Nileena Atholi, a Kozhikode-based sub-editor with an online publication who shared her trauma on social media and has registered a complaint at the Nadakkavu police station and the Social Justice Department. She had since then started a WhatsApp group of the stalking victims. Timing of letters The letters written in Malayalam interspersed with English sentences gave the impression that the writer was an educated person, she said. The letters are timed either on the appearance of a byline story or when the women concerned received awards. Another reporter based in Kozhikode traced the timing of letters to be coinciding with stories especially related to child abuse. Another Kochi-based senior woman journalist with a magazine had received 17 letters since 2016 and had even petitioned the District Police Chief (Kochi City) and the State Police Chief in 2018. The petition was forwarded to the Ernakulam North police, who conducted a probe and approached the Postal Department in Palakkad after it was found that majority of the letters were being posted from that district. “However, the Postal Department reportedly shared its helplessness in tracing the origin of the letters. The case was closed after six months as no headway could be made. I have kept all the letters for evidence sake but have not opened the recent ones, the latest of which was received a fortnight ago,” said the journalist on condition of anonymity. Though letters were being posted mainly from Palakkad, there were ones from Ernakulam and Kottayam as well, Ms. Atholi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/women-journalists-stalked-by-anonymous-letter-writer/article34146344.ece
24 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Case against officials: ED moves HC||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has moved the Kerala High Court against the registration of a criminal case by the police against certain unnamed ED officials for forcing Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling case and the money laundering case, to give accusatory statements against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The petition filed by P. Radhakrishnan, Deputy Director, Enforcement Directorate, Kochi, on Tuesday sought to quash the case or in the alternative pleaded for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the case. The First Information Report (FIR) has charged the unnamed officials with charges of conspiracy, threatening and forging an incorrect document, and other charges. It was launched on the basis of the statements of two woman civil police officers who were allegedly on guard duty while Swapna Suresh was in the ED custody. The alleged statements were made by the officers during an inquiry conducted by the State police into the leakage of an audio recording purportedly containing the voice of accused Swapna Suresh. Mr. Radhakrishan alleged that the FIR had been registered with an oblique motive to put pressure on the investigating officers. It was aimed not only at derailing the statutory investigation into the offence of money laundering committed by highly influential persons in the State, but also ensuring that the trial did not take place in a fair and impartial manner. He pointed out that when Swapna was produced before the magistrate court in the money laundering case, she did not make any such complaint of pressure or coercion being made on her before the court. In fact, when enquired by the judge, she had said that she did not have any complaints. M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, now out on bail in the money laundering case, was the mastermind behind the illegal registration of the FIR. He had been influencing other accused and using the State machinery to fabricate false evidence against the ED officials. Interference in probe It was nothing but interference in the investigation of the ED and opposed to the law. Terming the registration of FIR as illegal, the petitoner pointed out that it had been instituted without resorting to the mandatory requirements under Section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/case-against-officials-ed-moves-hc/article34146412.ece
24 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Despite summer, 77 Volvo AC buses idling in Thevara depot||A total of 77 low-floor AC Volvo buses that have been idling at KURTC’s Thevara depot here, despite demand for such buses increasing during the summer months. Of these, 37 are fit to resume service. The remaining 40 are awaiting repairs or cannot be operated since the validity of their fitness certificates has expired. Among them, many buses cannot be operated unless crucial spare parts and batteries arrive, it is learnt. They are in addition to over a dozen non-AC low floor buses which too are remaining under-utilised, although most offices and businesses are getting back to normal, resulting in increasing patronage for private buses and the few KSRTC buses that are operating.  Crew training The CMD of KSRTC, Biju Prabhakar, said that bus crew were being imparted technical and behavioural training so that all the 190 AC low-floor buses could be operated in the coming weeks. “Their training began on March 18. Our plan is to operate them in highways, arterial roads and in trunk routes, depending on demand.” Suburban routes Official sources said that intra-district low-floor AC buses which operated from the city to suburban towns enjoyed good patronage - especially in the Muvattupuzha, Piravom, and Fort Kochi routes. After all, the fleet of low floor AC and non-AC buses were procured under the JNNURM scheme using Central funds and were originally intended to improve the quality of commuting within the city. In Kochi, most suburban towns are part of the Greater Kochi area. There was also demand and regular commuters, in the Ernakulam-Cherthala route, relied on mostly by office goers and others, they said. GPS crucial Stakeholders associated with their operation expressed dismay at why the low-floor and other premium buses of KSRTC were not being tracked live, over a decade since Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled low-floor buses were introduced. “The GPS gadgets are available for as low as Rs. 500 and have been deployed even to track shared bicycles that were introduced earlier this month in Kochi by KMRL, CSML and MYBYK. The GPS-based tracking will help commuters get to know the exact location of each bus, while the KSRTC control room can take steps to prevent bunching of services, by rescheduling their timetable, if necessary,” they said.

While cities like Kochi are experiencing severe shortage of drinking water, the centre is recharging wells and testing water to ensure quality. P.A. Thankachan of the centre said as many as 260 open wells in Thurithikkara had been tested for water quality. Centre’s activities The activities of the centre also include ensuring that people recharge drinking water wells during the rainy season so that the water table in the village rises considerably. He said the State had received abundant rain during monsoon, and recharging wells was needed to ensure supply throughout the year. However, water supply, he added, had been taken for granted, and none took recharging of wells seriously. The water testing programme was conducted with the support of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat), Mr. Thankachan said. All stakeholders, including residents’ associations, were involved in the water conservation programme as well as efforts to ensure availability of safe water in the panchayat, he added. Water conservation has been one of the many efforts by the Science Centre. The programme was taken up by the Science Centre to ensure that the village had no land lying uncultivated. The centre also encourages scientific management of waste, aquaculture in areas as small as tanks as well as vegetable farming in backyards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/science-centre-shows-way-in-rainwater-harvesting/article34146339.ece

There were reports that the agency had asked Ms. Balakrishnan to appear before it on Tuesday. However, the attempts of the investigation agency to serve her the summons to appear for interrogation has not succeeded till now. The first summons, which was send through Speed Post to the address of the house owned by Bineesh Kodiyeri, her son, at Maruthankuzhi, Thiruvananthapuram, was returned by the Postal Department with a note that the door was locked. Second attempt The second attempt of the agency last week to deliver the second summons to the address of the apartment complex in Thiruvananthapuram where Mr. Balakrishnan is residing ended in wilderness as there has not been any return communication from the Postal Department on the post. The agency is yet to know whether the summons has been served. There has not been any communication on the status of the delivery of the summons, Customs sources said. It is to be found out whether she has left for her home town in northern Kerala. Efforts are on to trace her location to serve the summons, sources said. The agency was planning to question Ms. Balakrishnan in connection with the alleged possession of an iPhone which Swapna Suresh, the accused in the gold smuggling case, had reportedly collected from Santhosh Eapen, the managing director of Unitac. The company had run into trouble with the Customs and Enforcement Directorate probing its deals in the gold smuggling case and the alleged bribery charges for procuring the contract for constructing houses under the LIFE Mission housing scheme at Wadakkanchery. Incidentally, sources close to Ms. Balakrishnan had denied her owning or using the iPhone provided by any of the accused in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/customs-fails-to-deliver-summons-to-vinodini/article34146346.ece

24 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Public health system has grown stronger’||To say Kerala’s celebration of success against COVID-19 was premature is wrong, given the way it kept the active caseload curve flat and mortality at India’s lowest [0.4%] all along, asserts Health Minister and CPI(M) central committee member K.K. Shylaja. “When the pandemic struck, there were two choices in front of humanity. To allow the virus to run its round so that herd immunity is achieved or do everything scientifically possible to contain the spread, delay peaking and use that time to augment infrastructure. Herd immunity comes at a cost, as we have seen in other States and globally. Ours is a society with 15% elderly people, high comorbidities and high density of population; allowing the virus to spread would’ve been disastrous. So, we opted for the second model and decided to contain it,” says Ms. Shylaja in an interview with The Hindu in Aluva. “We took up the challenge as we believe in science. We were sure that a vaccine would be ready sooner or later and decided to protect the susceptible population until then. At a very early stage itself, Kerala chose to ‘trace, quarantine, test, isolate and treat.’ We used the lockdown period to plan, train and arm ourselves and it showed. Our hospital capacity was never overwhelmed. At the peak of the pandemic, just 50% of the ICU beds were occupied and occupancy of ventilators was below 40%. By then, we added hundreds of oxygen-supported beds, especially in medical college hospitals,” Ms. Shylaja recalls, saying the team was “thrilled to attempt to rein in a virus that was running riot globally, even as they feared the worst.” If this was not a success, what is, she asks. Ms. Shylaja contends that the government was able to strengthen the public health system at all levels in the past five years. “The primary health centres had just one doctor each. We focussed on early detection of diseases and prevention and gave a thorough makeover to the family health centres (FHCs). Using Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board funds, secondary hospitals, taluk and district ones, were given aesthetically designed labour rooms, operation theatres and were equipped with modern equipment. At the tertiary level, Linac machines for cancer treatment, multiple cath labs, etc., were set up. These apart, under e-health, 260 hospitals were made paperless, total trauma care was introduced in place of casualty units, modular theatres were set up and 2,000 poor children were operated upon at government expense for congenital heart disease,” she says. Rubbishes reports After two girls ended their lives by suicide at Walayar, no answers were forthcoming until an investigation revealed that they had been subjected to abuse. A third child from the family was rescued and a probe is on course.She rubbishes reports of a rise in atrocities against women and suicide by children during the pandemic. “While it will be some time before these social ills are brought to a halt, multiple agencies are intervening and all cases of violence and abuse are pursued to their logical conclusion.” While the Left has fielded more women candidates than any other formation, it is still not enough. “We wanted to have more women in the fray but while calculating ‘winnability’ and alliance equations, chances of several fell through. But I’m sure it will be compensated in future.”  We focussed on early detection of COVID-19 cases and their prevention||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/public-health-system-grew-stronger-in-past-five-years/article34146386.ece

He was the intermediate through which money went into the bank accounts of the racket members and dealers. He was also into selling ganja in small lots.

The key accused had allegedly sourced the LSD stamps from Europe over the Darknet and paid in bitcoins. An LSD stamp priced at $2 to $3 in the foreign market was being sold here at anything between Rs. 1,300 and Rs. 1,500. “This is not for the first time that such purchases are made over the Darknet. Only now we have made a major haul of synthetic drugs sourced through such channels. In fact, this is now the only channel to import synthetic drugs,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). The Netherlands seems to be the preferred destination for drug pushers sourcing it from Europe. However, in this particular case, the police are not sure whether it was the destination. The contraband, including 97 LSD stamps, hashish, ganja, and Rs. 7.86 lakh, was seized from the rented house of the key accused at Chilavannoor. The remaining 618 LSD stamps and Rs. 18,500 were seized from the house of another accused at Ayyappankavu. It was the arrest of two other clients-turned-pedlars with six LSD stamps that led to the arrest of the other two. The contraband was obviously received through couriers. The police are probing the addresses to which the couriers were sent and the dates on which they were received.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-to-crack-down-on-synthetic-drugs/article34146324.ece
24 March 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||An out-and-out political battle in Pathanapuram||With all three fronts fielding film actors, Pathanapuram had witnessed a sort of star war in the 2016 Assembly polls. And it came as no surprise when Left Democratic Front (LDF) nominee and Kerala Congress (B) leader K.B. Ganesh Kumar emerged victorious with a margin of 24,562 votes, defeating Jagdish of the Congress and Bheeman Raghu of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But this time it is an out-and-out political battle with the United Democratic Front (UDF) fielding Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary and Congress spokesperson Jyothikumar Chamakkala while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) district secretary V.S. Jitin Dev is the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate. K.B. Ganesh Kumar was part of the UDF in three out of the four terms he represented the segment and in 2016 he joined hands with the LDF. The constituency includes the Pathanapuram, Pattazhy, Pattazhy Vadakkekara, Piravanthur, Thalavur, Vilakudy, Melila and Vettikavala grama panchayts. Mostly with Left Voters of Pathanapuram have opted for the Left in majority of the past elections, starting from the very first Assembly polls when Rajagopalan Nair of the Communist Party of India (CPI) won against K. Kuttan Pillai (Congress). But in 1960 he lost to R. Balakrishna Pillai of the Congress and in 1965 Pathanapuram was reserved for Scheduled Caste contestants and it remained so till 1977. In the 1980s and 90s E.K. Pillai (CPI), A. George (Kerala Congress), E. Chandrasekharan Nair (CPI) and K. Prakash Babu (CPI) were elected. K.B. Ganesh Kumar first breached the Left bastion in 2001 as the UDF candidate. Two candidates Only two candidates, including his father and veteran politician R. Balakrishna Pillai and A. Geroge, could wrest the seat from the CPI in these years. The Pathanapuram Assembly segment has an expansive forest area and tribal communities form a considerable part of the electoral pool. There are farmers, plantation workers and cashew labourers, who altogether can sway the verdict in any direction. Development of the segment and welfare measures targeted at various sections are the major poll planks of Mr. Ganesh Kumar. The four-time MLA enjoys huge popularity and a loyal vote bank in the constituency despite all the controversies he courts. Formidable opponent Meanwhile, Jyothikumar Chamakkala, who started off his political career with the Kerala Student Union (KSU), is no easy adversary and is very active on the campaign front. Though the UDF leadership is pinning their hopes on the margin gained by Kodikunnil Suresh in the segment during the previous Lok Sabha polls, the LDF is currently ruling six out of the total eight panchayats. The NDA, which managed to increase its vote share over the years, also considers Pathanapuram a key constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-out-and-out-political-battle-in-pathanapuram-this-time/article34146402.ece
24 March 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Rising mercury: high alert in Kollam||In view of soaring mercury and the strong possibility of sunburn cases, the Health Department has sounded a high alert in the district. Apart from random incidents of people developing burns and redness, a 53-year-old Vengara resident had to seek medical assistance for sun exposure. The person engaged in masonry was taken to the Thodiyoor Primary Health Centre (PHC) for treatment on Monday. People who are part of electioneering, migrant labourers, farmers, persons engaged in hard labour in open spaces, headload workers and two-wheeler riders have been advised to stay cautious and take all precautions. In 2019 March, the district had reported around 50 sunburn cases in 10 days, most of them from Punalur and Chadayamangalam. In 2020 hardly any case was reported due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown. Heat rash, dehydration, burns and blisters due to sun exposure, fatigue, body pain, cramps, shivering, general weakness, yellowish urine and dry mouth are the primary symptoms. Those who develop symptoms, including sunken eyes, dry skin, urinary obstruction and fainting, should immediately seek medical aid. Those doing hard labour in open are more susceptible to sunstroke. “Dry body, loss of consciousness, light-headedness, severe headache and slow pulse are the symptoms. If not treated on time, it can lead to muscle damage and kidney failure. Some of the cases can be fatal, if left untreated,” said District Medical Officer (DMO) R. Sreelatha. In take of fluids The department has also issued a set of guidelines that includes setting up water corners and kiosks in all institutions. “Staying in sun should be avoided between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Drink a lot of water along with other fluids like buttermilk even if you are not thirsty. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables while alcohol should be avoided as it causes dehydration. Use sunscreen and umbrella while venturing out. Sunburn victims should be immediately moved to places with shade.” The Health officials have made all arrangements to tackle any emergencies and all medical facilities in the district from PHCs to the District Hospital are fully equipped. “All hospitals have stocked ORS packets, IV fluids and emergency medicines,” said the DMO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rising-mercury-high-alert-in-kollam/article34146405.ece
24 March 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Industry in need of relief measures||A sharp drop in exports, several processing units shutting shop and lakhs of skilled labourers rendered jobless -- the cashew sector has been on a tailspin for some years now. The crippled industry has been struggling hard to cope since 2016 and the crisis assumes even larger proportions post COVID-19. Though there had been signs of revival during the last couple of years, the sector has once again hit a major roadblock. The labour-intensive industry, which used to employ around 3 lakh labourers, is badly in need of emergency relief measures. “Of late we have seen a drastic fall in fortunes and only a special economic package can keep the industry going. Though our wages seem very reasonable in Kerala, it’s higher compared to other States. At present we are unable to afford it and in order to support the sector, the government can offer a share by integrating the industry with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS),” says Nizamudeen I., president, Federation of Cashew Processors and Exporters. Moratorium The State government had earlier declared a moratorium after a couple of processors committed suicide when slapped with Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (Sarfaesi) notice. In the last two budgets, interest-free loans for private processors and provision to restructure their loans were also announced. “There have been several interventions from the part of the government, but the banks have restarted the revenue recovery procedures once again. They are not supportive when it comes to restructuring the loans and many processors will not be able to stay afloat without fresh funding,” he adds. While almost all government-run factories that come under the Kerala State Cashew Workers Apex Industrial Cooperative Society (Capex) and Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (KSCDC) were recently renovated in an employee-friendly manner, a good percentage of the private units still lack basic amenities. Minimum wages “Though it's time for wage revision, many labourers are not even getting the current wage and are forced to work in pathetic conditions. We want the government to ensure rightful minimum wages and take action against processors who deny that. Also, steps should be taken to reopen the factories that have remained closed for several years,” says Savin Sathyn, general secretary, Kerala Kasuvandi Thozhilali Congress. P.Saraswathy Amma, who won the Thozhilali Sreshta award in the sector, believes that the industry requires a proper revival strategy rather than going for any quick fix.  “We want more working days, but there is no point in pressurising our employers who are also struggling. In my neighbourhood, every family has a cashew worker and we have depended on this industry for long.

24 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||UDF will pilot Nyay in State: Rahul||The United Democratic Front, if elected to power, will roll out the Nyuntam Aay Yojana (Nyay) scheme on a pilot basis in Kerala, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said. “If a family gets Rs. 6,000 per month and Rs. 72,000 per annum, this will come to the market and revive the economy, which will increase production and create jobs. This is not a favour or charity but is the only way to revive the economy,” Mr. Gandhi said, addressing an election convention here on Tuesday. “We are testing this new idea in Kerala and I am confident about its success. If it works out in Kerala, it will be taken to the rest of the country. Kerala is going to show the rest of the country how to fight poverty once and for all. We take the advantage of the strength, dynamism, and intelligence of the people of Kerala,” he said, pointing to the success of the MGNREGS in reviving the rural economy. Acknowledging the crisis in the natural rubber sector, Mr.Gandhi also guaranteed to raise the minimum price of natural rubber to Rs. 250 a kg. “We will make sure that rubber farmers get their right due. Ensuring Rs. 250 for rubber is also an important step to revive the economy, because it is one of the most important things of this area,” he said. He also unleashed an attack on the economic policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre and explained how Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken money out of the people’s pocket through demonetisation and GST. “It was like taking petrol or diesel out of the car. Mr. Modi is an instrument of two or three people who want to take India’s wealth away from India,” he said. CM, PM flayed He also criticised Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for turning a blind eye towards the protests staged by PSC rank holders in front of the Secretariat. “In the mind of the CM, those protesters are his enemies. It is like the Prime Minister calling the protesting farmers terrorists. Both the PM and the CM have the same mindset,” Mr. Gandhi said. Mr.Gandhi spoke at as many as five locations across the district. He was accompanied by senior Congress leaders, including K.C. Venugopal and Oommen Chandy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-will-pilot-nyay-in-state-rahul/article34146352.ece
24 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||P.C. George winds up his campaign in Erattupetta||Every election has its own share of controversies and confrontations. But none of these could probably be the strongest like the one that is currently boiling over in Poonjar. The last couple of years of P.C. George as Poonjar MLA have been a stormy one with the veteran politician in direct confrontation with a section of people from a community in Erattupetta. The latest in this long episode of public face-off played out on Monday evening when Mr. George was heckled by a group of people during an election campaign at Thevarupara in Erattupetta. Standing on his campaign vehicle, the MLA hit back sharply with cuss words but had to pull back in view of mounting opposition. A video footage of the incident, which shows the entire incident, has now gone viral in social media. Following the incident, the MLA then took to Facebook to announce that he would be withdrawing the election campaign in Erattupetta for the time being. “No one should think I am doing this because I am scared. When a group of people have become a hindrance to my right to seek votes, I do not wish to push my land into communalism,” he wrote. This is not the first time that Mr. George had a face-off with people in Erattupetta. He has been on a collision course with these people ever since the Parliament polls in 2019. While campaigning for the National Democratic Alliance, he had allegedly made an offensive remark about the community in Erattupetta. Following opposition, the MLA had issued an unconditional apology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pc-george-winds-up-his-campaign-in-erattupetta/article34146350.ece
24 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Battle of prestige in Kunnamangalam||Kunnamangalam Assembly constituency is not a seat of controversies this time, but winning it is a matter of prestige for both the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF). The constituency has shifted its loyalty many times, and the candidates here leave no stone unturned to win the hearts of voters. P.T.A. Rahim, the sitting MLA, is contesting for the third time as an LDF Independent, while the UDF has fielded District Congress Committee secretary Dinesh Perumanna. While Mr. Rahim is highlighting the achievements of the LDF government and developments in the constituency, Mr. Dinesh is banking on his image as a familiar figure in the segment. Besides the State government’s welfare programmes, the mini civil station, Government Arts and Science College at Kunnamangalam, Government ITI at Chathamangalam, the new police station at Pantheerankavu and infrastructure development in schools are being highlighted as achievements by Mr. Rahim in his campaign that has already entered the second phase. ‘Major issues’ The UDF is determined to wrest the seat back from the LDF. Mr. Dinesh, who is a leader of many action committees and protests, is a familiar face in the constituency. He is highlighting the alleged lack of development in the constituency over the past ten years. “The constituency has several issues in sectors such as labour, agriculture, drinking water and traffic, which the sitting MLA has not paid attention to,” he said. He plans to follow up on the reports of the commission appointed to put the abandoned Gwalior Rayons (Grasim) land for better use, and focus on solving the traffic crisis in Kunnamangalam town. He also plans to seek the help of premier institutions in the constituency such as the NIT, IIM, and CWRDM for agricultural development of Kunnamangalam. The Vazhayur-Perumanna bridge across the Chaliyar, for which he is chairing an action committee, and the Puthurmadham-Palazhi-Pottammal road development are part of his manifesto. Mr. Dinesh too has entered the second phase of his campaign and is currently focusing on institutions, places of worship, and workplaces. The Bharatiya Janata Party has fielded its district president V.K. Sajeevan in a constituency where the party’s support base is growing fast, with its candidate being the third highest scorer in the last two elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/battle-of-prestige-in-kunnamangalam/article34146311.ece
24 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||COVID, summer preventing many from donating blood||COVID-19 pandemic and the scorching heat are preventing many from donating blood for needy patients in hospitals across Kozhikode district. According to Shajahan Naduvattam, district joint secretary, Kerala Blood Donors Forum, big blood donation camps could not be held for the past one year owing to restrictions on social events. “Classes have not fully resumed in colleges. Earlier, we used to conduct big camps in such places. Only small camps are being held these days, and some of our plans have gone awry,” he said. Also, right now, those who have taken the second dose of COVID vaccine cannot donate blood for the next 28 days. There should be a gap of 28 days between the first and second dose of the vaccine as well. “This means that anyone who gets the first jab will have to wait for 56 days before donating blood. Since many people are undergoing vaccination, they cannot donate blood,” Mr. Shajahan claimed. Another impediment is the severe heat conditions which is forcing many to avoid venturing out. Mercury levels are rising in the district of late, and it was above normal on Tuesday. With the Ramzan fast beginning in April second week, the forum is expecting a severe shortage in the coming month. Most of those who undergo fasting may not donate blood for the whole month, Mr. Shajahan said. A two-day camp was held at the Government Hospital for Women and Children at Kottaparamba in the city from Monday. Around 70 people participated in the event, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-summer-preventing-many-from-donating-blood/article34146316.ece

According to DIET sources, 16 schools were part of the project in the 2019-20 academic year. It was implemented in 30 schools in 2020-21. One higher secondary school and one primary school each under one block resource centre are part of the project.

The project is being implemented by the In-service Teacher Education, Field Interaction, and Coordination section in DIET. A senior DIET official told The Hindu on Monday that government schools were being given priority. The support for academic improvement could be in online and offline modes. He said a common online platform would be set up for discussing ideas and suggestions. “DIET is organising various schemes for students, parents, and teachers.

24 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Fight that draws national attention||The arrival of veteran technocrat E. Sreedharan on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) banner has catapulted the Palakkad Assembly segment to national attention. BJP’s top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are expected to campaign for Mr. Sreedharan here. Although it is a triangular contest between the United Democratic Front (UDF), the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the BJP, the real fight is between Mr. Sreedharan and UDF incumbent Shafi Parambil. By fielding first-timer C.P. Pramod, the LDF appears not very keen to recapture Palakkad. The BJP camp is upbeat over the candidacy of Mr. Sreedharan, who is received by sections of Hindu voters in veneration. He made it into the news columns after some voters washed his feet and some others lay prostrate at his feet. He focussed on temples and religious groups in the initial days of his electioneering. Displaying his trade-mark gentle behaviour, Mr. Sreedharan is reaching to the masses with folded hands. Overall development remains his motto. He has promised to transform Palakkad town to the best in the country in five years.  Young opponent Mr. Sreedharan’s opponent Shafi Parambil is attracting young and elderly voters alike wherever he goes, seeking a third term to the Assembly. Young and ebullient, Mr. Shafi Parambil has established deep links with the electorate, especially among different sections of Hindus, in the last 10 years as Palakkad’s MLA. His affability and constant presence in the constituency appear his forte.  LDF’s Mr. Pramod too has strengthened his campaign. The votes the LDF candidate garnered in the 2019 Parliament election in the Palakkad Assembly segment are giving hopes for Mr. Pramod. 2019 challenge LDF’s M.B. Rajesh had polled 32.83% of the votes in a keenly fought triangular contest in 2019, trailing to UDF’s V.K. Sreekandan by 4,339 votes. BJP candidate C. Krishnakumar, with 4,123 votes behind Mr. Rajesh, was in the third position. BJP’s hopes are largely on Palakkad municipality, one of the two municipalities in the State where the BJP is in power. The Assembly seat is made up of Pirayiri, Kannadi and Mathur grama panchayats and Palakkad municipality.  BJP’s growth As an engineer, Mr. Sreedharan is banking on the BJP’s growth trajectory in Palakkad. From 19.86% in 2011, the party’s vote share has grown to 29.08% in 2016. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, BJP clocked 29.76% of the votes. The party is aiming at 35% this time. It hopes that Mr. Sreedharan will bring a large number of personal and independent votes to the party’s share. But it needs to be seen if Mr. Sreedharan can defeat a strong, energetic contender like Mr. Shafi Parambil. The fight for it is top class.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fight-that-draws-national-attention/article34146392.ece

24 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Major decline in TB incidence||Estimated incidence of tuberculosis (TB) went down by 37.5% in Kerala between 2015 and 2020, the State registering an annual decline rate of 7.5%. “This is huge, because even global figures for annual incidence of TB reduction have never been more than 2-3% and Kerala is the only State to achieve this,” Rakesh P.S., WHO consultant, TB Elimination, said This has won the State a bronze medal in the Union Health Ministry’s just-concluded Sub-National Certification of Efforts Towards Elimination of TB. The award will be presented by the Union Health Minister on Wednesday, World TB Day. The nation has set an ambitious goal to achieve “End Tuberculosis” by reducing the incidence of new TB cases by 80% by 2025, five years ahead of UN Sustainable Development Goals timelines. The sub-national certification is a process that the Health Ministry introduced this year to reward well-performing States /districts when they achieve specific milestones in their journey towards TB elimination. The State’s claim of TB incidence decline was independently evaluated by a team from the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, WHO and Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine, which went through the entire data sets since 2015. This was followed by a month-long door-to-door survey, which covered 83,000 people in the districts of Kollam, Ernakulam, Malappuram and Kasaragod. As many as 43 amongst this 83,000 persons had TB in the past one year. The researchers found that all 43 had been accounted for in the Nikshay national TB notification software, an indication of the State’s strong surveillance and reporting system. The researchers also cross-checked data on TB drug sales from major private practitioners from all districts and the State Drugs Control Department “In 2017, Kerala redesigned the TB elimination drive as People’s Movement Against TB and from that point, it was the active involvement of the local community and panchayats which drove the State’s efforts. This was a unique initiative which gave rich dividends,” M. Sunilkumar, State TB Officer, said. The State did a mammoth vulnerability mapping study to identify people at high risk of developing active TB and the 7.5 lakh individuals thus identified are being followed up at the community level. Diabetes, COPD Attention was paid to the control of diabetes and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), reduction of tobacco use and malnutrition, which also reduced the vulnerability to TB. Strengthening private sector involvement in TB control and air-borne infection control programmes at all hospitals too helped the State in its TB elimination drive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/major-decline-in-tb-incidence/article34146342.ece

24 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Plea for facilities in schools for insulin jab||The Type-1 Diabetes Foundation has demanded adequate facilities and privacy for children with type-1 diabetes in public schools to take the insulin injection. In a statement, the foundation said children with type-1 diabetes studying in public schools might have to take the insulin injection multiple times to regulate their sugar levels. Often, they were unable to check their sugar at the stipulated time or take the injection owing to lack of basic facilities. In at least 95% of educational institutions, there was no nursing room or teachers with nursing service or training. In many schools, students had to take the injections by visiting the staff room. But with many staff rooms having male and female teachers, children could not take the injection. It was important for parents, school authorities and health workers to know how to take care of such children.

Named ‘My First Trip’, the selected bloggers will board 10 MUVs from the capital for a five-day road trip that takes them across the length and breadth of the State. In the journey that commences from the KTDC’s Hotel Mascot premises, the bloggers will talk about their first-hand experience of the land, its nature-blessed destinations, key attractions, places of interest, cuisine, culture, heritage and the people. “All key destinations and the 14 districts will be covered under the Kerala Blog Express Influencer Activity’s India editions following COVID protocol. The itinerary has been prepared for the bloggers to get a full Kerala experience during their stay here till March 30,’’ a senior tourism official told The Hindu . The government has given administrative sanction to the Director of Tourism to utilise Rs. 88.55 lakh for the trip for marketing. Fan following The initiative was originally planned to be held in March last year with 30 bloggers selected through an online voting system. However, in view of the pandemic, the 10 bloggers were hand-picked based on the strength of their fan following. Kerala Tourism will bear the cost of the bloggers’ airfare to the State and back and accommodation during their stay here for the online campaign. “This is the first such campaign to attract domestic tourists to the State after the pandemic-induced lockdown a year ago led to perhaps the worst crisis the tourism industry has faced. ‘My First Trip comes at a time when several international flights to the country are yet to resume after the lockdown and the industry presently depends fully on domestic tourists for survival,” said a source. Kerala Blog Express has so far created over 200 tourism ambassadors, who have documented their journeys, experiences and memories across conventional, digital and social media platforms in different languages.

The panchayat secretary had suspended the driver, alleging an attempt to malign the panchayat president. Commission chairperson Antony Dominic was acting on a petition by a Vellanad resident on behalf of her husband Shiju who had been suspended by the panchayat secretary on February 7, 2019. It was alleged that Mr. Shiju tarnished the reputation of the panchayat president by driving too fast. The panchayat deputy director told the commission that the secretary’s order was nullified on January 16, 2020 after the suspension was not ratified at a meeting of the panchayat. However, the secretary did not take any action on the order. It was in this context that the petitioner approached the commission. The commission, in its direction to the secretary, said this was a violation of human rights. It also sought a report on the action taken by April 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/revoke-suspension-of-driver-shrc-to-panchayat/article34146567.ece

The results of the survey, conducted among 20,939 people across the State, including the general public and health workers, are more or less in agreement with the finding of the Indian Council of Medical Research’s third round of serosurvey in the State that a significant proportion of the State’s population is still naive. ICMR’s third round of survey held in the State in December reported a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 11.6 %. An official statement issued by the Health Department claimed that the latest survey results was proof of the fact that the State’s COVID-19 containment over the past one year had been successful and that only a small proportion of the population had been exposed to the virus. The reverse quarantine implemented by the State too had been successful as the current survey showed that the seroprevalence amongst the elderly was just 8%, the statement claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/only-1076-in-state-exposed-to-sars-cov-2/article34146356.ece

Senior CPI leader and chairman of the Legislative Committee on Environment Mullakkara Ratnakaran stressed the need for people’s movements to conserve the Western Ghats. Collective conscience must become the driving force for any campaign for the nature. Beyond politics Citing the agitation against the proposed airport in Aranmula that compelled the previous UDF government to abandon the project, the former Agriculture Minister said such movements that transcended political interests were necessary to correct political parties in such issues.  John Samuel, chairman of public policy, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, called for a review of construction methodology to prevent wanton exploitation of natural resources.

The Collector appealed to residents’ associations and local voluntary organisations to cooperate to make the vaccine drive a success.

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||Will pandemic management pass the poll test?||Kerala’s health sector faced unprecedented challenges in the past five years, which tested the system’s capacity, responsiveness and resilience, like never before. The State’s COVID-19 containment is something that the government is immensely proud of and one of the electoral planks on which the Assembly elections are being fought. When one takes stock of the pandemic year that was, there is no doubt that Kerala did alright and much better than many other States.  Pluses “There was some bungling in the initial stages, when the State seemed to take many irrational steps as far as testing protocols and quarantining were concerned, but a lot of things were done right also. It did contact tracing and isolation to a fault, followed up patients, provided free treatment to everyone, equipped hospitals. The biggest success was that at no point did the cases exceed the health system’s surge capacity,” points out Arun N.M., an infectious diseases physician. The government also succeeded in getting across to the people the vital message on how COVID prevention was important. In fact, it was almost 100% public compliance with COVID protocols that won half the battle for the Health Department. People were impressed by the meticulous manner in which the back-end team at the department worked. “I was called on most days by either the Health Department or the urban public health centre. In fact, the mental health care team must have made more calls to me than my family did,” says a city resident who had been admitted to a private hospital for over a fortnight following COVID. Kerala never allowed the epidemic to run riot. None died waiting in ambulances or because of lack of care as it did in the West.  Minuses Even when appreciating COVID control, public health experts and academicians are quite unhappy about the high-handed manner in which the government handled many COVID-related decisions, the abysmal data management and how the scientific community never had a role during the pandemic. Transparency “The government could have been more transparent and scientific in its approach to the pandemic. The people who were considered experts in public health or epidemiology were never seen and no explanations were given as to the decisions made. The epidemic was always a political issue for both fronts,” points out K. Ramankutty, renowned public health expert. The government discouraged all clinical research. Beyond generating daily reports, disaggregated data on the pandemic was never shared. Death reporting All attempts by clinicians and epidemiologists to enlighten the government on COVID death reporting and making it more scientific was stonewalled because it was unwilling to upset the narrative that the State had the lowest case fatality rate. “It is alright to be proud of our achievements but unless we explore our weaknesses, we cannot grow in strength. What drove the government all through the pandemic was this irrational urge to boast to the world that we were one step ahead. Not only was it unrealistic, it also prevented us from bettering ourselves,” a senior public health expert says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/will-pandemic-management-pass-the-poll-test/article34146388.ece

24 March 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||CPI(M) hails YSRCP walkout from RS over VSP divestment||Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary P. Madhu on Tuesday welcomed the YSR Congress Party MPs’ walkout from the Rajya Sabha in protest against the Centre’s decision to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. Leading a motorcycle rally here to drum up support for the March 26 Bharat bandh call along with All Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee Prakasam district president Ch.Ranga Rao, he said it was a good sign that the YSRCP had also extended support to the joint struggle by trade unions and Samyukt Kisan Morcha against the ‘anti-farmer’ and ‘anti-labour’ policies of the Narendra Modi government. The Central government was bent upon privatising all units in the public sector, including railways, banks and insurance firms, he said. Referring to the byelection to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat, he said it was good that the YSRCP had started realising that the ‘BJP’s political ascendancy by communalising spiritual issues with a Kapilatheertham to Ramatheertham yatra’ should be stopped. ‘Downfall started’ Mr. Madhu felt that the ‘suicidal economic policies’ of the saffron party would prove to be its political waterloo. The downfall of the BJP had started with its loss in the civic polls in Punjab, he said, adding that it would come a cropper also in West Bengal, where the voting share of the Left parties had picked up of late. The failure of the Centre to allot mines to the VSP was responsible for the losses of one of the Navaratna PSU, he argued and exhorted all sections of people to take part in the stir to turn the struggle into a people’s movement to exert pressure on the Bharatiya Janata Party to unconditionally scrap the farm laws and give up PSU privatisation spree.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-hails-ysrcp-walkout-from-rs-over-vsp-divestment/article34146506.ece

She was here to participate in a meeting organised by the CPI-ML (Liberation)to protest against the privatisation of the VSP. “We demand on behalf of the farmers to unconditionally repeal the three farm laws by the Union government, as they will facilitate handing over of agriculture from farmers to the hands of agri-corporate companies,” she said. Dr. Natt said that if the government was really keen on doing something good for the farmers, then it should strengthen its logistic supply chain, better the mandi system and give reasonable minimum support price. “The idea that farmers from Andhra Pradesh can sell their produce in Punjab is just an eyewash to misguide the farmers,” she said. She said that the steel plant cannot be privatised as it is one of the biggest shore-based integrated plants and lakhs of families are dependent on it in one way or the other. The concept of public sector was established with the idea of public service and employment generation and India still needs public sector, as it is the base of the economy, she said. On the other hand, private sector’s only concern is profitability and it does not match with the country’s economic condition, as the wealth of the nation will then be concentrated within a few families, she said. Brijen Tiwari, Member, National Working Committee, All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), said that employees from all public sector steel plants, including from the SAIL, are with the employees of the VSP and support the stir.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/withdraw-farm-laws-proposal-to-privatise-vsp-cpi-ml-liberation/article34146622.ece

24 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Slipshod translocation raises questions||Just over a month after recognition of Hyderabad as ‘Global Tree City’, an instance of gross neglect in translocation of trees has been brought into light close to the Outer Ring Road. Video clips of trees being dug up using earth moving machinery on the service road between Warangal Highway and Vijayawada Highway near Ghatkesar went viral on social media, which drew netizens’ ire as it went against the established procedures of tree translocation. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) has reportedly got permission for translocation of thousands of trees on the 50-km stretch between Chinna Golconda and Ghatkesar mostly along the Outer Ring Road, for laying LPG pipelines. Over 40,000 trees are identified which would be affected by the project, and permission was given by the Tree Protection Committee for felling/translocation/retention as is applicable in each case. However, HPCL authorities have reportedly chosen to translocate trees listed for felling too, and over 10,000 trees have been translocated so far. Despite the noble intentions, no established procedure seems to have been followed in translocation of the semi-grown trees. Scientific procedure mandates that the tree be uprooted along with maximum of its root stock, with as little disturbance as possible. To retain the root ball, the ground needs to be dug up carefully around the trunk/stem, leaving required clearance. The procedure usually take a few days, as the tree needs recovery time after each side is dug. Foliage on the tree should be brought down to a third even before digging it up, to reduce translocation stress. While much of this procedure is often given the go-by by the municipal and urban development authorities in a haste to complete the projects, the neglect is seemingly glaring in the present instance. Trees are seen being uprooted without root balls using the excavator handle, and the foliage pruned after uprooting. Sources inform that majority of these trees were planted along the ORR not more than four to five of years ago, with some of the saplings being only a year old. Officials from the Forest department, and HPCL representatives claimed that the survival rate was very high, and several of the translocated trees were already growing leaves. Environmentalists however demur. “Survival of the trees does not absolve HPCL contractors of the shoddy job. Despite being one of the largest public sector companies, they have not ensured scientific procedure while translocating the trees,” says Uday Krishna from Vata Foundation, who posted the videos. Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration & Urban Development, and HMDA Commissioner in charge Arvind Kumar said a team had been sent to the location to inspect the procedure, and action will be taken based in the report. While HPCL has maintained silence over the issue, the company’s representatives clarified that the trees had to be excavated on certain stretch due to “rocky terrain”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/slipshod-translocation-raises-questions/article34146274.ece

24 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Do not recommend another lockdown in State: DPH||Fears of another round of lockdown has gripped people in Telangana after COVID cases started to rise for the last two weeks. But, people might be relieved to know that the State’s Director of Public Health Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao has clarified that they do not recommend any more lockdown. After Janata curfew on March 22 last year, a lockdown was implemented in the State from March 23 to May 5, 2020. Thereafter, partial restrictions on movement of people and business operating hours were implemented for a few more weeks. During this time, daily wage workers ran out of jobs, along with scores of people who lost their jobs, and businesses plummeted. The dreadful times clouded people’s minds after cases started to surge, again, in the State. “We do not recommend a lockdown,” Dr. Srinivasa said. Currently, the only restriction that the State government announced on Tuesday was to shut down all government and private educational institutions, except medical colleges, until further orders. Large numbers of COVID clusters were detected in schools and hostels across the State. While majority of school students were asymptomatic, officials said that an asymptomatic person can spread it to high-risk groups who are not yet vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/we-do-not-recommend-lockdown-says-dph/article34146280.ece
24 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KTR: Centre ignored State on industrial development||Alleging that the Central government was not honouring its own laws, IT and Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao said there was no support for industrial development of Telangana in spite of the assurances given in the Andhra Pradesh (AP) Reorganisation Act. Question hour Replying to questions in the Assembly on Tuesday, he said that Telangana’s interests were ignored by the Centre in the last six years despite the new State creating avenues for attracting investments. At least now the Central government should take note of the promises made and provide special incentives for industries being grounded in Telangana. Further attacking the Centre, the Minister rejected the Central government’s claim on the Rs. 20 lakh crore package for industrial promotion under Atmanirbhar Bharat package. No help to individuals He said no one knows who benefited under that package, but Telangana did not get any benefit. That package helped some street vendors to receive loans up to Rs. 10,000 and no industry or individuals have received help, he said. The Minister said that the TS-iPASS scheme had opened windows for hassle-free establishment of industries and in the last six years 15,326 industries got approval. Telangana attracted investments to the tune of Rs. 2.13 lakh crore under the scheme and about 15.52 lakh jobs were created, both direct and indirect. He said 11,954 industries have commenced their operations with an investment of around Rs. 97,405 crore and 7.67 lakh persons were employed in them as of now. Mr. Rama Rao reiterated the government’s commitment to decentralise industrialisation, promoting establishment of industries in backward areas and for this special incentives are being offered. TASK The Telangana Academy of Skill and Knowledge (TASK) was in the job of offering skill development programmes in several sectors for the unemployed youth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-centre-ignored-state-on-industrial-development/article34146285.ece
24 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||School managements oppose closure||The government’s decision to close schools has come in for sharp criticism from the private school managements and teachers apart from teachers organisations, who said the decision would impact schoolchildren and damage their learning capabilities. Academic groove lost? The Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) honorary president S. Sreenivas Reddy said that it was unfair to close down the schools when children were getting back into the academic groove. He said it was ridiculous to argue that schools were spreading COVID when bars, cinema halls, malls and other business establishments where thousands gather were open. Thousands gathered for political programmes in the recently concluded Graduate MLC elections violating all COVID-19 norms but the government was not bothered but a few cases in schools have bothered them, he argued. He alleged that the government opened the schools earlier for political benefit in the MLC elections. When schools from class I to X were being run successfully in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, why is the Telangana government has hurried to close them down, he asked. The TS United Teachers Federation (TS-UTF) Secretary Chava Ravi also opposed the closure of schools without taking teachers and parents into confidence. He said there are 10,000 high schools in Telangana including 4,600 in the government sector but just a few hundreds of students have been affected in about 10 schools. He said instead of closing the schools the government should have ensured strict implementation of COVID-19 protocols. The closure has put the entire academic system in a dilemma and this decision was taken in haste, he felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/managements-oppose-closure/article34146288.ece

At the all-India level, 2,047 aspirants have been declared qualified for personality test and 796 are likely to be certified for appointments to various positions, including IAS, IPS, Group A and Group B Services. The Personality Test is the last stage of the three-tier examination with the Preliminary, and the main being the first and second respectively. Around 4.8 lakh aspirants are estimated to have appeared for the Preliminary. Though Prelims was originally scheduled in May, it was postponed to October 2020 due to the pandemic. The results of the Preliminary were released within a record span of 20 days and 10,564 aspirants were declared qualified for Mains, held in all the State capitals from January 8 to 17. Usually, the UPSC declares the date of the commencement of the Personality Test along with the result. However, this year they have not declared the date presumably on account of the uncertain situation. Apart from the personality and aptitude related questions, the aspirants are expected to be tested on current affairs, development and related parameters which would broadly encompass social dimensions, economic opportunities and good governance, says Gopala Krishna, Director, Brain Tree. While public health is expected to be a major area of questioning, candidates’ sensitivity to the impact of pandemic on the common man is expected to be focused on through situation-based questions designed to test skills like leadership, decision making, and ability to withstand pressure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/civil-services-mains-exam-results-out/article34146289.ece

In a memorandum addressed to Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, union general secretary K. Raji Reddy said the pay revision for the TSRTC employees was due since April 1, 2017. Though the State government implemented the 16% interim relief for the TSRTC employees, the long-awaited pay revision with fitment is yet to be implemented for them, he pointed out. Referring to the Chief Minister’s announcement of 30% fitment under the PRC for the State government employees of all categories, including teachers and pensioners, on the floor of the Assembly on Monday, he said there is no mention of the TSRTC employees in it. He urged the Chief Minister to ensure implementation of the pay revision with 30% fitment along with payment of the PRC-related arrears for the TSRTC employees. Meanwhile, in a statement, AITUC State secretary S. Narasimha Rao alleged that the municipal and gram panchayat contingent workers, mid-day meal workers and sweepers of the State-run schools were ignored in the PRC. He alleged that the “unscientific” pay revision resulted in a nominal pay hike for the lower-rung employees and injustice to thousands of municipal and gram panchayat workers. He demanded that the government implement a minimum wage of Rs. 21,000 with 30% fitment to the contingent workers engaged in vital tasks such as maintenance of sanitation in municipalities and gram panchayats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rtc-staff-seek-pay-revision/article34146294.ece

24 March 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||BJD govt. plans 15% quota for govt. school students||The Naveen Patnaik Government on Tuesday moved to reserve 15% of seats in medical and technical education courses for students passing out from government high schools. A resolution in this regard was tabled in the Assembly for acceptance of the House. The State government said the reservation was aimed at addressing inequity prevailing in students groups. “After introduction of common entrance exam like the National cum Eligibility Entrance Test and Joint Entrance Examination, the number of students from government schools and colleges of our State in these courses is getting reduced considerably. This is not due to lack of merit, rather the students are unable to fare better in these tests due to lack proper coaching facilities,” the resolution says. It says such common entrance tests require specialised training which is available only in coaching centres which are mostly urban-based and require considerable finances. Holding that students studying in government schools and colleges lack both physical and economic access to coaching centres, the State Cabinet had resolved to reserve adequate number of seats for students of government high schools in medical and engineering colleges of the State. Subsequently, a high powered committee headed by Justice Dr. A.K. Mishra, retired judge of the Orissa High Court along with other members, was constituted for making necessary recommendation in this regard. As per the observation of the committee, about 86% of students of Odisha are in government schools and they get 23% seats in the State medical colleges and 21% seats in engineering colleges. However, 12% of students studying in private schools get almost 60% seats in both medical and engineering colleges. “This clearly shows that there inequity arising from physical and economic access to coaching institutions which play a major role in the national entrance examinations. This inequity affects a majority of students,” the resolution says. The State government will issue necessary notification by exercising power under Section 9 of the Odisha Professional Educational Institute (Regulation and Admission and Fixation of Fees) Act, 2007, to implement the reservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjd-govt-plans-15-quota-for-govt-school-students/article34146188.ece

The Odisha Land Rights to Slum Dwellers Act, 2017, has been enacted with a view to assign land rights to identified slum dwellers for council area, not exceeding 45 sq.m. and where the slum is situated within the Notified Area Council area, not exceeding 60 sq.m. shall be settled in favour of the slum dwellers. “If a slum dweller is in possession of land less than 30 sq.m., land shall be settled as the extent of occupation,” the Cabinet decided. As per the norms of housing for all policy, 21 sq.m. of carpet area is required to construct an affordable housing unit. “Considering the provisions of Housing Policy, it would be essential that where a slum dweller is in occupation of land which is less than 30 sq.m., such slum dweller shall be settled with up to 30 sq.m. of land, subject to availability of land,” according to the Cabinet. The civic body polls in Odisha are long overdue as tenure of 65 local bodies ended almost two years ago. The notification for preparation of the electoral rolls will be done by the SEC only after the State government completes the delimitation process and determines reservation of seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/odisha-to-regularise-land-occupied-by-slum-dwellers/article34146189.ece

24 March 2021||JAIPUR,||‘No mandi can be better than Parliament’||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Tuesday said the farmers afflicted by the new laws would march to Delhi once again and sell their crops outside the Parliament. “On Republic Day, 3.5 lakh tractors had entered Delhi and we will do this again,” he said. ‘Laying siege’ Addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat at Vidyadhar Nagar Stadium here, Mr. Tikait said since the government had told the farmers that they could sell their crops anywhere under the new farm laws, “we will prove it to them by selling our produce outside the State Assemblies, Collectors’ offices and the Parliament.” “No mandi can be better than the Parliament,” Mr. Tikait said in the presence of Swaraj Abhiyan’s Yogendra Yadav and Bhim Army’s Chandrashekhar Azad, while calling upon the farmers to lay siege to Delhi from all directions. He said the farmers would observe a day’s bandh on March 26 all over the country to protest against the new laws. The BKU leader said while the government was trying to divide the country on the lines of caste, creed and religion, the farmers would defeat its designs and show unity to get their rights. The cultivators were faced with a situation where big companies had already built their warehouses and the laws were subsequently being enacted to protect their interests, he added. The rally, organised under the banner of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, received support from a large number of organisations, including CPI, CPI(M), Rajasthan Jat Mahasabha, Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad and Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. After the Mahapanchayats in several districts of Rajasthan, this was the first major event of Samyukta Kisan Morcha in the State Capital. Bad weather The sudden rain and strong winds in the city uprooted the tents at the rally and one person was injured. The thin attendance at the rally, attributed to bad weather conditions, left the organisers disappointed. The farmer leaders paid homage to freedom fighter Bhagat Singh on his death anniversary at the stage in the rally. An announcement was made on the occasion for appointment of Jat Mahasabha president Raja Ram Meel as BKU’s State unit president and K.C. Ghumaria as general secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/no-mandi-can-be-better-than-parliament/article34146191.ece

Delhi was witnessing 200 cases per day some time back, but again the number has risen to 800-900,” Mr. Jain said, while felicitating “corona warriors” from Deen Dayal Upadhay and GTB Hospital at the Delhi Assembly. “Just like the other diseases, we will have to learn how to protect ourselves. If we continue to follow proper precautions like washing our hands, wearing a mask, a lot of other diseases too can be kept at bay,” the Health Minister added. On March 7, despite the number of daily cases witnessing an upward trend, Mr. Jain had said that COVID-19 was nearing an “endemic” phase in the Capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/daily-infections-in-delhi-breach-1k-mark-for-first-time-this-year/article34146176.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||NIA files chargesheet against two separatist leaders, their associates||The National Investigation Agency on Tuesday filed a chargesheet against two separatist leaders from Manipur, who had in 2019 announced the launch of the ‘Manipur government-in-exile’ and declared the State’s independence from India, officials said. Besides Yamben Biren and Narengbam Samarjit Singh, the agency filed the chargesheet against their associates Narengbam Biswajit Singh, Elangbam Brojendro Singh and Akoijam Deepa Anand, they said. In 2019 at a press conference in London, Yamben Biren, claiming to be the ‘Chief Minister of Manipur State Council’ and Narengbam Samarjit Singh, claiming to be the ‘Minister of External Affairs and Defence of Manipur State Council’, had said they were speaking on behalf of the ‘'Maharaja of Manipur'’ to formally launch the government-in-exile — ‘The Manipur State Council’. The officials said the five persons have been charged under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The chargesheet was filed before a special NIA court in Imphal in Manipur on Tuesday. “The case, filed at the Lamphel police station in Imphal West on October 30, 2019, pertains to the declaration of independence of Manipur from India and formation of ‘The Manipur State Council’ at London by the self-styled external affairs and defence minister of so-called ‘Manipur State Council’ ,” a NIA official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/nia-files-chargesheet-against-two-separatist-leaders-their-associates/article34146186.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||BJP implementing British-era rule in Delhi: AAP||AAP leaders attacked the BJP over the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Amendment (GNCTD) Bill, 2021, which has been passed in the Lok Sabha and said that it is a “disrespect” to the vote of the people of Delhi. “In the British era too, there was a Parliament and elections were conducted. Even at that time MPs were elected. But the decision-making powers were not in their hands. It was the Viceroy who took all the decisions. The same thing is being brought today. The people of Delhi elected their MLAs, but the governance lies with the L-G. British rule is being implemented again,” Health Minister Satyendar Jain said. ‘Not indifferent’ He said that people need to be aware of the fact that their vote is being “disrespected” and he is hopeful that they will go against this. “The Central government is under the impression that Delhiites are indifferent since most people don’t belong to this city. But we believe that we will make them aware. The Centre can bring in L-G, but we will still work towards the welfare of the people. The work that took us 16 hours, might take 18 now, but we will still work,” Mr. Jain said. AAP Lok Sabha MP Bhagwant Mann also said that the Bill is not just about Delhi, but BJP is trying to intervene through the Governor in States where the BJP is not in power. The Bill, which was passed by the Lok Sabha on Monday, is yet to be passed by the Rajya Sabha. An AAP source said that though they have sought support of some other Opposition parties in Rajya Sabha, the chances of them being able to stop the Bill is less. “Many MPs of TMC and other parties who support us are busy with Assembly elections in their own seats. It will be difficult to stop it in RS,” the source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-implementing-british-era-rule-in-delhi-aap/article34146177.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong. claims new excise policy will ruin families||The Delhi Congress continued its criticism of the new excise policy of the Kejriwal government with former MLA and Congress leader Alka Lamba saying that the policy intended to boost the revenue collection by an additional Rs. 2,000 crore. She said it will not only ruin the lives of the youth but also many families as well. Ms. Lamba said it was ironic and shocking that Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced the new excise policy to lower the minimum drinking age from 25 to 21, knowing that at this age, most youngsters would be pursuing their education and are dependent on their families. Ms. Lamba asked the eight women AAP MLAs whether they support the policy as the ill-effects would be felt by women. The Delhi Congress said that it will hold a demonstration on March 24 outside the residence of the Chief Minister to protest the new excise policy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cong-claims-new-excise-policy-will-ruin-families/article34146171.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||Raise drinking age in States you rule, AAP dares BJP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday attacked the BJP and accused it of “hypocrisy” by opposing the Delhi government’s decision to reduce the minimum drinking age from 25 years to 21 years. “I am surprised to see the hypocrisy of the BJP. Within BJP-ruled States, the minimum drinking age has been 21 for many years, including in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Arunachal Pradesh. The BJP has ruled Goa for 15 years, where the minimum drinking age is 18 years,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj during a press conference. He challenged BJP leaders to increase the minimum age to 25 years in BJP-ruled States, and added that the Aam Aadmi Party will make it 30 years in Delhi, if the BJP makes it 25 years. Mr. Bharadwaj further alleged that the BJP was “misleading” people because “they think that they can’t do corruption once the new policy is implemented”. Property tax The AAP leader further claimed that the BJP-ruled South Delhi Municipal Corporation had brought a proposal to hike the property tax by 34%, which the BJP termed “totally false”.  “Allegation of Mr. Bhardwaj is totally false as South body Standing Committee has already rejected the proposal of the Commissioner to raise house tax. It seems in his malafide anxiety to level charges against the civic body, Mr. Bhardwaj does not even crosscheck facts,” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/raise-drinking-age-in-states-you-rule-aap-dares-bjp/article34146174.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||Centre ducks query on dissolution of air quality panel; Cong. doubts commitment||Cornering the government on premature dissolution of the Commission for Air Quality Management set up by the Narendra Modi government by way of an ordinance that lapsed on March 12, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh questioned the government’s commitment towards the issue. Mr. Ramesh said that the government that is usually agile in converting an ordinance into an Act, let this important ordinance lapse. This despite the fact, Mr. Ramesh said, that the Business Advisory Committee for Rajya Sabha had allocated three hours’ time for the discussion on the conversion of the ordinance to a Bill. Mr. Ramesh’s question went unanswered in the Rajya Sabha, with Deputy Chairman Harivansh pressing to take up other listed business. The session is slated to end on Thursday and it is unlikely that in the last two days, the government will bring in a fresh Bill to reactivate the commission. “No clarification was forthcoming. A much-hyped measure to tackle air pollution languishes,” Mr Ramesh tweeted. The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and adjoining areas, as it is called, came into being after the 22-year-old Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) that has so far addressed air pollution in Delhi, was dissolved in October.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centre-ducks-query-on-dissolution-of-air-quality-panel-cong-doubts-commitment/article34146164.ece

Justice Kaul said he was happy to inaugurate the web portal as it was well timed. “I am sure the judiciary can equally utilise in some way the opportunity of interaction with these dynamic youngsters,” Justice kaul added. SAHYOG was founded by Adya Jha and Dakshita Chopra, alumni of the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences.

24 March 2021||New Delhi,||Court upholds jail sentence for AAP MLA||A Delhi court on Tuesday upheld an order sentencing AAP MLA Somnath Bharti to two years in jail for assaulting AIIMS security staffer in a case registered in 2016. After the pronouncement of the order, Mr. Bharti was taken into custody, a lawyer said. A magistrate court had in January sentenced him to two years in jail. Special Judge Vikas Dhull partly dismissed Mr. Bharti’s appeal and convicted him for the offences under Sections 147 (rioting) read with 149 (unlawful assembly) of IPC and under Section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The court, however, set aside his conviction under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) read with Section 149 of the IPC. In January, Mr. Bharti was granted bail to enable him to file an appeal before the HC against his conviction and jail term. According to the prosecution, in September 2016, Mr. Bharti, along with 300 others, brought down the fence of a wall at the AIIMS. The case was lodged based on a complaint from R.S. Rawat, Chief Security Officer, AIIMS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-upholds-jail-sentence-for-aap-mla/article34146161.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||BJP says AAP govt. pushing youth towards alcoholism||The BJP on Tuesday accused the Delhi government of being the first in the country seeking to push the youth towards alcoholism to increase its own revenue. Addressing a protest against the new excise policy proposed by the Delhi government here near Shahdara bus terminal, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said that on one hand the BJP is organising programmes on martyrdom day to inculcate patriotism in the youth while the Delhi government is “making them move towards liquor consumption.” Angry party workers also burnt an effigy of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal where party vice president Virender Sachdeva, Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, MLA Shri Jitender Mahajan, district president Master Vinod were present.  “The new policy will not only lead to spurious liquor and promote crime but will also spoil youngsters as the legal age for drinking has been lowered from 25 to 21 years,” Mr. Gupta alleged. “It is rather unfortunate that the Kejriwal government is giving more weightage to extra revenue at the cost of ruining youngsters’ lives. The policy is arbitrary and unjust as no government has the right to play with future of the youngsters,” Mr. Bidhuri alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-says-aap-govt-pushing-youth-towards-alcoholism/article34146173.ece

24 March 2021||Patna,||Police lathi-charge RJD workers||Several policemen, RJD workers and media personnel were injured when the police resorted to baton charge on the protesting Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders and supporters in Patna in the course of their proposed Vidhan Sabha march. The RJD leaders and workers were protesting against the deteriorating law and order situation in the State, corruption, unemployment and price hike of essential commodities. ‘Where are jobs?’ “The NDA in its manifesto had promised to provide 19 lakh jobs in Bihar. What happened to that promise? Corruption is at an all-time high in the State these days, and law and order has nosedived at an alarming level,” alleged RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav. The RJD had, earlier, called a Vidhan Sabha march on March 23 to protest against these issues. The Assembly was adjourned till 2 p.m. when the Opposition members created pandemonium inside the House. The RJD leaders, workers and supporters, led by Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav and others senior party leaders, began their protest march from Gandhi Maidan in Patna. Heavy police deployment was done at the Dak Bungalow intersection of the city with barricades in place to stop the RJD workers from moving towards the Assembly. However, as the RJD leaders and workers kept moving towards the Vidhan Sabha to gheroa it, the police stopped them at the Dak Bungalow thoroughfare where a scuffle broke out between them. Later, the police resorted to baton charge against them. The police rained batons on fleeing RJD workers and supporters. All shops and business establishments were shut during the march.  Vehicles damaged Several policemen and RJD workers and supporters got injured in the scuffle. A few vehicles were damaged in stone pelting from both sides. Some media persons too got injuries in the scuffle. “This is the real character of the RJD. They believe in violence and they use it to remind people about what the RJD stands for,” alleged JD(U) leader Ajay Alok. Later, the RJD leaders and workers were taken in buses by the policemen to other places to restore traffic movement at the city’s main thoroughfare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/police-lathi-charge-rjd-workers/article34146185.ece

24 March 2021||Mumbai,||Fadnavis alleges irregularities in police transfers, seeks CBI probe||The ongoing political turmoil escalated on Tuesday after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis alleged of irregularities in transfer of police officers in Maharashtra citing a confidential report from the former commissioner of State intelligence department, Rashmi Shukla, who had put several phone numbers on surveillance. Mr. Fadnavis demanded an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the matter. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), a partner in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, denied the allegations saying 80% of the transfers discussed in the alleged phone conversations never even took place, and the rest were confirmed by a committee of senior IPS and IAS officers of which former Maharashtra Director General of Police Subodh Jaiswal was a member. “For lower posts, a well-established police board generally submits its recommendations and then the further process takes place,” NCP’s Mumbai president and State Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik said. The NCP said that Ms. Shukla had illegally put phone numbers of several political leaders on surveillance, when the MVA government was being formed, to help the BJP. “That was the reason why she was shunted out from the intelligence department after the government was formed,” Mr. Malik said. The party alleged that Ms. Shukla and Mr. Jaiswal worked for the BJP. “When the BJP realised that it could not buy our MLAs, it started working on officers,” he said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Fadnavis at a press conference claimed that he was in possession of 6.3 GB data of phone interceptions which he would produce before the Union home secretary and demand a CBI probe. “Ms. Shukla had sought permission from then DGP Mr. Jaiswal and through proper channel with approval from the then additional chief secretary of Home Department, several important phone numbers were put on surveillance,” Mr. Fadnavis said. He added that on August 25, 2020, Ms. Shukla submitted a report to Mr. Jaiswal and the next day, he forwarded it to the Chief Minister office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fadnavis-alleges-irregularities-in-police-transfers-seeks-cbi-probe/article34146193.ece

The entry should be allowed if the antigen report is negative or with a RT-PCR negative report of the last 72 hours. NMMC Commissioner Abhijit Bangar has also asked officials to open the temporarily closed COVID-19 Care Centres in phases and reactivate the mobile antigen van for housing societies. Department stores have been asked to start a token system by deciding on the number of visitors allowed at one time depending on space. “ A fine of Rs. 50,000 will be levied on the management each time a mall is found to be overcrowded without proper social distancing,” Mr. Bangar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/test-negative-report-must-for-entering-malls-in-navi-mumbai-on-weekends/article34146194.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||Monthly deadlines for Chandni Chowk work||Monthly deadlines have been set to ensure speedy completion of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, which has suffered several delays due to the COVID-induced lockdown and curbs, said Delhi government sources. The first phase of the project, related to the redevelopment and pedestrianisation of the 1.3 km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid, is expected to be completed by May 31, said sources. Once completed, it will pave the way for a futuristic solution to one of the area’s historical problems: last-mile connectivity. Free connectivity The authorities are exploring the possibility of deploying golf carts and trambuses to provide free connectivity on the stretch. “The main corridor is almost complete except for installation of streetlights and CCTV cameras. We expect this to be accomplished by the end of April,” said a government official. “Traffic diversions have been put in place at the Red Fort junction. Work on this junction as well as near the Fatehpuri Masjid is expected to be done by the end of April as well. The Transport department has been asked to explore the provision of e-vehicles for last-mile connectivity for the elderly and infirm,” the official said. Another official associated with the project said work related to phase II of the project, which includes façade restoration, will see the appointment of a consultant by the end of April. Meanwhile, a significant portion of overhead electric cables have been removed from the stretch, and multiple pick-up and drop sites for goods, which was a demand of local businesses, have also been demarcated. The stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid is being turned into a vehicle-free zone – between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. – though non-motorised vehicles will be allowed. There will be tree-lined footpaths on either side and a wide central verge. There will also be seating space for visitors. Most of the work is being done in red sandstone, keeping the Mughal-era architectural style in mind.  Undertaken at a cost of Rs. 90 crore and part of a larger redevelopment plan for the Walled City of Shahjahanabad, the project was scheduled to be completed by March-end last year. Government sources said this was mainly due to issues over procurement of construction material as well as components to be installed as part of the initiative from neighbouring States such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/monthly-deadlines-for-chandni-chowk-work/article34146167.ece

24 March 2021||Yangon,||Myanmar junta defends crackdown||Myanmar’s junta on Tuesday defended its seven-week crackdown that has left more than 260 democracy protesters dead, insisting it would not tolerate “anarchy”. The junta has unleashed deadly violence as it struggles to quell nationwide protests against the February 1 ousting of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In a news conference in the capital Naypyidaw, junta spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun put the death toll lower at 164. “I am sad because these violent terrorist people who died are our nationals,” he said. The streets of towns and cities across the country have seen chaotic scenes for weeks as security forces clash with protesters demanding the restoration of democracy and the release of Ms. Suu Kyi. The authorities have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds to disperse protests, prompting a senior UN rights expert to warn they may be committing “crimes against humanity”. But despite widespread international condemnation, the junta spokesman defended the response, saying that the security forces were dealing with “insurgents holding weapons” and five police and four soldiers had been killed. “We have to crack down on the anarchy. Which countries in the world accept anarchy?” he said. Despite the bloodshed, protesters took to the streets again on Tuesday, staging demonstrations in Yangon. Media targeted As well as breaking up protests, the military has sought to stem the flow of news about the crackdown, banning several local media outlets and arresting dozens of journalists. Mobile data networks remains suspended. Ms. Suu Kyi, not seen in public since being detained on February 1, is facing several criminal charges as well as allegations of accepting illegal payments of gold and cash. Sean Turnell, an Australian adviser to the 75-year-old Nobel laureate, is being investigated under immigration and state secrets laws, the junta spokesman announced on Tuesday. International pressure is building on the regime, with the EU on Monday imposing sanctions on junta chief General Min Aung Hlaing and 10 other senior officials. The U.S. — which has already blacklisted the top junta leaders — sanctioned Myanmar’s police chief and an army special operations commander, saying they were responsible for using lethal force against demonstrators.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-junta-defends-crackdown/article34145866.ece

He said the UNHCR had reports of more than 550 people injured and about 45,000 displaced. Thousands are homeless Bangladeshi officials are investigating the cause of the blaze even as officials, aid workers and families sift through the debris looking for further victims. The fire ripped through the Balukhali camp near the southeastern town of Cox’s Bazar late on Monday, burning through thousands of shanties as people scrambled to save their meagre possessions. “Everything has gone. Thousands are without homes,” Aman Ullah, a Rohingya refugee from the Balukhali camp, told Reuters. “The fire was brought under control after six hours but some parts of the camp could be seen smoking all night long.” Police have so far confirmed seven deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/15-killed-in-huge-rohingya-camp-blaze-in-bangladesh/article34145858.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||China, Russia propose new security dialogue platform||China and Russia have proposed setting up a new “regional security dialogue platform” to address security concerns of countries in the region, as their Foreign Ministers hit out at the United States for “forming small circles to seek bloc confrontation”. The proposal came following a meeting between Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in the southern Chinese city of Guilin, and days after the March 19 U.S.-China summit in Alaska and the March 12 leaders’ summit of the Quad (India, Australia, Japan and the U.S.), grouping that both Beijing and Moscow have viewed warily. Both sides said in a joint press release that they “also proposed the establishment of a regional security dialogue platform to converge a new consensus on resolving the security concerns of countries in the region”. China and Russia are already part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) security grouping, which includes India. The press release said "the international community believes that the United States should reflect on the damage it has done to global peace and development in recent years, halt unilateral bullying, stop meddling in other countries' domestic affairs, and stop forming small circles to seek bloc confrontation.” True multilateralism China and Russia have rejected U.S. calls for “a rules-based order” — a call endorsed by the Quad summit — and instead said “all countries should follow the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations” and "uphold true multilateralism, make international relations more democratic, and accept and promote peaceful coexistence and common development of countries with different social systems and development paths”. The two-day dialogue covered a range of issues, including Afghanistan, the Iranian nuclear issue, climate change and “the Asia-Pacific situation”, the press release said. On the Myanmar coup, both sides “voiced support for all parties in Myanmar to seek a political solution to the current crisis within the Constitution and legal framework, avoid further conflict and bloodshed, prevent external forces from taking advantage of the crisis for their own gains, and continue to advance the democratic transition”. In a separate joint statement following the conclusion of the two-day talks, both sides called for a summit of the UN Security Council’s five permanent members to be held. “At a time of increasing global political turbulence, a summit of the permanent members of the UN Security Council is particularly necessary to establish direct dialogue about ways to resolve humankind’s common problems in the interests of maintaining global stability,” Reuters quoted the joint statement, published on the Russian Foreign Ministry’s website, as saying. The statement also hit out at attempts by the West to interfere in both countries’ internal affairs. Both Ministers, in remarks to the press, criticised the U.S. and the EU for their recent sanctions on Russia and China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-russia-propose-new-security-dialogue-platform/article34145860.ece

America’s top diplomat adopted a positive tone at the start of a two-day meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers as he looks to rebuild ties strained by former U.S. pPresident Donald Trump. But high on the agenda for NATO is the future of the alliance’s 9,600-strong mission in Afghanistan after Mr. Trump struck a deal with the Taliban to withdraw troops by May 1. Allies are waiting anxiously for President Joe Biden to decide whether to stick to that date. “We have a review under way in the U.S. I’m here today in part to share some of our initial thinking with our NATO allies,” Blinken said. “Maybe even more important, I’m here to listen and consult because that is what allies do.” Mr. Biden said last week that it would be “tough” for Washington to meet the looming deadline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/blinken-meets-nato-allies/article34145861.ece
24 March 2021||Jerusalem,||Israel voters take fourth shot at deciding Netanyahu’s fate||Israelis were voting on Tuesday in their fourth election in less than two years, with the nation deeply split on whether veteran Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should stay in power. Mr. Netanyahu, 71, is Israel’s longest-serving premier but his inability to unite a stable governing majority behind him has mired the country in political gridlock. He hopes to be rewarded by voters for establishing ties with a series of Arab countries, and for a COVID-19 vaccination campaign that has inoculated half of Israel’s roughly nine million people. Election workers in full protective gear staffed special polling stations for voters in quarantine and those with the coronavirus — but most citizens wore only face masks thanks to the world-leading inoculation effort. Corruption charges While Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party appears set to win the most seats in the 120-seat Knesset, the premier will need coalition partners to secure a majority. That means Israel is looking at three possible outcomes: another coalition under Mr. Netanyahu, who has been in power for 12 straight years, an ideologically divided government united only by its opposition to him, or a looming fifth election. He is on trial over corruption charges — allegations he denies, but which have helped fuel a protest movement with weekly rallies outside his Jerusalem residence.  To form a government, Mr. Netanyahu would have to strike deals with small factions that control a handful of seats, possibly including Religious Zionism, a new extremist, far-right alliance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-voters-take-fourth-shot-at-deciding-netanyahus-fate/article34145864.ece
24 March 2021||Boulder,||10 killed in shooting at Colorado supermarket||A shooting at a crowded Colorado supermarket that killed 10 people, including the first police officer to arrive, sent terrorised shoppers and workers scrambling for safety and stunned a State that has grieved several mass killings. President Joe Biden called for a ban on assault weapons and tighter gun control measures. Hundreds of police officers from throughout the Denver metropolitan area responded to the Monday afternoon attack, converging on a King Soopers supermarket in southern Boulder. SWAT officers carrying ballistic shields slowly approached the store as others quickly escorted frightened people away from the building, some of its windows shattered. Customers and employees fled through a back loading dock to safety. Others took refuge in nearby shops. One suspect was in custody, a tearful Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said late on Monday. Authorities didn’t identify the suspect, though Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the suspect was the only person injured and was receiving medical care. Ms. Herold identified the slain officer as Eric Talley, aged 51. In brief remarks responding to the shooting, Mr. Biden urged Congress to move quickly to close the loopholes in the background check system and also to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines — an effort that would be even more difficult to achieve politically. According to a police affidavit, the Colorado shooter had purchased an assault rifle six days ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/10-killed-in-shooting-at-colorado-supermarket/article34145862.ece
24 March 2021||Seoul,||Xi, Kim exchange messages to reaffirm China-N. Korea alliance||The leaders of China and North Korea are reaffirming their traditional alliance following contentious talks between top diplomats from Washington and Beijing and diplomatic isolation and economic problems in the North that have left it ever-more dependent on the Chinese. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said on Tuesday that leader Kim Jong-un called for stronger “unity and cooperation” with China in the face of challenges posed by “hostile forces” while exchanging messages with Chinese President Xi Jinping. According to KCNA and China’s Xinhua news agency, Mr. Xi in his own message to Mr. Kim described bilateral relations as a “valuable asset” to both countries and vowed to make unspecified contributions to the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. KCNA said Mr. Xi also expressed a commitment to “provide the peoples of the two countries with better life.” Some analysts saw this as an indication that China would soon provide North Korea with badly needed food, fertilizer and other aid. The exchange came as the Biden administration steps up diplomatic efforts to strengthen cooperation with Asian allies South Korea and Japan to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat and China’s growing regional influence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-kim-exchange-messages-to-reaffirm-china-n-korea-alliance/article34145868.ece

The 2000 bomb plot was one of several attempts on Hasina's life in a wave of violence by Islamic extremists who were angry at her secular stance at the time. Since then, a major crackdown against homegrown Islamist groups has seen more than 100 extremists killed in raids by police and more than 1,000 suspected militants arrested. A fast-track court handed down death sentences to all 14 accused — five of them are absconding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/14-who-plotted-to-kill-hasina-to-face-gallows/article34145856.ece

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka said the three-year swap arrangement for 10 billion yuan with the People’s Bank of China was “with a view to promoting bilateral trade and direct investment for economic development of the two countries”.

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||The absent programme at the Kerala hustings||The two political fronts of Kerala, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF), have now presented their manifestos to the electorate. They are joined by distributivism, competing with one another in offering welfare payments. Almost no section has been left out — the old, the youth, the housewife. First off the mark with its manifesto was the ruling LDF. Among its 900 promises reported in the Malayalam language press was the gradual enhancement of the current monthly pension of Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 2,500 by the time its term ends. Not to be outdone, the UDF has in its manifesto promised a pension of Rs. 3,000 and a monthly payout of Rs. 6,000 per household to Below Poverty Line families. These are only a part of the rain of promises. Kerala Model is unsustainable The manifestos have been received with scepticism by the public, for they could not but have wondered how the fresh expenditures will be funded. Kerala today has one of the highest levels of public debt per capita among India’s States. Without fresh resource mobilisation — of which intent there is no indication in either party’s manifesto —enhanced public expenditure assures higher levels of public debt in the future. The economics profession globally agreed that during the novel coronavirus pandemic the level of public debt ought not to hold back necessary public expenditure to aid relief and recovery. However, in the case of Kerala, we are talking of the structural feature of expenditures being elevated in relation to revenue. It is in this sense that the so-called ‘Kerala Model’, in which the State focuses on welfare, has been identified as unsustainable by economist K.K. George several decades ago. The State’s political parties have not addressed this issue and conduct themselves as if this is not important. Inter-generational debt shifting, i.e., leaving debt incurred by us to be paid by future generations, is not a trivial issue. It is justified when the borrowing creates capital assets that generate revenues into the future, but when the borrowing is undertaken to finance our own consumption, leaving behind nothing but the debt for them is unconscionable. Actually, even if physical assets are created, they should generate adequate revenue. A blanket refusal to turn in a surplus by charging for public services is, therefore, problematic. It is this consideration that leaves the public particularly sceptical of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) initiative. Perhaps the Kerala government has done due diligence that demonstrates its financial viability but it has an obligation to lay the facts of the business model, in particular the forecast stream of revenues, on the table. A different welfarism here Individual well-being enabled by public action is a perfectly legitimate aspiration in a democracy. However, what distinguishes the decades’ long practice in Kerala is that it is a form of welfarism far from what is generally understood when we speak of a welfare state. Though originally imagined by the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, it was in western Europe that the welfare state achieved fruition. Its distinguishing feature is the provision of health and education by the state. There are pensions too. So, it is not as if the provisions in Kerala are improper in any way. What distinguishes a genuine welfare state from the Kerala Model is that in a genuine welfare state, benefits are financed by taxes. There were two considerations underlying this design in the original. The first was the crucial issue of financial viability. The second was to give citizens a sense of ownership of the programmes, signifying that the welfare state is not some sort of munificence extended to them by the political class but something they had contributed to themselves. Thus, the British institution of the National Health Service, the envy of richer countries which not even Margaret Thatcher dared dismantle, has eventually been paid for by that country’s workers. The tax to national income ratio in the United Kingdom is among the highest in the world, and has remained consistently over 40%. Kerala’s is not just much lower but has often been lower than in the other southern States. Point of coverage Before moving on, it is worth noting that in Kerala, there is also the question of coverage. The State has one of the highest percentages of children in private schools and out-of-pocket expenditure on health in India. Whether this is due to inadequate provision or the poor quality of service in the public sector is to be ascertained, but at least as far as schooling is concerned, it is difficult to believe that the government cannot provide schooling of the highest quality. The feature is more likely related to inflexible and shoddy governance. The issue of funding is not irrelevant either. For political parties, the temptation to be seen to be handing out welfare payments is too great to resist, which, in the absence of a will to mobilise resources, can only mean that there will be less for health and education. The meagre resources mobilised end up being spread thin, across innumerable government schemes. On employment generation It is difficult to imagine that Kerala will be able to permanently fund its welfare schemes through borrowing. At least, that would only be possible at ever rising interest rates, leading to a higher fiscal burden, if not actually a debt trap. At that stage, the welfare schemes would have to end, or a Herculean effort to raise revenues would have to be initiated. In other words, there is no alternative to funding welfare schemes via higher taxation or some other source of public funding (such as oil revenues in Saudi Arabia). Funding can also be through contributions made by workers, as in the case of Europe’s welfare states. However, this will be possible only if everyone is employed for at least some stage of their lives. For this, economic policy must ensure that levels of employment remain high. There is little awareness of this in Kerala at the level of either state or civil society. Seen from the manifestos in this forthcoming Assembly election, the political parties have no programme for employment generation. To place the enormity of the challenge in perspective, on the occasion of the presentation of the last Budget, the government stated in the Legislative Assembly that the unemployment rate for youth in Kerala is 36%. This is much higher than the national average. Broaden the tax net While it is clear that public resource mobilisation in Kerala falls short of its welfarist ambition, it is not widely known that even this reluctant mobilisation is skewed in its impact. Jose Sebastian, an independent observer of the State’s public finances, has pointed out that the State’s taxes largely derive from four sources: levies on liquor, lotteries, petrol and motor vehicles, respectively. These are items of mass consumption, implying that it is the working class that contributes most to resource mobilisation. This implies, that as the revenue goes to the provision of public services, it is the working class that financially supports the welfarist economic policy stance of the political class, with the middle class benefiting disproportionately. In Kerala, the tax net needs to be broadened from the point of view of both equity and buoyancy. This could start with a focus on the conspicuous consumption underlying the rampant construction of often unused luxury houses in the State. Steeply progressive taxation of property stands out by its absence. It was once understood to be the hallmark of socialism.

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||An extraordinary legislative misadventure||“At the bottom of all tributes paid to democracy is the little man [and woman], walking into a little booth, with a little pencil, making a little cross on a little bit of paper [now EVMs] — no amount of rhetoric or voluminous discussion can possibly diminish the overwhelming importance of the point.” These were the memorable words of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which the Indian Supreme Court endorsed. The court added that “the little large Indian shall not be hijacked from the course of free and fair elections by mob muscle methods, or subtle perversion of discretion by men dressed in little brief authority”. Contents of the Bill If the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which has been passed by the Lok Sabha, is enacted, the little large Indians of the national capital may as well keep off the polling booths, for their vote will be rendered meaningless. The popular government they have elected will not be able to act on matters which the Constitution vests in it the competence to do. This Bill is an extraordinary legislative misadventure. It states the opposite of what the apex court said when it interpreted Article 239AA of the Constitution. Strangely, however, the Bill proclaims that it seeks to give effect to the interpretation. First, the Bill says the expression “Government” referred to in any law to be made by the Legislative Assembly in Delhi shall mean the “Lieutenant Governor”. Second, it vests in the Lieutenant Governor the power to refuse assent and reserve a Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly for the consideration of the President, if, in his opinion, the Bill incidentally covers any of the matters which fall outside the purview of the Assembly’s powers. Third, and most drastically, the Bill says before taking any executive action, the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor shall be obtained on such matters as may be specified. The Supreme Court has the last word on the interpretation of the Constitution. That constitutional provision (Article 239AA) remains unamended. Any legislation which speaks to the contrary would be plainly illegal. The basis of the judgment remaining the same, the attempt in the Bill is to legislatively overrule a judgment. That would be an exercise of judicial power, which Parliament does not possess. All that the Bill does is to regurgitate the rebuffed arguments of the Central government by the court. The court stated in Govt. of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India (2018): “The respondents... highlight that by the constitutional amendment, introduction of the 1991 Act and the Rules of Business, the Lieutenant Governor functions as the administrator in the truest sense... They would submit that though Delhi has been conferred a special status, yet that does not bring any new incarnation. The submission, as we perceive, destroys the fundamental marrows of the conception, namely special status. It, in fact, adorns the Lieutenant Governor with certain attributes and seeks to convey that NCT of Delhi remains where it was.” The court was loath to centralise the power in the Lieutenant Governor and went only thus far to say that the Council of Ministers should keep the Lieutenant Governor informed of its decisions. This would enable any decision on which there was a difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the government to be referred to the President. It said the power to refer to the President was an exception; that the Lieutenant Governor need not in a mechanical manner refer every decision; and most important, he will be guided by the concept of constitutional morality and the question of prior concurrence was out of question, since that would set at nought the ideals of representative governance and democracy. The idea was twofold. The earlier judgment in Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab (1974) had ruled against the deification of any individual like the Lieutenant Governor, for it had warned that elections would then become but “Dead Sea fruits”. Second, the voice of the citizen could not go unrecognised. “This is only possible if the agency enacting and enforcing the law comprises of the elected representatives chosen by the free will of the citizens,” thundered the court in Govt. of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India . The elected representatives and the Council of Ministers, being accountable to the voters of Delhi, must have the appropriate powers so that they can perform their functions effectively and efficiently, the court emphasised. Any other interpretation, felt the court, would nullify the concepts of pragmatic federalism and collaborative federalism.  Administrative chaos Sidestepping the law laid down, and in a manner as to herald administrative chaos, by these thoughtless amendments, the Lieutenant Governor has been made synonymous with the Government. The government, a product of the beautiful democratic process, is replaced by one individual, a nominee of the Central government, who will occupy office at its pleasure. Not stopping there, the Bill vests in that individual enormous powers to refer all and sundry matters to the President. Now it is so well settled in constitutional law that what is to be seen is the pith and substance and not incidental aspects, while testing the competence of a legislature. That is why the referral power was to be an exceptional power and a confrontational attitude was to be abhorred. The further mandate in the Bill that before taking any executive action, the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor needs to be taken is in the teeth of the court’s interpretation, which only wanted the Lieutenant Governor to be kept informed. The majestic institutions that adorn Lutyens’ Delhi and the embassies of foreign nations that punctuate it symbolically convey a lot. Delhi cannot afford administrative breakdowns. To the outside world, Delhi is India’s face. It will reflect very poorly on the Central government if administration comes to a standstill in the capital. In any case, the little large Indian voter in Delhi cannot be hoodwinked. The Prime Minister should step in and immediately abort the Bill in order to uphold the principles of participative democracy, cooperative federalism, collective responsibility to the House and, above all, constitutional morality, which we deeply cherish.

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||The surge of geopolitics in South Asia’s power trade||India has released new rules governing the trade of electricity across its borders (https://bit.ly/3lG5oIb). They define the contours of the South Asian electricity market, placing clear limits on who can buy from and sell into India. This has ramifications for the electricity markets of Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, which, to varying degrees, have aligned their energy futures with the Indian market. The new rules show that India’s approach is unmistakeably political. It attempts to balance China’s growing influence in the region with developmental aims, both its own and the region’s. Rules on ownership Of central importance is the ownership of power plants wishing to sell to India. In masterful legalese, the rules strongly discourage the participation of plants owned by a company situated in “a third country with whom India shares a land border” and “does not have a bilateral agreement on power sector cooperation with India”. Chinese companies hoping to establish plants in Nepal, Bhutan, or Bangladesh will presumably have a hard time making good on their investments with the Indian market cut off. The rules place the same security restrictions on tripartite trade, say from Bhutan to Bangladesh through Indian territory. To make things even more airtight, the rules establish elaborate surveillance procedures to detect changes in the ownership patterns of entities trading with India. With this, it seems South Asia’s electricity politics has hit a holding pattern after several years of unpredictability. In the months after the Narendra Modi government came to power in 2014, India used the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to make historical moves towards liberalising electricity trade. China soon began to make its presence felt in the region, and India responded by walking back its free-market impulses. It imposed stringent restrictions that dissuaded everyone other than Indian and government entities from participating. That threatened to undermine private sector participation and promising joint ventures across the region. Nepal and Bhutan protested for years, leading to new guidelines in 2018 that tried to find a middle ground; these rules formalise that balancing act. They allow private sector participation but exclude Chinese investments. India-centricity no advantage The institutional structure that has emerged through this churn over the last decade is India-centric. The Government of India, through ministries, regulators, planning bodies and utilities, determines the rules of the road. India’s geographic centrality combines with its economic heft to give it a natural advantage in determining the shape of the market; all electrons must pass through it and most electrons will be bought by it. The prospect of an independent regional body governing trade, championed by theorists, is thus unlikely to begin with. It is nearly impossible to fathom in the context of an ailing South Asian project characterised by low levels of trust. India will thus enjoy pre-eminent rule-setting powers, but continually attract the ire of its smaller neighbours who feel their economic growth is being stunted by decisions in Delhi. Mega solar project These rules provoke some larger questions that must be tackled soon. India’s ambition of anchoring a global super-grid called One Sun One World One Grid, or OSOWOG (https://bit.ly/3f4lcDj) needs an institutional vision. It aims to begin with connections to West Asia and Southeast Asia and then spread to Africa and beyond. The South Asian lesson, contained in these latest rules, is that political realities will constantly collide with, and damage, expansive visions of borderless trade. Impartial institutions for planning, investments and conflict resolution are crucial to multi-country power pools. Managing the needs of three relatively small neighbouring economies in South Asia has consumed large amounts of time and political capital for the better part of a decade. Papering over the cracks of a power pool of a dozen countries or more will be much harder. An ad hoc design also makes the Indian project less attractive to countries looking to sign up to a power trading project. The logic underpinning OSOWOG is sound. Renewable energy transitions benefit from grids that cover vast areas and diverse geographic conditions. Multi-country grids allow for the unpredictable outputs from renewable energy plants to be balanced across countries, thus avoiding expensive country-specific balancing technologies such as hydropower and gas plants. Countering China It is quite likely, though, that India’s plans will be one among many in a soon-to-be competitive space. China, for example, has its own power pool ambitions. An attractive institutional model can lock countries into the pool by setting standards that investors and utilities plan towards and profit by. Once locked in, countries are thus unlikely to defect to other pools. The likely first battle will be in Southeast Asia, where China presently holds sway. A considered, stable institutional model will likely surpass anything China has to offer. It is worth considering releasing the vice-like grip on South Asia, aimed at countering China, by creating a rule-based regional institution that can counter Chinese offerings in other theatres.

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||The case that time forgot||Vishnu Tiwari, 43, was recently acquitted by the Allahabad High Court in a rape case after spending 20 years in prison. His story is illustrative of the tragic consequences that can follow from cases falling through the cracks of a bloated legal system. In 2003, Mr. Tiwari was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape under the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. His appeal before the Allahabad High Court was pending for 16 years as a defective matter. These defects are usually in the nature of missing documents or documents in the wrong format and are remedied by the lawyer, and the case gets listed. Mr. Tiwari’s lawyer had no interest in pursuing the case, and the appeal stayed defective. During his incarceration, his parents and two brothers died. The High Court pointed out in its judgment that the State government did not consider commuting his life sentence after 14 years. Shweta Singh Rana, a legal aid lawyer, was handed the case in 2019 when the jail authorities requested the High Court to provide a lawyer to Mr. Tiwari. The process of getting the ‘paperbook’, a compilation of the lower court’s records, took nearly two years. The fact that Mr. Tiwari is now a free man and his case was heard by the High Court is a consequence of fortuitous circumstances and the presence of a few good individuals in the system. A sincere lawyer and vigilant family members, luxuries that only prisoners with economic means have access to, have become essential to secure justice.  A poorly designed system An effective justice system should not depend on a few individuals’ goodness and should be robust enough to ensure justice for everyone, irrespective of the individual in charge. Many of the hiccups in Mr. Tiwari’s case do not reflect deliberate malice but result from poor design and the absence of an integrated digital platform for the criminal justice system. This poor design can have enervating effects on individual freedom. While digitisation has transformed the delivery of certain public services like passports, the criminal justice system is still beset with archaic procedures and paper-based processes. Although the eCourts project has made significant progress in digitising the works of courts, there remain substantial lacunae. These are especially glaring in the criminal justice system. Sharing information seamlessly Criminal cases involve various institutions such as the police, prosecutors, legal services authorities and forensic labs. Coordination and communication between these institutions are far from seamless. A criminal case’s smooth movement involves several ‘rubbing points’ where progress depends on one institution securing information from another. For example, the prosecutor needs to get the FIR from the police; the police have to submit the FIR and chargesheet to the court; the forensic labs need to submit reports to the prosecutors and the courts; etc. Allowing these various elements of the system to ‘talk’ to each other through a digital platform that standardises the format and content of data across all the systems will allow for seamless communication and will help avoid duplication of data entry and analyses. If such a platform can track cases from when an FIR is filed till the stage of appeal, it is unlikely that a case would fall through the cracks as Mr. Tiwari’s did. Such a system would have alerted the registry that defects in a particular appeal had been left unrectified for an extended period and would have alerted the accused person in prison that his lawyer was not pursuing his case diligently. Simultaneously, the legal services authority would have been informed of the case so that the lawyer could have been replaced. The digital platform would have been able to monitor the quality of representation of the lawyer provided by the legal services authority. Once the prisoner had served 14 years of his sentence, the system would have alerted the State government that he was eligible for commutation of his sentence. The documents from the lower court would have been transmitted electronically to the accused person’s lawyer and the High Court eliminating the endless wait for the ‘paperbook’. Although the Interoperable Criminal Justice System is on the anvil to integrate the information systems of the various institutions in the criminal justice system, it is far from being fully implemented. A critical factor holding back implementation is that these institutions have already created their own information systems that work in silos and are not interoperable. Priority must be given to speeding up the implementation of such a system that provides transparent, real-time access to criminal justice information to all stakeholders, including accused persons.

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Recalibrating India-Taiwan ties||India and Taiwan are celebrating 25 years of their partnership. However, the growing relationship has been a low-key affair as India has been hesitant to acknowledge the improving ties in public. Though mutual efforts between Delhi and Taipei have enabled a range of bilateral agreements covering agriculture, investment, customs cooperation, civil aviation, industrial cooperation and other areas, the time has come to recalibrate India-Taiwan relations. Cultivating political framework Creating a political framework is a prerequisite to doing this. Both partners have increasingly deepened mutual respect underpinned by openness, with democracy and diversity as the key principles for collective growth. The shared faith in freedom, human rights, justice, and rule of law continues to embolden their partnership. To make this relationship more meaningful, both sides can create a group of empowered persons or a task force to chart out a road map in a given time frame. Political will is the key. India’s has been in the forefront of the fight against COVID-19. Likewise, Taiwan’s handling of the pandemic and its support to many other countries underlines the need to deepen healthcare cooperation. India and Taiwan already collaborate in the area of traditional medicine. The time is ripe to expand cooperation in the field of healthcare. Maintaining air quality has become a mammoth challenge for the Indian government and stubble burning is an important reason for severe air pollution. Taiwan could be a valuable partner in dealing with this challenge through its bio-friendly technologies. Such methods are applied to convert agricultural waste into value-added and environmentally beneficial renewable energy or biochemicals. This will be a win-win situation as it will help in dealing with air pollution and also enhance farmers’ income. Further, New Delhi and Taipei can also undertake joint research and development initiatives in the field of organic farming. India and Taiwan need to deepen people-to-people connect. Cultural exchange is the cornerstone of any civilisational exchange. It not only helps one appreciate another culture but also helps in overcoming prejudices and cultural misunderstanding. Tourism is the key tool in this exchange. However, Taiwanese tourists in India are a very small number. The Buddhist pilgrimage tour needs better connectivity and visibility, in addition to showcasing incredible India’s diversity. This will accelerate the flow of Taiwanese tourists. With the Taiwan Tourism Bureau partnering with Mumbai Metro, Taiwan is trying to raise awareness about the country and increase the inflow of Indian tourists. Deepening economic ties Trade relations have grown. India’s huge market provides Taiwan with investment opportunities. Taiwan’s reputation as the world leader in semiconductor and electronics complements India’s leadership in ITES (Information Technology-Enabled Services). This convergence of interests will help create new opportunities. India’s recent strides in the ease of business ranking not only provide Taiwan with lucrative business opportunities but also help it mitigate its over-dependence on one country for investment opportunities. The signing of a bilateral trade agreement in 2018 was an important milestone. There are around 200 Taiwanese companies in the field of electronics, construction, petrochemicals, machine, Information and Communications Technology and auto parts operating in India. Despite the huge potential, Taiwan investments have been paltry in India. Taiwanese firms find the regulatory and labour regime daunting with stray incidents such as the incident in the Wistron plant last year creating confusion and mistrust. Policymakers need to coordinate better with the business community to help them navigate the regulatory and cultural landscape for better ties.

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Mumbai muckraking||Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh are sensational, and threatening for the State government. The nexus between crime, politics, policing and business is an old story. In that sense, Mr. Singh’s charge that the Minister was forcing police officers to extort money from businesses is not surprising; it is nevertheless an extremely serious one that needs serious investigation. However, Mr. Singh’s credibility is hardly inspiring, and he raised the allegation only after he was removed as Commissioner. The circumstances leading to his removal were inglorious. Sachin Vaze, an officer arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the discovery of explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, was perceived to be close to Mr. Singh. The Minister sought to put Mr. Singh on the mat over the case, who made a retaliatory move by accusing the former of trying to use Mr. Vaze as a henchman. Mr. Singh approaching the Supreme Court for a CBI inquiry against Mr. Deshmukh is intriguing and self-implicating. As Commissioner he could have — and should have — acted upon the allegations that he is now raising. The muckraking by Mr. Singh cannot be seen disconnected from the ceaseless political manoeuvering in the State. The formation of the unlikely coalition of the Shiv Sena, Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 2019 was a setback to the storied managerial skills of the BJP. Speculation of an impending collapse have loomed over the Maha Vikas Aghadi government since its formation. The BJP, with the active help of Central agencies, has been trying to unsettle the State government. In the tug of war, Mr. Singh has been an active instrument of the MVA, and the Shiv Sena sprung up to his defence immediately after he was removed. Now the leaders of all three parties have termed his allegations as a conspiracy to topple the State government. After the initial panic, the parties have closed ranks behind the embattled Minister. The lure of power is universal, but in Maharashtra, which is home to India’s economic capital Mumbai, it is even more intense. The ideological mismatch of the alliance partners is evident, but the State government has matched up to the BJP’s challenge several times in political combat. All three parties are united by a strong survival instinct in the face of the BJP onslaught. The BJP’s impatience to reclaim power in Maharashtra is more than usual considering the bruised egos involved. The chances of a politically motivated investigation are high, given the context. Only an independent, transparent investigation can separate the wheat from the chaff in this sordid tale. Unfortunately, a probe by either the State police or a central agency is not a reassuring option.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mumbai-muckraking/article34145838.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Corrective voice||While recognising society’s deep-rooted patriarchy and initiating a course correction in the way the judiciary itself views gender rights, the Supreme Court went back to Henrik Ibsen, a playwright known for his feisty women characters who break free of traditions of familial confines and notions of social propriety. Setting aside an absurd rakhi -for-bail order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court to a sexual offender, the Court issued a set of guidelines on March 18 to be followed by the judiciary while dealing with sexual crimes against women. The two-member Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and S. Ravindra Bhat used a quote from Ibsen to say that a woman ‘cannot be herself’ in an ‘exclusively masculine society, with laws framed by men’, and laid it down as a guiding force for all future judicial proclamations. The judiciary’s corrective voice is a welcome step in the aftermath of CJI S.A. Bobde’s reported remarks during a virtual hearing, when he asked an alleged rapist’s lawyer to find out whether his client would marry the victim. He later said he had been misquoted. The Khanwilkar-Bhat Bench asked all courts to refrain from imposing marriage or mandate any compromise between a sex offender and his victim. Powerful men seem to be reiterating misogyny besides carelessly linking sexual crimes to women being alone at night or wearing clothes of their choice. Leaning on the ‘Bangkok General Guidance for Judges on Applying a Gender Perspective in Southeast Asia’, the Bench listed a host of avoidable stereotypes: women are physically weak; men are the head of the household and must make all the decisions related to family; women should be submissive and obedient. Women are battling society’s ingrained prejudices, and the judgment acknowledges this bitter reality, saying gender violence is most often shrouded in a culture of silence. Pointing to the entrenched unequal power equations between men and women, including cultural and social norms, financial dependence, and poverty, it said data may not reflect the actual incidence of violence against women. It is not the first time the Supreme Court is clamping down against gender stereotyping. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud ( Secr., Ministry of Defence vs. Babita Puniya ) had argued against treating women in the Army any differently from their men counterparts for they worked as “equal citizens” in a common mission, and in Anuj Garg , the Court had called out the “notion of romantic paternalism” as an attempt to put women “in a cage”. To break the silence on bias against women, everyone must take responsibility, especially institutions and those in important positions. The Court’s reiteration on where it needs to stand on women’s rights is a move in the right direction because the fight for gender equality is far from over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/corrective-voice/article34145839.ece

Giri, stressed to-day [New Delhi, March 23] in his address to Parliament that the present Government had been returned to office on the clear pledge that the central objective of its policy must be the abolition of poverty. Mr. Giri said the people had asserted their sovereignty through the ballot box and given the Government a massive mandate for peaceful change which must swiftly and visibly alter the picture of poverty and alienation in our land. The President who was inaugurating a three-week interim budget session of Parliament gave the assurance that the Government will soon frame specific policies and programmes arising out of this mandate which will include a mid-term appraisal of the Fourth Plan. The President’s annual address to Parliament which is in the nature of a policy statement by the Government, has come to acquire special significance this time in view of the high expectations aroused by the ruling party’s election promises to usher in a more equitable social system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/promising-steps-to-remove-poverty/article34145848.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Privilege.||We understand that Lord Willingdon has been assiduous in his attendance for sometime and in watching the way in which Mr. Kesava Pillai, the Deputy President, voted in the Council. Mr. Pillai, it would appear, voted sometimes against Government and sometimes remained neutral. The Governor seems to have noticed this and asked Mr. Pillai, whether he, as Deputy President, could vote against the Government. Mr. Pillai’s reply was the only proper and commendable one. It is reported to have been that he, as a people’s representative, must be left free to vote as he pleased and that, to retain his free vote, he was if necessary prepared to resign the post of Deputy President. There is a general rumour in the Council lobby that the situation has so developed that Mr. Pillai might be forced to resign. The immediate cause that gave rise to the issue was, presumably, Mr. Pillai’s giving notice of a motion to reduce a certain item of expenditure and remaining neutral instead of voting for Government in respect of the Russelkonda Saw mills scheme. Whatever that be, Lord Willingdon’s action in calling upon the Deputy-President, who as a non-official bound to support the interests of his constituency is entitled to freedom of voting, is absolutely unconstitutional and utterly indefensible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/privilege/article34145847.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ready to discuss GST on fuel if States want it: FM||The Centre is ready to consider bringing fuel under the Goods and Services Tax regime if the States bring up the issue at the GST Council, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday, arguing that all decisions related to the indirect tax are driven by the Council and not the Ministry of Finance. The Minister introduced 127 amendments to the Finance Bill, 2021, which was passed by the Lok Sabha. These included an income tax break for the proposed development finance institution to fund infrastructure and a tweak in the proposed tax provisions for employees’ provident fund (EPF) contributions. Defending the decision to impose an Agriculture Infrastructure Development Fund Cess on several items including fuel in the Budget, Ms. Sitharaman said that the proceeds from the collections would be shared with the States as they were the ones in charge of farm infrastructure such as APMCs and marketing yards. “The cess may not get devolved to States, but eventually it will be used for improving infrastructure in agriculture and the farm yards and the marketing yards, which are with the State governments and so the funds will have to go the States only,” the FM said. The Minister also sought to assuage States’ concerns about a possible reduction in fund allocations owing to the Finance Commission’s recommendation to set up a non-lapsable Defence and Internal Security Modernisation Fund. “In principle, we have agreed to it. [But] the fear that it will be imposed on States is not well-founded at all. We have not yet taken a decision on this,” she said. “In the Finance Bill, a few new proposals are being added of a minor nature,” the minister said. EPF Tax The government has also introduced an amendment in the Budget proposal to tax income on employee contributions of more than Rs. 2.5 lakh a year into Provident Fund accounts. “There is 1% of people who were going up to Rs. 5 crore contribution also. The Rs. 2.5 lakh [cap] covers 92%-93% of people,” the FM said. “Therefore, I don’t think this is going to affect most people for whom tax-free, assured income is provided under the scheme,” she added. “Through an amendment, I intend to raise this limit to Rs. 5 lakh in those cases, and only in those cases where there is no contribution by the employer in the EPF account,” Ms. Sitharaman said.  Taxing fuel Responding to many MPs’ concerns about the high taxes on petrol and diesel and suggestions to bring them under the GST regime, Ms. Sitharaman said that both the Centre and States were taxing fuel and the Centre’s taxes had to be shared with the States. “And if there is this concern, rightly, a concern about the fuel taxes. I would honestly think, many of the States would be watching this, and in the next GST Council, if that discussion comes up, I will be glad to have it on the agenda and discuss it. Let the States come and discuss it,” the minister said. “Issues related to GST, being posed to Finance Minister, are not Finance Ministry matters,” she said. “They are GST Council matters in which all States are members. It’s a collective decision and without their clearance, things can’t happen,” Ms. Sitharaman pointed out. Aadhaar intimation Permanent Account Number (PAN) card holders failing to intimate their Aadhaar numbers to the Income Tax department on, or before a prescribed date, shall be liable to pay an Aadhaar intimation default fee of up to Rs. 1,000, as per amendments made to the Finance Bill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ready-to-discuss-gst-on-fuel-if-states-want-it-fm/article34145819.ece
24 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Family member CEOs upstage professional peers, shows study||While only 82, or 34%, of the top 243 listed Indian companies are run by promoter or family member chief executives, these company leaders outperformed their professional CEO peers in terms of delivering total returns to shareholders over a five-year period ending in March 2020, the findings of a study by London-based executive search firm EMA Partners show. “This is the first study of this kind carried out to understand the current proportion of family member CEOs versus professional CEOs in the country,” said Krishna Prakash, co-founder and managing partner, EMA Partners. “This is also to... identify who created more shareholder wealth, the family member CEOs or professional CEOs,” he added. An analysis of the compounded annual growth rate of total returns to shareholders (TRS) found that during the study period, the 243 listed firms reported an average decline of 2% in TRS due to the pandemic-triggered market decline. Interestingly, family member CEOs outperformed the market, creating a positive 2% average TRS, while the professional chiefs oversaw an average negative TRS growth of 4%. Family member CEOs were predominantly in the majority in the healthcare, lifesciences and pharma, and industrials and manufacturing sectors (67% and 53%, respectively). Professional CEOs were dominant across basic materials, energy & utilities, finance, TMT and consumer & retail. The respondents comprised BSE-listed firms having a market capitalisation of more than Rs. 100 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/promoter-family-kin-ceos-upstage-professional-peers/article34145820.ece

As per the findings of the 2021 KPMG CEO Outlook Pulse Survey, 45% of global top honchos executives said ‘normal’ course of business would not return until sometime in 2022, as opposed to 31% who anticipated this would happen later this year. Of those surveyed, 24% said their business model had been changed forever by the pandemic. Conducted by KPMG in February and March, the study asked 500 global CEOs about their response to the pandemic and the outlook over a three-year horizon. About 55% of CEOs remained concerned about employees’ access to a COVID-19 vaccine, which is influencing their outlook as to when employees will return to the workplace; while 90% were considering asking staff to report for duty after they are vaccinated. However, 34% of global executives remained worried about misinformation on COVID-19 vaccine safety and the potential this might have on employees choosing not to have it administered. “Before any major decisions are made, CEOs want to be confident that their workforce is protected against this virus,” Bill Thomas, global chairman and CEO, KPMG, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/return-to-normalcy-not-till-2022-kpmg-cites-45-of-ceos/article34145822.ece

24 March 2021||PUNE,||Prasidh, Shardul derail rapid England chase, India goes 1-0 up||Shikhar Dhawan made the most of two reprieves to set the foundation in the first half. Virat Kohli continued his silken touch. K.L. Rahul justified his inclusion ahead of Rishabh Pant with a final flurry. Pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shardul Thakur were at their usual best. Day of the debutants But it was the two debutants — Krunal Pandya and M. Prasidh Krishna — who caught the eye, playing significant roles in India’s win over England in the first ODI at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium on Tuesday. Despite Dhawan and Kohli’s 105-run partnership for the second wicket, England’s bowlers pulled things back after Eoin Morgan was again lucky with the toss. But Rahul and Krunal — the elder of the Pandya siblings — ensured India had a sizeable total with a whirlwind partnership. The duo’s unbeaten 112-run association in 9.3 overs meant India raced to 317 for five. Back with a bang While Krunal made his mark with an unbeaten 58 off just 31 balls, the other debutant — Prasidh — came back with a bang after being taken to the cleaners by Jonny Bairstow in the first PowerPlay. Prasidh’s four-wicket haul, including the key scalps of Jason Roy and Ben Stokes in successive overs, was crucial in India bowling England out in the 43rd over. The 66-run margin may indicate a facile win but when Bairstow and Roy got England off to a flying start, India had plenty to ponder. The former whacked Prasidh for 22 runs in the sixth over, including lofted drives, two of which landed in the empty stands. With Roy also coming to the party, the dangerous partnership had swollen to 131 in just 14 overs. Breaking through When captain Kohli reintroduced Prasidh in the 15th over, Roy cut him over backward point for a four off the first ball. Off the next, however, Suryakumar Yadav, substituting for an injured Rohit Sharma who was hit on the shoulder while batting, caught an uppish, mistimed drive at point. In his next over, Prasidh accounted for Stokes, with another substitute, Shubman Gill, filling in for an injured Shreyas Iyer after he partially dislocated his shoulder in the field, holding a dolly at extra cover. Had Kohli accepted the edge off the first ball that Morgan, batting with a split webbing, faced, Prasidh and India would have heaved a sigh of relief. But though Prasidh missed out on taking three wickets in two overs, Shardul managed the feat to give India control of the contest. Having terminated Bairstow’s stay by having him caught at deep mid-wicket in the 23rd over, Shardul sent back Morgan and the dangerous Jos Buttler in the space of four balls in the 25th, after which the result was only a matter of time. The momentum shift Earlier in the evening, when Krunal joined Rahul after Hardik’s dismissal, at 205 for five, India was in danger of falling well short of the 300-run mark. But Krunal went after Sam Curran in the 42nd over, pulling and flicking him for three fours. Joining the party Rahul joined the party in the 44th, clearing the boundary off leggie Adil Rashid. The mayhem continued even when the venomous Mark Wood came back for the last two overs, as Krunal and Rahul opened their shoulders to ensure India ended on a high.  Krunal Pandya’s 26-ball 50 is the fastest by a debutant in ODIs, eclipsing John Morris’ record (35 balls) for New Zealand against England in 1990. It was also the quickest by an Indian since 2012 Rahul and Krunal’s unbeaten 112-run stand in 9.3 overs took India to 317 for five While 16 Indian bowlers have claimed three wickets on their ODI debut, Prasidh is the first to take a four-for in his first match   While 16 Indian bowlers have picked up three wickets on their ODI debut, Prasidh is the first to take a four-for in his first match||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/prasidh-shardul-derail-rapid-england-chase-india-goes-1-0-up/article34145934.ece

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Why cricket-watching is not just about watching cricket||It has been almost a year since I watched cricket live, and it feels strange. Not just international cricket but First Class, club, even the Sunday knockabout in the neighbourhood. The pandemic has done worse things than shut the door on what some see as an indulgence anyway. Yet no one voluntarily gives it up. Either the playing of it or the watching. Cricket-watching is not just about watching cricket. You can decide whether you want it to be an individual sport, sitting by yourself in a stadium, thinking, planning, spending quality time with yourself, taking comfort in the feeling of being alone in a crowd. Digression and diversion are built into the aesthetics of cricket. Or you might prefer the team game, allowing yourself to be carried away by the energy of the crowd and revelling in a shared experience. Some people knit, some walk around looking for food or (when abroad) a drink. Or a chance meeting with Michael Holding taking a break from the commentary box. Cricket-watching is also about spending time with former players and potential stars, the past and the future in a continuum through the present. It is about nostalgia, and the elegiac which is never far from any discussion. Yesterday was always better than today. Many will recognise this sentiment about today’s game where a “hard utilitarianism and commercialisation have far too long controlled it.” But that was written well over a hundred years ago by the essayist E.V. Lucas. The arguments And the arguments. Always the arguments. Not about the DRS or dodgy catches, but about who was better than whom, who should have played for India but didn’t and vice versa. A retired player gets better every year with every stroke he doesn’t play or ball he doesn’t bowl — the past is frozen in the mind on a period when a player was at his best (or worst). In Breath of Sadness , sportswriter Ian Ridley’s poignant book about watching cricket following the death of his wife, he says, “Cricket didn’t talk back to me and it didn’t offer advice, it didn’t tell me what to do nor how to feel, like a best friend, it was just there for me, willing to embrace me and allow me to just be, whatever mood I was in.” You choose how you want the game to treat you, and it always obliges. Without judging you. The playwright, Nobel laureate and cricket obsessive Harold Pinter once pointed out, “Drama happens in big cricket matches. But also in small cricket matches. When we play, my club, each thing that happens is dramatic: the gasps that follow a miss at slip, the anger of an lbw decision that is turned down. It is the same thing wherever you play, really.” This is an insight most fans don’t get. Every club player is capable of playing that one special stroke or bowling that one stunning delivery once or twice in a career. The top players have such moments closer together — perhaps in the same over. A report of a Viv Richards double century began with, “Richards got his eye in with the kind of strokes an average batsman never gets to play in a lifetime.” It said more than his biographies did. No substitute for the real thing And now it’s been a year. It’s like admitting that I haven’t had a bath or eaten for that long. The lay-off has merely reconfirmed something I have always believed: television is no substitute for the real thing. Sure, there’s slow motion replay, and fake sounds from a fake crowd. But notice how often the camera turns away discreetly when Virat Kohli begins to argue with an umpire or tells an opposition player just where he gets off? Kohli is not camera-shy but cameras turn Kohli-shy when the skipper threatens to cross a line. Technology doesn’t give you the whole picture, just what the authorities want you to see. I spent a large part of my growing years following my hero Gundappa Viswanath around the city at league matches. He did to local bowlers what he had done to Andy Roberts and Dennis Lillee and Derek Underwood. The local bowlers didn’t seem to mind, many thought it was an honour. More relaxed then Test cricketers turned out for their clubs, and were more relaxed then, happy to speak to fans, and seldom rude. In any case, Bengaluru was a small city, and you always knew someone who knew an international player and was willing to make the introduction. Missing a year of cricket-watching has reminded me of the kind of cricket-watching I miss too. Cricket has been at the forefront of my life: watching it, playing it, writing about it. No single view speaks for the sport. And that’s its beauty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/why-cricket-watching-is-not-just-about-watching-cricket/article34145834.ece
24 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Indian women bring cheer to the faithful with thumping win||India on Tuesday night came up with a performance as clinical as it could get. A pity it came a bit too late in the night. They may have scored the crushing nine-wicket victory in a dead rubber against South Africa, but the Women in Blue will cherish it for a while. As will the enthusiastic crowd at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium. The Indian fans not just got to see their team win in commanding fashion, but were treated to an exceptional spell of spin bowling and then some magnificent batting before the final game in the series ended well ahead of schedule. The Indians took just 11 overs to breeze past South Africa’s modest 112 for seven. Shafali Verma was the main reason for that. The 17-year-old opener smashed 60 off just 30 balls (7x4, 5x6) as she celebrated her return to the No. 1 spot in the ICC’s T20 batting rankings. If she massacred a South African attack that had troubled the Indian batting in the first two T20Is, and for much of the five ODIs before that, her captain played her role of the smiling assassin to perfection. When the left-handed stylist wasn’t doing that, she got to watch Shafali playing a memorably destructive innings, as the youngster danced down the track when she felt like it and swung her bat around to great effect. Shafali was unstoppable. She took 18 off the South African spearhead Shabnim Ismail in the first over of the innings, with three fours and a six. The pacer would go for 19 in her second over, this time Smriti doing most of the damage. The stand-in skipper remained unbeaten on 48 (28b, 9x4) and her stand with Shafali was worth 96. Earlier, left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad (three for nine) ensured the South African innings never got going. She cleaned up the openers Lizelle Lee and Anneke Bosch to reduce the visitors to 15 for two in the PowerPlay. South Africa never recovered. No batter got to 30, as the Indians bowled straight and fielded well. A little later, the Shafali-Smriti show got underway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-women-bring-cheer-to-the-faithful-with-thumping-win/article34145932.ece
24 March 2021||Dubai,||Stimac promises ample chances||India football coach Igor Stimac on Tuesday said the young players in the national side will be given ample chances to prove themselves at the international level as he looks to build a team for the future. The Indian team is currently training here ahead of the FIFA friendlies against Oman and UAE. The average age of the squad currently at the camp in Dubai is just over 24. Among them, 12 are below 25, and a couple of them are barely 19. “It’s fantastic to see guys at 19, 20, 21, 23 making it to the national squad. We are trying to build on the FIFA U-17 World Cup, and develop their knowledge,” Stimac said. Long process “We are trying to make sure that in the next four years they become ready to play against the best, and win against them. It’s a long process and it takes time.” India takes on Oman in Dubai on March 25 in the first of two international friendlies, with the second match against the UAE slated for March 29. “The young guns proved it in ISL this season. It’s now for them to prove at the international level. I will give them the chance to do so. No need for fear “What we are doing here is trying to make them relax, and explain to them that there is no reason for fear at the international level. They need to be themselves and prove to the world that they can play against the best.”    However, Stimac also said that “it’s a revolving door.” “You need to perform and get selected. Age is never a bar for anyone to be in the squad. If you are good enough, you are never old enough.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/stimac-promises-ample-chances/article34145966.ece
24 March 2021||Kolkata,||The race to the top begins||With just the last round of fixtures remaining, three teams — Gokulam Kerala FC, TRAU FC and Churchill Brothers — are in the running for the I-League crown this season. The title could very well be decided by the last kick of the championship, with two matches featuring the three sides set to to be held simultaneously on Saturday. Even the race for the league's top scorer award is tantalisingly poised as three front-runners will be in action at the same time on Saturday and just one goal separating them. Leading the charts is none other than TRAU FC's Bidyashagar Singh, who has 11 goals to his name so far.  He came roaring up the charts after striking the net a whopping nine times in four consecutive games — including back-to-back hat-tricks against Mohammedan Sporting and Real Kashmir — both of which came in the second phase of the tournament. Behind him are Churchill Brothers' Luka Majcen and Gokulam Kerala FC’s Dennis Antwi, with 10 goals each. Slovenian Majcen started off the campaign in a dazzling manner as he registered a brace in his first outing and has gone on to form a formidable pairing up top with Clayvin Zuniga. Ghana international Dennis Antwi has been in red-hot form in the championship phase of the competition, scoring six goals in four games and taking his team to the top of the table with one game to play. Only one Indian in I-League history has finished as the top goal-scorer — Sunil Chhetri, who scored 14 goals for Bengaluru FC in the 2013-14 season when his side went on to lift the trophy. Chhetri shared the top scorer award with Salgaocar’s Darryl Duffy, but should Bidyashagar maintain his lead at the top of the charts this season, he could become the first Indian forward to be the outright top scorer in any I-League campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-race-to-the-top-begins/article34146132.ece

24 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Suhair — NEUFC’s unsung hero||V.P. Suhair was one of the unsung heroes in NorthEast United FC’s mid-tournament resurgence in this season’s ISL. The 28-year-old, after struggling with injury at the start of the tournament, found his mojo under interim head coach Khalid Jamil. A natural striker, Suhair turned to winger and his work rate and mobility made him an automatic choice in the starting line-up. Suhair played 17 matches for NorthEast United which entered the playoffs for only the second time in its ISL history.  Though he scored only three goals and provided one assist, Suhair’s overall contribution in terms of crosses, passes and tackles made him a vital cog in the Highlander’s attack. “I joined NorthEast with the hope that I will get opportunity to play more matches in the ISL. Khalid Jamil was instrumental in getting me a contract. “He told me what my role was and gave me the freedom. I am happy I was able to play well under him,” said Suhair. “I think the key to our resurgence was the form and understanding shown by the Indian players. Almost all of us were recruited by Khalid sir. The foreign players pulled their weight behind us. We never gave up and fought till the end. We scored a few last minute goals and we were able to go undefeated for 10 matches,” said Suhair. Hometown hero Suhair’s exploits in the ISL has made him a hero in his home town, Edathanattukara, in Palakkad district. There was a public reception in his honour and people have only nice words to tell him. Suhair is savouring every moment of it and enjoying his place in the sun. National coach Igor Stimac also praised Suhair’s performance but didn’t pick him for the national camp. However, Suhair is not disappointed and is willing to wait for his chance. “My dream is to play for India. However, at present there are lot of guys who are playing as wingers and they are all better than me. “I still have to improve a lot and I am working hard on my game. And I think I will get my chance soon,’’ he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/suhair-neufcs-unsung-hero/article34146301.ece

24 March 2021||BENGALURU,||Chaos mars para athletics meet lead-up||The 19th National para athletics championship is set to begin here on Wednesday. Events will be held at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium and Vidyanagar Stadium over three days, and will see athletes from 27 States and Union Territories participate. Far from smooth But the lead-up has been far from smooth. The championship, which is a qualification event for Tokyo 2020, was initially scheduled to be held in Chennai, but was shifted at short notice, jeopardising athletes’ preparation. The Paralympic Committee of India (PCI), after initially asking athletes to make their own arrangements for accommodation, have seemingly acted now, promising hotels within 2km vicinity of the Kanteerava Stadium. “We had all reached Chennai and then forced to make plans again to reach Bengaluru,” said Nidhi Mishra, a 2018 Para Asian Games bronze medallist in discus throw. “It is not safe in these times of a pandemic. “Now I have received a message [about hotels being provided] and it is a big relief. But forget the extra money and time [we had to spend]. What about the mental stress? There can be no compensation for that.” Monetary loss Jeetu Sawant, another athlete, said that she incurred significant monetary loss in rescheduling her flights and the anxiety the whole episode caused was very much avoidable. Satyanarayana, the Bengaluru-based chairman of PCI’s Technical Committee, said that he had done as much as he could. “The shift was last minute because of elections in Tamil Nadu. But on Tuesday we decided to accommodate athletes within 2km of the Kanteerava stadium. We will also provide transport between venues and food. Private foundations have done arrangements for their athletes but we want to ensure that others aren’t left out. “We are also requesting athletes to not crowd the stadium, and leave immediately after their events because of COVID-19 protocols,” Satyanarayana added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chaos-mars-para-athletics-meet-lead-up/article34145968.ece

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Benefits of penance||Saint Thirumoolar acknowledges in his Thirumandiram that Lord Siva revealed to him the Saiva agamas. Having acquired knowledge of these sacred texts, Thirumoolar visited Chidambaram, where Siva as Lord Nataraja is seen doing His Cosmic dance. Having witnessed this divine dance, Thirumoolar no longer wanted to inhabit a human body, said R. Narayanan in a discourse. And yet he remained in the human body. Everyone in this world must see the Lord’s dance in Chidambaram, says Thirumoolar. Thirumoolar had done tapas for a long time, and as a result, he was blessed with longevity. However, his inclination was to quit this world and be with Lord Siva. With such an ardent desire to be with the Lord, every day he spent on the earth seemed like a yuga to the saint. Thirumoolar was a jnani, and naturally, his desire was to exit the world. He says he lived for one crore yugas. Sekkizhar, in his Peria Puranam, which details the lives of the sixty-three Saivite saints, says Thirumoolar lived for three thousand years. But this should be taken to mean that he lived for many years. A literal interpretation must not be given to these words. In his Thirumandiram, Thirumoolar explains to one of his students the reason for his long life on earth. The student is called Indra, and Thirumoolar tells him that he (Thirumoolar) served Goddess Sakthi. She is the Goddess of the Universe, and She has ensured that he lives long. It is penance which destroys one’s enemies and saves devotees. Tapas governs the world. Here Thirumoolar personifies tapas as a divine being, and shows the benefits of doing penance. Thus, Thirumoolar explains that while he was disinclined to dwell in a human body, his penance extended his life span on earth. To be with Lord Siva was what he wanted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/benefits-of-penance/article34145926.ece

24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||In the spotlight||It was not overnight stardom, but Arjun Mathur did make heads turn playing Karan Mehra in the Amazon Prime web series Made in Heaven ; so much so that the actor says he is now busy with “back-to-back projects until August” of this year. The list includes a second season of Made in Heaven . “The quality of offers [coming my way] has improved. There are filmmakers who now ‘want’ to work with me. I’m aware that I am entering a new phase in my career, and it is exciting,” he says, over phone from Mumbai. Up next for Arjun is the ZEE5 film starring Manoj Bajpayee, Silence... Can You Hear It? A thriller written and directed by Aban Bharucha Deohans, Arjun plays Ravi Khanna, who he describes as “a suave politician with shades of grey”. Bajpayee is the cop investigating the death of a young woman. Edited excerpts: Tell us about playing a politician in Silence... Can You Hear It?  Every thriller will have a character like Ravi Khanna, someone whom you can’t tell if he is lying or speaking the truth, or if he is operating with an agenda. For me, it is different from the characters I have played before. I have this image of playing ‘clean, good boy’ roles. Ravi Khanna turns that notion on its head. Working with Manoj Bajpayee must have been a rewarding experience for an up-and-coming actor like you...  I have been a fan of Manoj since Satya . It was interesting to go toe-to-toe with an actor of his stature and skill. It was a brilliant experience on set, it is rare to see someone of such immense standing be so down-to-earth and welcoming. He takes the responsibility of creating a comfort level with his co-actors and the crew. Was the experience of working with big stars different post the success of Made in Heaven ?  The experiences that weren’t too enjoyable were in big star vehicles where I was used as an embellishment. I didn’t enjoy it. I learnt quickly when I saw that this was what the industry was doing to me. I immediately shifted focus and started working in indie projects that gave me the opportunity to work with skilled actors, and not those with over-inflated egos. I worked with actors who you can connect with and have some sort of an exchange instead of just standing behind a star. That said, I have no regrets. There is a learning in every experience. What are your upcoming projects?  I am filming for Made in Heaven: Season 2 till July. I am also committed to The Gone Game: Season 2 and there is another web series that has not been officially announced. 2021 is going to be a big year! It appears you are claiming space on streaming platforms. Do you suppose quality of content is better in streaming than in mainstream cinema?  Definitely. The quality is far better than anything mainstream cinema is offering at this point. That is because on these platforms, we are competing for eye balls with cutting-edge content from the world over. That forces everybody to pull up their socks. A lot of our mainstream cinema still caters to the lowest common denominator, for lack of a better word. But in streaming platforms now, there is a possibility to do the kind of work that is different from what we have seen in the last few decades. How do you prepare for your roles?  I’m an instinctive actor. I don’t over prepare. Say, if I have to physically change myself or alter my vocal quality, things that will need training, I would do that... but otherwise, I am someone who depends a lot on the conversations I have with my director and the script reading sessions with co-actors. My main preparation is the first reactions I have to the script and characters. I try to hold on to that first instinctive feeling that I get when I read something or learn about my character, and I retain it throughout the shoot. My preparation essentially is to leave myself open and vulnerable to the stimulus, so when it comes my way I am able to react as truthfully as possible.   I’m an instinctive actor. I don’t over prepare. I depend a lot on conversations I have with my director and the script reading sessions with co-actors Arjun Mathur||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/in-the-spotlight/article34146363.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Just for thrills||Director Sajit Warrier’s web series Chakravyuh — An Inspector Virkar Crime Thriller that has been streaming on MX Player from March 12, pitches the old world against the new digital age. Shot in posh South Mumbai, including trippy underground clubs, the series resonates with the youth, capturing their joys and inner struggles. Based on Piyush Jha’s novel, Anti-Social Network , the cyber crime series is packed with twists and turns, says the director. Prateik Babbar essays the lead role. Excerpts from an interview: Was Prateik Babbar the first choice as lead in Chakravyuh?  Prateik Babbar was always our first choice. He has an intensity in his eyes, which was perfect for this part.... This is rarely tapped and it was such a pleasure to work with him. From physically transforming himself for this role to creating a character with a lot of pent up fury, this was very challenging and he just rocked it totally.  Could you narrate your experience shooting for the series ?  The most wonderful aspect was that everyone really connected with the story. Applause Entertainment believed in this story and we had a wonderful cast and crew. It was an overall team effort nd I am so happy I could work with all of them. Your previous projects, Fired and Trial of Satyam Kaushik, were also thrillers. What attracts you to thrillers?  I remember the first movie I saw as a child was this wonderful mystery thriller Picnic At The Hanging Rock by Peter Weir. I think it affected me so much that I am totally drawn to mystery and thrills. Horror and comedy are the other two genres which I get immense satisfaction from.   As founder of Warrier Films, c ould you describe your journey?   I started as a fine arts student in Vadodara and then moved to screenwriting and directing at UCLA, Los Angeles, where I worked with some really talented filmmakers in Hollywood. When I arrived in Mumbai, I set up Warrier Films and we just enjoyed doing branding and animations for MTV VH1 and other channels. Storytelling and experimenting in the visual medium began with short films and video art. I think there’s so much opportunity in the visual medium that it’s a great time to try out different genres and have a unique stylistic approach. For me, storytelling as a visual experience is an endless ride. This is just the beginning. You are a director, writer and an editor. What role do you identify with the most? For me, filmmaking is the ultimate visual art. As a director, I bring in a vision which I feel is unique and that’s what I identify with most. I think as a director, my strength is to keep an audience engrossed in the storyviewing process. The social experience of keeping an audience engaged in a dark theatre is what makes me want to enhance my directing approach. With the entry of OTT platforms, the canvas has widened for young filmmakers who want to experiment with the medium.  It is with the advent of OTT platforms that I am able to tell my stories. I have been in innumerable meetings where people have told me “The story is a little too out there”. Well this medium is all about being out there and telling stories and characters, which have a unique perspective. Stories are being attempted, which would have never been tried before. Also we can attempt stories in budgets that would not have worked before. Even COVID-19 quarantine has helped build this habit of binge watching in audiences. There’s no fatigue for watching content now, which should help us try unique stories. So these are exciting times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/just-for-thrills/article34146367.ece
24 March 2021||March 24 2021 00:00 IST,||Art through humour and satire||Art need not always be pensive. Humour and satire can also be effective tools to make viewers engage with a piece of art. Hyderabad’s Shrishti Art Gallery’s annual show ‘Licence to Laugh’ features works of Chitra Ganesh, Smruthi Gargi Eswar, Thukral and Tagra, Gurjeet Singh and others. There are paintings, sculptures and works of art that double up as board games and puzzles. For instance, Thukral and Tagra’s ‘Walk of Life’ is a board game inspired by the traditional Indian card game ganjifa , which was played with 120 cards. ‘Walk of Life’ is a game journey through the 10 avatars of Vishnu, the Dashavatars, and players are challenged to equalise their debts and deeds of bad karma with that of good karma. A handbook details instructions for the game, and a face of each die is named Good Karma or Bad Karma. Verbal Kabaddi, also by Thukral and Tagra, is a collection of tongue twisters commenting on happenings around us. Players in this game have to read aloud the tongue twisters in a single breath and collect ‘stamps of sincerity’ as reward points. Sample these lines:  ‘Climate change changes fire to ice,   surges sea surface to rise   sights site of sliced   sails on sapien’s vice’  Or  ‘Arbitrary amendment   Act arouses aggression   against authoritarian   accession’.  Adjacent to the puzzle are Tushar Waghela’s cheerful, bright frames with the cartoon character Bugs Bunny and smiley faces, that lend a childlike, joyous touch to an otherwise crumbling world. One of the paintings asserts “Don’t grow up, it’s a trap”. Curator Lina Vincent, who worked in tandem with Shrishti’s Lakshmi Nambiar for the show, is hopeful that the interactive exhibition will make viewers pause and reflect even as they chuckle a bit. With the long-drawn pandemic creating a sombre mood everywhere, the idea was to moot a show with comic book elements, to explore art through multiple layers of humour and satire. “Humour is complex and subjective. We went back and forth, discussing the concept with the artists to see how they would respond,” says Lina. The results were varied, with a mix of new and previously existing art works being chosen for display. Smruthi Gargi Eswar’s Princess Pea series has a dadi doll as a standalone sculpture and in paintings, taking centrestage at the farmers’ protest. This is a place where traditional gender roles get reversed. The grandmother is on the stage addressing gatherings, while the men cook and feed. Gurjeet Singh uses an amalgamation of fabric and embroidery techniques to explore feminity. In Chitra Ganesh’s paintings, past, present and future come together with a mix of mythology and astronomy. And Farhad Hussain transforms slice-of-life moments into animated figures, for instance, caught in the midst of laughter, compelling viewers to wonder what would have happened prior or after an incident.  ‘Licence to Laugh’ is open for public viewing at Shrishti Art Gallery, Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad, till June 13, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/art-through-humour-and-satire/article34146371.ece

24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Singhu roars again on Shaheed Diwas||Shaheed Diwas brought back the lost cheer and spirit at the Singhu protest site on Tuesday. People, especially youth, reached the Delhi borders to participate in the agitation to mark the martyrdom of the freedom fighters. Three huge photographs of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev adorned the main stage at the protest site. The crowd wore yellow, orange and green pagdis . A call was given in Punjab and Haryana villages for the youth to join the protest. “All those wearing yellow pagdis signify youth. This whole protest is essentially for them and their present and future,” said a member of the stage management committee. Soil collection Soil collected from various historical places — revolutionary Kartar Singh Sarabha’s village Sarabha, Bhagat Singh’s village Khatkar Kalan, Hussainiwala Border, Anandpur Sahib, revolutionary Udham Singh’s village Sunam, Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, and Sirhind — was also kept on the stage. It was collected by youth and student organisations and brought to Singhu and Tikri borders. Tractor shows and several langars which had lately vanished also came alive. ‘Govt. will have to bend’ Women also gathered at the Singhu border on Tuesday said that no matter what happens, they’ll continue to protest. Preeti (23), from Haryana’s Sonipat who had come with a group of women, said that the government will have no other option but to bend. A 22-year-old fashion designer from a private college, a resident of Delhi, said that she has spent the last one month here as part of the exam on human rights, she recently wrote. “I have conducted a deep study here and it is not Punjabis here, there are people from across States and all walks of life — those who believe in the cause,” she said. Two wheelchair-bound men also came to Singhu from Fatehgarh Sahib to join the protest. Lakhwinder Singh who has been on the wheelchair since 2015, said that he belongs to a labour family and there has been a growing anger over the farmers’ issue. “Shaheed Bhagat Singh has taught to fight for our rights at all costs and that’s what we are doing,” said Rao Varinder Singh who has been on the wheelchair for the last 10 years, following an accident in the fields. ‘Fighting our people’ Drawing the crowds, Punjabi singer Ravinder Garewal sang for nearly two hours. He said, “Shaheed Bhagat Singh did not know that we’ll have to fight our own people for the freedom, and our own people will become like the British. People ask me about the dwindling numbers at the protest site, and I tell them that this is not the only protest happening. There’s a protest inside every household,” he said. However, those managing the protest also realise that the spirit seems to be going down. “Strategy needs to change. This cold wave cannot continue and is not good for the protest,” said a committee member.  Shaheed Bhagat Singh has taught us to fight for our rights at all costs and that’s what we are doing   Rao Varinder Singh Protester||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/singhu-roars-again-on-shaheed-diwas/article34146159.ece
24 March 2021||BOKAKHAT (ASSAM),||Rhinos stray into Assam poll rhetoric||The one-horned rhino appears to have strayed into Assam’s poll rhetoric. Assam has an estimated 2,640 rhinos in four protected areas. About 2,400 of them in the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) have become an issue for 23.19 lakh voters, more specifically for more than 3 lakh voters across six Assembly constituencies that straddle the World Heritage Site. Among the achievements that the BJP has listed is having checked rhino poaching in the State. Records with the State Forest Department say poaching has reduced by 86% in the last three years. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the booth level party worker, almost every BJP leader has been wearing the “conservation success” like a badge. ‘Poaching stopped’ “No government before us took on the poachers like we did, putting many of them behind bars and instilling fear in them. We have also taken unprecedented steps to clear Kaziranga and other wildlife habitats of encroachers,” Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said. The encroachers are often equated with “illegal immigrants” or “Bangladeshis”. But the anti-poaching and anti-encroachment drives have affected ally Asom Gana Parishad more than “big brother” BJP. Bokakhat and Kaliabor, the two adjoining constituencies that cover much of the KNPTR that has expanded to 1,300 sq km, are represented by the AGP’s heavyweights – party president and Agriculture Minister Atul Bora and Water Resources Minister Keshab Mahanta. Mr. Bora is apparently feeling the heat more than Mr. Mahanta. Apart from the responsibility of saving the space of regionalism in the State from the Assam Jatiya Parishad, a new political party, his prime challenger is 35-year-old activist Pranab Doley who believes conserving rhinos cannot be at the cost of the lives of local people. A founding member of the Jeepal Krishak Sramik Sangha, a mass organisation that has been leading land and farmers’ rights movements in the Kaziranga area, Mr. Doley is an independent candidate backed by the Congress-led Mahajot or grand alliance. “I have been fighting for justice for the families of over 50 people gunned down since a shoot-at-sight policy adopted by the Kaziranga authorities in 2008. They were killed in cold blood in the name of rhino conservation and the killings were never investigated,” he told The Hindu . Mr. Doley also dismissed the claims that the park authorities evicted encroachers. “Why do they compensate people then? They keep adding swathes of land to the park and tagging people living there as Bangladeshis. Most are our own people. Conservation cannot be at the expense of the local people who have known how to coexist with animals for ages,” he said. ‘Eviction on court order’ KNPTR Director P. Sivakumar declined to speak citing poll restrictions, but an official said the evictions were carried out on the orders of the Gauhati High Court and the squatters multiplied after areas were added to the park four decades ago. “I have never interfered in the conservation efforts in Kaziranga because we care about ecology. But at the same time, the people matter too,” Mr. Bora said, confident of retaining Bokakhat where the KNPTR’s headquarters is located. The AGP and the BJP supporters believe a slew of developmental projects would see Mr. Bora through, but those behind the Mahajot believe Mr. Doley could spring a surprise. So do the supporters of Jiten Gogoi, another independent candidate who had won the seat twice before Mr. Bora and claimed to be the “king of Kaziranga”. There are eight other contestants for the key seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rhinos-stray-into-assam-poll-rhetoric/article34146151.ece
24 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||V-C will continue to hold office till successor is appointed: JNU||Responding to allegations made by the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) on the conduct of the Academic Council meeting by “interim administrator” Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar, the administration said that according to the JNU Act and its statutes, there is no nomenclature as “caretaker V-C”, “officiating V-C” and “interim administrator” as it clearly states that the V-C will continue to hold office until his successor is appointed. It said that it strongly condemns the “downright falsehood and malicious propaganda” being spread by a “small section” of faculty member of JNU about the conduct of the Academic Council meeting on Monday. Damaging reputation “These faculty members seem to be only interested in damaging the reputation and public image of JNU by spreading stories about the conduct of the Academic Council meeting and decisions taken in it. During the meeting, a large number of council members from assistant professors to senior professors and deans of schools, participated in the deliberations in a very democratic and enthusiastic manner and arrived at the decisions,” the varsity said. The JNUTA has alleged that Mr. Kumar had allowed only select members to speak and had questioned if the “interim administrator” had the power to conduct meetings deciding the future of the university. JNU Registrar Anirban Chakraborti said that the Academic Council meeting was held in a “very cordial and positive atmosphere with an attendance exceeding 100 members” and said many important decisions were taken at the meeting. The council resolved to conduct the JNU entrance examination 2020-2021 in collaboration with the National Testing Agency (NTA) and that the university will admit students through the Central Universities Common Entrance Test whenever the NTA decides to conduct it, he said. “The council decided to start a new MA programme in Hindi translation in the Centre of Indian Languages, School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies. The council also approved granting of recognition to Arun Jaitley National Institute of Financial and Management Faridabad, to award PG Diploma in Management [Finance] and PG Diploma Management [Financial Management],” the Registrar said. The Centre had permitted Mr. Kumar to continue at the university, after the expiry of his term on January 26, till a successor is appointed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/v-c-will-continue-to-hold-office-till-successor-is-appointed-jnu/article34146157.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||Unable to identify personnel who rounded up youth, police tell HC||The Delhi police has informed the Delhi High Court that it has not been able to identify the officers who were seen in a viral video rounding up five Muslim youth and forcing them to sing the national anthem on February 24 last year. The police made the statement in response to a petition filed by a 61-year-old Kismatun seeking constitution of a court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into the alleged custodial death of her son Faizan (23), who was last seen in the viral video. Ms. Kismatun alleged that “the policemen kicked the five Muslim men with their boots, beat them and prodded them with their lathis and taunted them saying, ‘ Ye lo azaadi [Here, take freedom]’, and forced them to sing the national anthem while they were lying down, helpless in a grievously wounded condition”. In a report filed before the court, the agency said it has taken on record four video clippings related to the incident. In the clips, persons in police uniform are seen assaulting Faizan and four others — Farhan, Kauser, Rafique and Wasim. The police said that three clips are distantly shot videos in which the pictures of these persons are blurred and are not recognisable as they are wearing helmets and other safety gadgets except one person who is seen without a helmet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/unable-to-identify-personnel-who-rounded-up-youth-police-tell-hc/article34146152.ece
24 March 2021||New Delhi,||HC grants protection to interfaith couple after mob attack||The Delhi High Court Tuesday granted police protection to an interfaith couple, who got married recently and fear for their life after their house was attacked by a mob on March 20. Justice Anu Malhotra directed the police to file a status report in the case and listed the matter for further hearing on April 6. The High Court was hearing the petition by the couple, who were also present, urging the court to provide police protection to them and the man’s family as after the attack they feel unsafe in their locality. They sought direction that Rapid Action Force be deployed in the sensitive area to ensure that the situation should not erupt into a communal riot. Own free will Advocate Monika Arora, representing the couple, said the man and the woman are consenting adults and got married of their own free will and their house was attacked by a mob of around 50 people. The counsel also showed photographs of injured persons, who received stab injured in the attack. “CCTV footage of the area shows the mob entering the narrow lanes and breaking pots and coolers, pelting stones and banging doors to threaten petitioner no. 2 (man), his family and neighbours while people could be heard screaming from inside. Another video shows damaged bikes and cycles lying on the street,” said the petition, filed through advocates Manish Kumar, Akaksh Vajpai, Riddhima Gaur and Archit Vasudev. The plea said the petitioner woman is an adult and is free to take her decisions and her family should not harass her just because she married a man from another community. Ms. Arora submitted before the court that houses of Dalits were attacked and casteist slurs were made by the mob but the police has not invoked the provisions of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in the FIR. Advocate Nandita Rao, representing the police, said the relevant provisions of the SC/ST Act have been invoked in the case and an officer of ACP level is investigating the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-grants-cover-to-interfaith-couple-after-attack/article34146163.ece

24 March 2021||Lumding/Hojai (Assam),||‘BJP govt. will not allow infiltrators to enter Assam’||Appealing not to indulge in politics over illegal immigration, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the BJP, if voted to power, will not allow Bangladeshi infiltrators to enter Assam at any cost. Addressing an election rally here, Mr. Singh said the BJP government has started electronic surveillance across the Indo-Bangla border in Assam to stop infiltration from the neighbouring country. “We will not allow Bangladeshi infiltrators to enter Assam at any cost...We will not allow politics over illegal immigration problem,” he said. Mr. Singh added that the BJP has governments in Assam and Tripura, and it will come to power in West Bengal this time, and then the infiltration problem from Bangladesh through these three States will be solved. He said misinformation is being spread by the Opposition that the BJP is attacking and destroying the civilisation, culture and identity of Assam. “If we had any bad intention, we would have not conferred Bharat Ratna on Dr. Bhupen Hazarika. We respect Assamese culture.” The Defence Minister also said that misinformation is being spread regarding the BJP’s role in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Talking about the perennial flood problem, Mr. Singh said the BJP government, once it is back to power again, will do everything possible in this regard and make Assam a ‘flood-free’ State. Mr. Singh said the Congress could have made Assam among the top States in India had the party ‘even partially’ fulfilled its election promises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-govt-will-not-allow-infiltrators-to-enter-assam/article34146149.ece
