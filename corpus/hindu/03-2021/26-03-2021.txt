26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Why no decision on list sent by Collegium, SC asks government||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the government to clarify on the status of 55 recommendations made by the Collegium for judicial appointments to High Courts six months to nearly a year-and-a-half ago. Of the pending recommendations, 44 were made to fill vacancies in the Calcutta, Madhya Pradesh, Gauhati, Rajasthan and Punjab High Courts. These recommendations have been pending with the government for over seven months to a year. The remaining 10 names have been pending with the government despite their reiteration by the Collegium. They include five for the Calcutta High Court pending for one year and seven months. The recommendations of four names made by the Collegium to the Delhi High Court have been pending for seven months. ‘Grave concern’ “This is a matter of grave concern... When do you propose to take a decision?” a Special Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, asked Attorney General K.K. Venugopal. The total sanctioned strength in the 25 High Courts is 1,080. However, the present working strength is 661 with 419 vacancies as on March 1. The court asked Mr. Venugopal to enquire with the Union Ministry of Law and Justice and make a statement on April 8 about their status. The Bench handed over to Mr. Venugopal a chart containing the details of the 55 recommendations. Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said on the 10 recommendations, some of which date back to a year-and-a-half, that “neither have they been appointed nor have you (government) given us a response”. Justice Kaul, who was accompanying the Chief Justice and Justice Surya Kant, said the “thought process” of both the government and the Collegium should be modulated. He said a time frame needed to be fixed for both the Collegium and the Ministry to complete the appointment process. Bar Association plea Senior advocate and who is the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association Vikas Singh said there was a need to institutionalise a process for considering advocates practising in the top courts to judgeships in the High Courts. “There should be an institutional basis for considering names from the Supreme Court Bar, rather considering them on an ad hoc basis. It should be done as a rule and not as an exception,” he said. Chief Justice Bobde said the court was in complete agreement with Mr. Singh’s sentiments. The CJI said the problem may be that “in some States, the Bar Associations call these advocates as outsiders”. Mr. Singh said this was not the case and Supreme Court advocates, too, should come within the zone of consideration of the Collegium for HC judgeships. The Bench said it would take up this matter on April 8. The total sanctioned judicial strength in the 25 High Courts is 1,080. However, the present working strength is 661 with 419 vacancies as on March 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/why-no-decision-on-list-sent-by-collegium-sc-asks-government/article34165556.ece
26 March 2021||MANGALURU,||Lorry driver charred to death||A driver of a container lorry was charred to death in a collision between the lorry and a private bus in Mannagundi of Kadaba Koukradi village near Nellyadi, on National Highway 75, a little after midnight on Wednesday. The Uppinangady Police gave the name of the deceased as Santosh (26) from Nanjangud taluk of Mysuru district. He was driving the container lorry filled with vegetables to Mangaluru from Bengaluru. The private sleeper bus that belonged to Sri Durga Travels was going towards Bengaluru from Kundapur. At around midnight on Wednesday, the two vehicles collided and a fire broke out. The driver of the bus and the 23 passengers managed to come out of the bus in time. “The lorry driver, however, got caught and was charred to death,” said Superintendent of Police B.M. Laxmi Prasad. Haneef, cleaner of the lorry, was injured. He was admitted to a nearby hospital. A few among the 23 bus passengers suffered minor injuries, he said. Mr. Prasad said that it appears a leakage in the CNG fuel tank of the lorry resulted in the fire. The Transport Department has been asked to submit a report about the cause of fire, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lorry-driver-charred-to-death-in-dakshina-kannada/article34166119.ece
26 March 2021||KURNOOL,||Jagan inaugurates Kurnool airport||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday inaugurated the Kurnool Airport at Orvakal and dedicated it to the nation. This will be the sixth functional airport of Andhra Pradesh when the flight services to Bengaluru, Chennai, and Visakhapatnam begin on March 28. At a public meeting after the inaugural function, Mr. Jagan announced that the airport would be named after a freedom fighter from the region, Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy, whose death anniversary was on February 22. Prior to inaugurating the airport, the Chief Minister hoisted a national flag on a tall flag pole in front of the airport building. Mr. Jagan also unveiled the bust of his father and former chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy at the entrance of the terminal building. He said his predecessor had hurriedly opened the airport without any DGCA permissions and several pending works, but, “Our government completed all the pending works at a cost of Rs. 110 crore and fast-tracked the project to make it functional in all aspects within one and a half years.” Mr. Jagan thanked the people for giving the party a massive victory in both the panchayat and urban local body elections. “We are moving ahead with our aim of making Kurnool the Judicial Capital of the State and this airport will serve as a good asset,” Mr. Jagan said amid cheers from a large crowd. The Chief Minister inspected the passenger amenities at the airport and later interacted with the airport staff. He took a group photo with the staff in front of the passenger terminal. Initially, the airport will handle six incoming and outgoing IndiGo flights between 10.10 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. from and to Bengaluru, Visakhapatnam, and Chennai. The airport has space to park four aircraft and it can handle ATR-72 and Bombardier Q-400 aircraft. Panyam MLA K. Ram Bhupal Reddy requested the Chief Minister to sanction the development of Mallikarjuna Swamy Reservoir in the constituency. District Collector G. Veerapandian, SP Fakkeerappa Kaginelli, Hindupur MP G. Madhav, Minister G. Jayaram, and Kurnool MLA Hafeez welcomed the Chief Minister on the tarmac.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/jagan-inaugurates-kurnool-airport/article34165477.ece
26 March 2021||CHENNAI,||HC to hear DMK’s plea today||The DMK on Thursday complained to the Madras High Court against the collection of postal votes from ‘absentee voters’ even before a list of such voters could be provided to recognised political parties. Absentee voters include those aged above 80, people with disabilities, persons employed in essential services and COVID-19 patients, who have chosen to vote through postal ballot. Making a mention before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, senior counsel R. Shunmugasundaram and R. Viduhthalai said the court on March 16 directed the Election Commission to furnish ‘absentee voters’ list to all political parties before March 29. However, even before the order could be complied with, the collection of postal votes had begun in Chennai and will soon begin in Vellore, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts, they said. The Chief Justice asked the counsel to file appropriate petitions in that regard and agreed to hear them on Friday. Immediately, DMK’s organisation secretary R.S. Bharathi filed two writ petitions. One of them sought to restrain the EC from commencing collection of postal votes before issuing a list of absentee voters to political parties and another insisted upon permitting representatives of candidates to affix their signatures on the cover of the postal ballots. The petitioner stated that affixing such signatures would help in preventing malpractice with postal ballots. According to the litigant, the Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner had given an interview to the media on Wednesday stating that collection of postal votes from absentee voters would begin on Thursday and get completed by March 31 and that 70 teams had been formed to collect those votes. Wondering how collection could commence without providing a list of such voters to the political parties, he said complaints in this regard had been made to the Returning Officers concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-to-hear-dmks-appeal-over-postal-ballots-today/article34166164.ece

26 March 2021||MANGALURU,||217 new cases in twin districts||With continued surge in new COVID-19 cases, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada reported a total of 217 positive cases on Thursday. Of the 145 cases from Udupi, 111 cases were reported from the Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT) campus. With 18 patients being discharged, the number of active cases in Udupi touched 605. In a statement, Udupi District Health and Family Welfare Officer Sudhirchandra Sooda said that of the 145 cases, 123 were from Udupi taluk, 16 from Kundapur taluk and six from Byndoor. As many as 109 of these patients were asymptomatic, while the remaining [36] were symptomatic. He said that a total of 21,502 throat and nasal swabs have been tested since March 15 when the surge in cases was noticed. Of this, 3,669 swabs have been tested on MIT campus alone and the total number of new cases detected on MIT campus has now touched 586. The positivity rate in Udupi district is 4.88%, he said. A fine of Rs. 25.75 lakh has so far been collected in 24,164 cases of people not wearing masks and violating social distancing norms, said a bulletin from the Udupi district administration. Meanwhile, 72 new cases were reported and 61 patients discharged in Dakshina Kannada on Thursday. The number of active cases in Dakshina Kannada rose to 573. A fine of Rs. 38.97 lakh has so far been collected in 37,840 cases of people not wearing of masks. In the light of nine cases reported in Mangalore University so far, Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya has decided to suspend classes on the university campus for seven days. This has been done to prevent further spread of COVID-19 on campus, Mr. Yadapadithaya told The Hindu . Dakshina Kannaada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra, in a meeting with officials on Thursday, said that there will be zero tolerance to people not wearing masks and violating social distancing norms. Fines will be imposed on violators. Calling upon people to strictly follow the safety protocol, Dr. Rajendra asked vulnerable people to voluntarily come for vaccination at nearby health centres. All those serving in petrol bunks, shops, community halls, medical shops and other public places should compulsorily wear masks. Hotels and restaurants should have thermal screening facility, he said. As COVID-19 spreads quickly at places with centralised air conditioning system, Dr. Rajendra said that people should not gather in big numbers at such places. Hotels and other firms employing personnel from Kerala should ensure that their personnel undergo regular RT-PCR test. Lodges should maintain a register with details of those coming from outside the district, Dr. Rajendra said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/217-new-cases-in-twin-districts/article34166292.ece

Subhash has served notice on Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who is contesting the Assembly elections from the Dharmadam constituency, for allegedly violating the election model code of conduct. The Collector, who is also the District Election Officer, served the notice on Thursday following a complaint. The complainant, C.P.

26 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Voting via postal ballots begins in Tamil Nadu||The postal voting for electors aged above 80 is under way in various Assembly constituencies of Tamil Nadu. As on March 22, 12-D forms (seeking postal ballots) had been received by the Returning Officers from over 1.49 lakh elderly electors. This is the first time certain sections of the public in the State are allowed to cast postal ballots. Earlier, only service voters and those drafted for election work were allowed the facility. Different dates Speaking to The Hindu , Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo said the date on which election officials would visit the homes of such elderly voters would not be the same across the State. “It would depend on the respective Returning Officers, the number of such electors, their availability, police personnel and video teams.” “If a Returning Officer has satisfied all the requirements needed for undertaking the postal ballot voting, he/she can commence,” he said. An Assistant Returning Officer would be assigned to handle all the work related to postal ballot voting by absentee voters.  No agent present On Thursday, a team of officials visited the homes of those who had submitted 12-D forms in various parts of Ambattur and received their ballots in a postal ballot box. After fulfilling the procedure, the electors were handed ballot sheets, and they were offered privacy for a few minutes to affix a tick against the candidate of their choice. No agent of any political party was present. However, in some cases, spouses were seen along with the electors while they were casting the ballots. “Every elector would be provided with a list of candidates for reference before casting his/her postal ballot,” Mr. Sahoo said. All the forms and postal ballots are enclosed in envelopes before they are received in the postal ballot box. Besides elderly electors, 12-D forms were also received from over 45,300 persons who are differently abled. All 234 Assembly constituencies in Tamil Nadu will go to the polls on April 6, and the counting is scheduled for May 2. The schedule is the same for the byelection to the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/voting-via-postal-ballots-begins-in-tn/article34165591.ece
26 March 2021||Agartala,||Bedlam in Tripura Assembly over charge against Minister||The Tripura Assembly on Thursday witnessed pandemonium and two adjournments after the Opposition Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) members sought a high-level investigation into allegations that the State’s Forest Minister Mevar Kumar Jamatia had sought allotment of a large expanse of forest land in his name. The Minister rejected the allegations outright and announced that he would step down if he had flouted the law at any level. Newspaper report Deputy Leader of the Opposition and former minister Badal Choudhury raised the issue after the Question Hour, citing a report published in a local vernacular newspaper. The report said that Mr. Jamatia, also the general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party’s ally Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), had last year sought the allotment of 50 acres of land from within limits of reserved forests in the Teleiamura subdivision of Khowai district. The newspaper report was based on an official communication between Khowai District Magistrate and Collector Smitha Mol and Special Secretary to the Revenue Department. The district magistrate sought legal opinion over prayer for such allotment as the “Collector is authorised to allot land for agriculture purpose only to any person who is economically poor and will cultivate the land by himself or for homestead purpose to a person not owning any house and who intends to build the house for personal habitation.”  ‘Clarity needed’ The District Magistrate further wrote: “Before granting allotment in his (Mevar Kumar Jamatia) favour clarity is required regarding its legality.” All CPI(M) legislators except Leader of Opposition Manik Sarkar rushed to the well of the House to demand a high level probe into the whole case. The Speaker adjourned the House twice amid chaos on the last day of the Budget session.  No violation Responding to the allegations, Mr. Jamatia said he was ready to face any investigation and if found wrong he would step down. He strongly claimed that there was no violation of rule and law in the whole matter. Mr. Jamatia later challenged opposition CPI(M) leaders to prove the allegations against him within 24 hours else he would resort to legal action against them. He said the charge was politically motivated to tarnish his image and that of his party — IPFT —ahead of elections to the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council slated for April 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bedlam-in-tripura-assembly-over-charge-against-minister/article34165801.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Belagavi bypolls: Suresh Angadi’s wife, Mangala, gets BJP ticket||The Bharatiya Janata Party announced its candidates for the upcoming bypolls, on Thursday night. The party has let go off its opposition to dynastic politics and fielded Mangala Suresh Angadi, wife of the late Union Minister Suresh Angadi for the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency, raising eyebrows.   The possibility of a senior leader Satish Jarkiholi contesting the bypolls — necessitated by the death of Suresh Angadi due to COVID-19 in September 2020 — forced the BJP that did not have a strong candidate to bank on the sympathy wave for the Angadi's family, sources in the party said. Principled stand It may be recalled that Tejaswini Ananth Kumar was denied the ticket from Bengaluru South constituency in the 2019 parliamentary elections on the grounds that the party had taken a principled stand against dynastic politics and had instead fielded Tejasvi Surya. Also, the choice of Suresh Angadi’s wife as the candidate is being seen as an effort by the party to focus on its cadre rather than parallel entries from other parties in Belagavi, especially in the wake of the CD scandal involving the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi who has a dominant presence in Belagavi. The party has expectedly given the ticket to defector Pratapgouda Patil from the Maski Assembly segment. The bypolls to this Assembly segment was pending as the election of Mr. Patil in 2018 was legally challenged. The BJP has fielded Sharanu Salagar, a Lingayat leader from Kalaburagi, from the Basavakalyan Assembly seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/belagavi-bypolls-suresh-angadis-wife-mangala-gets-bjp-ticket/article34165729.ece
26 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Modi insecure about Kejriwal’s popularity’||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of doing “negative politics” and said he is “insecure” about Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s growing popularity. Mr. Sisodia made the comments while attacking the Prime Minister and the BJP over passing the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in Parliament. “The Bill the Central government passed yesterday (Wednesday) shows that Modi ji ’s government is insecure about Arvind Kejriwal and his work. This Bill has been brought to stop Kejriwal from going forward,” the AAP leader said. “Modi ji is doing negative politics to stop good governance. He is worried about Kejriwal and had to bring a law to stop Delhi’s development,” he said. ‘Exploring all options’ Mr. Sisodia said they are exploring all options and also talking to legal experts about how to tackle the Bill. “We know that at present, the nation and the world is talking about the Arvind Kejriwal model of governance and its diverse schemes. People feel that they have a choice to vote for someone who actually works for them. This is exactly what is making the BJP-led Central government insecure,” the Deputy Chief Minister said. “Prime Minister Modi is acting like a roadblock in the politics of good work, in the progress of our nation. The Prime Minister of the nation should promote and reinforce good work done by individuals and public representatives. This sort of revenge politics, negative politics is not right. If someone is trying to do good work, you should aid and support the work instead of trying to erase history and blur lines,” he said. The AAP leader said the Modi government is not able to do any work across the country and it is trying to put obstacles in the work being done in Delhi. He added that people have started looking at Mr. Kejriwal as an alternative to BJP and Mr. Modi, as “the Modi model is failing”. Many other AAP leaders also criticised the passage of the Bill. “This is the first time in the history of India that a law has been introduced to prevent someone from working. By bringing this law, the Central government has insulted not only the Supreme Court but also the Constitution,” tweeted AAP leader Satyendar Jain. Party leader Rajendra Pal Gautam said in a tweet in Hindi: “Despite the murder of democracy, our commitment to work will not diminish, the war for justice will continue...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/modi-insecure-about-kejriwals-popularity/article34166196.ece
26 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Surveys buoy LDF, but UDF, NDA undeterred||With 10 days of hard campaigning to spare, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is approaching the home stretch of the 2021 Assembly elections with favourable poll predictions that arguably place the ruling front on the path to a second term in power. However, the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) appear undeterred. They argue that the pollsters have attempted to stack the decks in favour of the LDF. The firms have concluded the random surveys well before the candidate announcement and manifesto declaration. The samplings are no barometer of public opinion. Both the UDF and the NDA are struggling to put the unfavourable news-cycle behind them. Their leaders have segued into attacking the government on the Sabarimala issue and the UAE gold smuggling case with renewed vigour. The UDF and the NDA have sensed a political opportunity in the Nair Service Society leadership’s perceived antipathy to the LDF on the emotive issue relating to the entry of women of childbearing age into the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple. The NSS has repeatedly said the LDF attempt to seek a consensus on the Sabarimala issue is ‘too little and too late.’ The UDF and NDA manifestos promise a law to protect the Sabarimala faith. They vow to revoke the LDF government’s affidavit backing the entry of women of all age groups to worship at the temple. BJP national executive member Sobha Surendran has made it the central plank of her campaign against Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran in Kazhakuttam. Ire on the coast The LDF is reportedly finding itself on the back foot in coastal localities. Congress’ campaign against the government’s alleged move to allow foreign trawlers to raid the high seas preserved for traditional fishers appears to have resonated strongly among the coastal community. The Latin rite of the Catholic Church has given voice to the fishers’ disquiet about the controversial scheme. Traditional fishers are a crucial demographic in Kerala. The BJP’s electioneering is sharply focussed on the ‘rising threat of Islamism’ and a law against ‘love jihad.’ It feels the issues resonate among the Christian community, which has flagged the issue in pastoral letters. The LDF, on its part, feels the Opposition’s recriminatory campaigning had made little headway against the government in the local body polls. It foresees a continuation of the trend in the Assembly polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/surveys-buoy-ldf-but-udf-nda-undeterred/article34165758.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||In signal to China, U.S. raised India ties during Alaska talks||The Joe Biden administration highlighted the strength of U.S.-India ties in its March 19 meeting with Chinese officials in Alaska, underlining how it has increasingly come to view India as central to its broader objectives in dealing with China in the Indo-Pacific region. The reference to India, it is learnt, was not favourably received by China’s two officials in Alaska — top diplomat and Politburo member Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi — and is being seen as reflecting how U.S.-India relations, only two months into the new administration, are developing robustly. The speed with which the new Biden administration has pushed closer ties with India has come in sharp contrast to expectations in some quarters, both in New Delhi and Washington, that relations would not be as smooth as they were with the Trump administration, both because of the rapport between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Modi and the former U.S. President’s lack of interest in India’s internal affairs and more broadly, human rights issues abroad. But two months on, any initial wariness that the relationship, which had seen rapid progress particularly on the security side over the past four years, would have to be rebuilt from scratch has dissipated. One reason for that is the successful holding of the virtual Quad summit between India, the U.S., Japan and Australia on March 12, seven days before the U.S.-China Alaska talks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-signal-to-china-us-raised-india-ties-during-alaska-talks/article34165550.ece
26 March 2021||MANGALURU,||Govt. urged to declare submerged coral reefs as ecologically sensitive||The College of Fisheries, Mangaluru, has urged the Union government to notify groups of submerged coral reefs off coastal Karnataka as ecologically sensitive and treat them on par with Lakshadweep Islands and eco-sensitive areas under the Wild Life Protection Act. Professor and Dean of the college A. Senthil Vel has in a release said that as per the Survey of India map these coral reefs are about 120 nautical miles (about 220 km) from Mangaluru. The Survey of India has named them as Bassas De Pedra, Cora Divh and Sesostris Bank. They may be the extension of Lakshadweep Islands towards the north from the Lakshadweep waters. Submerged reefs are at a height of around 40 m-50 m from the sea bed. Some of the catches that have not been recorded on the Karnataka coast are being observed along these reefs. The reefs are known to harbour some of the endangered species such as sharks, spotted skates and rays, lobsters, shells which are listed under Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act, including large bio diversity comprising sea weeds and sea fans. These have not been explored so far. “While there has been over-fishing and over-exploitation of the coastal waters, information has been received that certain fishing communities from neighbouring States are also exploiting some of the endangered and scheduled animals off the Karnataka coast,” he said and added that hence, there is a need to declare submerged coral reefs off coastal Karnataka as ecologically sensitive. Illegal fishing “The area has been neglected; hence, the fishing communities from other States have resorted to fishing using illegal methods and nets such as gill netting through monofilament material. As these fish are not known so much along the Karnataka coast, these fishermen are selling these fish at a low cost of Rs. 100-Rs. 130 a kg. Further, the shells which are pretty big in size and fall under Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act are being sold at Rs. 50-Rs. 100 a piece,” Prof. Vel said. He said that the gears/nets are dangerous and extremely destructive and could catch several of these beautiful animals. If the reefs are over-fished they become barren and the bio-diversity totally lost. Such submerged reefs also act as breeding and spawning areas for several commercially important fish and shell fish, including molluscs and star fish. The Indian Coast Guard Act 1978 under Chapter III Duties And Functions of The Coast Guard Para 14 (2)(c) can implement provisions for prohibiting exploitation in ecological sensitive areas within the EEZ. Further, the Coastal Security Police and the Fisheries Department also need to inspect the area and take stock of the situation as it is informed that around 80-100 fishing boats are known to be operating in these areas. The college will take up the matter with the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and also with the Coast Guard, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-urged-to-declare-submerged-coral-reefs-as-ecologically-sensitive/article34166289.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,||New norms for inter-State travellers to Bengaluru||The civic body has further tightened protocols for people entering Bengaluru from other parts of the country. From April, all travellers coming from any State to the city must carry a recent RT-PCR negative report for COVID-19. The rule had so far been limited to people from Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, and Chandigarh. It will apply to only those who come to Bengaluru to stay and is not for transit passengers who are travelling to another destination. It will come into effect from April 1, said the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike in a press release. This measure was announced in the light of a second wave of COVID-19. “More than 60% of the cases reported are from among people who have come to the city from other States,” said Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who chaired a review meeting at BBMP on Thursday. Of the 2,523 new COVID-19 cases reported on Thursday, 1,623 were from Bengaluru Urban district alone.  The BBMP will also resume stamping the hands of COVID-19 patients. The Minister said that many cases are afflicting those in the 20-40 age group, who may be asymptomatic and are mostly in home isolation. “We are hand stamping patients to prevent them from roaming around. The civic body will redeploy the Quarantine Watch app to monitor the movements of those who have to remain in isolation,” Dr. Sudhakar added. The Minister also reviewed health infrastructure facilities in Bengaluru, and visited Victoria Hospital, where 400 beds have been set aside for COVID-19 patients.

26 March 2021||New Delhi,||SC bats for women officers in Army||The Supreme Court on Thursday held that the Army’s “selective” evaluation process discriminates against and disproportionately affects women short service commission officers seeking permanent commission. “We are of the view that the evaluation criteria set by the Army constituted systemic discrimination against the petitioners (women officers),” a Bench, led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, observed. The evaluation pattern of women officers has caused them economic and psychological harm, the court said. In a series of directions, the court ordered that the cases of women officers who have applied for permanent commission should be reconsidered in a month and the decision on them should be given in two months. They would be considered for permanent commission subject to disciplinary and vigilance clearance. The court said physical standards should be kept at a premium during selection. The court highlighted how one of the Army’s “administrative requirements” was to benchmark women officers, under consideration for permanent commission, with male officers who are lowest in merit. “This is arbitrary and irrational,” Justice Chandrachud, who wrote the 137-page judgment, noted. The court said the “systemic and indirect discrimination” shown in the Army’s evaluation of women officers for permanent commission seemed neutral on the face, but was founded on a structure of “oppression and domination”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-bats-for-women-officers-in-army/article34165594.ece

26 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||KWA’s 120-mld water supply project may be retendered||The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) is likely to retender both components of the 120-mld (million litres a day) Neyyar water supply project, which has been delayed due to a combination of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and land disputes. Fresh bids will reportedly be invited for the construction of the intake system and water treatment plant at Neyyar, as well as for the second critical part of the project, the laying of a main transmission pipeline from Neyyar to the capital city, a senior KWA official said. Problems had begun stalking the project right from the selection of land for the water treatment plant. The KWA had awarded the Rs. 56.2-crore contract for constructing the plant at Neyyar to a Thiruvananthapuram-based firm in 2019. Although the State government issued orders transferring six acres of Irrigation Department land to the KWA in February 2020, disputes erupted over land ownership, preventing the contractor from commencing work. Restrictions impelled by the COVID-19 lockdown further added to the problems.  Consequent on the delay, the contractor sought a renegotiation of the terms, citing acute cost escalation. But this, reportedly, was not acceptable to the KWA. The contractor had also moved court in this regard. The KWA later identified an alternative site for the treatment plant, but the impasse over the terms persisted, prompting the KWA to consider a retender. For the construction of the transmission main, the KWA had selected an Erode-based firm in February this year. The work involved the supply, laying, testing and commissioning of a 1,422-mm, mild steel, clear water gravity main from the Neyyar dam site to the ground-level storage reservoir (GLSR) at PTP Nagar. Although the KWA issued a selection notice in January, the firm did not take steps to execute the agreement, according to the KWA. It also failed to provide relevant reasons for the delay, the KWA added. Subsequently, a KWA meeting held on March 18 decided to cancel the tender. Billed as a long-term solution for the water woes of the State capital, the project envisages supply of 100 mld to Thiruvananthapuram city and 20 mld to be shared by four grama panchayats in the project area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kwas-120-mld-water-supply-project-may-be-retendered/article34166399.ece

26 March 2021||Kolkata,||It’s Jangalmahal’s moment of reckoning||Thirty Assembly constituencies across five districts of the southern and western parts of West Bengal will go to the polls on March 27, in the first phase of the eight-phase Assembly election. The campaign bells for the high-pitched polls for the first phase fell silent on Thursday evening. Except a few in Purba Medinipur district, most constituencies that go to the polls in Pashchim Medinipur, Jhargram, Purulia and Bankura fall in the Jangalmahal region, once a hotbed of Left-Wing Extremism. These seats are located in one of the most backward regions of the State. Of the 30 seats, seven are reserved for Scheduled Tribe candidates and four for Scheduled Caste candidates. Contestants In all, 191 candidates are in the fray, including 29 each from the Trinamool Congress and the BJP, 18 of the CPI(M), six from the Congress, four from the CPI and two from the All India Forward Bloc. The nomination of a Trinamool nominee from Joypur was cancelled and the party has decided to support an Independent for the seat. The BJP has supported an AJSU (All Jharkhand Students Union) candidate for the Baghmundi seat in Purulia district. Senior Congress MLA Nepal Mahato is contesting the Baghmundi seat, while Trinamool leader Shantiram Mahato is trying his luck from Balarampur. The other key constituencies are Kharagpur and Medinpur. From Medinipur, the Trinamool has fielded actor June Malia. From Jhargram, the party has nominated Santhali language film actor Birbaha Hansda who will contest against the BJP’s Sukumar Satpati and CPI(M)’s young leader Madhuja Sen Roy. Salboni will see former Left Front Minister and CPI(M) leader Sushanta Ghosh and in the adjoining constituency of Garbeta, the Samyukta Morcha has fielded Tapan Ghosh. Both the leaders had considerable influence during the Left Front regime. Road shows and meetings While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held four rallies in each of the districts of Purulia, Paschim Medinipur and Purba Medinipur, and Bankura, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda have followed it up with several roadshows and public meetings. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also held dozens of public meetings in the region. The other star campaigner for the Trinamool has been Abhishek Banerjee who has tried to match the pace of the party supremo, who, despite sustaining leg injuries in Nandigram earlier, was addressing three meetings a day. The BJP won all four seats in Jangalmahal in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The defection of Suvendu Adhikari from the Trinamool to the BJP has given it an advantage not only in Purba Mednipur but also in other districts of south Bengal. The Trinamool has put its faith in Chhatradhar Mahato, former leader of the People’s Committee Against Police Atrocities, a frontal organisation of the banned CPI (Maoist), to revive its fortunes in the region. The Trinamool has highlighted the absence of elected public representatives of the BJP from the region and introduced outreach programmes such as Duare Sarkar at the last moment. The State’s ruling party is emphasising on the restoration of peace in the region as its achievement and is promising rations at the doorsteps under the public distribution system. Apart from stressing development, Ms. Banerjee has promised to popularise the Al Chiki language and give recognition to the tribal religion of Sarna. Along with tribal issues, the other crucial ones are unemployment, lack of industry and economic backwardness. The BJP is also highlighting the water crisis in the arid region. Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah have raised the issue of water crisis and that the piped water supply project in Purulia has been pending for several years. The BJP has also promised to allocate Rs. 18,000 of PM Kisan which has been pending for three years. Though the region voted in favour of the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, political observers feel that the Trinamool, with the support of tribal schemes such as the ‘Joy Johar Bandhu Prakalpa’ (a pension scheme for tribals) and establishment of the Bagdi Community Development Board, alongside streamlining the party organisation, is expected to fare better.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/its-jangalmahals-moment-of-reckoning/article34165455.ece
26 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Crime Branch has given me a clean chit: Oommen Chandy||In a Facebook post on Thursday, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said: “the Crime Branch report stating there is no evidence in the solar case had emerged in the public domain.” It gave him no relief or glee but merely ‘‘illustrated the fact that no power could suppress the truth for long’’. Mr. Chandy said he had not approached the court to quash the police case registered against him in 2018 knowing very well that the law enforcement could arrest him at will. Mr. Chandy appeared to be referring to the case of rape registered against him and five other top Congress politicians based on the sworn statement of the woman accused in the solar scam. He did not state where the report exonerating him had surfaced. The “victim” had alleged that the politicians had sought and received sexual favours from her, promising State support for her business venture during the 2012-13 period. Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal, former Ministers Adoor Prakash and A.P. Anil Kumar, Hibi Eden, MP, and Abdullah Kutty, currently a top BJP functionary, are the other respondents in the case. ‘No evidence’ Mr. Chandy said the police had repeatedly investigated the woman’s allegations and found no evidence to substantiate the charges. The Kerala High Court had removed the woman’s deposition from the solar judicial commission report. A retired Supreme Court judge had advised the government that the prosecution had no evidence to proceed against him, he said. However, in January, the State government had promulgated an extraordinary notification authorising the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe Mr. Chandy, suppressing evidence to the contrary. A police official said it was usual for the State law enforcement to state why it sought a CBI probe in a particular case. He said the CB might have pleaded inability to ferret out evidence in the case to justify the government’s demand for a CBI inquiry. However, such a statement, if at all, did not tantamount to absolving him of the charges. The cases against Mr. Chandy and others have their provenance in a damning observation by the judicial commission that probed the solar scam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/crime-branch-has-given-me-a-clean-chit-oommen-chandy/article34165485.ece
26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Parliament adjourned ahead of schedule||Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned sine die on Thursday nearly two weeks before schedule, keeping in mind requests made for the curtailment of the second part of the Budget session by MPs from West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Puducherry and Kerala owing to the Assembly elections. The first part of the session started on January 29. The second leg started on March 8 after a break and was to run till April 8. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, in a briefing after the end of the session, said: “It was curtailed ahead of schedule due to the demands made by various political parties and Assembly elections in four States and one Union Territory.” The influence of the electoral contests was seen during the session with frequent references to poll issues in West Bengal during the debates. Earlier in the day, Bhratruhari Mahtab, who was in the chair in the Lok Sabha as part of the 10-member panel of presiding officers, commended Speaker Om Birla, who is down with COVID-19, for the arrangements made for the conduct of the House in the middle of the pandemic. In fact, while the first two days of Parliament in the second part of the session were for limited five-hour sittings, the time period of the sittings was made regular again with both Houses running concurrently. Mr. Mahtab, in the valedictory address, revealed that despite disruptions, the session clocked 114% in productivity with 24 sittings, which lasted over 132 hours. Seventeen government Bills were introduced and 18 passed, including the Finance and the Appropriations Bills. A total of 171 reports were tabled by various parliamentary committees and 84 starred questions were answered orally. The tally for the Rajya Sabha was also impressive with 23 sittings, in which the House sat for 104 hours and clocked a 90% productivity. The Upper House passed 19 Bills, spending 42% of the functional time on legislative business.  Head to head Though attendance was sparse in both the Houses as members mainly from election-bound States were absent, the Treasury and the Opposition benches went head to head on the strike by farmers against the three controversial farm laws and even more so with the Government of the National Capital Territory (Amendment) Bill, 2021 which seeks to add to the powers of the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi. The Bill was passed after repeated adjournments, especially in the Rajya Sabha, with even neutral parties such as the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) staging a walkout from the Upper House terming it an assault on the rights of elected State governments. In his valedictory address, Rajya Sabha Chairperson and Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu reminded the members that the country was “entering the 75th anniversary of Independence” and that it was “a moment of introspection”. “While this special occasion provides all of us and citizens the opportunity to cherish the values and ideals that our freedom fighters stood for and helped our country to gain freedom from the colonial rule, it also calls for serious introspection on the functioning of our legislatures and their Members,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parliament-adjourned-ahead-of-schedule/article34165504.ece
26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccine export may be curbed||Amidst a fresh surge in COVID-19 cases in India, and the rollout of vaccines for those above 45 years from April 1, the government has hinted it may need to “calibrate” its supply schedules to other countries, although it has not proposed a full ban on exports at this time. According to Global vaccine alliance GAVI, which runs the COVAX programme, Indian vaccine supplies to lower income countries are being delayed “as the Government of India battles a new wave of COVID-19 infections”. A statement from GAVI said that while it had receive 28 million Covishield doses from the Serum Institute of India (SII), it was unclear about additional supplies of 40 million in March and 50 million in April, and was in talks with the government and SII over the issue. The decision comes as several countries including the U.K., Brazil, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Nepal have experienced, or expect to experience, a delay in the supply of Indian-made vaccines. In addition, a UNICEF representative has said export licences from India had been held up. “Given our current manufacturing capacity and requirements of national vaccination programmes, there may be a need to calibrate the supply schedules from time to time. All stakeholders would have to work together to adjust the schedules as required,” an official source said on Wednesday night, stressing that India remains “committed” to its vaccine supplies to the world. The source said that “unlike many other countries”, the government has not placed a ban on exports, but that COVID-19 vaccine supplies to other countries would be made in a phased manner “keeping in view the domestic requirements”. Sent as grants According to the Ministry of External Affairs, India has exported more than 60 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines since January 20 this year. While about 8 million were grants from the Government of India to other countries, most of the supplies have been procured by the international GAVI alliance that runs the COVAX facility (17.86 million) and commercial orders (34.17 million). On Thursday, UNICEF also confirmed the delays.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-export-may-be-curbed/article34166110.ece
26 March 2021||MADURAI,||Steady love for every shade of red||About 40 km southwest of Madurai, in a hamlet called Vannivelampatti, Karl Marx, Jyoti Basu, Fidel Castro, Lenin and Stalin gather at the village common every morning for banter and tea. They aren’t stage artistes but ordinary villagers named after Communist leaders. All in their 40s and working as farm labourers in the maize fields that dot the villages on the road to Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district, their discussions are a ritual now that the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections are round the corner. Poring over the daily Theekkathir , their conversations veer around the crushed dreams of the working class. These discussions attract other village elders and youngsters too. They sit against the backdrop of the Vembulaiyan Swamy temple. A few yards away, Dmitri keeps a watch on the children, who are at home due to the pandemic and are prancing around his autorickshaw, while Ramamurthi takes a walk against the sun with a handful of children, all of them wearing signature Che Guevara T-shirts. ‘A reputation to maintain’ “The T-shirts were this year’s Pongal gift to all the children in the village,” Ramamurthi said with pride. “No matter which way the political wind blows, Vannivelampatti village (under Thirumangalam constituency in Madurai district) has a reputation to maintain.” “We may not look like the original leaders or match their achievements, but we wear their names with pride because they give us the courage to demand justice and never give up the fight against inequality and discrimination,” said Safdar Hashmi, 28, a gym coach. Red has been the colour in this village with 3,000 voters. Over the years they have stuck to an interesting practice of naming their children after Communist leaders. “There is some disenchantment but we will vote for the DMK-CPI(M) alliance because we don’t believe in religion- and caste-based politics and don’t want it to enter here,” said Mr. Karl Marx. The villagers remain unyielding to the two staples of Tamil Nadu politics — caste sentiments and money. “Political party candidates do not even bother to enter our village for campaigning,” said Mr. Lenin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/steady-love-for-every-shade-of-red/article34165440.ece
26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Opposition denied chance for discussion: Congress||The Narendra Modi government pushed through Bills to end the second part of the Budget session two weeks before schedule but the Opposition was denied an opportunity to have short-duration discussions or calling attention motions, the Congress alleged on Thursday. The party said many of the laws passed in the second part of the Budget session will be legally challenged in the Supreme Court, and cited the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) law defining the Lieutenant-Governor as the “government” in Delhi and the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and Development) Act as examples. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge; chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, Jairam Ramesh; and the party’s stand-in leader in the Lok Sabha, Ravneet Bittu, in a joint press conference, said the principle of “government must have its way while the Opposition must have its say” was not followed. “Every Bill that was passed in the Parliament session will be challenged in the Supreme Court. There is no doubt about it,” Mr. Ramesh said. “This is the first time the Opposition’s legitimate demand for calling attention [motion], short duration [discussion] has not been agreed to. If it has not been agreed to, it means the government is not keen or prepared to discuss.” Questioning the provisions of the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Bill, passed by the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Congress leaders asked how an institution, set up by an Act of the Parliament, could be outside the purview of Central Bureau of Investigation, the Central Vigilance Commission, and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Party leaders said that although the Opposition had played a constructive role in getting Bills passed, the government did not agree to any discussion on crucial issues such as disinvestment, inflation and price rise, newly framed rules for digital media, and the farm laws. “I personally gave notice on two issues: on digital media being curtailed and the panic privatisation of Railways, insurance, airports, steel plants, oil refineries and petrochemical plants. Neither of those two notices were agreed to,” Mr. Ramesh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-denied-chance-for-discussion-congress/article34165510.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Vaccines effective in preventing severe illness caused by variants’||Rakesh Aggarwal , Director, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, talks  about the unique double mutant COVID-19 virus found in India, its implication for the country which is at the beginning of the second wave of infections and the importance of vaccination. Excerpts:  What do the COVID-19 variants and double mutants found in India mean for the ongoing pandemic and second wave that the country is witnessing? The genome sequencing data of the COVID-19 virus from 10 national laboratories in India made available on Wednesday show that nearly 7.7% of the nearly 11,000 specimens tested contained one of the viral variants. In this context, it is important for us to understand what the variant viruses are, and what this detection means. Viruses develop changes in their genomes very often during their multiplication and spread. The progeny viruses with one or more such changes are referred to as ‘variants’. The appearance of variants of COVID-19 viruses in our population was not really unexpected. The ‘double mutant’ simply means that this virus has two mutations, each of which has individually been seen in viruses from other parts of the world, except that it has both these mutations simultaneously. Such double-mutants are not rare. Based on the recent announcement, there is no reason to believe that this double mutant has any special characteristics for it to raise any special interest or concern. Does this mean that nearly 7%-8% of all COVID-19 patients in our country have a variant virus? And should we worry about the variants of the COVID-19 virus? No. I would not think so. The specimens tested were highly selected and preferentially included arriving foreign travellers and their close contacts. These groups would be more likely to have variants. Hence, the data in this select group would overestimate the frequency of variants. The real proportion of variant virus in all cases in our population should be lower than this. Of course, the rate would also be different across different geographical areas of our large country. Genetic variations are very common in all viruses, including the COVID-19 virus. So, we do not need to worry about each and every variant. Detection of a variant virus is a matter of interest or of concern if the variant has some special characteristics. Why are some variants a reason for concern? And are the variants detected in India ‘variants of concern’? You would hear two terms: ‘variant of interest’ and ‘variant of concern’. The first — ‘variant of interest’ — refers to variants that appear to be associated with a special characteristic, but evidence is still limited. A ‘variant of concern’, on the other hand, is one where there is evidence supporting such association. These special characteristics of a variant could be an increased risk of transmission, causing more severe disease, failure of detection by the usual tests, or a higher risk of infection after prior infection or vaccination. Three variants of concern have been detected in India. These had been first identified in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and have been identified in several countries globally. These are of concern primarily because they have an increased potential for spread from one person to another. Fortunately, these variants are not associated with more severe disease or a higher risk of death. The good news is that simple measures, such as the proper use of face masks and of physical distancing, are highly effective in preventing the spread of these variant strains. Hence, we can still effectively control their spread by following these steps. Just that we have to be disciplined. The other reason for concern has been the reports that some COVID-19 vaccines may not be as good in preventing infection with the South African variant. Again, fortunately, though these vaccines may not prevent mild illness caused by this variant as well, they still appear to be effective in preventing severe illnesses that need intensive care and ventilator, caused by these variants. Hence, it is prudent that those at a high risk of such disease, for example, the elderly and those with co-morbid conditions, and are eligible for receiving COVID-19 vaccines, get themselves vaccinated as soon as possible. Is the current vaccination drive enough to control the pandemic? The current COVID-19 vaccination drive is not really for controlling the spread, but to protect those who are likely to develop severe disease. Elderly people are more likely to develop severe disease, more likely to need ICU admission, more likely to need ventilators, more likely to die. The primary aim of the drive is to reduce the need for ICU beds, the use of ventilators, and deaths. However, as immunisation continues and covers a large proportion of the population, it eventually will lead to a reduction in cases as well. In some small countries, such as Israel, where immunisation coverage is high, the disease rate has come down remarkably. Besides, case-control studies in the U.K. show that an extremely small number of vaccinated people get COVID-19. Increasing vaccination coverage will surely help. The surge is a cause for worry. It is happening partly because people are no longer taking precautions as seriously as they were previously. COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease and spreads rapidly and exponentially.  The primary aim of the vaccination drive is to reduce the need for ICU beds, the use of ventilators, and deaths||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccines-effective-in-preventing-severe-illness-caused-by-variants/article34165516.ece
26 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||RT-PCR must for entering Bengaluru||There was a surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths in Andhra Pradesh with the State reporting four more fatalities and 758 cases on Thursday. Karnataka recorded 2,523 fresh cases and 10 fatalities. Telangana added 493 cases on Wednesday. Karnataka Health Minister K. Sudhakar said from April 1, passengers arriving from any State to Bengaluru must possess a RT-PCR negative report. It was decided to hand-stamp infected persons residing in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike limits. There were 1,623 new cases from Bengaluru Urban. The day also saw 1,192 patients getting discharged after recovery. Andhra Pradesh Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh said schools would continue to function in the State with strict COVID-19 guidelines. Just when the department thought the education sector could be put back on the rails after the disruption, there were signs of a second wave emerging. ‘Time-table released’ “We have released the time-table for the 10th class and the Intermediate exams and have announced the academic calendar. Officials have been given strict instructions to scrupulously follow the protocol — use of masks and hand sanitisers and maintaining social distancing,” he said. On more than 160 students in a junior college in Rajahmahendravaram testing positive, the Minister said it was “very unfortunate”. Action was taken against the college management and the hostel closed down,” he said. 2.15% in A.P. In Andhra Pradesh, the daily test positivity rate (TPR) of 35,196 samples tested was 2.15%, the highest in over four months. The overall positivity rate of 1.487 crore samples tested further came down to 6.02%. The toll touched 7,201 and the cumulative tally increased to 8,95,879. So far in March, 5,963 infections were reported and 3,139 were reported in the past week. Nearly 70% (2,150) were reported in five districts. Two deaths occurred in Chittoor and one each in Guntur and Visakhapatnam districts. Chittoor reported the highest incidence of 175 cases, followed by Guntur (127), Visakhapatnam (98), Krishna (80), Anantapur (56), East Godavari (45), Nellore (33), Prakasam (30), Kurnool (27), Srikakulam (27), Kadapa (24), Vizianagaram (23) and West Godavari (13). 1,779 cases in T.N. On a day when another 1,779 persons tested positive for COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu, the active caseload went past 10,000 after nearly three months. Chennai, along with six other districts, accounted for over 70% of the fresh cases. The State’s active caseload was pushed to 10,487. The last time it had over 10,000 persons under treatment for COVID-19 was in mid-December 2020. Of this, 4,082 persons were in Chennai followed by 1,088 persons in Chengalpattu and 936 in Coimbatore. In Chennai, 664 persons tested positive, while three districts had 100-plus cases — Chengalpattu (162), Coimbatore (153) and Thanjavur (108). Nine returnees – five from West Bengal and one each from Bangladesh, Gujarat, Assam and Kerala – were among those who tested positive for the infection. The State accounted for a total of 8,73,219 cases till now. A total of 11 persons succumbed to the infection, taking the toll to 12,641. Chennai accounted for seven of the 11 fatalities. There was one death each in Kancheepuram, Thanjavur, Tiruvallur and Vellore. Kerala’s tally on Thursday rose to 11,11,897 cases. With 51,027 samples tested, the TPR dipped to 3.9%. With 12 deaths the State’s cumulative toll was 4,539.  In Telangana four deaths were reported. There was an increase of 27 cases in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area.

26 March 2021||Jhargram,||A battle for political revival in an erstwhile Maoist bastion||As the Jangalmahal region of south-west Bengal go to the polls on March 27, the spotlight is on two leaders. Chhatradhar Mahato, 57, has been tasked with reviving the fortunes of the Trinamool Congress in Jangalmahal, where the BJP won all four seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, while CPI(M) candidate Sushanta Ghosh, contesting from Salboni, has been given the job of reviving the Left to the pre-2011 days. Both leaders have spent time in jail for various cases and are now out on bail. While Mr. Mahato was slapped with a number of cases under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Mr. Ghosh was arrested in August 2011 after half a dozen skeletons were recovered from a pond near his house. Investigations revealed that those were the remains of Trinamool supporters who had gone missing. Road through Lalgarh One of the roads from Jhargram, where Mr. Mahato wields considerable influence, to Salboni passes through Lalgarh, which was a ‘liberated zone’ of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) from 2009 to 2011. In those two years, hundreds of civilians, Maoists and security forces were killed in violence that gripped the area around Lalgarh, including Jhargram, Binpur, Bandwan, and the neighbouring constituencies of Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Purulia. After its rout in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Jangalmahal, the Trinamool inducted Mr. Mahato, who was the convener of the People’s Committee Against Police Atrocities, the frontal organisation of the CPI(Maoist) during the Lalgarh movement, into its State committee last July. He is supervising the campaign of Birbaha Hansda, the Trinamool candidate from Jhargram. At the makeshift Trinamool election office inside a single-screen cinema hall in Jhargram, Mr. Mahato spoke about his agenda. “The movement then (in 2009) was against the Left Front government and its excesses. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had also contributed to the movement. We were fighting for a dream, and now we are trying to project the success of 10 years under the Trinamool regime and protect it from the BJP’s false promises,” he said. Years in jail have made Mr. Mahato, now guarded by men with semi-automatic rifles, a man of few words. But his organisational skills are sharp, and he explained in detail how he is trying to unite the Adivasi Santhals and Adivasi Kurmis in Jhargram. Uneasy divide About 68 km from Jhargram lies Salboni. This is where a landmine blast on the convoy of then Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in November 2008 triggered police action and violence. Within days of being nominated as a Samyukta Morcha candidate, Mr. Ghosh walked through a village and announced his return. “The forefathers of the Maoists and Trinamool and BJP know who Sushanta Ghosh is. When I was not there, they could do whatever they wanted. Now if they lay hands on you, I will break their bones and arrange for their treatment,” the former Minister of the Left Front government said at a village in Salboni. The remark, unsurprisingly, triggered strong reactions from his political rivals. He spent nearly eight years behind bars. Mr. Ghosh likes to speak to the media while standing next to the portrait of former Chief Minister Jyoti Basu. “This time, the wind is different; the people are not going for the Trinamool or BJP,” he said. For the local people of the area, the return of both leaders sparks unease. Chiranjib Maity, in his 30s, is part of the network of about 417 families whose kin were killed during the violence. “There are many still missing. Those who were behind the violence have got jobs and those at the receiving end are still suffering,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-battle-for-political-revival-in-an-erstwhile-maoist-bastion/article34165438.ece
26 March 2021||PALAKKAD,||MBBS students seek lenient evaluation||Students of the 2019 MBBS batch who took their first-year university examinations last week have raised a hue and cry over the toughness of their human anatomy and physiology question papers. They have appealed to the Vice Chancellor of the Kerala University of Health Sciences demanding lenient evaluation and moderation. Teachers’ support Teachers in medical colleges too have endorsed the students’ concerns, saying that the questions were clinically oriented and of super-specialty level. Most of the 4,000-plus MBBS students in Kerala, who took their anatomy paper one and two and physiology paper one examinations on March 15, 17, and 19 respectively, were agonised with questions of “higher, unexpected levels” after doing half of their curriculum through online mode during the COVID-19 period. “I was in for a shock. The questions were too lengthy, ambiguous and tricky. Some of them were definitely beyond the capacity of a first-year MBBS student,” said Freesia Habeeb, university union councillor of Sree Gokulam Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. The online factor Many students came out crying, cursing the COVID-19 time that denied them regular classes and laboratory experiments. They said those who set the question papers did not consider the fact that half their academic year had been on online mode. “Most students found it difficult to manage time. The standard of questions was unfit for the new Competency Based Medical Education (CBME) curriculum as they did not check the clinical or anatomical knowledge of students,” said Ms. Freesia. Some of the teachers, requesting anonymity, said such questions should have been avoided considering the COVID-19 special time. “The students were denied not only clinical experience but also any kind of dissection in lab during this pandemic period,” they said. ‘Super-specialty level’ A former anatomy professor from the Government Medical College, Kozhikode, said some of the questions were of super-specialty level and some were surgical anatomy questions. The 2019 MBBS students are the first batch of the CBME curriculum in the State. The students, in their appeal to the university, said they had been deprived of practical and dissection classes. They demanded either a lenient evaluation or moderation from university.  Students of 2019 MBBS batch appeal to VC of Kerala University of Health Sciences.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mbbs-students-seek-lenient-evaluation/article34165844.ece
26 March 2021||Kolkata,||BJP pulls out all the stops in Bengal||With less than 32 hours of the first phase of polling to begin in West Bengal, the BJP is pulling out all the stops to woo the voters. From senior Union Cabinet Ministers Amit Shah to Rajnath Singh, the party also roped in matinee idol Mithun Chakraborty on Thursday for the 30 seats going to the polls on May 27. Mr. Shah said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is trying to instil fear among the people by saying “Khela Hobe”. “Do you think that you will be able to scare us by all this. No one will be able to play any games during the game. Please vote without fear,” Mr. Shah said. The Home Minister addressed three rallies in the day at Baghmundi, Jhargram and Mecheda tried to reach out to tribal communities promising a development board for Kurmi Adivasis. Alleging that the Trinamool government has not done anything for tribals, Mr. Shah said every family of the Kurmi Adivasi community will have one member who will be provided with employment. “If you want schemes, vote for Modiji, if you prefer scams, then vote for the incompetent Trinamool. It is for you to decide,” Mr. Shah said at another public rally at Baghmundi. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh who also held public meeting at Joypur in Purulia accused the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of not ushering in development in West Bengal. Mr Singh said like the Left regime, Ms. Banerjee had not delivered on the development front. The Defence Minister accused West Bengal Chief Minister of trying to divide the country by calling people who had come from other States as outsiders. Along with Home Minister and Defence Minister, actor Mithun Chakraborty also hit the campaign trail. Mr. Chakaborty participated in roadshows at Saltora and Keshiary in Jangalmahal. The rally drew enormous crowds who came out to see the actor. The actor had joined the BJP at the Brigade rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month. Along with the actor, former cricketer and Delhi BJP MP Gautam Gambhir campaigned for BJP candidate Ashok Dinda, who is contesting from Moyna Assembly segment. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also held two public meetings in the day at Kakdwip and Nandigram and also accused the State government of failing the State on development front. Mr. Adityanath said at Kakdwip that Mamata Banerjee was not interested in the State’s development and only wanted to promote goons and extortionists. At Nandigram, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister showered praises on Suvendu Adhikari, and said that he has taken the right decision by joining the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-pulls-out-all-the-stops-in-bengal/article34165512.ece
26 March 2021||New Delhi,||DFI is required for the next 25 years of growth: Minister||The Rajya Sabha on Thursday cleared the legislation to establish the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NBFID), which was announced in the Budget speech by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as the principal development financial institution (DFIs) for infrastructure financing. Opposition members argued unsuccessfully for sending the Bill to a select committee, saying that in its present form, there was no scope for “external oversight or surveillance”. Ms. Sitharaman, however, said all safeguards had been provided for and an audited report would be placed in Parliament every year. Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh opened the debate, saying the concept of DFIs had already been tried, tested and rejected. The first such institution was set up in 1948. In 1991, Manmohan Singh, as Finance Minister, had set up the Narsimham committee, which came to the conclusion that the era of the DFIs was over. “Thirty years after Dr. Manmohan Singh’s Budget, the clock has turned back and we are going back to the DFI era,” Mr. Ramesh said. He said that despite the government having a 26% stake in this bank, the Bill did not provide for an oversight mechanism. The other lacunae was the protection provided to management for the decisions it takes as an “act of good faith”, he said. “What is an act of good faith? Who will determine an act of good faith,” Mr. Ramesh asked. Ms. Sitharaman said the NBFID was the need of the hour and the need of the next 25 years. The infrastructure that it planned to fund was not only roads but also social infrastructure like schools and hospitals. It would be a professionally run body, with only the government appointing the Chairperson. The Bill, she said, had safeguards, including the provision that the NBFID had to furnish to the Centre and the RBI a copy of its balance-sheet and accounts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dfi-is-required-for-the-next-25-years-of-growth-minister/article34165514.ece
26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC suggests posting retired judges to clear backlog in HCs||The Supreme Court on Thursday pushed for the appointment of retired judges to battle pendency of cases in High Courts. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said retired judges could be chosen on the basis of their expertise in a particular field of dispute and allowed to retire once the pendency in that zone of law was over. Several problems “There are suits pending in chartered courts, and in North India, some courts have cases pending for 30 years... there are all kinds of problems,” Chief Justice Bobde said at a virtual hearing of a petition filed by NGO, Lok Prahari, on the mounting backlog. The Bench said retired judges who had handled certain disputes and fields of law for over 15 years could deal with them faster if brought back into harness as ad-hoc judges.  The court said the appointment of ad-hoc judges would not be a threat to the services of other judges. “Ad-hoc judges will be treated as the junior most,” Chief Justice Bobde said. The Chief Justice said the appointment of ad-hoc judges was provided for in the Constitution under Article 224A. Under the Article, the Chief Justice of a High Court for any State may at any time, with the previous consent of the President, request any person who has held the office of judge of that court or of any other High Court to sit and act as a judge of the High Court for that State. The court orally outlined prospective guidelines for the appointment and functioning of an ad hoc judge. “If in a particular jurisdiction, the pendency goes beyond a certain limit, say eight or 10 years, the Chief Justice may appoint a certain [retired] judge with expertise in those fields of laws as an ad hoc judge. The next hearing is scheduled for April 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-suggests-posting-retired-judges-to-clear-backlog-in-hcs/article34165526.ece

Among those named in the FIR are the company, Mr. Kothari, his wife Sadhna Kothari and their son Rahul Kothari. The accused are being probed by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate in multiple bank fraud cases. In February 2018, the CBI had arrested Mr. Kothari and his son in an alleged Rs. 3,695-crore “wilful” loan default case. The latest case pertains to Crown Alba Writing Instruments India, which made writing instruments. However, it later started dealing in multiple commodities including brass scrap, ceramic tiles, iron ore, industrial equipment and tiles. The bank said the company had taken credit facilities in the form of letters of credit, but it could not release the export proceeds in time for the adjustment of devolved letters of credit. The account turned non-performing asset on September 30, 2016. The company had also taken such facilities from the Bank of India and the Dena Bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-register-another-case-against-rotomac-group/article34166199.ece
26 March 2021||Hyderabad,||Four of a farmer’s family found dead||Four members of a tenant farmer’s family were found dead in his residence at Malkapally village in Kasipet mandal of Mancherial district here on Thursday morning. Janjerala Ramesh (45), his wife Padma (40), their recently married daughter Sowmya (20) and son Akshay (17), ended their lives by hanging from a ceiling. Ramesh, a tenant farmer, borrowed a huge amount to lease 30 acres of land, and for his daughter Sowmya’s marriage, and was unable to repay the amount due to bad crop owing to unseasonal rains. “He was debt-ridden and resorted to the extreme step with his family members,” Devapur Sub-Inspector A Vijayender said. It is suspected that the incident might have taken place in the late hours of Wednesday and came to light in the early hours of Thursday when a neighbour noticed their bodies hanging. “Around 6.30 a.m. a woman residing next door went to the victims’ house to find why they didn’t wake up as their daily routine starts at 4.30 a.m. everyday. Shocking sight After knocking the door for a few moments, she opened the window and saw the family members in a shocking state,” he said. Soon, she alerted her husband, who in turn informed about the incident to the locals and police. A note purportedly left behind by Ramesh cited that no one was responsible for their death, and they have asked the children also to end their lives as the debt would mount on them after his death. “Ours is a middle-class family and even if I had one acre of land, I would have sold it to clear the debts. We have no options left, but to end our lives,” the sub-inspector quoting Ramesh’s last note said. Sowmya was married to one Suresh of Rapalli village in Luxettipet mandal. He runs a kirana shop. Two days ago, Ramesh went to Rapalli and got Sowmya to his house at Malkapally. They said that a case was registered and bodies were handed over to the relatives for last rites after autopsy at the Government Hospital.

We recorded a footfall of around 4,000 tourists on the first day, probably the highest in the past few years,” Director, Floriculture, Farooq Ahmed Rather said. Baseer Ahmed Khan, Adviser to Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha, threw open the garden, which also found a mention in the tweets of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday with an appeal to visit the place. “Entire Kashmir is famous for its natural beauty. The opening of the tulip garden will add more charm to the tourism of J&K. We aim to make the garden not only an attraction for domestic tourists but a global tourist destination,” Mr. Khan said. He said a festival is being organised from April 3 when the garden will be in full bloom. “The garden has 62 varieties of tulips. They stay in bloom from three to four weeks,” Inam Rehman Sofi, caretaker of the garden said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/asias-largest-tulip-garden-opens-in-srinagar/article34165506.ece
26 March 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC to hear Akbar’s appeal on May 5||The Delhi High Court on Thursday posted for May 5 the hearing on a plea by former Union Minister M.J. Akbar challenging a trial court order acquitting journalist Priya Ramani in the criminal defamation case for her tweets accusing him of sexual harassment. The petition, scheduled to come up for hearing on Thursday, could not be taken up as Justice Mukta Gupta was not holding court. Mr. Akbar moved the High Court against a February 17 verdict of a trial court here dismissing his criminal defamation case against Ms. Ramani. The trial court had accepted Ms. Ramani’s argument that she spoke out against Mr. Akbar after two decades of the incident “in public interest and for the public good.” “The woman has a right to put her grievance at any platform of her choice and even after decades,” Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey had said. The trial court had also accepted Ms. Ramani’s contention that Mr. Akbar “is not a man of stellar reputation” on the basis of her testimony and testimony of senior journalist Ghazala Wahab, who too claimed of being sexually harassed by Mr. Akbar. ‘Truth is defence’ Mr. Akbar had in his criminal defamation complaint said Ms. Ramani’s tweet and her article accusing him of sexual harassment were defamatory, and lowered his reputation. He also said that Ms. Ramani didn’t produce any evidence to prove her story. However, Ms. Ramani pleaded truth as her defence in relation to the allegations of sexual harassment against Mr. Akbar. She said her tweet and subsequent article alleging Mr. Akbar of sexual harassment during his previous role as newspaper editor was made in “good faith” and for public good. At the height of the #MeToo movement in 2018, Ms. Ramani accused Mr. Akbar of sexual harassment. Subsequently, about a dozen former colleagues of Mr. Akbar also came out with different allegations against him. Days before he resigned as Minister of State for External Affairs in October 2018, Mr. Akbar filed a criminal defamation case against Ms. Ramani citing her open letter published in a magazine and her tweets naming him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-to-hear-akbars-appeal-on-may-5/article34165501.ece
26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC quashes hate crime case against Editor||The Supreme Court has held that criticism of governmental inaction cannot be branded as an attempt promote hatred between communities while quashing a hate speech case against Shillong Times Editor Patricia Mukhim for a Facebook post. Ms. Mukhim was charged with promoting hatred between communities for her social media post urging the Meghalaya Chief Minister and authorities to take action against masked assailants who brutally attacked a few non-tribal boys playing basketball. The incident took place last year. A Bench, led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao, said every citizen has a right to expect and articulate the call for justice. Justice Rao, who authored the judgment, said Ms. Mukhim’s Facebook post was one such “call for justice”. “Disapprobation of governmental inaction cannot be branded as an attempt to promote hatred between different communities. Free speech of the citizens of this country cannot be stifled by implicating them in criminal cases, unless such speech has the tendency to affect public order,” the Supreme Court held. The court said every Indian has the right to free speech, to travel freely and settle throughout the length and breadth of the country. “At times, when in the legitimate exercise of such a right, individuals travel, settle down or carry on a vocation in a place where they find conditions conducive, there may be resentments, especially if such citizens prosper, leading to hostility or possibly violence. In such instances, if the victims voice their discontent and speak out, especially if the State authorities turn a blind eye or drag their feet, such voicing of discontent is really a cry for anguish, for justice denied – or delayed,” Justice Rao wrote. The court said the attack upon six non-locals, carried out by masked individuals, was not denied by the State. There appears to be no headway made in the probe. “The fervent plea made by the appellant (Mukhim) for protection of non-tribals living in Meghalaya and for their equality cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be categorised as hate speech,” the Supreme Court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hate-crime-case-against-editor-quashed/article34165589.ece
26 March 2021||Srinagar,||Mehbooba quizzed for 5 hours by Enforcement Department||Former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti, who was quizzed by the Enforcement Department (ED) in Srinagar on Thursday, said her party will continue to fight for the rights of the people and the restoration of Article 370, which was diluted in 2019. Officials said Ms. Mufti was questioned by the officials of the ED at the Srinagar office for around five hours. She was summoned in a money-laundering case. After the questioning was over, Ms. Mufti told the media: “Dissent has been criminalised in the country. One who speaks against you [the Centre] is being either booked under sedition charges or being summoned by the investigative agencies,” she said. She said the ED officials questioned about her father late Mufti Muhammad Sayeed’s property in south Kashmir’s Bijbehara. “I was asked how I sold it and other related things. Also about the funds during my tenure as the J&K Chief Minister. I have nothing to hide,” she said. After being summoned on March 15, she approached the court for a stay but the Delhi High Court did not grant it. Later, in a letter to the ED, Ms. Mufti said she was not in a position to attend the summons on March 22 as she has prior commitments. Ms. Mufti said she willing to be questioned in Srinagar “preferably at her residence or through a video conference from Srinagar”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mehbooba-quizzed-for-5-hours-by-enforcement-department/article34165529.ece
26 March 2021||New Delhi,||BJP enabled goons to harass nuns: Priyanka||In a sharp attack, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday accused the BJP-led government of “enabling” goons to harass young women who were commuting on a train. Her comments come just days after two nuns and two postulants of the Sacred Heart Congregation were forced to get off a train by the railway police in Jhansi. The incident happened last Friday, and a video clip of it went viral on Wednesday. In the clip, a group of men, claiming to be associated with ‘Hindu Samaaj’, were heard questioning the women about their religion and if they were being taken for ‘forceful conversion’. “Which political party runs the government that enables these goons to harass and demand personal details of young women commuting on a train? BJP. Which political party do these goons belong to? BJP. Which party’s student wing are some of them members of? BJP. And now that there is an election in Kerala HM @AmitShah is busy giving hollow statements about protecting nuns from harassment. Really?” asked Ms. Vadra on Twitter. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted on Wednesday that “the attack in U.P. on nuns from Kerala is a result of the vicious propaganda run by the Sangh Parivar”. He also tweeted that he would no longer refer to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliates as the Sangh Parivar. “To refer to RSS and its affiliates as Sangh Parivar, in my view, is not right. In a family, there are women, respect for the elderly, love and compassion. RSS has none of this. I won’t refer to the RSS as the Sangh Parivar,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-enabled-goons-to-harass-nuns-priyanka/article34165533.ece
26 March 2021||Kochi,||Coast Guard seizes heroin worth Rs. 3,000 cr.||High-grade heroin worth around Rs. 3,000 crore and five AK-47 rifles with 1,000 live rounds were among the items seized by the Indian Coast Guard from a Sri Lankan fishing vessel on March 18, according to a Coast Guard press release.  The agency said that the boat Ravihansi , one among the three fishing boats that were intercepted by it following a coordinated air-sea operation off Minicoy Island following intelligence inputs, contained 300 kg of heroin.  The three boats and 19 crew were escorted to Vizhinjam, for further joint investigation. This is the second major anti-drug trafficking operation undertaken by the Coast Guard on the west coast of India during the past fortnight. On March 5, Coast Guard ships and aircraft, in a co-ordinated operation in Lakshadweep seas, had apprehended Sri Lankan boat Akarsha Duwa with six crew, off Minicoy island. 60 kg of hashish The crew admitted of carrying 200 kg of high-grade heroin and 60 kg of hashish which was jettisoned at sea on sighting of Coast Guard ships on patrol. In a similar operation in November, 2020, the Coast Guard had apprehended Sri Lankan boat Shenaya Duwa off Kanyakumari, carrying 120 kg of narcotics worth approx Rs. 1,000 crore and five weapons, according to the agency. The Coast Guard has in the past one year seized about 1.6 tonnes of narcotics worth approximately Rs. 4,900 crore. The back-to-back successful anti-narcotics operations are testimony to the smooth and cohesive flow of information among various government agencies and the Coast Guard. This set up has resulted in robust detection and response mechanism coupled with unwavering commitment of the Coast Guard to keep anti-national elements at bay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/coast-guard-seizes-heroin-worth-rs-3000-cr/article34165842.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,||34 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 found in Bengaluru||A study by researchers from NIMHANS of 176 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from international travellers and positive cases in Bengaluru has found that 34 lineages have been circulating in the city since November last year till January this year. The study, posted on medRxiv, the pre-print server, has been authored by a team of doctors from the Department of Neurovirology at NIMHANS led by Chitra Pattabhiraman. V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, and Anita Desai from the department are the senior authors. With the second wave of the pandemic having set in, the selection of genomic variants which can influence how the pandemic progresses is of growing concern. Of particular concern are those variants that carry mutations/amino acid changes conferring higher transmission, more severe disease, re-infection, and immune escape. It is in this context that the researchers studied genomes of 75 travellers and 108 local positive patients to track importation, spread, and the emergence of variants locally. “Of the 183 genomes (75 travellers and 108 locals), we were able to amplify 176 samples. We found that these genomes could be classified into 34 lineages that were either imported or circulating in this time period,” Dr Ravi told The Hindu on Thursday. “The lineage B.1.1.7 (UK variant) was the major lineage imported into the State (in 32.9% of the 176 samples), followed by B.1.36 (27.4%) and B.1 (19.2%). We identified B.1.36 (in 45 of the 103 local samples - 43.7%), B.1 (26/103; 25.2%), B.1.1.74 (5/103; 4.9%) and B.1.468 (4/103; 3.9%) as the major variants circulating in Bengaluru city. A distinct clade within the B.1.36 lineage was associated with a local outbreak in a college too,” he said. A fresh outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Bengaluru early February this year, raising concerns about the spread of variants, the threat of a second wave, and reduction in the efficacy of vaccines. “This outbreak in a college where students returned from different States was driven by related viruses belonging to the B.1.36 lineage. Only one of the six sequences from the outbreak cluster had the mutation resulting in the N440K replacement in the Spike protein,” Dr. Ravi explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/34-lineages-of-sars-cov-2-found-in-bengaluru/article34166118.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,||BJP MLAs should clarify: Siddaramaiah||A day after Health and Family Welfare Minister K. Sudhakar challenged all MLAs to take “monogamy test”, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah said if BJP MLAs are ready to accept the Minister’s statement, the Karnataka government should take legal action against them as per the provisions of IPC sections 494 and 495 and the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which have declared polygamy as illegal. On Thursday, Mr. Siddaramaiah tweeted: “@mla_Sudhakar had told that none of the 225 MLAs follow monogamy. As this statement applies to @BJP4Karnataka MLAs also, they should clarify about their marital status to the people of Karnataka”. If the BJP MLAs declined to endorse the Minister’s statement, then they should urge Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to order a probe against all the MLAs, Mr. Siddaramaiah said. “If @BJP4Karnataka MLAs are not ready to accept @mla_sudhakar’s statement, will they write a letter to @CMofKarnataka without any compulsion, requesting to initiate an enquiry against all the MLAs. @INCkarnataka has already written a similar letter to @CMOofKarnataka,” he tweeted. Dr. Sudhakar’s statement, calling for an investigation into the personal life of all the 225 MLAs of the State to find out how many of them have had extramarital affairs, created a flutter in the political circles on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-mlas-should-clarify-siddaramaiah/article34165736.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Sex scandal: woman doubts SIT’s credibility||As the Special Investigation Team is investigating the sex scandal allegedly involving former Karnataka Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, the woman who is said to be in the purported video has raised doubts over the credibility of the investigating agency and sought protection to her family. This even as Mr. Jarkiholi claimed that he had shocking evidence to show who was behind the alleged sex scandal, and will release it at the right time. The woman on Thursday released a video statement, and this is the second such attempt by her seeking protection. “I know hundred per cent that my parents would not have filed a complaint wilfully, because they know that their daughter has not committed any mistake, so there is no need for them to fear,” she has said in the video statement referring to the missing complaint lodged by the family. Noting that the safety of her parents was of utmost importance to her, she said, “Once I get to know about my parents safety, I will come before the SIT and give whatever statement that I have to and do further procedures.” She has also requested Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, State Congress chief D.K. Shivakumar, senior Congress MLA and former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar and women’s organisations to provide security to her parents. “... I somewhere have hope that I will get justice.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sex-scandal-woman-doubts-sits-credibility/article34165492.ece
26 March 2021||BENGALURU,||CD episode: woman doubts SIT’s credibility||In a major twist to the ongoing investigation, the woman in the CD scandal involving the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi released another video on Thursday in which she expressed doubts over the credibility of probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) and sought protection to her family. This is the second video released by her seeking protection. Referring to the missing complaint filed by her family, she said, “My family did not give a complaint on their own,” but did not elaborate. “Security of my family is most important,” she said, requesting Opposition leader Siddaramaiah and Congress leaders D.K. Shivakumar and K.R. Ramesh Kumar, and women’s organisations to help her. She further said the safety of her parents was important and that she would come before the SIT only after security was provided to them. “I had sent a video to the SIT on March 12 addressing the Home Minister and seeking protection. But the video was made public 30 minutes after [Mr.] Jarkiholi filed a complaint. This has raised doubts on whom the SIT is protecting,” she said in the video released a day after the legislature session was abruptly adjourned seven days ahead of the schedule following a stalemate over the CD issue. It may be recalled that the victim had earlier released a video requesting the Home Minister to provide security. In the earlier video, she had accused Mr. Jarkiholi of cheating her by promising a government job. The SIT on Wednesday took away the mobile phone of Mr. Jarkiholi to analyse the data to ascertain his communication details with the woman and others. Meanwhile, close on the heels of the release of the second video, SIT officials held a meeting to step up investigation to track down the woman. On her trail While special teams are on the trail of the woman and other prime accused since the scandal broke out, the woman releasing the second video has posed a challenge to the officials besides embarrassing them. Soumendu Mukherjee, head of the SIT, held a detailed discussion with the officials. Top-ranking officials are reportedly concerned about why the woman has not been traced, though a technical cell of the CCB is working to track her digital footprint. According to sources, the video was recorded from a device, presumably from a mobile phone, and re-recorded on a laptop. There is a person who recorded the video and identity of the person and his location is being probed. The officials are yet to find out from where the video was uploaded. Sources in the Police Department said the video was being recorded on the mobile phone and different apps had been used to upload the same. This is to mask the source of the video. The SIT chief asked the officials to ensure security to her family and question the family members again to get clues about her. Reacting to the video message, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the SIT was conducting an impartial investigation and would focus on bringing out the truth. The SIT had also questioned Mr. Jarkiholi and probing all angles, he said. The SIT is not for or against anyone but its only intention was to find out the truth, he reiterated. The investigation is on the right track and progress cannot be discussed at this juncture, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cd-episode-woman-doubts-sit-probe-credibility-in-new-video/article34165904.ece
26 March 2021||Guwahati,||In Assam, campaigning for Phase 1 ends||Campaigning for the first phase of the Assam Assembly elections covering 47 of the 126 constituencies came to an end on Thursday. The stakes for the BJP and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) are highest in this phase as the two allies had won 35 of these 47 seats in 2016. The outcome in this phase will also be crucial for the Congress, which leads the 10-party Grand Alliance. Tea plantation workers are a deciding factor in more than 35 of these 47 seats. Litmus test Phase 1 would be a litmus test for the parties on either side of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, too. While the BJP insists the CAA has no impact on the ground, the Congress made it one of its five main issues, as did the two new regional parties — Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal — that were forged in the anti-CAA agitation fire. The anti-CAA movement was initially the strongest across these 47 seats but waned with time. Many leaders spearheading the movement joined the BJP. Among the heavyweights in this phase are Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who seeks to retain Majuli, and AGP president Atul Bora and his party colleague and Minister Keshab Mahanta, who are seeking re-election from Bokakhat and Kaliabor, respectively. Three other party presidents — State Congress chief Ripun Bora (Gohpur), his AJP counterpart Lurinjyoti Gogoi (Duliajan and Naharkatiya), and Raijor Dal president Akhil Gogoi (Sibsagar) — are in the fray in this phase. Other key leaders include former Congress Minister Rakibul Hussain (Samaguri) and former BJP leader-turned-AJP general secretary Jagadish Bhuyan (Sadiya). In this phase, the Congress is contesting 43 seats, the AJP 41, the BJP 39 and the AGP 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-assam-campaigning-for-phase-1-ends/article34165445.ece

26 March 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||60% teachers’ posts in Odisha varsities lying vacant||At a time when Odisha government has launched ‘Mo College’ campaign to mobilise resources from Odia alumni, a large number of posts teachers’ posts in universities and autonomous colleges in the State are lying vacant. A reply by Higher Education Minister Arun Kumar Sahoo laid bare the state-of-the-affair of learning in institutes of higher educations in the State. There are 1,664 vacant posts of professors, associate professors and assistant professors in 12 State-run universities in Odisha. However, 1,005 vacant posts constituting 60.39% are yet to be filled up by the government. The situation in 16 State-run autonomous government colleges is equally worse. Of 1,152 total sanctioned teaching posts, 539 positions constituting 46.78% have fallen vacant. New universities The State government had recently come up with two universities — Kalahandi University and Rajendra University, Balangir and created 112 and 126 teaching posts for the two institutions. According to Minister’s reply, no single teaching staff has been appointed in two universities. Utkal University — Odisha’s premier university — had 257 posts of professor, associate professor and assistant professor. The university does not have any teachers in 126 posts. Ramadevi Women’s University was created with much fanfare few years ago. As many as 138 teaching posts were sanctioned. Total 101 posts have already fallen vacant. Ravenshaw University had 267 teachers’ posts while 179 remained vacant. Mr. Sahoo, however, said 1,028 new departments had been opened in government and private universities since 2009-10 and 1950 new teaching and non-teaching posts were created. “Situation is much worse if one starts assessing vacant positions in college level. In N. C. College, Jajpur, the sanctioned teachers’ posts is 68 whereas only 22 are managing classes of different departments. Appointments of many teachers are contractual in nature. The contractual teachers cannot show the same amount of commitment like permanent teachers when there is huge gap in remuneration,” said Santosh Tripathy, a member of Federation of University Teachers Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/60-teachers-posts-in-odisha-varsities-vacant/article34166198.ece

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||SC bats for women officers in the Army||They would be considered for permanent commission subject to disciplinary and vigilance clearance. The court said physical standards should be kept at a premium during selection. The court highlighted how one of the Army’s “administrative requirements” was to benchmark women officers, under consideration for permanent commission, with male officers who are lowest in merit. “This is arbitrary and irrational,” Justice Chandrachud, who wrote the 137-page judgment, noted. The court said the “systemic and indirect discrimination” shown in the Army’s evaluation of women officers for permanent commission seemed neutral on the face, but was founded on a structure of “oppression and domination”. Justice Chandrachud said the 15 year legal battle fought by women officers against sex stereotyping within the Army was finally won when the Supreme Court, in a judgment in February last year, recognised their right to an equal playing field with their male counterparts in the selection for permanent commission. However, the “selective” evaluation of the annual confidential reports of women officers and belated introduction of a SHAPE-1 medical criteria have undermined the Supreme Court judgment. The February judgment had forbidden the Army from casting aspersions on the abilities of its women officers, saying it was an “affront not only to their dignity as women but to the dignity of the members of the Indian Army”. Justice Chandrachud said the evaluation pattern is a product of a “formal” show of equality by the authorities towards women officers. Such a sense of equality is not “substantive”. A genuine effort to provide everyone with equal opportunity would include steps to “break the cycle of disadvantage”, measures “to promote respect for dignity and worth, thereby redressing stigma, stereotyping, humiliation, and violence because of membership of an identity group” , the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-bats-for-women-officers-in-the-army/article34165494.ece

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||In signal to China, U.S. raised India ties during Alaska talks||One reason for that is the successful holding of the virtual Quad summit between India, the U.S., Japan and Australia on March 12, seven days before the U.S.-China Alaska talks. Although the Biden administration’s message was it did not want to push any country beyond its comfort level and was willing to keep in mind their respective China concerns — hence the absence of any reference to China in the joint statement and the focus on deliverables such as the vaccines initiative — India’s immediate expression of willingness to go ahead with the summit and the “clarity” with which it put forward its agenda eased many concerns in Washington that New Delhi, amid the on-going disengagement process with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), might waver in its commitment to the grouping. If India has made clear it will not be part of any formal alliances, it has also suggested it is more willing to push the bar with China than previously. The broader reason for the smooth transition in India-U.S. relations is the new administration’s emphasis on a bipartisan approach to India and other key foreign policy issues, despite the divisiveness at home on the domestic agenda. One indicator of that was Mr. Biden’s insistence that a video prepared for the Quad summit would begin by, at the very start, acknowledging former President George W. Bush’s legacy in building the Quad, which first came to life following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. India’s familiarity with three of the key interlocutors in the new administration’s Indo-Pacific agenda — Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who chaired the meeting in Alaska, as well as the newly announced “Indo-Pacific coordinator” Kurt Campbell — has also helped. On Thursday, China’s military hit out at the Quad, describing it as a mechanism “promoted by the United States” and said it “adheres to the Cold War mentality, believes in group confrontation, is keen on geopolitical games, and uses the so-called ‘China challenge’ as an excuse to ‘form cliques’ and openly provoke relations between regional countries”. “We are firmly opposed to this,” PLA Senior Colonel and Ministry of Defence spokesperson Ren Guoqiang said. “Seeking peace, development, and seeking cooperation and win-win is the trend of the times. Anything that goes against the trend of the times and satisfies one’s own selfishness is untimely, unpopular and is doomed to failure. China has always insisted on being a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and a defender of international order. We urge the United States to take up its responsibilities and refrain from making mistakes and do more things that are conducive to regional peace and stability,” he said. On the LAC disengagement, he repeated China’s earlier statement that both sides had positively viewed the disengagement at Pangong Lake and had “agreed to maintain communication through military and diplomatic channels so as to promote the settlement of other issues” such as in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, which the next round of military talks is expected to take forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-signal-to-china-us-raised-india-ties-during-alaska-talks/article34165493.ece

According to Kurubur Shanthakumar,president of Karnataka Sugarcane Growers’ Association and part of Raitha Dalita Karmikara Sanghatanegala Horata Samiti, the farmers would be taking out “funeral procession” of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre. “We completely support the national bandh, but we will not observe the bandh in the State since Karnataka has seen four bandhs called by farmers since the COVID-19 pandemic started. We have received good response to the earlier bandhs,” he said. He also acknowledgedthat there has been no adequate planning for the bandh. “We have not been able to come to a conclusion since all pro-farmer and pro-people organisations did not holddiscussions to make the bandh a success.” Instead, he said that they would take out a funeral procession from Town Hall to Mysore Bank circle. “Similar funeral processions will be taken out in district centres across the State,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wont-observe-bandh-in-karnataka/article34165734.ece

26 March 2021||Bengaluru,||FIR against Kangana for tweet quashed||In a partial relief to actor Kangana Ranaut, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday quashed both the First Information Report (FIR) and the Tumakuru city magistrate court’s order of directing the police to register the FIR against her for posting a tweet commenting on those opposing farm laws. However, the HC remanded the matter to the magistrate court to consider afresh the private complaint, filed by one Ramesh Naik L., who had sought initiation of criminal proceedings against Ms. Ranaut. Justice H.P. Sandesh passed the order while allowing the petition filed by Ms. Ranaut questioning the correctness of the direction issued by the magistrate on October 12, 2020 to THE Kyathsandra police to register the FIR against her. The HC said that the magistrate, without applying mind on whether the averments in the private complaint constitute the offences alleged, passed a mechanical order of directing the police to investigate the matter. During the hearing, Justice Sandesh orally observed that it has become common nowadays to make such comments/allegation [on social media] and celebrities need to exhibit restrain. “Who gave you the power to make such allegations? What would you have done if some one uttered same words against you,” the Judge orally asked her advocate. Ms. Ranaut had tweeted: “People who spread misinformation and rumours about CAA [Citizenship Amendment Act] that caused riots are the same people who are now spreading misinformation about Farmer’s Bill and causing terror in the nation, they are Terrorists. You very well know what I said but simply like to spread misinformation.” Earlier, it was contended on behalf of Ms. Ranuat that the contents of her tweet has no ingredient of any of the offences, like intent to cause riot or promoting enmity between various groups or to provoke breach of peace, as was alleged in the complaint. “The tweet makes no reference to any identifiable groups. It merely refers to persons who spread misinformation deliberately to the detriment of the general public. It is pertinent to note that it is not the petitioner [Ms. Ranaut] herself that is making reference to farmers as terrorists, but the media (including news reports and other social media sources) who are creating such a reference where it does not exist,” it has been contended in her petition. It has been further contented in the petition that “...the furore being created on social media platforms against the petitioner and her tweet is not on the basis of the words of the tweet itself but on the interpretation being forcibly accorded to it by certain persons with malafides vested against the petitioner.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fir-against-kangana-for-tweet-quashed/article34165479.ece

The clearance for diversion of the forest land follows a positive public opinion secured for the project in the public hearing held earlier in January this year. The forest land in the Naini block comprises 783 hectares out of the total land of 912.7 hectares allotted to it. The advisory panel cleared the proposal on March 24. Chairman and Managing Director of SCCL N. Sridhar complimented the officials of the company for their ground work for the purpose and the advisory committee for giving its nod for diversion of the forest land. According to officials of the coal company, diversion of the forest land is a significant development for the operation of the coal block. Naini is the first coal block allotted to SCCL outside Telangana. Later, it was also allotted the New Patrapada block, also in Odisha. Following the forest clearance and positive public opinion, the management is expecting the environmental clearance for the project at the earliest – at least by June-end so that coal mining could be taken up by the end of this fiscal. The management is planning to commence the removal of overburden from October next with the hope that the environmental clearance would be granted by June-end. The CMD complimented Advisor for Naini block Vijaya Rao, General Manager Suresh, Directors of the company N. Balaram and S. Chandrasekhar and Advisor (Forest) Surendra Pandey for their efforts in taking the project forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nod-for-forest-land-diversion-for-coal-block/article34165475.ece

26 March 2021||Aruppukottai,TAMIL NADU||In the fray for the 11th time in a row||DMK legislator K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran, who is seeking re-election from Aruppukottai, is fighting his 11th Assembly poll in a row. Unlike party general secretary Duraimurugan, who has entered the fray for the 12th time on a DMK ticket, Mr. Ramachandran first entered the Assembly in 1977 on an AIADMK ticket when M.G. Ramachandran became the Chief Minister. He had joined his family’s cotton business early on and was attracted to the screen charisma of MGR. He then became the president of an MGR fan club of the then composite Ramanathapuram district. “I never had dreams of becoming an MLA. I contested the election at 28, only because MGR wanted me to fight polls,” he said. Since then, he has been a force to reckon with in the region, though he joined the DMK in 1997. Mr. Ramachandran has won six times from the Sattur Assembly seat that earned him the moniker, Sattur Ramachandran. He fondly recalls those days of campaigning being simple and straight. “We loved to do door-to-door canvassing and meeting people from every street and village. Even people used to be eager to meet the leaders and candidates as it was the only way to meet them — there was no television or internet those days,” he said. As Minister for Cooperation and later PWD in MGR’s Cabinet, he brought four minor dams to the dry areas of Virudhunagar district — Anaikuttam, Vembakottai, Golwarpatti and Kullursandhai. Having been with Mr. Ramachandran in his campaign, former Aruppukottai Municipal Chairman S. Sivaprakasam recalled that his campaign jeep would return home only after day break. With no restrictions on timings for campaigning then, he would continue electioneering throughout the night. After a nap for a couple of hours, Mr. Ramachandran would be back on the streets campaigning, Mr. Sivaprakasam said. After MGR’s death in 1987, Mr. Ramachandran won from the neighbouring Vilathukulam seat, as part of Jayalalithaa’s faction of the AIADMK. His popularity in Sattur was evident when he won the seat in 1991, repesenting the little known Anna Puratchi Thalaivar Munnetra Kazhagam, after parting ways with Jayalalithaa. “I was among the few to survive the tsunami of sympathy in that election following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi,” he said. However, soon after the election, he rejoined the AIADMK. Six years later, he joined the DMK after then leader M. Karunanidhi “liked me to be with his party.” In 2006, he was a Minister in the Karunanidhi Cabinet. After delimitation in 2009, he shifted from Sattur to Aruppukottai. “This is my 11th election and I have won eight times (losing in 1996 and 2011). This has been possible because I have always remained connected to the voters. Even when I lost elections, I went around the constituency to thank them,” he said. He takes pride in the fact that anyone can meet him any time, at his office or home, and that he knows many voters by their name. The 72-year-old said he has adapted himself to the changing times. “Now, with just a fortnight left for campaigning, we are reaching out to voters through social media,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/in-the-fray-for-the-11th-time-in-a-row/article34165616.ece
26 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Defeat AIADMK and BJP: Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday reiterated his charge that if an AIADMK candidate was elected in the April 6 Assembly election, he/she would behave like a BJP MLA in the House. Therefore, there was a need to defeat the AIADMK and BJP candidates in every constituency, he said at an election campaign in Tiruvannamalai. He alleged that the AIADMK Theni MP was behaving like a BJP MP and had Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photo on his letter pad. Canvassing votes for the former Minister E.V. Velu (Tiruvannamalai), K. Pichandi (Kilpennathur), M.P. Giri (Chengam), K.V. Sekaran (Polur), Ambethkumar (Vandavasi), Saravanan (Kalasapakkam), S.S. Anbazhagan (Arani) and O. Jothi (Cheyyar) of the DMK, he said the party had fielded candidates in all eight seats in Tiruvannamalai and urged the cadres to ensure their victory. “ Kalaignar [late DMK leader M. Karunanidhi] created Tiruvannamalai district in 1989,” he pointed out. Tiruvannamalai was a spiritual place, he said. “The DMK had made several promises related to Hindu Religious Endowments and Charitable Department – Rs. 1,000 crore for temple consecration, cable car in hill station temples, modernise temples without affecting their historicity, expand slokas in Tamils, appointment of qualified priests from all castes, concrete path for girivalam and so on,” he added. “Whenever there is an election, the parties that oppose the DMK will say that we are against Hindus. I would like to say that we are not against anyone’s religious belief. My government will respect all religious beliefs. I assure you that. Those who use religion in politics must understand that this is Tamil Nadu — Tamil people have clarity that politics is different and spirituality is different. The BJP will take 100 years to understand this – they have no brains,” he said. Pointing to the fact that the BJP released its candidate list in Hindi, Mr. Stalin said, “Their rule is a rule for Hindi speaking people. They want to impose Hindi and are trying to provide jobs for Hindi-speaking youth in Tamil Nadu and they are trying to grow through that. [Chief Minister] Palaniswami and the group may become bystanders to this, but the DMK and Tamil people won’t stand and watch.” Mr. Stalin said the party was not against the Hindi language or the north Indian States. Mr. Stalin said, “Velu has been a Minister and is managing the district for the party. He had the goodwill of Kalaignar .” Supporting Mr. Sekaran, who is contesting against the AIADMK’s Agri Krishnamoorthy, Mr. Stalin said Jayalalithaa had sidelined Mr. Krishnamoorthy for his corrupt activities. “Only after the death of Jayalalithaa, he gained prominence again and got the ticket in Polur. I am sure that the people would sideline him as much as Jayalalithaa,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/defeat-aiadmk-and-bjp-stalin/article34166426.ece
26 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||1,779 persons test positive in Tamil Nadu||On a day when another 1,779 persons tested positive for COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu, the active caseload went past 10,000 after nearly three months. Chennai, along with six other districts, accounted for over 70% of the fresh cases. The State’s active caseload was pushed to 10,487.

In Chennai, 664 persons tested positive, while three districts had 100-plus cases — Chengalpattu (162), Coimbatore (153) and Thanjavur (108). There were 89 cases in Tiruvallur, 63 in Kancheepuram, 52 in Tiruvarur, 45 in Salem and 43 in Madurai. There were no new cases in Perambalur, while the number of districts that recorded fewer than 10 cases each dropped to 10. Nine returnees — five from West Bengal and one each from Bangladesh, Gujarat, Assam and Kerala — were among those who tested positive for the infection. The State accounted for a total of 8,73,219 cases till now. A total of 11 persons succumbed to the infection, taking the toll to 12,641.

There was one death each in Kancheepuram, Thanjavur, Tiruvallur and Vellore. Among the deceased was a 47-year-old man, who had no co-morbidities. A resident of Chennai, he had symptoms of cough and difficulty in breathing for five days.

26 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A campaign rooted in Dravidian ethos||Ezhilan Naganathan, the DMK candidate for the Thousand Lights constituency, is focusing on door-to-door meetings with voters, discussing civic issues, in compliance with the COVID-19 protocols, ahead of the crucial contest with the main rival — Khushbu of the BJP. In an interview, Dr. Ezhilan says the voters in the State will support secularism and reject the policies of the Central government.   What are the key aspects of your campaign in Thousand Lights? My strategy is to meet at least two lakh voters. I am doing door-to-door meetings with members of all socio-economic strata. I am able to understand the socio- economic conditions of the people and discuss civic issues with them. I have framed a ward-wise manifesto for the constituency, identifying issues caused by the absence of people's representatives in local bodies. You have been criticised on social media for your views on your party’s ideology. What kind of reception do you get from residents while expressing similar views during the campaign? The Thousand Lights constituency has a very good platform of secularism. All residents are together, irrespective of caste or religion. Whenever you vouch for a humanitarian approach and secular credentials, which are basically the Dravidian ethos and the ultimate goal is humanism, I don’t see any trouble or disturbance in the constituency at all. If we do people’s work, it is equivalent to any spiritual work. Has your participation in electoral politics affected your fight in the front line against COVID-19? Since the start of the epidemic, I have treated over 2,000 patients. I have understood that the COVID-19 management at the community level is a different approach, focusing on norms such as mask-wearing. This campaign has provided me with an opportunity to combine my medical knowledge with various socio-economic aspects of COVID-19 management. What are the major civic issues residents have reported in the seven wards of your constituency? Residents have demanded playgrounds and community halls in each ward. They need better school infrastructure for the poor. Provision of proper drinking water, a complete revamp of drainage pipes should be done, and garbage clearance is inadequate, leading to public health problems. Water stagnation during the northeast monsoon is a challenge. Public health problems, including dengue, malaria and diarrhoea, have been reported. Many traders and entrepreneurs have lost their source of livelihood during the pandemic. Residents want redevelopment of slum tenements at 16 locations, instead of resettlement far away from the city. How do you view a direct contest with the BJP in your constituency? The Dravidian ethos is very strong in this State. The BJP cannot carry on with the same agenda of creating religious polarisation, propaganda and creating Islamophobia in the constituency and the State. Tamil Nadu is known for its secular values. We are always together. It is not easy to drive a wedge between communities in our State. Tamil Nadu people are intelligent and understand the designs of the BJP. People have understood that we have suffered because of the policies of the Centre, including NEET. Your social media posts in the past few days have focused on the learning in politics from Gopalapuram, the contribution of your grandparents to the independence movement and your proximity to former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. How have these aspects helped you contribute to electoral politics? My great-grandfather, grandfather and grandmother spent 27 years, collectively, in prison during the independence struggle. Having been born and brought up in such a family, I was curious enough to take some vital memories from many great persons about Tamil ethnicity, social justice and federalism. Kalaignar [M. Karunanidhi] was able to educate me in all spheres. Thanks to our leader M.K. Stalin, this is a wonderful opportunity to serve the people.  Tamil Nadu is known for its secular values. It is not easy to drive a wedge between communities. Tamil Nadu people are intelligent and understand the designs of the BJP||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-campaign-rooted-in-dravidian-ethos/article34166140.ece
26 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Northern suburbs register a decline in COVID-19 cases||With fresh coronavirus infections exceeding 600 a day in the city, the northern part has been recording around 100 cases a day in the last two days. According to officials, a number of areas in the northern suburbs that had earlier registered more cases had fewer numbers now when compared with the other parts of the city. In certain pockets, cases were reported in apartments, according to officials. Fresh cases in the north region, which comprises the five zones of Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram, Tondiarpet and Royapuram, has been fluctuating between 80 and 110 a day. “Overall, COVID-19 cases are on the rise in Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) limits. The daily count had dipped to less than 200 but there is a slight uptake now. There is nothing to worry about as we are registering one-sixth of the cases when compared with the peak, when we had nearly 3,000. As the daily count exceeded 500, the north reported around 100 cases in the last two days. The daily figure has been fluctuating,” an official of the GCC said. During the peak last year, both Tondiarpet and Royapuram recorded widespread transmission of the infection. Presently, Tondiarpet accounted for 30 to 40 cases a day, while Royapuram reported around 50 cases a day, he said. ‘Nowhere near peak’ “During the peak, there were around 300 cases in Royapuram. Both these areas are densely populated, with Tondiarpet accounting for a population of eight lakh and Royapuram having around seven lakh. But the fresh cases are nowhere near the number that was reported during the peak,” he added. In fact, cases in slum areas that posed a challenge earlier were almost nil now. “We had taken up focused community intervention. After the initial wave, cases substantially reduced and we are seeing no cases in slum areas,” he said. The number of tests conducted by the GCC per day in the north region stood at 2,000, an official added. “There should be no complacency. The practice of wearing masks has taken a back seat. We are enforcing norms and are imposing fines even as our awareness initiative continues.” Officials said vaccination was being aggressively carried out, with the north region accounting for 8,000 persons a day. “We have a target of reaching 10,000 a day by next week. In fact, Royapuram is one of the top performing zones in the GCC as we have reached vaccination coverage of 4,000 people a day. New cases are being reported from specific areas, especially from apartments. So, we are taking up vaccination in apartments by following the eligibility criteria of persons aged 45 to 59 years with comorbidities and senior citizens,” he said.  There is nothing to worry about as we are registering one-sixth of the cases when compared with the peak, when we had nearly 3,000  Corporation official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/northern-suburbs-register-a-decline-in-covid-19-cases/article34166149.ece
26 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Prime Minister Modi is the AIADMK’s ‘daddy’, says Stalin||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the AIADMK’s “daddy”, DMK president M.K. Stalin said on Thursday, adding that both the AIADMK and the BJP had not done anything for the people. The Assembly election on April 6 was not just an election about regime change, but an election to save the State’s self-respect, he said. Campaigning for his party’s Pallavaram, Alandur and Sholinganallur candidates at Pallavaram, Mr. Stalin said the State had been pushed to new depths in all sectors in the last 10 years of AIADMK rule. Mr. Stalin said the DMK would provide a COVID-19 relief amount of Rs. 4,000 to the people of the State on June 3, Karunanidhi’s birth anniversary. While the DMK had been asking the AIADMK government to give Rs. 5,000 per family, the government had given just Rs. 1,000. The DMK would provide the remaining amount on June 3 after coming to power, he said. The DMK president said the AIADMK government had not kept any of its promises made in its manifesto during the last election. With COVID-19 cases rising again in the State, Mr. Stalin said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had mocked the DMK, especially its general secretary Duraimurugan, when they asked for preventive measures in the early days of the pandemic. “The Chief Minister said there will be no COVID-19 cases in the State because this is Amma ’s [Jayalalithaa’s] rule. We are now seeing a second wave coming,” he said. At an election campaign in Tiruvannamalai, Mr. Stalin said if an AIADMK candidate was elected to power in the April 6 election, he/she would behave like a BJP MLA in the House. Therefore, there was a need to defeat AIADMK and BJP candidates in every constituency, he added. Canvassing votes for former Minister E.V. Velu (Tiruvannamalai), K. Pichandi (Kilpennathur), M.P. Giri (Chengam), K.V. Sekaran (Polur), Ambethkumar (Vandavasi), Saravanan (Kalasapakkam), S.S. Anbazhagan (Arani) and O. Jothi (Cheyyar) of the DMK, he urged the cadres to ensure their victory. “ Kalaignar had created Tiruvannamalai district in 1989,” he added. Pointing to the fact that the BJP released its candidate list in Hindi, Mr. Stalin said, “They want to impose Hindi and are trying to provide jobs for Hindi-speaking youth in Tamil Nadu... Palaniswami and the group may become bystanders to this. But the DMK and Tamil people won’t stand and watch.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prime-minister-modi-is-the-aiadmks-daddy-says-stalin/article34166159.ece
26 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Palaniswami will be Chief Minister again, says Ramadoss||PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Thursday said Edappadi K. Palaniswami will become the Chief Minister again as there are no negative points against him. “He (Palaniswami) thinks of people and implements schemes for the welfare of people,” he said. Mr. Ramadoss was campaigning in Royapettah for PMK’s Chepauk-Triplicane candidate A.V.A. Kassali. Mr. Ramadoss alleged that the DMK had not done anything, despite the constituency being its strong bastion. He pointed out that DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi had won from here thrice and alleged that nothing had still been done for the welfare of the minorities. “The constituency suffers from poor roads, water scarcity and lacks basic amenities,” Mr. Ramadoss said. He said the plan to clean up Cooum river was proposed and funds were allocated when C.N. Annadurai was the Chief Minister in 1967 and Karunanidhi was the Minister for Public Works, but no progress had been made and it continued to be a work in progress for many years. Now, the AIADMK government was trying to fix the issues, Mr. Ramadoss said. He pointed out that Stalin had been Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Rural Development and Local Administration, but the promise of “Singara Chennai” had not been fulfilled. “If PMK had got such opportunities, we would have made Chennai better than Singapore or London,” Mr. Ramadoss claimed and urged the voters to give the PMK candidate a chance and see how development happened. He highlighted the PMK’s manifesto, which promised free education, among other things.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palaniswami-will-be-chief-minister-again-says-ramadoss/article34166166.ece

Senior geriatrician V.S. Natarajan, who inaugurated the centre, said, “These days, due to coronavirus, people are more aware of the need for vaccination. I started a pneumonia vaccination centre in 2013 and vaccinated hundreds of elderly people. So far, no untoward incident has been observed.” A single dose of the vaccine can prevent deaths due to pneumonia. Anybody above the age of 50 can take the vaccine, more so people with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and renal diseases, he said. It also applies to those taking steroids and chemotherapy agents, Dr. Natarajan added. Pneumonia vaccination will reduce frequent visits to hospitals. Influenza vaccine can be taken by those suffering from ashthma, bronchitis or tuberculosis. The vaccine must be taken annually as the virus strain is prone to change. “If necessary, both vaccines can be taken simultaneously,” Dr. Natarajan said. Bharathi Reddy, managing trustee and CEO of Vijaya Hospital, and other members of the trust, Vasundhara Reddy, Aaradhana Reddy and chief administrative officer Viswana- tha Reddy participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-hospital-launches-exclusive-vaccination-centre-for-the-elderly/article34166141.ece

Acting on a complaint lodged by G.V. Sastry, Deputy General Manager, SBI, that M/s Khaitan Tibrewala Electricals Private Ltd., which later changed its name to M/s Khaitan Electricals Limited represented by its directors, including Sunil Krishna Khaitan, Sajjan Dabriwal and Swapan Kumar Das, mostly based in Kolkata, had submitted forged documents to cheat the lender banks, the CBI’s Economic Offences Wing here registered a case on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery, among others, and invoked provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The SBI, representing the consortium of banks, said the company directors entered into a criminal conspiracy with unknown public servants and other private persons to cheat the banks by falsifying accounts and diverting funds for other than sanctioned purposes. The unknown public servants abused their official position and allowed the accused persons to illegally divert the funds and misappropriate the funds of the banks. While the value of security was Rs. 28.08 crore, the total loss caused to the banks was the tune of Rs. 244.92 crore.

26 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Absentee voter registration explained||The Chennai District Election Officer held a meeting with representatives of political parties to explain the procedures for absentee voters. The absentee voting system has been introduced by the Election Commission to register the votes through postal ballot for those serving in essential services, senior citizens aged above 80 and persons with disabilities. G. Prakash, District Election Officer and Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner, told presspersons at the end of the meeting that the aim of the special meeting was to clear the air on the absentee voting mechanism and to bring in transparency by providing the schedule of voting to be carried out per day by the Returning Officers (ROs) in their constituency. Absentee voting, to be done through ballot voting for those who have applied through the online window, is being introduced for the first time in the State to cover all eligible voters. Mr. Prakash said the procedure involved an elaborate system wherein a set of voting equipment would be taken to those houses with prior appointments taken a day earlier in each constituency. Those who have applied would be allowed two chances to vote, and the ROs would be able to register an average of 15-17 voters a day, he added.

26 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||U.T.’s 10% quota proposal rejected, Centre tells HC||The Union Home Ministry on Thursday informed the Madras High Court of having rejected a proposal mooted by the Puducherry Cabinet in November to provide 10% horizontal reservation to government school students in admission to medical and dental courses. The court was told that the decision was taken after receiving comments from various other Ministries, including the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Appearing before Justice B. Pugalendhi, Additional Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan said the Union Home Ministry had sent a communication to the Puducherry Chief Secretary on Wednesday stating that the proposal of the Cabinet had “not been agreed to”. The submission was made during the hearing of a writ petition filed by a government school student, who had sought a direction to the Centre to approve the Cabinet decision. ‘Against social justice’ Senior Counsel P. Wilson, representing the writ petitioner Subbulakshmi, said, “This is atrocious. Such rejection is not legally tenable. It is against social justice. It is very unfortunate that the Centre has made such submission in court when the same horizontal reservation has been made available to government school students in the neighbouring State of Tamil Nadu. Reservation comes within the purview of the Puducherry Cabinet.” After hearing both sides, the judge adjourned the hearing after permitting the senior counsel to file a detailed rejoinder to a counter affidavit filed by the Union Home Ministry. The counter stated that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare was completely against grant of horizontal reservation to government school students in medical admissions because it would dilute merit-based admissions introduced through the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET). “Also, this may lead to similar/other demands from other States, undoing the reform of merit-based admission. NEET provides for uniform national standards, imbibing the principle of ‘one nation, one merit’,” the Health Ministry said and feared that students might take namesake admission in government schools to claim a medical seat. In an affidavit filed on behalf of the minor petitioner, her mother Mahalakshmi stated that her daughter had completed Class XII at Thanthai Periyar Government Higher Secondary School in March. She secured 72% marks in her Plus Two examinations and 47.95% in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET). She was confident of getting a medical seat if the Cabinet decision was implemented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/uts-10-quota-proposal-rejected-centre-tells-hc/article34166376.ece

The centre will cater to problems of the lower back, facet joint pain, sciatic pain, and neck pain radiating to the hands. The centre is equipped with radio frequency equipment and high-definition cameras to provide magnification and clear visualisation for precise high-speed burrs and ensure safe procedures for patients. The hospital has performed over 300 endoscopic spine surgeries in the last five years. Over 70 of them were done in the past year. Best-in-class treatment Hospital chief executive officer Alok Khullar said the centre paved the way for best-in-class treatment for any spine-related issues. S. Karunakaran, director of the Institute of Advanced Spine Sciences, said endoscopic spine procedures were suture-less and patients recovered fast. They could resume normal activities within three days as the blood loss was minimal, and there is not much medication. “The procedure is beneficial for high-risk patients and those suffering from comorbidities,” he said. Phani Kiran, senior consultant at the institute, said most spine problems did not need surgery but in patients with severe symptoms that do not respond to other measures, surgery might be the only option. At the launch event, several patients shared their experiences.  Endoscopic spine procedures are suture-less and patients recover fast. They can resume normal activities within three days S.

Velu’s properties as “politically motivated”. It was highly condemnable that the searches were conducted at the guest house where DMK president M.K. Stalin was staying, he said. Addressing a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Duraimurugan said there was nothing for the I-T Department to seize at the guest house. “There was only one invaluable asset there. That was our leader Stalin. He is the Leader of the Opposition today. In two months, he is going to be the next Chief Minister.” He said the searches were motivated out of fear that the AIADMK and the BJP were going to lose the Assembly election. “This is nothing but a gross misuse of power. This is not good for democracy, nor for decency,” he said. Mr. Duraimurugan said the BJP government at the Centre was using agencies like the Income Tax Department, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to threaten people, and was attempting to ensure that there is no opposition in the country. Separately, in a statement, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S.

26 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Mylapore||T. RAMAKRISHNAN   R. Nataraj of the AIADMK, who is seeking re-election from Mylapore, has accomplished a record of sorts — he is the first candidate from the party since 1977, to get re-nominated from the constituency. Prior to him, there were six AIADMK nominees who got elected from Mylapore — T.K. Kapali (1980), B. Valarmathi (1984), T.M. Rangarajan (1991), V. Balasubramanian (who won in a byelection in 1994), S.Ve. Shekher (2006) and R. Rajalakshmi (2011). But none of them were fielded by the AIADMK again in the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mylapore/article34165617.ece

26 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Direct fight between AIADMK, DMK||Kavundampalayam Assembly constituency is set to witness yet another direct battle between the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which won the first two Assembly elections after the formation of the constituency, and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). AIADMK’s P.R.G. Arunkumar, incumbent MLA of Coimbatore North who replaced party’s two-time winner V.C. Arukutty, is expected to have a tough fight with DMK’s R. Krishnan alias Paiya Gounder, who lost in 2016 for 8,025 votes. As campaigning by major parties is reaching the length and breadth of the vast constituency, voters have a range of issues and demands that they expect the next winner to address. As in the case of most of the urban areas in Coimbatore district, residents from a majority of the urban localities in the constituency complain of erratic water supply and poor roads. “We get drinking water once in 10 or 15 days. Poor roads and delay in the completion of infrastructure projects affect public movement. A large chunk of the population from Kavundampalayam are daily wagers and or do small jobs,” says A. Vetrivel from Lakshmi Nagar in Kavundampalayam. According to S.G. Suresh from Chinnavedampatti, roads dug for laying drinking water pipelines have not been re-laid for about a year. Many minor accidents have occurred due to the poor condition of roads and stray dog problem, he says. “Maintenance of law and order also needs to be improved in Kavundampalayam, Sarvanampatti and Chinnavedampatti, where chain-snatching incidents are on the rise. Important roads and junctions require surveillance camera coverage,” Mr. Suresh adds. Residents from Vellakinar, Thudiyalur, Saravanampatti and Sarcarsamakulam also complain of erratic water supply, poor maintenance of tanks and public toilets. K. Kathirmathiyon of Coimbatore Consumer Cause feels that widening of roads connecting Mettupalayam Road with Sathyamangalam Road and Thadagam Road can reduce the congestion in Kavundampalayam and Thudiyalur. “The Regional Transport Office at Thudiyalur, which now functions from a rented building, does not have adequate space for parking of vehicles. The earlier proposal to shift the RTO to Saravanampatti needs to be reconsidered,” he says. The constituency is also home to a large number of micro, small and medium enterprises, majority of them spread over Kavundampalayam, Chinnavedampatti, Saravanampatti, Ashokapuram, Vellakinar, Vilankurichi and Kalapatti. According to J. James, district president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises (TACT), more than 15,000 MSMEs function in the constituency and establishment of an industrial estate would boost their operations and productivity. He says that power outages without alert is a concern for industrial units. “Though the Tangedco implemented shutdown of sub-stations for maintenance once in three months, they are forced to carry out maintenance works such as pruning of tree branches often. This leads to unexpected power cuts of short durations,” he says. Saravanampatti in the constituency is known for the presence of IT companies. Establishment of low budget Government-run working women hostels for women employees who require paid accommodation is a long pending demand. Thadagam Valley situated towards the western end of the constituency has been seeing large scale environmental degradation in the form of illegal mining of red earth by brick kilns. Activist S. Ganesh of Thadagam says that nearly 200 brick kilns functioning in five village panchayats in the valley have been plundering red earth without obtaining any requisite permission. They also cause air pollution, he adds. Tribal settlements in Anaikatti region that saw the implementation of welfare schemes in the last few years expect more attention from the government, says Joshua G.P.N., a social worker from the region. According to members of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam, farmers in various parts of segment want the government to protect their crops from wild animals and adequate compensation for crop loss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/direct-fight-between-aiadmk-dmk/article34166187.ece
26 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Lack of waste disposal measures in Arasur creates problems for residents||Unscientific measures adopted in waste management by the Arasur panchayat on the outskirts of the city is posing serious health hazard to the people residing in the locality. In addition, frequent setting of fire to the garbage results in thick smoke temporarily blinding the eyes of the motorists, besides causing cough. The dumpyard in 34 cents of land is located close to the national highway. All types of waste are dumped at the site causing bad odour and nausea to the passers-by. Besides, frequent setting of fire to the garbage results in thick smoke blocking the visibility of the motorists. R. Aravindan a motorist said that it is time the panchayat resorts to scientific disposal of waste. Until then it should shift the dumpyard to an interior location away from Avanashi Road and human habitations. When contacted, panchayat officials admitted that the issue has been troubling residents and road users and said that as a temporary solution, tin sheets for 10 feet height would be erected and the dumpyard will be completely covered, with barbed wire fencing and iron gates. As a long term measure, the panchayat has planned to buy two acres of land from a block of 34 acre land belonging to the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Board on Saravanampatty Road to set up a scientific waste disposal facility, says Manonmani Govindarajan, panchayat president. This will be far away from the human habitations and also from the road providing a big relief to the motorists, he said. The panchayat also plans to clean up the 34 cents land on Avanashi Road to construct a shopping complex to augment the revenue of the local body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lack-of-waste-disposal-measures-in-arasur-creates-problems-for-residents/article34166173.ece
26 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Man arrested on charges of usurping business partner’s share||The Central Crime Branch (CCB) of Coimbatore City Police on Wednesday arrested a man on charges of cheating a woman, his business partner’s wife, by usurping the ownership share after her husband’s death. The man also allegedly duped the woman of Rs. 10 lakh that he took from her on the pretext of spending for business development. The arrested has been identified as S. Chandramouli, resident of an apartment on Thondamuthur Road at Vadavalli. According to the CCB, a woman named B. Lakshmi from R.S. Puram lodged a complaint on March 11 this year against Chandramouli, accusing him of usurping the business share of her husband Balasubramaniam, who died in an accident near Salem on January 4, last year. The complaint said that Balasubramaniam and Chandramouli had been running a gold covering firm named Tejaswani and Co, based at R.S. Puram, each holding 50 % share. On January 9, last year, Chandramouli obtained Balasubramaniam’s mobile phone from Ms. Lakshmi, convincing her that it was needed for continuing business operations. The woman said the phone contained several documents related to the business. But, Chandramouli returned the phone on September 24 after formatting it. The complainant alleged that Chandramouli usurped the business share of her husband using the signed documents and made his wife C. Nagalakshmi the business partner. He was produced in the seventh judicial magistrate court and remanded in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-arrested-on-charges-of-usurping-business-partners-share/article34166170.ece

A free trade agreement with the U.K. as a duty-free regime would create a level playing field with other competing countries, he said. The U.K. was one of the largest trading partners for Indian textile and clothing sector among the European countries, with 24 % share in textile and clothing Indian exports shipped to the Europe region. The U.K. has signed trade agreements with 62 countries, including competing countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. So, it is imperative that India concluded a deal with the U.K. soon, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/texprocil-welcomes-trade-deal-initiative/article34165680.ece

26 March 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||Inundation of agricultural fields a regular phenomenon here||Battlelines have been clearly drawn in Kurunjipadi assembly constituency in the district, where two former Ministers belonging to the DMK and the AIADMK are in the fray. The constituency has been witnessing one-to-one fights between these parties with the DMK winning nine times. The AIADMK breached the DMK citadel only in 1980, 1984, 1991 and 2011. The AIADMK was the first party to announce its candidate, ahead of the DMK and the AMMK. But it replaced its nominee and Cuddalore south union secretary R. Palanisamy with Selvi Ramajayam, who was the first woman Minister of the district. Ms. Ramajayam, who won from the neighbouring Bhuvanagiri Assembly constituency in the 2006 and 2011 elections, is pitted against former DMK Minister and heavyweight M.R.K. Panneerselvam. Prestigious battle In the 2016 election, Mr. Panneerselvam defeated his nearest rival, R. Rajendran of the AIADMK, by a margin of 28,108 votes. It is a prestigious battle of ballots for both the DMK and the AIADMK, with the former stretching every sinew to retain the seat. Mr. Panneerselvam is banking on the party’s strength, the rural mass, the anti-incumbency factor, price rise and corruption charges against the AIADMK. The AIADMK nominee, on the other hand, projects the welfare schemes of the Edappadi K. Palaniswami government. Although the constituency has not elected a candidate other than the two Dravidian parties yet, the lead of the DMK here has gradually declined. Kurunjipadi had given Mr. Panneerselvam the biggest margin in 1996 when he beat N. Pandarinathan of the AIADMK by 39,013 votes. In 2001, the DMK won from here by 23,863 votes. In 2006, the party’s margin came down to 1,708 votes. In 2016, the DMK won by a margin of 28,108 votes. The DMK has high hopes in Kurunjipadi this time. The constituency has a large number of farm hands and weavers, and advances in technology have hardly made any impact. The issue of excess water pumped out from NLC India Ltd. (NLCIL) resulting in inundation of agricultural fields is a regular phenomenon during the monsoon. Long-pending demand According to R.K. Ramalingam, president of Kurunjipadi Uzhavar Mandram, “Lignite mining by NLCIL in the abutting villages has resulted in borewells drying up, which in turn resulted in poor yield. Water level in several villages in the constituency has declined to a depth of 320 feet as against a depth of 60 feet a few years ago. The desilting of Perumal Eri, a major waterbody, has also been a long-pending demand.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inundation-of-agricultural-fields-a-regular-phenomenon-here/article34166375.ece
26 March 2021||DINDIGUL,TAMIL NADU||‘14,000 acres of land retrieved from DMK men’||Chief Minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami said that minorities were safe in Tamil Nadu and described the statements of DMK speakers as mischievous and misleading. Speaking at a public meeting to garner support for sitting MLA and Forest Minister Dindigul C Srinivasan here on Wednesday night, he said whenever the AIADMK was in power, not only the minorities but also all sections of people lived in peace. The law of the land was supreme and the AIADMK never interfered with the police. Asking the people whether he was right or Mr Stalin, he accused the DMK of practising double standards. Recalling the DMK’s alliance with the BJP in 1999, he asked Mr. Stalin as to why he didn’t question his father and late leader M Karunanidhi for having ties with the BJP then. ‘If the DMK was comfortable then, why did it raise doubts when the AIADMK had working relationship with the BJP,’ Mr Palaniswami asked. The DMK, he said, was out of power for 10 years. This was because the AIADMK delivered good governance. Even after the demise of late leader Jayalalithaa, the party had functioned smoothly under his leadership. Seeking votes for veteran politician and former Minister ‘Natham’ R Viswanathan, who is contesting from Natham Assembly constituency, Mr Palaniswami said that Mr. Viswanathan was a well known personality in the party and in the constituency. With his vast experience in public life, the people here would benefit if gets elected once again. The CM said that the demands of the electorate to establish an electric crematorium and a textile park would be taken up as and when the AIADMK was elected to power. Listing out a few projects implemented in the district, Mr. Palaniswami said that the government medical college and hospital coming up at a cost of Rs. 327 crore, drinking water project completed at a cost of Rs. 70 crore, solid waste management project completed at a cost of Rs. 14 crore were good for the constituency. The Chief Minister said that an anti-land grab wing was established in Tamil Nadu police since the public complained to Ms. Jayalalithaa that many DMK men were involved in land grab case. A total of 1,4000 acres of land was retrieved and handed over to rightful owners since then. Similarly, it was misleading to say that the AIADMK was anti-minorities since they were aligned with the BJP. Haj pilgrims were being given Rs. 10 crore under my leadership. A rest house was being built in Chennai at a cost of Rs. 15 crore for the benefit of pilgrims. Similarly, for those aspiring to visit Jerusalem, Rs. 37,000 was given as subsidy towards travel, he said. The AIADMK government had also earmarked Rs. 5 crore for renovation of churches in the State. He appealed to the people to think before voting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/14000-acres-of-land-retrieved-from-dmk-men/article34165649.ece
26 March 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Development, still a long way to go||Modakkurichi Assembly constituency received national attention when 1,016 farmers contested in the Assembly election in 1996 to draw the attention of the government to its charter of demands, which later led to increasing the deposit amount for candidates. The agriculture driven economy has turmeric, sugarcane, coconut and paddy as its major crops. It is irrigated by the 750-year-old Kalingarayan Canal and the Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) Canal. Arulmigu Magudeswarar temple at Kodumudi, located on the banks of River Cauvery, draws tourists from various parts of the State and also from nearby States. Erode taluk was trifurcated and Modakkurichi and Kodumudi taluks were formed in 2016. But no development has taken place in the taluks. As turmeric is the major crop, farmers demand fair price for their produce. Cold storage facilities and food processing industries never took off. Upgradation of taluk hospitals, establishing a bus stand at Modakkurichi, government college in Kodumudi, improving amenities at Magudeswarar temple for devotees, developing Karanampalayam check dam as tourist spot and a bridge across River Cauvery linking Kodumudi and Namakkal district are the key demands of people. Also, the suburban bus stand constructed at Anakalpalayam in 46 Pudur village in 2014 is yet to be put to public use. Pollution in Kalingarayan Canal continues to affect farmers in the region who are demanding strict action against the textile processing units that discharge effluents into the canal. Though vehicle flow has increased significantly on Erode – Karur road, the much needed four-laning work is yet to start on the stretch. AIADMK had won eight times, while DMK had won twice and Congress once. Incumbent V.P. Sivasubramani of AIADMK could not contest again as the seat was allotted to BJP which has fielded C.K. Saraswathi, a doctor. DMK had fielded former Union Minister Subbulakshmi Jagadeesan, who won the elections in 1977 and 1996 in the constituency. While Ms. Saraswathi seeks votes highlighting the party’s performance at national level, Ms. Subbulakshmi highlights her party’s manifesto and her contributions to the constituency during her earlier tenure as MLA and MP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/development-still-a-long-way-to-go/article34165690.ece

26 March 2021||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK and DMK are equally opportunistic: Owaisi||The All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen’s (AIMIM) electoral foray into Tamil Nadu, in an alliance with T.T.V. Dhinakaran’s AMMK has spawned criticism that its leader Asaduddin Owaisi is subverting the anti-BJP coalition as a Trojan horse. In an interview , he denies the charge and argues why he believes the DMK practices “soft-Hindutva”. Edited excerpts:  What is the goal of your alliance? It has many objectives but the important one is that the people of Tamil Nadu need, require and want a third political alliance — traditionally it has been a DMK-led front and an AIADMK one. Now, there is space for a third front to occupy the political vacuum that has been created. Mr. Dhinakaran had earlier said that he was open to aligning with the AIADMK or the BJP to keep the DMK out of power if his leadership was acceptable to the parties. But do you believe that your idea of alliance is aligned with that of the AMMK leader? When I met Mr. Dhinakaran, I asked him point blank if he was going to support the BJP. He told me, “Mr. Owaisi, I promise you we will not support the BJP. I am running a party and I want it to go ahead, I cannot support or align with the BJP because my political journey has to go very far.” Those were his actual words. So who is your greater foe — the BJP, and by extension the AIADMK, or the DMK because of your alliance with the AMMK? As far as the DMK or the AIADMK is concerned, they have aligned and shared power with the BJP. So no one is a great saint. Both are equally opportunistic and communal. Moreover, the Congress has supported the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. What does that say about their grand stand on secularism? And then, the same Congress supported the Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act (UAPA), brought by Amit Shah in July 2019 in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha — the amendments which made the Act more draconian and were used to incarcerate writers and activists. What does that say about the Congress and the DMK? You are seen as a Trojan horse undermining and subverting an anti-BJP secular alliance everywhere, and now in Tamil Nadu as well… Yeah, I know. How did [Congress leader] Rahul Gandhi lose Amethi? Because of a Trojan horse? I was not even there. And If I was a Trojan horse, why did the DMK offer to ally with me, send their minority wing president [Dr. Mastan] to my house in Hyderabad to invite me for their minority convention in Chennai and after landing in Chennai, completely deny that, despite the visuals of the meeting? They even offered me a seat, and later backtracked. That is why I say that Muslims require an independent political voice. This is a classic example where the minority wing president of the DMK has no value in his own party. That shows your disposition towards Muslims, where you don’t support your own minority wing president. The DMK-led alliance has pitched the election as an existential threat to the ideology of Periyar and not just as a battle for power. Progressive forces are looking wearily at the steady inroads made by the BJP. Where do you figure in this? The DMK is talking ‘soft Hindutva’. Look at its manifesto, promising Rs. 1,000 crore to temples and funds for pilgrimage. Is this paying homage to Periyar? Did anyone ever imagine that this would be talked of in Tamil Nadu? And what progressive forces? How is it that they were not able to stop the BJP at the national level and even let it win 300-odd seats? The Congress could not win in several north Indian States and I did not contest there. They do not have the capability and have compromised themselves to become more BJP than the original BJP itself. When I stand up and put up a candidate, does that make me backward? How would you respond to the accusation of splitting votes? This question is problematic. In a democracy, there will be candidates, unless you want a Kim Jong system. Am I a slave to the parties that I cannot contest elections? And then you lose Bihar. I have given empirical evidence that my contesting does not help the BJP. Is this turning into a feudal system where one must not contest so that votes do not get divided? It is the people’s power to decide whether they want to vote for X or Y party. But how is it that I am asked why I am contesting? If you contest, they will lose or they will win. If I contest, you should be happy that I am strengthening India’s democracy, bringing in more youth into the democratic process. What should I do? Should I only vote for you; I should not take votes and be subservient to you? Yes, I want my voice to be heard; I want to create a leadership of young Muslims, and this should be celebrated. How do you see the BJP’s Tamil Nadu manifesto? Tamil Nadu already had a cow slaughter ban in 1976. But I want to ask why the AIADMK and the DMK have not rubbished in categorical terms the cow slaughter ban of the BJP. Why are the two parties silent on this?  The DMK is talking ‘soft Hindutva’. Look at its manifesto, promising Rs. 1,000 crore to temples and funds for pilgrimage||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-and-dmk-are-equally-opportunistic-owaisi/article34165619.ece

Jaisankar   Instead of installing large cutouts, some functionaries of the AIADMK this time have come up with make-shift cutouts of leaders such as late M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa, and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. The life-size cutouts, made of thermocol, were positioned in front of a podium where Mr. Palaniswami campaigned in Karur on Wednesday. Minutes after the campaign, cadre carefully moved them to other areas where the Chief Minister continued electioneering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cutouts/article34165614.ece
26 March 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||AMMK is the alternative to AIADMK and DMK, says Dhinakaran||The true rule of Jayalalithaa was only possible under the AMMK, which was run by the “true loyalists” of Jayalalithaa, said T.T.V.Dhinakaran, here in Shoolagiri on Thursday. Taking potshots at the AIADMK candidate K.P.Munusamy, who was contesting from Vepanahalli constituency, Mr.Dhinakaran said, Mr.Munusamy has been removed from his ministership for underperformance. Mr. Dhinakaran dubbed the DMK as the “evil force” and the AIADMK as the “force of betrayal” that is trying to retain power, and urged voters to reject both the forces. “It was time to reject the evil forces (DMK) seeking power and the forces of betrayal that is trying to retain power,” Mr. Dhinakaran said. According to the him, the AMMK was the “alternative force” to the “evil DMK” and the “traitorous AIADMK” and represented the true spirit of Jayalalithaa. Toeing the AIADMK’s campaign line against the DMK, Mr.Dhinakaran alleged, “Tamil Nadu was peaceful so far, and the DMK coming to power would ruin the peace between communities.” He called upon the voters to vote for the AMMK candidate Mare Gowdu for Hosur constituency and the DMDK candidate S.M. Murugesan for Vepanapalli constituency. Later, campaigning for candidates of the AMMK-led front in Salem, Mr. Dhinakaran said the present government was a ‘tender’ government and they had committed corruption from ordinary tenders to procurement of materials for COVID-19 pandemic.  He said that Mr. Palaniswami formed an alliance with the PMK and gave 10.5% reservation temporarily to win in his own constituency. He had deceived a dominant community in his constituency, Mr. Dhinakaran said. The DMK was trying to create a perception that they would win the elections. But Mr. Dhinakaran was sure people would vote the AMMK-led alliance to power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ammk-is-the-alternative-to-aiadmk-and-dmk-says-dhinakaran/article34165682.ece
26 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘No caste, communal clashes during rule’||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday said the State had not witnessed any caste or communal clashes during his rule. Campaigning for R. Gopalakrishnan, the AIADMK’s Madurai East Assembly constituency candidate, at Othakadai here, the Chief Minister urged the people to vote for the AIADMK to continue to have peaceful governance. “It has been over four years since I took charge as the Chief Minister, after which no caste or religious clashes were reported. Under the AIADMK government, people can live peacefully and businesses can function without any hindrance,” he added. Dubbing the DMK as a party of “ruffians”, Mr. Palaniswami said there would be no peace in the State if they were voted to power. Recently, a DMK functionary had food at a restaurant in Chennai and refused to pay the bill, he said. “DMK leader M.K. Stalin threatened the shop owner rather than taking action against the DMK functionary,” he said. “Do you need such a leader?” Mr. Palaniswami asked. The Chief Minister said the DMK grabbed hundreds of acres of land from the poor, and it was the AIADMK government that returned it to the people. Mr. Palaniswami said power cuts were one of the main issues during the erstwhile DMK government. But the AIADMK government had prioritised supplying uninterrupted electricity to the people to ensure the development of the State. ‘Good infrastructure’ With the availability of good infrastructure, including electricity, many industries were willing to set up units in Tamil Nadu, Mr. Palaniswami  said. At the Global Investors Meet held in 2019, the government signed 304 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) entailing investments to the tune of around Rs. 3 lakh crore. “This will provide job opportunities to hundreds of educated youth,” he said. The Chief Minister explained the schemes announced in the party’s election manifesto and urged the public to vote for the AIADMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-caste-communal-clashes-during-rule-chief-minister/article34165628.ece
26 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Murder: wife, three others arrested||The police have arrested four persons, including the wife of the deceased V. Periyasamy, 56, of Nedumadurai, who was found murdered inside a dry well in Periyakoodakoil in the small hours of Wednesday. Police said Periyasamy who had gone out for hunting rabbit on Tuesday night had not returned home. When neighbours went in search of him, his body was found inside a well. “In her complaint, his wife P. Shanthi had said that her husband who had gone out for hunting went missing and was found dead in the well,” Tirumangalam Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vinothini said. However, during investigation it was found that Periyasamy’s nephew, C. Mokkachamy (22), who had property dispute with him, was infuriated when Periyasamy had gone to the same spot where Mokkachamy had already laid the trap. After an argument, Mokkachamy had reportedly stabbed his uncle and pushed him into the well after murdering him. The police said that the woman had suppressed the fact to the police that Mokkachamy had revealed the murder to her and handed over the husband’s mobile phone to her. Two associates of Mokkachamy were arrested for murder and the woman for attempting to hide details about the crime, the DSP said. Murder in Villapuram Meanwhile, in another incident, a 68-year-old man, R. Thangapandi, of Jaihindpuram was found murdered in Villapuram on Wednesday night. The police said that the deceased, who was running a petty shop, was returning home after work, when he was found lying on the road side near a school. Upon checking, the police found that he was hacked to death. Avaniapuram police are investigating into the motive of the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-held-for-murder/article34165641.ece
26 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK ensured peace in State, says CM||AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said the State had not witnessed any caste or communal clashes when he was at the helm. Campaigning for AIADMK’s Madurai East Assembly constituency candidate R. Gopalakrishnan at Y. Othakadai in Madurai on Thursday, Mr. Palaniswami urged people to vote for the AIADMK and continue to have peaceful governance. “In the over four years since I took charge, there were no caste or religious clashes in the State. People can live peacefully and businesses can flourish without any hindrance under AIADMK rule,” he said. Dubbing the DMK as a party of ruffians, he said if it was voted to power, peace in the State. Recently, a DMK functionary had food at a restaurant in Chennai and refused to pay the bill to the owner, he alleged. “DMK leader M.K. Stalin threatened the restaurateur instead of taking than action against the party functionary,” he claimed. “Do you need such a leader?” Mr.Palaniswami asked. Power cut issue The DMK grabbed hundreds of acres of land from poor people and it was the AIADMK government which returned those lands to the owners. Power cut was a major issue during the erstwhile DMK government. But the AIADMK government prioritised uninterrupted power supply to put the State on the development path. With the availability of good infrastructure, including electricity, many industries are willing to set up industries in Tamil Nadu. In the Global Investors Meet in 2019, 304 memoranda of understanding were signed entailing investments to the tune of around Rs. 3 lakh crore. “This will provide jobs to hundreds of educated youth,” Mr. Palaniswami said. The Chief Minister also canvassed votes for AIADMK’S Melur candidate P. Periyapullan alias Selvam; Tirumangalam candidate R.B. Udhayakumar; Usilampatti candidate P.Aiyappan; Tirupparankundram candidate V. V. Rajan Chellappa; and Madurai West candidate Sellur K. Raju. ‘DMK, A chameleon’ Speaking at Tirupparankundram constituency, Mr. Palaniswami charged that the DMK was like a chameleon which changed alliances for its convenience. “In 1999, the DMK formed an alliance with the BJP to form the government. While they did not have any issues with the BJP at that time, they are falsely propagating that AIADMK is under the control of BJP now,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami said metro rail will be introduced in Madurai while campaigning at Palanganatham.The Chief Minister explained the schemes announced in the party’s election manifesto and urged the public to vote for the AIADMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-ensured-peace-in-state-says-cm/article34165646.ece
26 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC wants review of ‘student sponsor’ scheme||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has observed that a scheme introduced by Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department to sponsor students who performed well in Class X examinations to private schools for higher secondary course may require a review. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi observed that the review needs to be done in view of the 7.5 % reservation introduced to NEET-qualified government school students in medical courses. The court made the observation while disposing of an appeal preferred by a medical aspirant N. Soundarya of Karur. She performed well in the Class X examinations and was sponsored by the State to study higher secondary course in a private school. As she had studied her higher secondary (Class XI and Class XII) in a private school, she was not eligible under the 7.5 % reservation for NEET-qualified government school students. Noting that this was a hard case, a single bench had dismissed her plea for consideration. She preferred an appeal against the order. During the course of the hearing, the State told the court that if the plea of the candidate was taken into due consideration, it would open a Pandora’s box, as there were other similarly placed candidates. After it was submitted that as per a previous order a seat was reserved in a dental college, the court said the candidate cannot be made to suffer for having performed well under the scheme. Taking note of the fact that she had performed well in NEET, the court directed the State to give admission to the candidate in the dental college in Chennai where the seat had been reserved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-wants-review-of-student-sponsor-scheme/article34166286.ece

26 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Congress cautions people against voting for NDA||Cautioning the people against voting in favour of the National Democratic Alliance in the April 6 Assembly poll, former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday said the legislation passed by Parliament on Wednesday, giving more powers to the Delhi Lt. Governor, is only a precursor to what is going to happen in Puducherry after the election. “The Delhi Union Territory’s Act was amended to give more powers to the Lt. Governor there. Now, all the decisions taken by the Delhi government have to get the approval of the Lt. Governor, making the elected representatives powerless. The legislators in Delhi, hereafter, will be at the mercy of the Lt. Governor and the same situation will unfold in Puducherry after the Assembly poll,” he said addressing a press conference with Member of Parliament V. Vaithilingam at the PCC office. Pointing out the contradictions within the NDA in the Union Territory, he said the principal Opposition party, All India N R Congress, and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have been fighting to obtain Statehood for the Union Territory. But the BJP-ruled Centre had declared its intention not to accord Statehood. The former Chief Minister asked the AINRC and the AIADMK to explain their position on the Centre’s move to give more powers to the Lt. Governor in New Delhi. The Centre would grab the power of the elected government and give it to the Lt. Governor of the Union Territory, he said. “If the BJP comes to power, the separate identity of Puducherry will be lost,” he warned. Mr. Vaithilingam said the decision of the Centre to give more powers to the Lt. Governor would invariably bring to question the necessity of holding election itself. “Some leaders in the NDA are fighting for the CM’s post in Puducherry when they are going to be powerless. If you are not going to have any say in policy-making or decision-making, what is the use of winning the election? It will be a disrespect to the people who voted for the legislators if someone sitting above the elected representatives is going to take unilateral decisions,” the senior Congress leader said. Referring to a PIL filed by a student seeking implementation of 10% reservation (the previous Congress government had taken a Cabinet decision) for government school students who have cleared NEET in medical admissions, Mr. Narayanasamy said the Union Government had stated in the court that the territorial administration had no power to take such a decision. The AINRC and the AIADMK should respond to the Union Government’s stand in court, he said adding it was a mockery of democracy that neighbouring Tamil Nadu could provide reservation for government school students in medical admissions while the Union Territory could not, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cong-cautions-people-against-voting-for-ndas-candidates/article34166379.ece
26 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Wooing voters with striking symbols||Helicopter, babywalker, cauliflower... binoculars! These may seem like images straight out of a feverish dream but in reality belong to a mind-boggling list of symbols that have been freed up by the Election Commission of India (ECI) for unrecognised parties/independent candidates taking the field in the April 6 Assembly election in Puducherry. Apart from recognisable symbols, such as the hand (INC), lotus (BJP), jug (AINRC), rising sun (DMK) or two leaves (AIADMK), voters are likely to come across an entire range of symbols, sanctioned by the ECI, for the 116 Independents out of a total of 324 candidates in the fray in the Union Territory. As per the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) (Amendment) Order, 2017, party symbols are either “reserved” or “free”. While eight national parties and 64 State parties across the country have “reserved” symbols, the Election Commission also set apart a reserve of about 200 “free” symbols for allotment to unrecognised regional parties/Independents who throw their hat into the ring. Under the rules, no two contestants can compete on the same symbol. From emblems of nostalgia, such as the gramophone and sporting symbols — tennis racket and ball, bat and football — there are several relatable mundane images, such as water tank, pressure cooker, tea filter, helmet and the phone charger. If the assigned transportation symbols include helicopter, truck and autorickshaw, candidates can also issue a metaphorical clarion call with the trumpet or the whistle. Or if one wants to woo voters with something small and sweet, there is the toffee symbol. ‘For the experience’ Independents believe that choosing the right symbol with good recall value increases their chances of getting more votes. “I was allotted the pineapple symbol,” says E. Vignesh, a youth who is contesting as an Independent in Kalapet. Though he lives in Mudaliarpet, he decided to enter the fray in Kalapet. The youngster, who works for a mobile service provider’s backend services, has no illusion about his electoral prospects. “Though I aspire to serve society, I have entered the fray more for the experience,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wooing-voters-with-striking-symbols/article34166382.ece

26 March 2021||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||‘No lockdown on the cards’||C. Vijayabaskar , AIADMK’s candidate for the Viralimalai constituency, led the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic as Health Minister. A qualified doctor, he has been projecting his performance during what he calls a trying time for the people, to solicit votes for the upcoming Assembly election. With a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in the State, he discusses preparatory measures under way to contain it and future prospects for the constituency. Excerpts: A few districts are recording a steep rise in COVID-19 cases. What plans have been drawn up to contain it? Will there be another lockdown? We are looking to curb the transmission from the primary sources. Measures to avoid overcrowding, including the closure of schools and colleges, are being taken. Public cooperation is essential to control the spread of the infection. A lockdown, as was done last year, is not being considered as of now. The public has become lax with following COVID-19 protocols, especially wearing of masks. What is being done to ensure public safety, especially during the election season? Yes, people have become relaxed, which is a major cause of worry. All candidates and organisers need to insist on wearing masks during the campaign. When I go, we make sure that people are wearing masks at every stop. I insist on people taking the vaccine. There was apprehension among the people when we began the roll-out in January. I took Covaxin and had no side-effects, not even a slight fever. We need to trust the medical experts and protect ourselves from the infection. The government was criticised for reopening schools and colleges, especially since clusters have emerged in some institutions. What do you have to say? The schools were opened only for students of Classes 9 to 12. Now, colleges and schools have been asked to revert to online classes for the foreseeable future. Compared to other countries and even our neighbouring States, we are well-equipped with all facilities to contain the spread of COVID-19. Our healthcare workers have become experts and can even offer training to others. You have been projecting your performance as Health Minister to seek votes during your campaign. The youth here have also been demanding job opportunities. Why have these not been done in the last 10 years? I focused on providing basic necessities first as this used to be a reserved constituency earlier. In 10 years, water supply under the Cauvery Combined Drinking Water Supply Scheme, good quality roads and street lights, among other amenities, have been provided. Amma Mini Clinics have been set up in several parts. The Chief Minister inaugurated an ITC Factory, where 3,700 jobs have been provided. Construction of a SIPCOT zone is under way at Malampatti and three MoUs have been signed with multinational companies for the same. Within a short period, 15,000 job opportunities would be generated for the people of Viralimalai. Moreover, the first phase of the Cauvery-Gundar river link begins here in Viralimalai. Soon, we will be able to shed the tag of being a drought-prone area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-lockdown-on-the-cards-says-health-minister/article34165602.ece

The vehicle was proceeding towards Pudukottai from Pattukottai when the team stopped the vehicle and found gold jewellery kept in various boxes. They were apparently meant to be distributed to jewellery shops. The team seized the valuables and handed it over to the Returning Officer of the Pudukottai Assembly Constituency. Official sources said the gold jewellery was seized to find out if there were any issues relating to Income Tax and Goods and Services Tax involved. A letter has been written to the Income Tax department following the seizure, the sources said adding that the seized valuables, worth Rs. 3.17 crore were deposited at the sub treasury office in Pudukottai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/6-kg-of-gold-jewellery-seized/article34165599.ece
26 March 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Drinking water scarcity is the main issue in Mudukulathur||Apart from the DMK and the AIADMK, candidates from the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, Naam Tamilar Katchi and Makkal Neethi Maiam are in the race in the caste sensitive Mudukalathur Assembly constituency in Ramanathapuram district. The constituency had elected stalwarts like Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and former Speaker and late Congress leader S Balakrishnan from 1952 to 2011. Elections were held 15 times and the Forward Block had won twice, Swatantra Party and Tamil Maanila Congress one each, three Independents, Congress had won four times, DMK and the AIADMK emerged victorious two times each. Situated in a highly dry belt, drinking water scarcity is the main issue. Though the rulers claimed that they have brought in Cauvery water, it is not fully implemented, S. Vellaichamy, a resident in Kamudi, said. A desalination plant was launched during the DMK regime at Naripayur, which too had gone defunct for various reasons. Residents demand a by-pass road for Mudukalathur, bus depot at Sayalkudi, emergency ambulance service at Kadaladi Government Hospital, among others. Though the elected representatives had promised to bring in better infrastructural facilities, nothing tangible had come in so far. Many people in Sayalkudi are engaged in jaggery production, which is famous among major markets in Tamil Nadu. The constituency has Yerwadi dargah, a memorial for Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and the Mannar Sethupathi King’s palace. The DMK has fielded Raja Kannappan (72). A political veteran, he was holding key portfolios in Jayalalithaa’s cabinet in 1991-96. In 1996, he tasted defeat in Tirupathur Assembly constituency to DMK’s Rama Sivaraman. In 2000, he floated Makkal Tamil Desam Party and got six seats as DMK’s ally. However, Mr. Kannappan lost in Illayankudi Assembly segment. After dissolving his party, he joined the DMK. In the 2006 election, he won from Illayankudi constituency but later joined the AIADMK. In 2009, the late party supremo Ms. Jayalalithaa made him contest in Sivaganga Lok Sabha election against P. Chidambaram of the Congress. After being defeated by 3,354 votes, he contested against DMK’s K.R. Periakaruppan in 2011 Assembly election but lost in the race. The demise of Ms Jayalalithaa made Mr Kannappan to go back to DMK as he did not get the expected recognition as ‘senior’ politician in the AIADMK. By organising an event at Madurai in 2020, Mr. Kannappan joined the DMK in the presence of M. K. Stalin. For the AIADMK, Keerthika Muniasamy is the candidate. A post-graduate and active in the party’s state women’s wing, she has good rapport among party workers. During the pandemic time, she had worked well in creating awareness among the people and coordinating with health and sanitary teams. Above all, her husband Mr. Muniasamy is the AIADMK’s district secretary, who is known as accessible within and outside the party. Being a woman candidate and popular among rural and urban segments in the constituency, she has been pinning hopes from all women to cast their votes on the two-leaves symbol. However, the AMMK had fielded a former MLA Murugan as its candidate, who is set to split the votes of the AIADMK. In the highly caste sensitive pocket, when the Election Commission had announced reclassification of constituencies, there were plans to drop Mudukalathur and make Kadalai as the Assembly segment. However, the people from the belt raised objections to it and said the name Mudukalathur was important since Thevar had won from here following which the proposal was dropped. Apart from the three candidates, the NTK has R Rahmath Nisha and Navapanneer is contesting on Samathuva Makkal Katchi, an ally of MNM.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drinking-water-scarcity-is-the-main-issue-in-mudukulathur/article34165637.ece
26 March 2021||RAMESWARAM/COLOMBO,TAMIL NADU||Sri Lankan Navy arrests 54 fishermen from State||In one of the biggest arrests of Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy in recent months, 54 fishermen from Tamil Nadu were arrested and five of their fishing vessels, “poaching close to Sri Lanka”, were seized, the Sri Lankan Navy said on Thursday. Around 20 fishermen from Thangachimadam, 20 from Nagapattinam and 14 from Karaikal were arrested in the early hours of Thursday. Three separate patrol units apprehended the fishermen on charges of engaging in illegal fishing, using the “bottom-trawling” method, at three different points on the coastline off Mannar, Jaffna and Mullaitivu, the navy said. The fishermen were handed over to the authorities for “further legal action”. The two mechanised boats carrying about 20 fishermen from Thangachimadam were reportedly held by the Sri Lankan Navy personnel near Neduntheevu. According to Fisheries Department and Central agencies, preliminary inquiries revealed that nine fishermen from Thangachimadam had gone on a boat owned by Mariasingam of Valasai Street and 11 others had ventured into the sea in the boat owned by Subramani of Rajiv Gandhi Nagar. Over 500 boats had ventured into the sea from Rameswaram jetty on Wednesday. Fishermen leader Sesu Raja said they were shocked to hear that 54 Tamil fishermen had been held for crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line. Official sources said fishermen from Nagapattinam and Karaikal, who were fishing near Katchatheevu, were also arrested. After the quarantine period, the fishermen would be produced before courts. The fishermen leaders in the coastal districts have appealed to the Central and State governments to take steps to bring them back safely. In a statement, the Sri Lankan Navy said the “illegal entry” of foreign fishermen into Sri Lankan waters and the use of prohibited fishing methods “seriously threatened” the island’s marine ecosystem and endangered the livelihoods of fishermen living in the north.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sri-lankan-navy-arrests-54-fishermen-from-state/article34165633.ece

26 March 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||It is a close contest in Tirumayam yet again||One of the backward regions in Pudukottai district, the Tirumayam Assembly constituency is witnessing a close contest between two sons of the soil from the two major Dravidian parties. Former Union Minister and sitting Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MLA S. Regupathy is in the fray for the second consecutive time from this constituency locking horns with the AIADMK candidate P. K. Vairamuthu. This is the third consecutive time that Mr. Vairamuthu has been given the ticket by the party high command to contest from the same constituency from where he won in 2011 but tasted defeat in 2016. Encompassing three unions- Tirumayam, Arimalam and Ponnamaravathy- the Tirumayam constituency is essentially a rain-fed region where agriculture is the main vocation. “Waterbodies get filled up only where there is a good spell of rain forcing the farming community to depend on borewells for cultivation of crops. This has resulted in a sharp drop in groundwater table to about 200 feet over the years worrying the farming community of this drought-hit constituency,” says P. Puviarasu, a resident of Ponnamaravathy. Tirumayam, a town of religious and historical importance housing the famed Sri Sathyamurthi Perumal Temple which is one of the 108 Divya Desams, has been facing drinking water problem for long, forcing the residents to purchase packaged water, says M. Kulandairaj, the district president of Neer Nilai Mattrum Sutru Soozhal Paadhugappu Vivasaya Sangam. Encroachments in waterbodies and streams have persisted in various places in the wake of official inaction. Large extent of farm lands have turned into real estate plots due to absence of good spell of rains for several years. Irrespective of the party affiliation, the next people's representatives should ensure that encroachments in waterbodies should be removed to protect the farming community and the people at large, he says. The constituency also lacks avenues for educated youth to secure employment. Barring the BHEL Power Plant Piping Plant at Tirumayam which went on stream in 2013, there is no industry in the constituency necessitating the educated youth to venture out for greener pastures. Many from in and around Ponnamaravathy areas have left for Tiruppur to work. The absence of a government arts and science college at Tirumayam or anywhere in the constituency has been felt for long. Youth have to travel to Pudukottai or neighbouring Sivaganga district for higher education. The constituency has not witnessed any significant development over the years and continues to remain a backward region in Pudukottai district, claims Mr. Puviarasu. The constituency has a sizeable presence of Mutharaiyars especially in Arimalam and Ponnamaravathy unions besides Kallars, Adi Dravidars and those belonging to other communities. Both Mr. Vairamuthu and Mr. Reghupathy, who is also the DMK south district in-charge, are well-known faces. Mr. Regupathy had won from the same seat two decades ago in 1991 when he was in the AIADMK then and went on to become a Minister in the Jayalalithaa -headed cabinet at that time. Later, he switched over to the DMK and became a Union Minister of State for Environment and Forests during Congress-led UPA regime. The 2016 elections at Tirumayam turned out to be a very close contest between Regupathy and Vairamuthu. After a stiff fight Mr. Regupathy managed to win by a very narrow margin of 766 votes. The entry of K. K. Selvakumar, founder president of the Veera Mutharaiyar Munnetra Sangam who is contesting as an Independent candidate is being seen as interesting development in the upcoming electoral battle at Tirumayam given the sizeable population of Mutharaiyars across the constituency. In all, 22 candidates, including Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam and Makkal Needhi Maiam, are in the race, which could end in a photo finish this time too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-is-a-close-contest-in-tirumayam-yet-again/article34165598.ece
26 March 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Campaigning picks up heat in Tiruchi||With just 11 days left for the polling, political parties and candidates are on top gear to reach out to the voters. Though the AIADMK has fielded candidates in eight constituencies out of nine constituencies in the district, leaving out Lalgudi constituency to the Tamil Maanila Congress, where D.M. Dharmaraj is contesting on the Two Leaves symbol. Similarly, the DMK has fielded its candidates in seven constituencies, leaving Tiruchi East to Christhuva Nallenna Iyakkam and Manapparai to Manithaneya Makkal Katchi. However, the candidates fielded by them are contesting on the rising sun symbol of the DMK. Besides them, Makkal Needhi Maiam, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam and Naam Tamizhar Katch have also fielded their candidates. The candidates, who spent considerable time, soon after their nomination, in meeting influential persons in their constituencies, have now begun street-by-street and door- to-door canvassing. Though the usual festivities associated with the elections are missing mainly due to the strict implementation of model code of conduct, a few streets are dotted with the flags of political parties. The candidates of AIADMK and the DMK have set up election offices in every ward and village in the district. Among the candidates, the AIADMK and the DMK have taken a lead in reaching out to the voters in some way or other. Most candidates, begin their campaign early in the morning. Braving scorching sun, they meet the voters accompanied by drum beats and bursting of crackers. While the promise of washing machine has taken the centre stage of the AIADMK campaign, the promise of Rs. 1,000 as cash aid for women family heads tops the campaign agenda of the DMK. The leaders of political parties have started visiting the district one after another. Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Hassan campaigned for two days in Tiruchi and neighbouring districts to muster support for its candidates. DMK leader M. Kanimozhi campaigned for her party candidates in different parts of the district on Tuesday. DMK president M. K. Stalin will visit Srirangam on Friday to introduce his party’s candidates before leaving for Karur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/campaigning-picks-up-heat-in-tiruchi/article34165606.ece

26 March 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||ECI lacks teeth to curb atrocities of ruling party: Thirumavalavan||Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) president Thol. Thirumavalavan on Thursday expressed serious concern over the lack of powers of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to curb the atrocities unleashed by the ruling party in the State. Talking to presspersons after releasing the party’s election manifesto, he said the ECI was more keen about holding the election alone. “The ECI has no teeth to prevent the atrocities of the ruling party, although it does have limited powers to seize cash carried by the public and traders,” he said. The attacks by the Sri Lankan Navy on Tamil Nadu fishermen were continuing because of the tacit support extended by both the Central and State governments, he said, adding that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was against the welfare of Tamils. Mr. Thirumavalavan called upon the Centre to take immediate steps to rescue the fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy and to retrieve Katchatheevu.  Manifesto highlights The VCK said it would strive for the reformation of Centre-State relations and strengthen the principles of federalism by nurturing State autonomy. In its election manifesto, the party also called upon the Centre to take over the debt burden of the State. The manifesto also demanded the repeal of maritime-related laws and to protect the interests of Tamil Nadu fishermen, who had been facing attacks at the hands of the Sri Lankan Navy. The party said education should be made a State subject. The manifesto also proposed a stringent law against the rising incidents of caste killings. It demanded that the provisions of the SC/ST law be implemented in letter and spirit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eci-lacks-teeth-to-curb-atrocities-of-ruling-party/article34165634.ece

Balasubramanian as Vice-Chancellor of Tamil University, Thanjavur, invalid . A single bench had held that the Search Committee was constituted in violation of University Grants Commission regulations and provisions of Tamil University Act, that said that persons nominated to the committee should not be a member of any of the authorities of the University. The judge had directed the State and the UGC to reconstitute the Search Committee. Preferring an appeal against the order, Balasubramanian said that two members nominated to the Search Committee were formerly associated and were not present authorities of the University. Allowing the appeal filed by Balasubramanian, a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi observed that no materials were produced against the members of the Search Committee to prove any bias. The judges said that they did not find any legal malice in existence. The assessment made by the committee was unbiased and done on a comparative basis. Such assessment cannot be questioned in the absence of any concrete material. The court said that it did not find any merit on the objections made on the constitution of the committee. The words ‘shall not be connected with the University or College or recognised institution of the University’ cannot be stretched by any imagination to mean that an ex-Syndicate member and ex-Vice Chancellor would be disqualified from the member of the Search Committee.

An Assistant Returning Officer would be assigned to handle all the work related to postal ballot voting by absentee voters.  On Thursday, a team of officials visited the homes of those who had submitted 12-D forms in various parts of Ambattur and received their ballots in a postal ballot box. After fulfilling the procedure, the electors were handed ballot sheets, and they were offered privacy for a few minutes to affix a tick against the candidate of their choice. No agent of any political party was present. However, in some cases, spouses were seen along with the electors while they were casting the ballots. “Every elector would be provided with a list of candidates for reference before casting his/her postal ballot,” Mr. Sahoo said.

In a memorandum submitted to Collector V. Vishnu on Thursday, association district secretary T. Babu Selvan said security arrangements and amenitites such as toilet and drinking water facility should be made in places where teachers, who had to be at their polling stations on the previous night (April 5), stayed. Since polling would end only at 7 p.m. on April 6, the polling personnel would have to stay put even after 10 p.m. and beyond in order to handover electronic voting machines and other material. Hence, special buses with police protection should be operated from the polling stations in remote areas to the nearest town or places of their choice. Police personnel should be deployed at all bus stands on the night of April 5 to ensure safety of the polling staff. The postal ballots meant for polling personnel should be given at least during the second phase of training. Those who produced medical certificate should be exempted from poll-related work. Since some teachers did not receive intimation regarding the training, they did not attend the session. But they had been asked to render explanation. The notices should be withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-for-special-buses/article34165644.ece

26 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Alert in North Karnataka as cases rise||With COVID-19 cases rising in Maharashtra, officials have sounded an alert in North Karnataka districts. There is some panic among residents of the border districts after the State witnessed 10 deaths on Thursday and Belagavi registered the first COVID-19 death after three months. The quantum of testing and vaccination would be increased by nearly 40%, say Health Department officials. While Belagavi and Kalaburagi have been asked to increase testing to 3,000 per day, Bidar and Vijayapura have been asked to raise it to 2,000 per day. Vaccine targets are being revised too. In Belagavi, officials had set a target of 4.4 lakh vaccinations, as per the earlier cut-off age limit of 60. But now, with the Union government asking those above 45 to get vaccinated, the target will be revised to around 18% of the district population. “That means we will need to administer the vaccine to nearly nine lakh people. There are 126 government hospitals and 20 private hospitals where the vaccine is available. We are asking each hospital to submit a utilisation certificate before putting an indent with the Central warehouse for vaccine supply,” a Health Department officer said. In Vijayapura, officers have stepped up vigil on the border. “We are not only increasing checking on the border but are also trying to find out if people cross the border using minor roads,” a senior officer said. Vijayapura Deputy Commissioner P. Sunil Kumar has urged more people to get vaccinated. “Of the 1.86 lakh senior citizens in Vijayapura district, only around 25,000 have got the vaccine. This should increase,” he said. He has issued orders banning public celebrations of Holi across the district from March 28 to 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/alert-in-north-karnataka-as-cases-rise/article34165738.ece

26 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pandemic exposed the flip side of online mode of teaching, learning||A year ago, parents were urging their children to stay away from their phones and computer screens. The lockdow, which was imposed after the pandemic began to spread, changed the face of education and the way children are taught. Suddenly, parents were scrambling to get their hands on laptops, smartphones or any device that would allow their children to access online learning modules. Just as schools were opening their campuses to students, the second wave of COVID-19 is threatening to throw a spanner in the academic calendar. Investments & returns While schools and parents have made a lot of investments on tools to make online learning effective, the results have not been desirable. Srinivas C., who works as a driver and has a son who studies in class five in a private CBSE-affiliated school in Bellandur said that his son had not picked up new skills, and had even forgotten what he learnt in his previous classes. “I worked hard and bought a smartphone worth Rs. 10,000 for his online classes, but he is not interested in online classes. I cannot blame him as it is easy to get distracted at home,” he said. He added that teachers acknowledge that many students are in the same boat. “Making matters worse, Internet connectivity is a matter of concern and my son sometimes tends to miss out on a large chunk of classes,” he said. Schools and college managements are doing everything they can to conduct bridge courses so that students can move on to the next grade, but COVID-19 second wave, has got everyone worried. Digital divide While a significant number of students in private institutions could get on to the Internet, many of their peers in government schools had no online classes. Sanchitha S., a class nine student of a government school, said they had the Vidyagama programme at the beginning of the academic year which was stopped till January. “From October to January, we did not have an academic schedule and we just had to complete assignments and worksheets. I did not understand concepts and I only copied lessons from my textbook,” she said. A study by Azim Premji University found that children not only missed out on the regular curricular learning they would have acquired had schools remained open, but were also ‘forgetting’ what they had learned in previous academic year. Rishikesh B.S., associate professor, Azim Premji University said the impact on academics for the 2020-21 academic year was severe. “There is a need to do things differently in the coming academic year. One of the lessons the pandemic has taught us is that classes can continue amidst precautionary measures. Clamping down classes is not the solution. We can conduct classes with all protocols in place and heightened alertness,” he said, and added that school managements and teachers need to get out the old way of thinking and schools need to provide all their resources to ensure that students have access to learning in different ways.  (This is the third of a series on how the pandemic has affected the lives of people across sectors a year after the lockdown)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pandemic-exposed-the-flip-side-of-online-mode-of-teaching-learning/article34166124.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Induction of Sriramulu, Surana into core committee raises eyebrows||The all-crucial core committee of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit was reconstituted on Thursday by dropping two prominent leaders and inducting four new leaders. Induction of some leaders has raised eyebrows. Senior BJP leaders C.M. Udasi and Arvind Limbavali were dropped from the core committee and Deputy Chief Ministers C.N. Ashwath Narayan and Laxman Savadi, senior Minister B. Sriramulu, and one of the 10 vice-presidents of the party Nirmal Kumar Surana were inducted. While the induction of the two Deputy Chief Ministers is seen as a natural progression, it is the induction of Mr. Sriramulu and particularly low-profile leader Mr. Surana that has raised eyebrows in the party. “The induction of Mr. Surana is a clear assertion of the dominance of national general secretary (Organisation) B.L. Santhosh,” a close aide of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said, even as a senior party functionary concurred with the reading. ‘A recognition’  A former MLA, Mr. Surana had identified with the anti-Yediyurappa camp and was sacked by the party as vice-president to quell factionalism in 2017 over Sangolli Rayanna Brigade fiasco. One of the first decisions Nalin Kumar Kateel took as State president was to reinstate him in 2019. Mr. Surana presently holds the charge of party affairs in poll-bound Puducherry, where he is credited with successfully toppling the Congress government. “Mr. Surana has proved his mettle in Puducherry and his induction is a recognition of that,” said one of his close associates. Political importance Mr. Sriramulu, a senior Scheduled Tribes leader, was tipped to become Deputy Chief Minister during the 2018 Assembly polls campaign, but was denied that post after the BJP came to power. He was recently stripped of the Health and Family Welfare portfolio amid the pandemic, which had not gone down well with him and his induction into the core committee is seen as a recognition of his political importance. Moreover, he presently holds the charge of Social Welfare at a time when there are rising demands for reconstituting the reservation matrix, a tricky political question. Meanwhile, the rest of the core committee — Mr. Kateel, Mr. Yediyurappa, Union Ministers D.V. Sadananda Gowda and Pralhad Joshi, the former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar, former Deputy Chief Ministers K.S. Eshwarappa and R. Ashok, Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, and State general secretary (Organisation) B.P. Arun Kumar — has remained unchanged. Arun Singh and D.K Aruna, in-charge and co-in-charge of the party affairs in the State, respectively, and C.T. Ravi, national general secretary hailing from the State, have been made special invitees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/induction-of-sriramulu-surana-into-core-committee-raises-eyebrows/article34165907.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Don’t use Assembly to settle political scores: Speaker||With the Opposition Congress stalling the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly during the Budget session, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri told the Congress members not to use the Assembly as a platform to settle political scores. At a press conference here on Thursday, Mr. Kageri expressed displeasure over the manner in which the Opposition stalled the debate on the State Budget, drinking water, electricity, and on other Bills, and said it was natural that political parties have divergent views on matters in democracy. But it was not a good precedence to use the House for sledging on political issues, he said. The Congress stalled the debate on the Budget seeking a probe monitored by the Karnataka High Court Chief Justice into the CD scandal in which the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi is accused of sexually exploiting a woman by promising a government job.  Right of other members One party, by stalling the business of the House, also curtailed the right of debate of other members. “I am pained by the conduct of the Opposition,” he said. If this situation continued, parliamentary debates would reach their worst situations. During the Congress dharna, the Speaker said the House belonged to all the 225 members and not just to members of the Opposition parties. Disturbing the conduct of the House by staging dharnas was against the spirit of the Constitution, and people who voted legislators, too, would not accept it in democracy. The Opposition’s duty was providing constructive suggestions on the functioning of the government, the Speaker said. On the Congress complaint related to Health and Family Welfare Minister K. Sudhakar’s challenge to all MLAs to take “monogamy test”, he said he would look into it and take appropriate action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dont-use-assembly-to-settle-political-scores-speaker/article34165910.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Is govt. taking steps to get people in slums vaccinated, asks HC||Observing that administration of COVID-19 vaccination to citizens is now key in controlling the spread of the infection, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday asked the State government to inform whether it is taking any measure to persuade people living in thickly populated vulnerable areas to take vaccine. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar passed the order while hearing PIL petitions related to issues that cropped up during the lockdown and unlock periods, and implementation of guidelines issued to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Pointing out that there are a large number of people living in slums and construction sites as major infrastructure projects are under way, the Bench said the question is whether the State government should make special efforts to persuade those persons, who are more vulnerable to get COVID-19, to take vaccine as per the protocol fixed by the Central government. Perhaps it will be the measure in the right direction to curb the spread of COVID-19 when the number of positive cases are on the rise in Karnataka, particularly in Bengaluru Urban district, the Bench observed. Lapse by airlines On queries made by the court during an earlier hearing on the measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the government told the Bench it was noticed that airlines were allowing passengers to fly to Karnataka without mandatory negative RT-PCR certificate from the flagged states.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/is-govt-taking-steps-to-get-people-in-slums-vaccinated-asks-hc/article34166128.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Signature drive to seek action against Yatnal||A letter to the party high command seeking action against dissenter BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal was circulated and signed by several MLAs at an informal legislators’ meeting with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa at his residence on Thursday evening, multiple sources said. The meeting saw over 60 MLAs, including several Ministers, participate. While sources in the Chief Minister’s camp claimed almost all MLAs who attended the meeting signed the letter, The Hindu could not independently verify this claim. Mr. Yatnal, who has turned a bitter critic of the Chief Minister, was served a show-cause notice by the disciplinary committee of the party high command over a month ago. But that has done little to silence him. Taking the Chief Minister head-on, he has repeatedly made allegations of corruption, deviation from party ideals and family rule, and speculated on leadership change. The signature campaign comes in the wake of his recent statement speculating on leadership change after the byelections. The Chief Minister’s camp is rankled at the delay in the high command taking disciplinary action against him. M.P. Renukacharya, political secretary to the Chief Minister and who has publicly criticised Mr. Yatnal, spearheaded the signature campaign, sources said. Mr. Renukacharya told mediapersons, “All MLAs have condemned statements by Mr. Yatnal and have expressed support to the Chief Minister.” He, however, remained silent on the signature campaign. ‘We discussed bypolls’ Speaking to mediapersons after the meeting, Mr. Yediyurappa said the meeting was attended by over 60 MLAs and recent political developments were discussed. “We discussed the upcoming bypolls. MLAs also discussed some of the issues they face in development works of their constituencies and I sorted out a few issues,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/signature-drive-to-seek-action-against-yatnal/article34165909.ece

26 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Notice to govt. on PIL seeking housing for homeless by 2022||The High Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition seeking direction to provide housing to around 39.77 lakh eligible homeless/siteless persons living in urban and rural areas by 2022 as per the schemes announced by the Union government. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, passed the order on the petition filed by Mohamed Ikbal of Bengaluru. The petitioner has alleged that though the Union government has announced housing for all by 2022, the process of providing house for eligible persons belonging to below poverty level and economically weaker sections is not being implemented effectively. “Though housing projects are going on for the last several years, eligible homeless/siteless have remained shelterless.

The local people noticed the idol while extracting sand on the bank of river Hemavathi on Tuesday. The idol suffered dents as it was hit by an earthmover employed for sand extraction.

Kumar H.C., curator of the Archaeology Museum in Hassan, visited the spot on Thursday. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Kumar said the idol had been kept in the premises of the Chennakeshava temple, which is being renovated, in the village. “Barring minor dents, the idol is in good condition. I will submit a report to the Director of Museums about the idol and seek his directions for preserving it”, he said. Appeal He also interacted with the villagers and appealed to them to hand the idol over to the museum. “As broken idols cannot be worshipped, I have appealed them to hand it over.

The villagers have kept it in a secure place”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/idol-found-during-sand-extraction/article34165889.ece

Kumaraswamy has termed the police case against Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait an “attempt to silence” the voice of farmers. Mr. Kumaraswamy tweeted criticising the case against Mr. Tikait on charges of making provocative speeches in Shivamogga and Haveri. In his tweets, the JD(S) leader said there was nothing provocative in Mr. Tikait’s statements calling upon farmers to stage protest against the anti-farm laws in Bengaluru. “It is well within the rights granted by the Constitution to take up struggles and to give a call for struggle. Mr. Tikait did not call for assaulting or killing”, he said and demanded the cases be withdrawn. Mr. Kumaraswamy wondered how many BJP leaders would have cases if the police were to register cases for provocative speeches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kumaraswamy-comes-out-in-support-of-tikait/article34165746.ece

Revanna, on Thursday, alleged that officers of Hassan Urban Development Authority were allowing many illegal layouts to come up on the outskirts of the city. He said at a press conference that the officers had been allowing layouts without even checking the availability of power supply and drinking water supply.

26 March 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Plan to move HC against cases involving Rakesh Tikait||Terming the criminal cases slapped on farmers leader Rakesh Tikait at Shivamogga and Haveri police stations as an afterthought action, Congress leader and former legislator B.R. Patil said that it was a misuse of power by the ruling BJP and he would approach the High Court of Karnataka seeking quashing of the First Information Reports (FIR) under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code. “There is nothing in Rakesh Tikait’s speech during the Shivamogga and Haveri farmers agitation that could attract the provisions of Section 153 of Indian Penal Code [Wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot]. The farmers leader asked the people to protest against injustice and fight for the complete repeal of the anti-farmer laws recently enacted by the Union and State governments. With such repressive actions, the BJP is attempting to curb the Constitutional rights of people to fight injustice. It is clearly a misuse of power by the ruling BJP and we would move the High Court seeking quashing of the FIRs filed against Mr. Tikait,” he said. Pointing to the delay in registering the FIR against Mr. Tikait, Mr. Patil said that it was an afterthought action taken after the Union government pressured the State government. “If the police found something wrong with Mr. Tikait’s speeches, they could have filed the FIRs immediately and arrested Mr. Tikait who was in the State for three days. They filed suo motu FIRs only after the farmers leader left Karnataka. The BJP may think that it would curb the farmers movement by implicating leaders in false cases. But it won’t happen as more repression is making the farmers movement stronger,” he said. Soil for memorial On the resolution of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a conglomerate of different farmers organisations leading the movement on the Delhi border, to collect soil from different places across India for building four martyrs memorials in Delhi in the memory of farmers who died during the course of the ongoing agitation, Mr. Patil said that he would hand over to farmers leaders in Delhi soil collected from different places in the State for the purpose. “Farmers associated with Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha recently marched on foot from Basavakalyan in Bidar district to Ballari opposing the anti-farmer laws and expressing their solidarity with farmers agitating on the Delhi border. They collected soil from different places en route . Soil from Nargund and Haveri where agitating farmers were killed in police firing in the past were also added to it. I am carrying the pot of soil to Delhi,” Mr. Patil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/plan-to-move-hc-against-cases-involving-rakesh-tikait/article34165740.ece

Kumaraswamy on Thursday claimed that the BJP sells tickets to contest the byelections to those who offer the party the highest amount of money. He was speaking to media persons at Basavakalyan on Thursday, after participating in the nomination filing of JD(S) candidate Syed Yasrab Ali Quadri for the byelections to the Basavakalyan Assembly Constituency to be held on April 17. “No one [party] can compete with the BJP; the amount of money that is being spent by the BJP is unimaginable,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said, and added that it is extremely difficult to match and this will lead to politics being limited to a certain few. What the BJP is doing is a systematic destruction of democratic and constitutional values with a single aim of eliminating the opposition completely, he said. One seat Mr. Kumaraswamy clarified that the JD(S) will not contest the bypolls to the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency and Maski Assembly segments; instead, we will limit ourselves to a single seat at Basavakalyan Assembly segment and put in collective efforts to guide the party to victory, he added. Replying to a question, the former Chief Minister said that there is a threat to the victim of the CD sex scandal allegedly involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkholi. “If she does not have faith in the government, she should either approach the court or seek Opposition leader Siddaramaiah’s help.” Mr. Kumarswamy accompanied by Bandeppa Kashempur, MLA, visited the Anubhava Mantapa and Hazrath Raja Bagh Sawar Dargah to pay obeisance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/basavakalyan-bypoll-bjp-selling-ticket-to-aspirants-says-hdk/article34165743.ece

Naveen Bhat on Thursday asked banks to ensure that the survivor of the deceased depositor under the Union government's PMJJBY, PMSBY schemes got payments due to them hassle free. Such claimants should not be put into inconvenience without any reason, Mr. Bhat, who also heads the Udupi District Level Review Committee for Banking Development said. Speaking at the quarterly meeting of the committee, he said that banks should devise a model operational procedure for settlement of claims.

Speaking at an awareness programme about the five important goals of Poshan Pakhwada of the Poshyan Abhiyan, Dr. Durgaprasad said that during menstruation, women, on an average, lose about 120 ml of blood every month, which turns out to be about 1 gram of haemoglobin. Women, more so pregnant and lactating mothers, have the right to have haemoglobin level at 15 grams. “You (anganwadi workers) should work towards achieving this,” he said. Maintaining good haemoglobin level was among the important goals of Poshyan Abhiyan designed to prevent complications for pregnant women and also neonatal deaths. A nutritional diet, which is prescribed by considering locally available grain and fruits, helps in keeping a woman and her child in good health. Pregnant women and lactating mothers should eat groundnut, leafy vegetables and consume milk, cheese and curd. Eating oats, eggs, beans and fruits such as banana, orange and pomegranate is also helpful. Those with diabetes and high blood pressure should take care in consuming food as advised by doctors. “Pregnant women should be made aware of the need to consume nutritious diet in the interest of child growing in the womb,” he said. Earlier, self-help group members and anganwadi workers took out an awareness jatha from Urwa Market to the zilla panchayat auditorium. Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Kumara and Deputy Director, Women and Child Welfare, T. Papa Bovi, flagged off the jatha. District Officer, Integrated Child Development Services, C.K.

The Mangaluru South Police have now arrested Gangadhar, an onion trader, on the charge of sexual assault, after registering the woman’s complaint. On March 23, 52-year-old Yashoda K., a resident of Bolar, filed a complaint with the Mangaluru South Police stating that her husband [Gangadhar] has been abducted by some persons and forced to marry a 22-year-old Muslim woman. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Mangaluru division, termed this incident as a case of Love Jihad and had sought special investigation. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar told reporters here on Thursday that the investigation team traced the 22-year-old woman after the complaint of abduction filed by Yashoda. Mr. Kumar said that the 22-year-old woman, a native of Puttur and a mother of a child, had lost her husband in an accident recently. Gangadhar reportedly introduced himself as Abdul Anees to her. After assuring her of marriage, Gangadhar is said to have raped her. When she became pregnant, Gangadhar admitted her to Government Lady Goschen Hospital here for terminating pregnancy. However, she had health problems. A few days ago, Gangadhar formally married the 22-year-old woman. The Mangaluru South Police traced Gangadhar and arrested him for an offence under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. Mr. Kumar said that Yashoda was the second wife of Gangadhar. “We suspected that her complaint was an attempt to give communal colour to Gangadhar’s action,” he said. The police will inquire into the role played by two of Gangadhar’s friends in connection with the sexual assault on the Muslim woman, he added.. Earlier, Gangadhar had married twice and has five children from his two wives. His marriage with the Muslim woman, who has a child from her first marriage, was the third one.

26 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Tourism to take another hit?||The second wave of COVID-19 pandemic has started showing its impact on tourism in Mysuru with a big drop in footfall since last week. Also, hotel and taxi bookings, and bookings for tour packages were getting cancelled after the government announced strict enforcement of COVID-19 guidelines to fight the pandemic. RT-PCR test negative report is a must for arrivals, especially from Kerala and Maharashtra, which have reported a big spike. The rising curve after a long lull, amidst the tourism sector showing recovery, has worried stakeholders who are now keeping their fingers crossed awaiting the government’s next step. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri has issued an advisory to tourists to bring test negative reports along with them as a precaution even though it’s not mandatory from all States. “I have told the Palace Board to advise the visitors to get RT-PCR negative reports as it will be good for them and also for the authorities (who are combating COVID-19). We need to balance the situation as we also need to look into tourism,” she said. The impact over fresh fears was once again pushing popular destinations like Mysuru zoo into yet another “revenue crisis” like it suffered last year with the footfall dropping substantially after curbs on Kerala tourists who make up nearly 60 per cent of the visitors. Same is the case atn other tourist sites, including Mysuru palace, which are witnessing fall in number of visitors, sources in the tourism industry said. While the stakeholders were urging the government not to go for yet another lockdown citing the situation, they said they were ready to support the government and abide by all its decisions. “Please desist from imposing a complete lockdown as it will lead to a total collapse of the industry and will take years for it to recover,” argued B.S. Prashanth, President, Mysuru Travels’ Association. He said the decision on negative reports was understandable and the same was being communicated to clients but they are cancelling bookings citing the dicey situation and talks of lockdown to stop the rising trend. “Tourists are unsure about the situation and reluctant to take the risk. Tour operators have been getting a lot of calls and Whatsapp messages on this,” said Mr. Prashanth. Expressing concern over continuous drop in footfalls, Mysuru Zoo Director Ajit Kulkarni said the daily visitors’ number had now fallen below 2,000 from 6,000-7,000 a day. Weekend footfall had almost touched 10,000. But, the fears of the second peak and the resultant rise in cases had dissuaded the visitors. “If the same trend continues, it will be tough for the zoo to sustain with this revenue. The financial impact will be tough to bear after last year’s blow.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tourism-to-take-another-hit/article34165896.ece
26 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Siddis possess superior endurance and strength’||Siddis, a tribal community, residing in Uttara Kannada and other parts of Karnataka, bearing a striking resemblance to Africans, were found to possess superior physical attributes during a recent sports talent search exercise conducted by the Centre for Sports Science, Bengaluru. “Their endurance level is good… They have superior body strength and power. Their hand grip, power and strength are comparable with international standards,” said Antony Chacko, director of Centre for Sports Science, Bengaluru. The centre, which has been set up by the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports, has been conducting sports talent search programmes in different parts of the State. During the programmes held at Haliyal, Yellapur, and Mundgod recently, the authorities identified about 50 to 60 youths possessing good sporting talent. “In Haliyal, the participants from the Siddi community showed that they were not only strong, but also had good hip strength. Their hand grip and power was above the normative range, comparable with international standards,” he said. Mr. Chacko said the endurance level of Siddis, who had been picked up for raw talent, was found to be higher than a regular athlete, who had been practising for four to five years. Out of the identified Siddhi youth, Mr. Chacko said they will zero down on thecrème de la crèmeand take up a programme to provide long-term coaching and prepare them for national events. However, he emphasised the need to hold training and programmes for tribal youth in their backyard. Earlier also, Sports Authority of India (SAI) had been to tribal areas and selected the youth for training. “But, they could not accustom themselves to life in Bengaluru and returned,” he said. “We don’t want to displace them. With the best of the facilities, we will go to their areas and train them,” he said. Similarly, another find of the Centre for Sports Sciences was talent possessed by tribals from Yadgir for archery. “Their hand-eye coordination, focus and attention is good. We found them to the highly talented. Some of them have also been selected by the State for the national archery tournament, Mr. Chacko said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddis-possess-superior-endurance-and-strength/article34165899.ece

In Mysuru, the authorities hope to resolve 8,954 cases out of 1,09,235 cases in the district. Ramachandra D. Huddar, Principal District and Sessions Judge and Chairman, District Legal Services Authority, said it is estimated that out of the pending 1.09 lakh cases, 84,785 could be resolved through mediation and reconciliation. Of these, they have zeroed in on 24,951 cases for reconciliation of which they hope to close about 8,954 cases through mediation. He said this will help secure justice to the aggrieved but there is no coercion or compulsion and will be fruitful only if both the parties involved in the case agree for a settlement. Of the 8,954 cases that could be resolved through mediation, there are 6,109 criminal compoundable cases including petty cases that are ready for settlement during the Lok Adalat. However, cases of heinous nature such as rape or murder do not qualify for such settlements. The authorities said they have identified 1,433 partition suites of which 185 cases are projected to be resolved during the Lok Adalat. There are 345 bank-related casesof which 79 are ready for settlement. Similarly, there are 852 cases related to money recovery of which 131 are ready for settlement. There are also 130 matrimonial cases of which 36 cases are likely to be settled. The identification of the cases and their selection entails an elaborate exercise in which committee members go through the cases per se and group them subject-wise, discuss the issue with the advocates and also ascertain the willingness of the parties concerned for a mutual settlement.  Devaraj Bhute, Senior Civil Judge and Member Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mega-lok-adalat-in-mysuru-tomorrow/article34165892.ece

26 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Hinkal incident: Vishwanath lashes out at police||A.H.Vishwanath, MLC, on Thursday lashed out at the Commissioner of Police Chandragupta for commending the traffic police on their handling of the Hinkal incident in which a motorcyclist died in an accident during a document check drive on Tuesday. The enraged public thrashed two policemen on duty following which the police have arrested a few persons while spreading their dragnet to nab others involved in the violence. The city police also issued a clarification stating that the accident and the death of the motoryclist had nothing to do with the document check drive. Mr. Vishwanath said the death was due to the ‘overzealousness’ of the police. The law does not state that the police should give the motorists a chase to check their documents. “Don’t they have CCTV cameras’’, he asked and said that the Commissioner of Police should be “more pro-active’’. He said he would take up the issue with the Chief Minister and the Home Minister apart from the district in-charge Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hinkal-incident-vishwanath-lashes-out-at-police/article34165891.ece

Days after an advisory from the Centre, the State government on Thursday issued an order banning public festivities until further notice. Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar directed authorities to ensure strict compliance of the order. “All authorities will ensure that public gatherings and congregation during the upcoming religious festivals such as Holi, Ugadi, Shab-e-Barat, Good Friday etc. shall not be allowed in public places/grounds/parks/markets/religious places in Karnataka,” Mr. Kumar said in the order. The Ugadi-Holi season is marked by several chariot festivals across the State, which will be impacted by this order. Karaga, scheduled in April, in the city will also likely be affected. Last year, too, Karaga was held with no congregation of devotees and the procession was limited to the Dharmaraya Swamy temple. Action would be taken against persons violating the order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act, 2020.  In the wake of a surge in COVID-19 cases in Bengaluru and reports that the new mutant of the virus spreads faster than the earlier variant, Health Minister K. Sudhakar, after a meeting with Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike officials on Thursday, advised citizens to “be careful for the next two months”. “Earlier, even when a person contracted COVID-19, other members of the family in the same house did not test positive in most cases. But this time, whole families are getting infected together. Moreover, nearly 70% of the caseload is being observed in apartments, indicating how the virus variant spreads faster,” he said, adding “the new mutant version had been found in 700 cases so far”. Appeal to people The Minister appealed to the public to cooperate with the authorities, avoid public gatherings and follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour for the next few months. “The mask rule and restrictions imposed on public gatherings will be implemented strictly and violations will be penalised. Organisers of gatherings and owners of venues will be booked and penalised for violations,” he said. The State government had recently limited public gatherings to a maximum of 200 in closed-door events and 500 in open spaces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-state-bans-public-festivities/article34165745.ece

In the previous 2020-21 budget, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had announced that electric bike taxis would be allowed in the State. Though a year has passed, the Transport Department is yet to come out with detailed guidelines. The bike taxi business has been a contentious issue with aggregators accusing the department of not being proactive in framing rules. When asked about the status of the proposal, principal secretary of the Transport Department Anjum Parvez said, “The proposal is in its conceptual stage and a final decision has not yet been taken.” However, taxi drivers, who have been suffering heavy losses since the start of the pandemic, are unhappy that bike taxis continue to operate under the radar, and accused the government of inaction. “The aggregators are allowing white board two-wheelers, meant for personal use, to run as bike taxis or other purposes. They are risking the lives of customers. We want the Transport Department to take action against those who are operating such services,” said Somashekhar, president, Namma Chalakara Trade Union. Auto and taxi drivers pointed out that they pay for their yellow board vehicles, but are losing money to motorcyclists who are operating without the required licence from the Transport Department. “We do not know why the Transport Department is silent about the illegal bike taxi business,” Mr. Somashekhar added. On the other hand, commuters who want the services to be made legal said that bike taxis are economical and ideal for Bengaluru’s roads as well as for last-mile connectivity. In the past, there have been instances of officials taking action against aggregators, such as Uber and Ola, for allowing bike taxi services on their mobile apps. At the time, officials had compounded the vehicles. In March 2019, the Transport Department had even suspended the license of Ola for reportedly operating illegal bike taxis. The order was revoked within a few days. L. Hemantha Kumara, secretary, Karnataka State Transport Authority, said that bike taxi services remain illegal. “The Transport Department had sent a proposal to the government to allow electric bike taxis to operate. As no guidelines have been issued yet, if anyone provide such services, they are breaking the law,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bike-taxis-operating-under-the-radar/article34166122.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Good turnout for sports talent hunt||A sports talent search programme using scientific methodology, the first such effort in Mysuru by the Centre for Sports Science, elicited a good response with a total of 360 budding sportspersons from different schools in the City and its outskirts undergoing a variety of tests to assess their physical capabilities at the Chamundi Vihar Indoor Stadium here on Thursday. The Centre for Sports Science, Bengaluru, established by the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports (DYES) last year, has begun a State-wide drive to create a talent pool from different districts of the State. During the two-day programme in Mysuru, which concludes on Friday, an estimated 650 to 700 young sportspersons aged between 8 and 15 years are expected to be screened for their physical prowess and sporting talents. Speaking to The Hindu , Director of Centre for Sports Science Antony Chacko said the talent search programme will help identify promising youngsters and promote them to achieve Olympic excellence in any of the 14 sports identified by the Centre for medal prospects. The games include archery, boxing, shooting, badminton, wrestling, hockey, weightlifting, cycling, athletics, table tennis, judo, swimming, fencing and rowing. The 360 young sportspersons, who had been sent by their respective educational institutions, were first subjected to a battery of tests in a traditional manner to assess their hand-eye coordination, upper limb and lower limb strengths, agility, static mobility, dynamic mobility, flexibility, grip strength etc. Those showing promise were taken for a second round of tests using high-end scientific technology and sensors. “For instance, if a boy or a girl is playing badminton, they will not know if their hand-eye coordination and reaction time is good. Our tests will assess them for the same and see if it matches the international standards for children their age”, Mr Chacko said. “We will also know if they are in the right sporting discipline or not”, he said. Mr. Chacko said their initiative is also looking to encourage more girls to take to competitive sports. “If one looks at the data for Karnataka, we see girls winning more medals for Karnataka than boys. For example, in swimming we are the leading State in junior and sub-junior level. But, if you look at the participation ratio between boys and girls, there is huge difference. Their participation is less, but they win more medals. So, we are trying to improve the participation of the girls”, he said. The boys and girls, who are selected under the talent search programme, will be brought under a Long-Term Athlete Development programme with complete sports science support. Assistant Director, Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports, Mysuru, Omprakash, was present during the programme.

The decision was taken after a meeting with representatives of auto drivers’ unions who aired their grievances. Unions had approached the DC, who is also head of the regional transport authority, seeking a hike in fares. “Autorickshaw fares were last revised in 2013. We held a meeting with union representatives. A sub-committee has been formed to look into the issue. It will also seek public opinion on the issue and other issues, such as hike in fuel prices and operational cost, how other modes of transport, including taxis, impact auto drivers,” said Mr. Manjunath. The sub-committee is likely to submit its report in a month. Unions want the base fare increased to Rs. 40 and thereafter Rs. 18 per kilometre. At the start of the month, before the budget was scheduled to be announced, auto unions had taken out a rally from KSR Bengaluru railway station to Freedom Park demanding that the State government hike the fare. Drivers pointed out that not only was business down because of COVID-19, but in the backdrop of the fuel hike, it was becoming increasingly difficult to meet daily expenses. Many also claimed that they could not claim the Rs. 5,000 that the government had provided due to stringent eligibility rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sub-committee-to-study-demand-for-revision-of-autorickshaw-fare/article34166125.ece
26 March 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||‘Loyalty’ factor may come into play||In the Idukki Assembly constituency, sitting MLA Roshy Augustine of the Kerala Congress (M) in the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is in a direct contest against Francis George of the Kerala Congress (KC) in the United Democratic Front (UDF). Both candidates had crossed over to their respective fronts relatively recently. The KC(M) that was in the UDF, switched to the LDF in the latter half of 2020, while Mr. George, who was in the LDF, joined the P.J. Joseph-led KC early last year. The constituency has tended to lean towards the UDF, with a majority of voters being settler farmers. The high-pitch campaigns of Mr. George and Mr. Augustine have been covering small towns. While Mr. George covered the Mariyapuram and Kamakshy grama panchayats, accompanied by motorbike rallies, Mr. Augustine campaigned in Kanjikuzhy amid a roadshow. The constituency was drastically affected by the 2018 floods, when the shutters of Idukki dam were opened. The repairs of the main road in Cheruthoni are still going on. The candidates have completed the first round of constituency visit. Mr. Augustine has been highlighting the developmental works undertaken in the constituency during his tenure. Mr. George has been stressing that development came Idukki’s way only when he was its MP. The contenders have personal influence in the constituency. However, their shift in loyalties might come under question. “The voters are bound to consider this factor, though party loyalty and personal clout remain important,” said Varghese Kurien, who runs a grocery shop at Cheruthoni. BJP’s efforts Sangeetha Viswanathan of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaigned in the interior and tribes-inhabited areas of Makkuvally, Manayathadam, and Kaithapara. She said she would strive to develop the areas using Central funds. A permanent solution to the land issue in Idukki was a must and she would work for it, she said, while visitng shops and houses. Though, the NDA is not a considerable force here, the front hopes to improve its vote share here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/loyalty-factor-may-come-into-play/article34165858.ece

Receiving the symbol of the frock turned out to be an emotional moment for her, as she began her election campaign in the constituency on Wednesday. Speaking to The Hindu , the mother said that the frock was not just an election symbol but a reminder of her two children. “It will tell the story of betrayal and injustice faced by the mother, who lost her two daughters. It will be a symbol that will raise voice against the Chief Minister, who promised justice, but betrayed me,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/walayar-mother-gets-tiny-frock-as-symbol/article34165775.ece

26 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Heavy rain, wind batter district||Heavy rain packed with strong winds that lashed the district on Thursday evening inflicted all-round destruction, besides injuring three, including a 15-year-old, who got trapped under uprooted trees. Fallen trees and hoardings and trusswork blown away by the wind disrupted traffic and power supply, reducing most parts of the district to pitch darkness well into the night, leaving KSEB employees to work late into the night to restore supply. Farmers also suffered considerable damage. District Collector S. Suhas directed village officers to estimate the extent of damage. The Deputy Collector (Disaster Management) has been entrusted with supervising the preparation of estimates. The fire and rescue services station on Club Road in the city received not less than 13 distress calls, mostly caused by uprooted trees. It took firefighters more than an hour to remove the huge shade tree near the Children’s Park that fell onto the road disrupting traffic. A huge tree on the General Hospital campus fell on a parked car smashing its windscreen though, fortunately, none was inside. Two residents of Madura sustained injuries after they got trapped under a fallen tree near Kaloor bus stand, while a teenager met with a similar fate near Ambedkar stadium. Firefighters could not remove a huge tree that fell on the road near Ravipuram, as they did not have the chainsaw adequate enough for the task. Vaduthala, Vennala, Kadavanthra, Vyttila, Palarivattom, Kaloor, Thevara, Pachalam, and Karikkamuri were among the worst affected areas in the city. Aluva and nearby areas, including the Aluva Palace, Aluva-Munnar Road, Choornikkara, Edathala, and Keezhmadu, also reported widespread damage. KSEB reported widespread damage to electric posts and supply lines, mostly by uprooted trees. Train services were also hit, with the New Delhi-bound Kerala Express getting halted at Thripunithura for nearly an hour after a tree fell on the track.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/heavy-rain-wind-batter-district/article34166271.ece
26 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||State sees largest reverse migration||In what is possibly the largest reverse migration yet to the State, lakhs of people have returned in the past year, a majority from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, and several will vote in the upcoming Assembly elections. As per figures from NoRKA-Roots, 12,32,905 people have returned to the State in a year till March 21. The highest number of returnees (7,17,015) is from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). “The State is seeing this sort of mass reverse migration for the first time, largely due to loss of employment,” says Harikrishnan Namboothiri, CEO, NoRKA-Roots. In the past year, the government offered financial assistance of Rs. 5,000 each to 1,22,000 people who returned to the State. Under a project for returned emigrants to set up their own businesses, Rs. 14 crore was provided as subsidy on capital or interest for 712 ventures. A sum of Rs. 10,000 each was also provided to 433 NoRKS who tested positive for COVID-19. Several returnees are in limbo — work here is hard to find and moving abroad looks like an unattainable prospect. Subair T.M., a Thalassery native, returned from Ajman in the UAE five months ago after having worked in the country for nearly 40 years as a driver and at a grocery store. He is struggling to cobble together money for daily expenses and to pay off a home loan. He would like to return to the UAE but has so far spotted job vacancies only for relatively younger people. Others have made a fresh start here and are back for the long haul. A 50-year-old Kochi resident who returned from Dubai in March last year, after having lost his job, is now running a fish delivery business, a collaborative effort of nearly 30 returnees. People with experience are looking for jobs that match their skills and salary expectations. ‘Not all workers’ S. Irudaya Rajan, professor at the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, says the total figure with NoRKA records the total arrivals to Kerala, and all of them are not necessarily migrant workers. “People have already started returning to the Gulf. At least one-third of the people who were evacuated might be able to go back abroad in the next six to eight months. But there will be a set of distress returnees. The government will have to support them,” he says. “More return migrants will vote in the elections this time, and their votes could play a major role in some localities. But, here that vote bank has not been captured,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-sees-largest-reverse-migration/article34165880.ece
26 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Households, apartments under PCB scanner||Households and apartment complexes located close to the Perandoor and Edappally canals will come under the scanner of the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) for dumping untreated sewage and effluents into the waterbodies. The board has found that the discharge of untreated sewage was one of the main reasons behind the worsening ecological condition of the two major canals. Five monitoring stations each have been fixed along the canals as part of steps being taken on the directive of the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta had taken suo motu notice of The Hindu report titled ‘Faecal contamination high in Perandoor, Edappally canals’ published on January 28. The report had revealed that the total coliform count, indicating faecal contamination, had exceeded the maximum permissible limits by 160 and 96 times respectively in the two waterbodies. The tribunal had also asked a five-member committee constituted by it to submit a factual and action taken report on the worsening ecological condition of the two major canals in the city. The Bench had asked the State respondents to file independent action plans while recommending long- and short-term measures to restore the canals to their original state. The PCB had found that most households and apartment complexes lacked sewage treatment plants and were dumping untreated waste into the canals. A detailed spot assessment will have to be made to ascertain whether the illegal discharge of sewage and effluents was through underground pipes. The board has informed the tribunal that the proposed Rs. 1,528-crore Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System (IURWTS) project undertaken by Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) will help in rejuvenating Perandoor and Edappally canals. Six canals in the city will be rejuvenated and made navigable as part of the project. They include Edappally canal (11.15 km), Chilavannoor canal (11.23 km), Thevara-Perandoor canal (9.84 km), Thevara canal (1.41 km), Market canal (0.66 km), and Konthuruthy canal (0.67 km). The project proposal includes the setting up of sewerage treatment plants and a sewer network, covering 40% of the Kochi Corporation area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/households-apartments-under-pcb-scanner/article34166280.ece
26 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||New govt. needs to ensure better infra||From setting up cold storages to ensuring prices for crops to encourage young people to come into agriculture, farmers are placing a lot of expectations on the new government. Dani Kurien, a nutmeg and tapioca farmer at Muvattupuzha, says the price of inputs such as fertilizers has gone up drastically. The cost of labour too has risen considerably. However, the price of produces has not gone up proportionately. The situation is such that farmers are forced to abandon more and more areas and depend on other means to make a living. He says fruits such as jack and pineapple do not have much shelf life. If the government establishes a chain of storage facility, it would be possible for farmers to keep them and sell at the right time to get remunerative prices. Govt. help sought Joel Nellikunnel, a pineapple farmer, says the government should step in when the farmers are in serious trouble. Farmers are unable to plant their crops with the hope of a steady price. A pineapple plant costs about Rs. 56 for it to be harvested with about two kg of fruit. However, seasonal variations, heavy rain and even outside events such as transport strike affect the farmers’ income. Joseph Karukappally, who cultivates a variety of crops, including areca, says the government should come out with a clear policy on various issues, including land use and support for the farmers. Babu Joseph, a coconut farmer and part of a committee to promote Neera in Kanjirappally, says both coconut and paddy cultivation is in a big crisis in the State. While the Rubber Board being almost disbanded, rubber farmers are in serious trouble now. The new government should be able to help provide remunerative price for the produce ranging from paddy to tapioca. He says farmers are at the receiving end of rules and regulations that include handling of wild animals. Attack by wild boars has made cultivation of any crops difficult in areas neighbouring the forests on the Western Ghats.  Farmers are at the receiving end of rules and regulations that include handling of wild animals.

The move comes amidst the increasing incidents of violations of various key provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016; Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; Environment Protection Act, 1986; Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981; Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016; and Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016. The video documentation of the violations would create awareness among the local bodies and the public in general, especially in view of the stringent directives being issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the Kerala High Court on ensuring the implementation of various environmental laws across the State, pointed out senior officials of the board. Besides creating awareness, the video clips would act as a deterrent to the growing trend of violations such as dumping of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste in the open, unscientific handling of biomedical waste, and poor management of plastic waste, they said. United effort The board has pointed out that the cooperation of multiple government departments and local bodies is required to implement various waste management rules in the State. Despite repeated efforts, the situation has not improved as expected, going by the assessments made in recent times. A follow-up on the action taken by the local bodies on the video clips shared will be done on a periodical basis. The video documentation will also be shared with the Departments of Local Self-Government and Environment. The proposal to capture the violations comes close on the observations by the NGT on the continuing lethargy on the part of the government to act tough against the violations. The southern bench of the tribunal had said in March that its directives on ensuring compliance of waste management rules had fallen on deaf ears.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cameras-to-trap-eco-violations/article34165783.ece

Five cents of land that Nizar, 37, of Thodupuzha, had bought in his wife’s name would be attached. This was after a probe ordered by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K.Karthik found it to have been bought with the money illegally earned through ganja smuggling. Following this, steps were initiated under Section 68 (e) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and documents were secured from the sub registrar’s office. Though the party concerned filed an appeal against it, the office rejected it. This was perhaps for the first time a property was being attached on the ground of investments being made through illegal means. About 105 kg of ganja was seized from two premium cars while it was being smuggled in from Andhra Pradesh.

26 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Govt. defends its stance in cashew case||The State government has justified its action in declining sanction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for prosecuting INTUC State president R. Chandrasekharan and former managing director of Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (KSCDC) K.A. Ratheesh in a corruption case relating to procuring inferior quality raw cashew nuts from abroad worth Rs. 600 crore. In an affidavit filed before the High Court, the government indicated that there were no irregularities in the procurement of raw cashew nuts between 2006 and 2015. The government order issued in March 1996 had allowed the board of directors of KSCDC and Capex to purchase and import raw nuts. This practice was allowed to continue in 2007. Moreover, the Store Purchase Manual and Central Vigilance Commission guidelines were not applicable in this case. The contention that procedures were not followed by the accused was incorrect. ‘Approved by board’ Since cashew was a seasonal crop it could be purchased at the time of production only to run the factories through the year. Besides, the purchases were approved by the board of directors of the KSCDC which consists of the government officials. The affidavit added that due application of mind was made while declining sanction for prosecuting the accused. There was no substance in the allegation that the matter took a U-turn with the intervention from the office of the Chief Minister. There was no material to substantiate the allegation. The affidavit was filed in response to a writ petition challenging the refusal of sanction sought by the CBI to prosecute the accused in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-defends-stance-in-cashew-corruption-case/article34165779.ece
26 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||HC vacates stay on ecotourism in Wayanad||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has vacated its stay on ecotourism activities in the South Wayanad Forest Division and allowed the government to carry on with the ecotourism projects under the forest division The order was passed on Thursday on a batch of petitions filed by tourist guides seeking to lift the stay and allow ecotourism activities in the South Wayanad Forest Division, subject to conditions in the approval order granted by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests on April 24, 2019. Non-forest activity The stay on tourism activities was granted on a petition filed by the Wayanad Paristhithi Smrakshana Samithi on the ground that the Central government had not approved the ecotourism projects in the forest. Therefore, it was a non-forest activity coming under the Forest(Conservation) Act, 1980, the petitioner contended. Vacating the stay order, the court said that the Centre having issued requisite orders to carry on with the ecotourism activities, there was no substance in the contentions advanced by the petitioner now. Strict compliance The court also made it clear that the orders passed by the State government with respect to COVID-19 and in the interest of protecting the environment and forests should be strictly and scrupulously implemented while permitting tourists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-vacates-stay-on-ecotourism-in-wayanad/article34165869.ece
26 March 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Pinarayi sees bid to pit LDF against NSS||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said there have been conscious efforts to pit the Left Democratic Front (LDF) against the Nair Service Society (NSS). Speaking at a press conference here on Thursday, the Chief Minister said some parties had been striving to declare the NSS and the LDF enemies by misinterpreting his statements and blowing them out of proportion. Asserting that there was no clash between the NSS and the LDF, he said: Rejected by RBI “The NSS leadership wanted to know why the government has been ignoring their demand to declare Mannam Jayanti a holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act. But in reality, the Reserve Bank of India has rejected our recommendation due to some legal hassles. Also, the LDF government is the first in the country to implement the reservation for poor among forward communities.” Reacting to the latest allegations of the Opposition that the Chief Minister’s Office was aware of the deal with EMCC International Private Limited, a multinational corporation based in the United States, he said the entire project was part of a conspiracy from the very beginning and the EMCC head contesting against Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma in Kundara points to that fact. “In Kerala, the government has the support of fishers. It is an attempt to instigate them against the government by trying to convince the fishers that we have done something that threatens their rights and livelihood. A person who is known as ‘dallal’ (broker) was also involved in this and there is nothing wrong in a bureaucrat in an official position getting in touch with the Chief Minister’s Office or the additional private secretary responding to it. A probe has been launched into the conspiracy and everything will be brought to light eventually.” Criticising the Kollam diocese of the Latin Catholic Church for its pastoral letter against the State government, Mr. Vijayan said the Church authorities simply copied the allegations raised by the Opposition and they should rethink about the act. Credibility at stake “When they reproduce the fake stories spread by political parties against the government, their authority and credibility will be questioned,” he said. Slamming the Opposition for attempts to sabotage the distribution of free ration kits and welfare pensions, Mr. Vijayan said the Leader of the Opposition wanted to see the people suffer. He said the government was not distributing kits for some votes, but for the welfare of the public. “They are trying to stop the relief measure, something beneficial to all sections,” said the Chief Minister who also attacked the Election Commission of India for its decision to put the elections to three Rajya Sabha seats on hold.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pinarayi-sees-bid-to-pit-ldf-against-nss/article34165872.ece

26 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Former allies in a pulsating face-off||Unlike the clean sweep by the Kerala Congress (M) last time, Kaduthuruthy is set to witness a pitched battle in this election, thanks to a split in the regional party. A pocket borough of Kerala Congress politics for long, the region has now become the arena for a direct fight between Mons Joseph and Stephen George, prominent faces from the respective KC groups led by P.J. Joseph and Jose K. Mani. Besides the regional political heavyweights, the National Democratic Alliance too has thrown its hat in the ring by fielding a fresh face, Lijin Lal of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mons Joseph, a former Minister who has been representing the seat from 2006 onward, seeks to improve on his previous margin of 42,256 votes. A popular face across the region, he counts on the upper hand that the United Democratic Front enjoys among the farmers and Hindu upper castes to work in his favour. The Left Democratic Front, on the other hand, bets heavily on the considerable influence of Mr. George among the Knanaya Catholic community and also on the well-geared election machinery. A former legislator, the KC(M) general secretary also nurtures strong personal connections all around the Assembly segment. The NDA, meanwhile, expects the candidature of Mr. Lal will bring in the much-needed freshness to its campaign and build on the momentum it gained during the local body elections. Among the factors that will determine the coalition’s performance includes the stance of the Nair and Ezhava communities. Thrice earlier But in a region where the Knanaya and Catholic churches hold the sway, the battle will be most keenly fought between the two KC leaders, who had fought against each other in the same seat on three occasions earlier. While Mr. George had won the seat in 2001, Mr. Joseph emerged victorious in 2006 and 2011. Of the 11 local bodies in the segment, nine are under the LDF’s rule. The UDF has just one panchayat while it supports the One Indian One Pension movement led council in another panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/former-allies-in-a-pulsating-face-off/article34165863.ece
26 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||NSS questions CM’s stance on holiday, quota||A day after the war of words between the Nair Service Society (NSS) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) hit a crescendo, the community organisation on Thursday asked Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan not to be peeved when confronted with facts. In a statement issued here on Thursday, NSS general Secretary G. Sukumaran Nair questioned Mr. Vijayan’s statement with regard to the non-inclusion Mannathu Padmanabhan’s birth anniversary as a holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act. The organisation had made representations in this regard to the State government twice. Govt. response According to Mr. Nair, the first memorandum had elicited a response that the government was unable to consider the demand in view of its policy of not declaring new holidays. The reply to the second request, however, had pointed to a directive by the Union Finance Ministry fixing the limit of holidays under the Act to a maximum of 15 days. But at the same time, it also stated that the total number of holidays declared by the State had already crossed this limit . “In its response, the government replied that the demand put forth in the memorandum could not be allowed in view of the declaration of 18 holidays in 2018 and in line with the general policy of not declaring new holidays. This itself explains the hollowness in the Chief Minister’s statement,” Mr. Nair said. He also sought to counter Mr. Vijayan’s claim attributing the delay in releasing the forward caste list for the economic reservation to the model code of conduct. “It was based on a sub-petition moved by the NSS that the High Court has directed the State government to release the list,” added Mr. Nair.  Govt. response to NSS memorandum was that it was unable to consider the demand in view of its policy of not declaring new holidays.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nss-questions-cms-stance-on-holiday-quota/article34165873.ece

The process was carried out by Returning Officers in the presence of District Collector M. Anjana and representatives of political parties. Among the Assembly segments, Poonjar has been allotted 292 EVMs, followed by Kaduthuruthy with 291. With 241 machines, Kottayam has been allotted the lowest number of EVMs. A total of 2,887 ballot units, control units and 3,128 VVPAT machines have been selected through the EVM Management System, a web application by the Election Commission.

26 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||After initial hiccups, Kuttiyadi turns a battlefield for fronts||The stage has been set for poll battle in Kuttiyadi. Clearing the initial confusion and disagreements over the selection of its candidate, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) campaign is now in full swing in the agrarian belt. For the UDF, the fight this time is seemingly an endurance test to prove that it has gained an indomitable hold in the constituency with the last term’s victory. Sitting MLA and UDF candidate Parakkal Abdulla exudes confidence that he will retain the seat. He says he has been a ‘visible people’s representative’ unlike many of his political opponents and that it will definitely help him romp home. UDF campaigners say the recent protests within the LDF over the selection of candidates have given them an advantage in electioneering. According to them, the disagreements over fielding a KC(M) candidate within the LDF still persist and that it will come to light after the elections. Meanwhile, LDF campaigners say the front lost the constituency last time by a thin margin because of some ‘unfortunate reasons’. This time they bank on the candidature of former Kozhikode district panchayat president K. Kunhammad. His popularity as an approachable politician and his entry into the fray with the support of the KC(M) following party workers’ protest will help the front wrest the seat back from the UDF, they say. Poll planks In the last election, Kuttiyadi, the erstwhile Meppayur constituency, gave a shocker to the LDF, as it tasted defeat in the constituency after 25 years. With a victory margin of 1,157 votes, Parakkal Abdulla trounced his strong opponent K.K. Lathika of the LDF that time. This agriculturally sensitive region has eight local bodies where issues related to agriculture and allied development projects grab political attention. Relief packages and supportive schemes for farmers are the main poll planks here. For the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Kuttiyadi gives some hope. Its increasing vote percentage prompts the front to go ahead with aggressive campaigns for its candidate P.P. Murali. The BJP, which secured 4.4% of votes in the 2011 elections, managed to improve it to 7.8% in the last elections. NDA leaders claim that the vote share will increase further this time too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/after-initial-hiccups-kuttiyadi-turns-a-battlefield-for-fronts/article34165772.ece
26 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Competitive populism, the new keyword for major fronts||Competitive populism seems to be the keyword for major political fronts in the State, going by their manifestos for the upcoming Assembly polls. The thrust now is on promising schemes for the poor, senior citizens, women and children, patients, farmers, the homeless and the differently abled, pensioners and homemakers. Political parties here appear to be following the model of the Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu, where free schemes feature in poll manifesto. Some economists, however, have raised questions about going gung-ho on welfare schemes without specifying details about resource mobilisation.  Unlike earlier, the preparation of the poll manifestos itself was a public relations exercise for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) this time. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan conducted district-level meetings with people from different walks of life and sought their opinions that could be included in the document. The UDF too held consultations with people before releasing its poll manifesto, and Shashi Tharoor, MP, was in charge of the process. It was the LDF which first hit the trail with its manifesto seeking to increase the social welfare pension from Rs. 1,600 to Rs. 2,500 in five years. A pension scheme was proposed for homemakers from poor families. The LDF also promised to prepare a list of extremely poor families and offered financial help in the range of Rs. 1 lakh and Rs. 15 lakh for 45 lakh units among them. It sought to implement home delivery services for senior citizens and a survey for them as well. The LDF promised land and houses for all landless people, including those from the Scheduled Castes. Pension Not to be left behind, the UDF too promised to implement its Nyuntam Aay Yojna (Nyay) scheme that ensures Rs. 6,000 a month for poor families and said the social welfare pension would be hiked to Rs. 3,000. The Congress-led coalition proposed a monthly pension of Rs. 2,000 for homemakers in the 40-60 age group and those excluded in the Nyay scheme. A special commission was promised for senior citizens. The poll manifesto released by the National Democratic Alliance too has welfare promises, including social welfare pension of Rs. 3,500, jobs for at least one member of each family with a monthly salary of Rs. 20,000, and six LPG refills for free for below the poverty line families. With the campaign reaching a crescendo in the coming days, the impact of these promises will be something to watch out for.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/competitive-populism-the-new-keyword-for-major-fronts/article34165847.ece
26 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Vigil against transfer of unaccounted cash||The police have increased the frequency of surprise vehicle inspections covering national and State highways in north Kerala in the wake of a spurt in the number of inter-district unaccounted money transfer cases. All suspicious vehicles will be intercepted. The plan is to carry out the check as an additional surveillance measure, in addition to the already operational special squads appointed by the State Election Commission. Enforcement squads of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) and Excise will also conduct similar special drives in their respective areas. Police sources said the recent seizure of a motorbike fitted with an altered fuel tank to hide cash had prompted many local squads to intensify vigil. According to them, the already installed Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems in some major checking points will help the police ensure flawless enforcement. There is also a plan to monitor emergency service vehicles and prevent their misuse. Police sources said complaints were on the rise against the misuse of ambulances for non-emergency purposes. The interception of such suspected vehicles will be carried out on the basis of credible information, they added. Vehicle theft According to police sources, the investigation into vehicle theft cases will also be carried out, as stolen vehicles are frequently used for carrying unaccounted money. The number of missing vehicles will be handed over to highway checking squads, they said. The Crime Prevention and Detection squad under the Railway Protection Force had already stepped up surprise inspections in trains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vigil-against-transfer-of-unaccounted-cash/article34165777.ece

26 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Cong. candidates allege rampant election fraud||Alleging rampant electoral irregularities in the district, the United Democratic Front on Thursday raised serious allegations including impersonation behind such fraudulent activities that threatened to scuttle the electoral process. V.S. Sivakumar, Veena S. Nair and S.S. Lal, the Congress’ candidates in Thiruvananthapuram, Vattiyurkavu and Kazhakuttam constituencies respectively, alleged here that numerous bogus entries had crept into multiple voters’ list in various constituencies in the district. A day after Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala raised claims of multiple entries of voter names in the electoral rolls within a constituency or spread across two or more constituencies, the Congress candidates alleged graver charges. They claimed the presence of multiple entries in different lists with the same photos, but with different names, addresses and identification card numbers. Citing examples, Mr. Sivakumar said there were voters who figured in four or five electoral lists in different constituencies with different credentials. He claimed that the UDF could identify 8,400, 7,600 and 6,360 such instances in Vattiyurkavu, Thiruvananthapuram and Nemom respectively. “These irregularities could have been done by CPI(M)-affiliated officials without the voters’ knowledge. The identification documents could have been forged for the purpose,” Ms. Nair said. Variation in details At a separate media briefing, Dr. Lal too alleged similar discrepancies in the electoral rolls in his constituency. A scrutiny by the UDF identified multiple entries in the case of 460 voters there. It also revealed cases where the names and photographs of the voters were repeated, but with variation in details such as addresses as similar to the other Assembly segments. A preliminary assessment has revealed 12,000 to 15,000 such cases, he said, while accusing the CPI(M) and the BJP of trying to sabotage the election process. The candidates urged the Election Commission to scrutinise the electoral rolls and weed out bogus voters prior to the polls.

Raja on Thursday credited the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government for bucking a national trend of falling development indices in Kerala and creating a better growth alternative than others in the country. He was inaugurating an LDF convention to drum up support for its Nedumangad constituency candidate G.R. Anil in Vembayam. Addressing a sizeable gathering in Tamil, Mr. Raja said the people of the State enjoyed high standards of living than in many other parts of the country. “On the other hand, the country is ranked below many of its neighbouring countries in terms of human development index, hunger index, happiness index and other indicators of progress,” he said. Slams Prime Minister Pointing out that the upcoming elections were crucial for the country, Mr. Raja appealed to the voters to ensure that it marked the “beginning of the BJP’s defeat at the Centre”, which has been hell-bent on replacing the country into a theocratic state. He accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of duping the country with hollow promises. While Mr. Modi had failed to honour his assurance of generating two crores of job opportunities every year, unemployment has also slipped to a five-decade low. The CPI leader added that the Centre worked for the interests of crony capitalists alone, while ignoring the demands of the farming community, which has been on a path of agitation. Incumbent Nedumangad MLA C. Divakaran, CPI (M) district secretary Anavoor Nagappan and CPI district secretary Mangode Radhakrishnan were among those who participated in the convention.

About 15 sleuths of the Income Tax office in Kochi stepped into KIIFB headquarters situated opposite the Accountant General’s office shortly after noon close on a letter served by the Income Tax Additional Commissioner to KIIFB. The I-T Department has sought details of KIIFB projects implemented in the past five years. It has asked the funding body to submit the details of the financial transactions made with the contractors who had been awarded various works funded by KIIFB in the past five years. The department has also sought the details of income tax paid for each development project. Official sources in KIIFB were tight-lipped on whether the documents sought were being handed over to the I-T officials. ‘Bid to tarnish image’ Finance Minister T. M. Thomas Isaac, who last week made it clear that KIIFB would give replies to the queries sought by the I-T Department, said the inspection was meant to corner the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government as the elections to the Assembly were only two weeks away. Describing the inspection as an act of hooliganism, he said the move was to tarnish the image of KIIFB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/i-t-sleuths-raid-kiifb-hq/article34165877.ece
26 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Now, it’s digital warfare on the election battle front||What does German film Downfall , released in 2004, have to do with the Kerala Assembly elections? A popular parody video of a scene showing Hitler in a bunker with his close aides pointing at a Congress-BJP alliance is now being shared across all Left profiles. In another Internet bubble, Congress workers are gleefully sharing a humorous video of a tea shop owner inquiring about money that has gone missing to an employee, who is shown taking pot shots at the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the gold smuggling case in his defence. Meanwhile, the BJP has come out with a series of videos based on the 1991 Malayalam film Sandesham , with the two brothers portrayed as Congress and Left supporters and their parents asking them to take the ‘right’ path of BJP. This Assembly election season, it is a virtual war on social media in Kerala, with short videos, memes, parody videos, campaign songs, posters, and 3D images becoming a tool to promote a candidate or party and put down the opponents. While the crisply produced official videos of the candidates are popular, what gets the message through to an even wider audience are the seemingly ‘neutral’ and user-generated ones, with less production values, of people sharing their personal experiences of how their lives have changed for the better or for the worse. The data analytics team of each of the parties studies the needs of different social or age group and focus on creating a targeted content. Anil K. Antony, convener of the State Congress digital media cell, says over the past one year, the State Congress has got 50,000 online coordinators and content distribution channels at every level as part of its Janasakthi initiative. “Toolkit has been prepared for each constituency, as localised campaigns are more effective. Two war rooms are functioning, in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, which work like an online digital platform,” he says. The CPI(M) is banking on the strength of its organisational machinery to quickly deliver content at all levels. “One of our focus points this time is media criticism. We also have given instructions to not have content personally attacking anyone, but only projecting our positives,” says a coordinator of the CPI(M)’s cyber wing. One of the BJP’s innovations this time is the almost daily digital conclaves with various personalities, including star campaigners such as cricketer Gautam Gambhir, which are broadcast across all the party’s digital platforms. “Since we give prior information about the conclaves, we get thousands of viewers logging in at the same time from various places in several platforms. It is as effective as organising a big rally,” says P. Jayashankar, IT cell coordinator, BJP. Conspicuous by their absence are the long texts on various campaign issues. The mantra now is short, snappy content, to capture the attention of a generation, for whom there is no dearth of content availability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/now-its-digital-warfare-on-the-election-battle-front/article34165846.ece

Radhakrishnan alleged here on Thursday that, fearful of losses in the upcoming elections, the CPI(M) was unleashing violence against BJP workers. “BJP workers are being attacked by the CPI(M) in places such as Kattakada. Fed up with the violence, the NDA candidate in Kattakada, former BJP State president P. K. Krishnadas, was forced to organise a protest outside the police station,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said. If the violence continued, the people of Kerala would throw the CPI(M) government, which is already mired in corruption and nepotism, into the Arabian Sea, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-attacking-bjp-workers-radhakrishnan/article34166409.ece

26 March 2021||THRIPUNITHURA,KERALA||It’s a tall order for both UDF and LDF||The announcer was speaking about the good work done by K. Babu, the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate for the Thripunithura Assembly constituency, while vouching for his innocence in the bar bribery scandal and attacking the State government for its alleged failures endlessly when Mr. Babu himself made it to the reception organised at Ayni Nada, near Maradu, in an open vehicle on Thursday afternoon. Being thrown into the cauldron of yet another election contest seems to have lifted the spirits of the former Minister and five-time MLA who was reduced to an outcast by his own party in the last five years. Presence in constituency Mr. Babu was confident of his victory though he admitted the Left Democratic Front (LDF) to have a head start in the campaign, which he blamed on the delay in announcing his candidacy. “These people haven't seen their MLA since the election, while I was available despite having lost. Ask them about the difference between me and the present MLA and you will realise why I am confident about the victory,” Mr. Babu gestured towards the people at the reception. He then went on to wield the microphone and list out his many achievements during his previous terms in his conversational style besides taking potshots at the incumbent's claim on development worth Rs. 2,600 crore. Pitching Mr. Babu as the quintessential accessible politician and painting the incumbent and Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate M. Swaraj as a recluse seems to be the main campaign strategy of the UDF camp. Mr. Swaraj, taking a break for lunch at a local committee member's house at South Pereekkad in Thripunithura municipality after a vehicle campaign in sweltering heat, said it was an outdated strategy of the UDF across the State to present their leaders as more popular than their LDF counterparts. Healthy assistance “A legislator's popularity is largely determined by the healthy assistance he facilitates for the people, in which I have the best record in the district. Our campaign is based on development of the constituency, the State government's achievements, and politics. Mr. Babu has staked claim to BJP votes and it is now for the leadership of those two parties to come clear on whether they have struck any unholy nexus for vote trading,” he said. Counters claim Wrapping up his campaign for forenoon at another part of the municipality, BJP candidate K.S. Radhakrishnan shot down the allegations and said he had no clue on what basis Mr. Babu had made that claim. “We are confident of a victory by bagging about 60,000 votes. Those who believe in democracy and God-fearing people among the electorate will see us through,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/its-a-tall-order-for-both-udf-and-ldf/article34165851.ece

Chacko, who has left the Congress to join the NCP, has said. “The Congress, the main Opposition in the country, could not form a political alliance or a political stand to fight the BJP. This is the reason why I quit the Congress,” he said. Mr. Chacko said the Congress had done anything to resist the BJP in the last six years. The decision of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to contest from Wayanad was detrimental for the party, he said. The BJP would suffer a major setback in all the five States, including in Assam, he said. He said the LDF would win the elections in Kerala. The Congress, which has been making secret alliance with the BJP, has lost its identity, he said. The blind enmity against the LDF prompted the Congress to support the BJP. “It’s good to train self defence techniques for girls. But who will resist the BJP. Rahul Gandhi should tell us that too,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-failed-to-fulfil-its-duty-chacko/article34166368.ece

Case in capital “Government employees belonging to Left organisations have added fake voters. There are 12,551 fake voters in Thiruvananthapuram. Nemom has 14,421. The same name has been added on the list from three or four places. Fake identity cards have also been produced. We have to suspect that the Chief Minister is aware of this,” he alleged. ‘Poll code violated’ The Left Democratic Front is distributing kit, rice, and other welfare measures to influence voters. This is against the model code of conduct. The kit meant for students that should have been given from September to March is being distributed now. The Vishu kit, which must be distributed in April, too is being distributed now. Even the pension for May is given now. Saris have been given to Anganwadi teachers. The LDF thinks they can change the minds of voters with these welfare measures, Mr. Chennithala said. ‘Opinion polls absurd’ “The opinion polls are absurd. We have seen them even during the Lok Sabha election. The UDF will secure a huge majority this time,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bid-to-scuttle-peoples-will-chennithala/article34166367.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A mindless celebration of violence||When a film advertises itself as ‘the feel-bad film of the year’, one is bound to feel thankful, having experienced an overdose of feel-goodness at the cinema in recent years. Yet, by the time Kala (Weed) ends, one is left ruing the fact that the warning in that advertisement was not taken seriously, for it delivers what it promises. At the centre of it all is Shaji (Tovino Thomas), a man who revels in his masculinity and competes in ferocity with his pet dog of an exotic breed. He survives mostly on his father’s (Lal) money. We get enough hints that Shaji has already wasted quite a lot of it in unsuccessful ventures. The events in the film happen over the course of a day, when Shaji’s father is out for a medical check-up and his wife (Divya Pillai) is away at her parents’ house. Alone at home with a few workers who have been hired to harvest the vast arecanut plantation attached to the plot, Shaji comes face to face with someone who is out to seek revenge for an event from his past. Rohith.V.S, who debuted with the quirky Adventures of Omanakuttan and went on to do Iblis , returns with a film that is unlike his past works. In Kala , he has chosen to do a dark, violent drama, where just quite a lot of blood is spilled. While that consistent habit of experimentation is laudable, this work sorely lacks in substance and seems to yearn for appreciation for its technical output, most notably the fast cuts, which are overdone in some places, and the visuals. In the initial half, the eerie background tone and visuals are used to create a sense of foreboding. Vagueness is the hallmark of the film all through. It is almost the opposite of some films that over-explain things. This vagueness can be seen in how the characters are written and in how the narrative plays out. Right from the exact reasons for the fear and mental pressure that Shaji’s wife talks about, to Shaji’s past, and the reasons for his peculiar nature are painted in broad strokes, leaving too much to our imagination. Action sequences Much of the attention instead is invested in the action sequences. While some of the raw action does thrill us initially, the novelty soon wears off as the two men get involved in a mortal combat. The underlying theme of the story seems to be the fightback of the oppressed and the downtrodden against the ones who have pillaged their lands and inflicted extreme cruelty on them. Yet, that theme is somehow lost in what is a celebration of mindless violence, and ironically, of masculinity.S S.R.

Raju gave a call for picketing the house of the MLA on Thursday. District police immediately got alerted and deployed a large number of security personnel. Disha police station Deputy Superintendent of Police A. Srinivasulu kept a watch on the developments since morning. The TDP leader was arrested along with other Dalit leaders at several places in and around Dharmavaram town when they tried to reach the place. “We have shifted them to different police stations and our main aim is to maintain law and order,” the DSP said. The standoff began with the MLA asking the District Collector to allow a certain group of people to perform rituals at Chillavaripalli Siva temple during the Sivaratri festivities. The temple had a 120-year-old tradition of the Anke family from Pulivendula performing the rituals, but they were allegedly stopped on the border and the rituals did not take place this year.  The District Collector was acting on the government order of the Endowments Commissioner last year after the Anke family won a lawsuit, and the district administration was asked to ensure the traditions were not disturbed. The MLA, however, blamed the Collector and gave a public statement at a hospital where one person from that village allegedly attempted suicide. Mr. M.S. Raju, however, called the suicide attempt a drama and that the medical reports of the person showed that he had not taken any poison.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dalit-leaders-held-in-dharmavaram/article34166361.ece

The investigation team has gathered over 150 documents from the office of the Sub-Registrar at Mangalagiri that “show the mala fide acts of the individuals involved in the illegal activities.” The names, addresses, photographs, and other details of the persons suspected to be benamis of individuals in decision-making roles in the then government are being compiled. “During the course of investigation, it has come to our notice that certain private individuals are trying to contact the potential witnesses and hamper investigation by twisting facts. As all the victims / witnesses belong to the weaker sections, they were hesitant to approach the law enforcement agencies then,” said a senior CID officer. As the matter is being examined by the Andhra Pradesh High Court, the CID will be placing all the facts before the court through a counter affidavit. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy had reportedly gathered file notings pertaining to the “modification of the CRDA land pooling rules in violation of the A.P. Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfer) Act and the SC/ST (POA) Act,” through his acquaintances who had invoked the Right to Information Act. The investigating officer has been recording the statements of the officials involved in the process of framing the rules pertaining to the controversial G.O. 41 and the assignees who may have been illegally exploited and deprived of their land. “The names of the assignees have been gathered from the revenue records and the data from the AMRDA (CRDA),” the officer said. Several officers, including former District Collector, Guntur, Joint Collector, and Commissioner, CRDA, and other Deputy Collectors were questioned by the CID.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cid-gathers-clinching-evidence-in-amaravati-assigned-land-scandal/article34166339.ece

The water release had been suspended at the request of the authorities in Chennai in view of the adequate storage to meet the needs of the residents and to carry out repairs to the canal carrying water from Kandaleru to Poondi. “We will resume the water release to Chennai from April,” Telugu Ganga project Chief Engineer K. Harinarayana Reddy told The Hindu . The twin major reservoirs in Nellore district had received record inflows during the water year. A quantum of 7.648 tmcft had been supplied to Chennai city during 2019-20 for drinking water purposes, he said. Quota remains elusive Though Chennai is entitled to 12 tmcft of water with the three riparian States of undivided Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra contributing equally, its quota remains elusive during most of the years due to dwindling flows into the reservoirs in the lower riparian State of Andhra Pradesh after the construction of reservoirs in the upper riparian States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/supply-of-krishna-water-to-chennai-from-next-month/article34166157.ece
26 March 2021||NELLORE/ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vaccination picks up as target groups identified||The health authorities resorted to micro-management to give a push to the COVID vaccination drive in south coastal Andhra Pradesh as the number of active cases crossed the 300-mark on Thursday. A battery of health officials led by Nellore Joint Collector N. Prabhakar Reddy fanned out to two villages Chennuru and Dagadarthi for a door-to-door survey to identify all eligible persons for inoculation drive. The soaring mercury was no deterrent as a steady stream of villagers assembled at the village secretariat. A group of health workers waiting for them from the morning administered the vaccine. By the evening, 50 persons above 45 years of age with comorbidity conditions were administered vaccine at Chennuru village. As many as 125 persons aged above 60 years also took the jab. “We will cover all the persons in the target group in every village,” said District Medical and Health Officer S. Rajyalakshmi after overseeing the inoculation of vaccine to over 7,200 persons till late in the evening. With this, 1.30 lakh persons have been given the vaccine in the district, where after a dull start, the drive has picked up pace as people shed their hesitation to take the jab. In Dagadarthi, as many as 144 persons aged above 45 years with other diseases were inoculated and 118 persons above 60 years of age by late in the evening. Meanwhile, there was no respite from coronavirus incidence as 33 in Nellore district and 30 in Prakasam district tested positive. Health officials swung into action and subjected to testing their primary and secondary contacts after isolating them. The number of active cases rose to 302. The saving grace was that none of those undergoing treatment succumbed to the disease. As a result the toll remained unchanged at 509 in Nellore district and 582 in Prakasam district. Helpdesk set up The recovery rate dipped to 98.88% in the region. In Prakasam district, the health officials set up a helpdesk in over 1,000 villages with a view to register the names all those in the targeted age group on-the-spot and administer them the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccination-picks-up-as-target-groups-identified/article34166333.ece
26 March 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Liquor consumption in State has come down by 50%, says Minister||The efforts being made by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to bring down liquor consumption in the State is paying dividends, according to Home Minister M. Sucharitha. Addressing an awareness meeting organised by the Madyapana Vimochana Prachara Committee(MVPC) here on Thursday, Ms. Sucharitha said liquor consumption had come down by 50% during the last 22 months. The YSRCP government was successful in curbing the belt shops that were rampant during the TDP term, she said. “The TDP government had seen liquor more as a revenue earner, and ruined the lives of the common people,” she alleged. She appealed to those addicted to liquor and drugs to make best use of the de-addiction centres set up at the district hospitals. Committee chairman P. Lakshman Reddy said the government was committed to making the State liquor-free in phases. Toll-free number People could register their complaints by calling the toll-free number 14500 on issues relating to alcohol and drugs. District Collector Pola Bhaskar said studies conducted by the WHO showed that those who pick up the habit in their adolescence in a casual manner become addicts over a period. “Students should eschew drugs and other vices, and concentrate on their studies for a bright career,” he said. Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal said the police, in coordination with the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), was acting tough to curb the flow of illicit liquor. The Prakasam police had cracked the case relating to the death of labourers after consuming hand sanitiser during the lockdown period in the Kurichedu area by raiding the manufacturing units outside the State, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/liquor-consumption-in-state-has-come-down-by-50-says-minister/article34165843.ece
26 March 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Andhra region took lead in non-coop. movement’||Mahatma Gandhi was apprehensive of the readiness of the masses to spearhead a non-violent no tax campaign against the Britishers. But, it was the people Andhra region of the Madras Presidency who went ahead with the campaign, observed historians at a national seminar on ‘Nostalgia of non-violent non-cooperation movement in Madras Presidency’ organised by the Acharya Nagarjuna University, Ongole campus on Thursday. The seminar was organised as part the centenary celebrations of the non-cooperation movement held between 1920 and 1922. “Spontaneous protests were organised in the Andhra region of Madras Presidency after the All India Congress Committee authorised every province to undertake the civil disobedience, if the Pradesh Congress Committees got satisfied that the conditions laid down in Dehi were fulfilled,” said Prof. Atlury Murali from University of Hyderabad, delivering the keynote address. It was in Bardoli taluk in Gujarat, Mahatma Gandhi had planned the no-tax campaign. However, it was the people of Andhra who went ahead with the campaign with vigour in the Madras Presidency, he said. Throwing light on the participation of people in these parts in the non-cooperation movement, Prof. Murali said no-tax campaigns broke out in Chirala-Perala in Prakasam district, Palnad and Rayachoti and Pedanandipadu, near Bapatla, in the Andhra region.

Smart City works “Citizens who are turning down water connection may lose their underground drainage system (UDS) connectivity and other services extended by the civic body.

26 March 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||NARL forms consortium of five high-power atmospheric radars||The National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL) at Gadanki near Tirupati has formed a consortium to strengthen radar-based atmospheric research. The cooperative research consortium of high-power atmospheric radars has been formed with five high-power stratosphere, troposphere/ mesosphere – stratosphere– troposphere (ST/MST) radars, which are functioning in different parts of the country . The radars governed by the NARL, Gadanki (Andhra Pradesh); Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), Kerala; Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital in Uttarakhand; Gauhati University, Guwahati (Assam); and University of Calcutta (West Bengal) are used for measuring wind, turbulence, meteorological and ionospheric parameters with excellent height and time resolutions. The formation of the consortium is aimed at strengthening atmospheric science through coordinated radar observations, education, training and exchange programmes. The effort, which was set in motion in form of a training session on Thursday, was attended by 60 delegates including professors, faculty members, research scholars, post-doctoral fellows and technical staff.

26 March 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP follows ‘northeast’ sentiment in Tirupati||Northeast corner is always considered auspicious as per Hindu almanac, which is strongly believed not only in astrological predictions but also in ‘Vaasthu’ (equivalent to modern civil engineering and construction). The sentiment has now become ‘politically relevant’, with most parties choosing the northeastern corner of a constituency to blow their poll bugle. It has always been a practice for the politicians of Tirupati to launch their campaign ahead of any elections from Jeevakona and Thimmanaidupalem areas, located on the northeastern corner of the city as well as the Assembly constituency. Be it the Congress, Praja Rajyam or the YSR Congress Party, there was a strict adherence to this sentiment in the past. A legacy The TDP has more association with this region than others, as it was at this (then) village that the thespian and party founder N.T. Rama Rao had community lunch (sahapankthi bhojanam) with the residents of the Dalit hamlet in 1982 before launching his party. After registering a thumping victory from Tirupati, he went ahead to build a huge colony for them, which exists today. Even his successor N. Chandrababu Naidu also visited the colony a couple of times in the past. It is perhaps for this reason that the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) had no intention of shying away from following the ‘unspoken rule’, when it launched its campaign for the ensuing byelection for the Tirupati (SC) parliamentary constituency from here. After filing nomination at Nellore on Wednesday, party candidate and former Union Minister Panabaka Lakshmi promptly reached Thimminaidupalem on Thursday, where her campaign vehicle started moving into the lanes and bylanes to woo voters. She appealed to the voters to resist the alluring offers from the ruling party and urged them to teach the government a lesson for its ‘anti-people’ measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-follows-northeast-sentiment-in-tirupati/article34166358.ece

He said just when the department officials thought that the education sector could be put back on the rails after the “interruption” caused by the outbreak of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, there were signs of second wave emerging. “We have released the time-table for the 10th class and the Intermediate exams and have announced the academic calendar. Officials of the department have been given strict instructions to scrupulously follow the protocol, which includes use of masks and hand sanitisers and maintaining social distance. The Education and the Medical and Health Departments are working in tandem to ensure safety to children in schools and colleges,” he said. Referring to the incident of more than 160 students in a junior college in Rajahmahendravaram testing positive, which sparked tension among parents, the Minister said it was “very unfortunate”. “To avoid recurrence of such incidents, action has been taken against the college management and the institutions run by it and the hostel attached have been closed down,” he said. He said all private educational institutions must follow the Standard Operating Procedure issued by the department and any deviance from it would not be tolerated. Speaking about the online mode of teaching, he said it was not suitable to everybody. “We are hopeful that such a situation does not arise because not all students, especially in the government schools, have access to technology needed to attend these classes,” he said.

26 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||New sand policy is fool-proof: Minister||Accusing the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) of making baseless allegations on the sand tenders issue, Minister for Panchayat Raj Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy said on Thursday that it was the TDP government that had encouraged the sand mafia in the name of free sand policy. Addressing the media, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said the new sand policy would not give any scope for illegal transportation and black-marketing. The A.P. Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) was entrusted with the task of sand mining and supply. Multiple issues had been reported during the implementation of the policy, and a Cabinet sub-committee was constituted to formulate and take corrective action. Central agency The committee had submitted its report and the same was put in the public domain. The Minister said that the task of selecting the contractor had been entrusted to MSTC, a Central government agency. Bid security The State government had also decided to collect Rs. 120 crore as bid security for the participation of skilled and experienced companies, and tenders were invited on line. The MSTC had selected Jaiprakash Power Ventures Limited (Jaypee), and the target was to supply two crore tonnes of sand. Mr. Ramachandra Reddy further said that since the price was capped at Rs. 475 per tonne, the total value of the contract was not more than Rs. 950 crore, out of which the company should pay Rs. 765 crore to the State government. He questioned the rationale behind the TDP leaders’ charge that the tenders were fraught with corruption amounting to thousands of crores of rupees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-sand-policy-is-fool-proof-minister/article34166348.ece
26 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Annual tiger estimate to begin next month||The Andhra Pradesh Forest Department is gearing up to count the number of big cats in the State from April. The ‘tiger estimation’ exercise will be continue till the onset of the rainy season. The exercise will also culminate with the All India Tiger Estimate-22 (AITE-22), the tiger population census that is conducted once in four years. The AITE is conducted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in collaboration with the State Forest Departments. It was started in 2006, and the last estimate was done in 2018-19. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) N. Prateep Kumar says that the annual estimate helps in keeping a tab on the tiger population and take steps to conserve the tigers. Training programmes have been conducted for the personnel in grid making, fixing cameras, etc. In all, 2,000 field staff will be deployed in the exercise that will also cover the co-predators and prey. The department will fix motion sensor cameras at the locations where tiger territories have been identified. “During the estimation done earlier, it was found that the tiger population had risen to 60. The department has camera trap images of each of the 60 tigers. The remarkable rise in their numbers is due to the persistent conservation efforts of the department through the local community and intense patrolling. The tiger habitat is expanding, and it covers a significant area of the Nallamala forest and the Seshachalam hill range. The presence of the big cat has been found in Papikondalu also,” says Mr. Prateep Kumar. Sophisticated equipment The exercise begins with the installation of sophisticated cameras with infrared sensors, which are put in pairs. The department will utilise the services of local tribes such as the Chenchus in fixing and relocating the cameras. The tribal people will act as trackers for protecting and monitoring the tigers. The cameras trap millions of photographs. It is a big task in evaluating the data, as each and every photograph has to be analysed, he explains. The camera trap images help in identifying the individual tigers through stripes and other physical features. Also, it is possible to arrive at the count in a more accurate manner compared to the pug marks. The stripes of tiger are like fingerprints of a human being. The stripes of tiger do not match with the other, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/annual-tiger-estimate-to-begin-next-month/article34166338.ece
26 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lokesh threatens stir against demolitions||Telugu Desam Party national general secretary and MLC Nara Lokesh on Thursday said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his MLAs had no right to demolish houses of the poor at Tadepalli in Mangalagiri segment of Guntur district. He said when the ruling party had failed to get even a single house constructed for the needy in its 22-month-long rule, it had no right to demolish the existing houses. Mr. Lokesh accused Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy of conspiring to demolish over 320 houses belonging to poor families in Ward no 2 of Tadepalli. The poor residents now lived in the fear of their homes getting demolished by the government, like the houses at Atmakur that were razed a few days ago. The TDP leader said the residents had met him and poured out their woes. They had been living here in their homes constructed 45 years ago. In the run-up to the 2019 elections, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy had threatened to get their houses demolished if they did not vote for him and now, he was bent on pulling down their dwellings, he alleged. Mr. Lokesh assured his full support to the aggrieved residents and promised to stand by them. He dared the YSRCP MLA to touch even a single brick and said he would sit on a protest if the ruling party leader tried to go ahead with his “evil” plans. He said the Chief Minister and his Ministers boasted of constructing lakhs of houses for the poor, but had failed to provide them even a single house till now. He alleged that the YSRCP thrived and flourished on spreading lies and falsehoods. He said the video evidence had foiled the game plan of the ruling party which tried to raise the bogey of “'assigned farmers’ lands”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lokesh-threatens-stir-against-demolition-of-houses-at-tadepalli/article34165568.ece

26 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP extends support for Bharat bandh call today||Telugu Desam Party State president K. Atchannaidu on Thursday said the party would extend its full support to the Bharat bandh call given by the Kisan Samyukta Morcha on Friday. In a statement, he said the TDP was strongly opposed to both the farm Bills and the proposed privatisation of the Visakha Steel Plant. He said the TDP leaders and the cadre would take active part in the bandh from village to the State-level and make it a success. With regard to the VSP, the party would continue its fight till the Centre rolled back its divestment decision, he said. Mr. Atchannaidu accused the ruling party of adopting anti-farmer stand. He said the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government extended its unconditional support to the farmers’ Bills ignoring the plight of the thousands of farmers who had been protesting against the new laws. In the State, the Chief Minister had been indifferent to the pleas of the farmers in Amaravati region who had sacrificed their lands for construction of a new capital and now electric meters were being fixed to agricultural motors. He alleged that the YSRCP government had entered into a secret deal with POSCO for privatisation of the steel plant with an eye on its prime properties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-extends-support-for-bharat-bandh-call-today/article34166342.ece

26 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Second wave of COVID-19 has arrived in district, say officials||After a lull of four months, when the number of daily COVID-19 cases had dropped to single digits, the district has once again started witnessing a sudden surge in cases. From March 1, the district has recorded close to 630 cases till date. “On March 1, we reported just one case in the district, and the total active cases stood at only 24. But today, the number of active cases stands at 526 and we have recorded close to 450 cases in the last five days alone,” said District COVID-19 Special Officer and Andhra Medical College principal P.V. Sudhakar. This indicates that the second wave has begun in the district, he said. But health officials are not sure how serious this will be and whether it can be compared to the surge in some other States such as Maharashtra, Kerala and Chhattisgarh. First UK strain recorded The district has been randomly sending some samples to CCMB (Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology), Hyderabad, and as per health officials, only one sample had matched the UK strain so far. The sample is that of a woman who has returned from abroad and resides in Visakhapatnam city. She had tested positive in Kakinada a month ago. Her strain matched the UK strain, officials said, adding that she has made a full recovery and was kept under observation after she returned from Kakinada. COVID-appropriate behaviour Health experts attribute the surge to lack of COVID-appropriate behaviour. People have become complacent and many have stopped wearing masks, or maintaining personal hygiene or following social distancing norms. “Since the beginning, we have been advocating that the second wave is due to lack of appropriate behaviour. This, coupled with some events such as Maha Sivaratri, VSP agitation and ULB elections, can be seen as the likely reasons for the sudden rise in cases,” Dr. Sudhakar said. Vaccination is key The district administration said that though the machinery is now well prepared both in terms of understanding the disease and in terms of infrastructure and equipment after having combated the pandemic for over a year, they feel that vaccination can play a key role in stopping the surge. “If we can vaccinate 70-75% of the population, we can develop herd immunity among others and that should keep us safe,” said Dr. Sudhakar. But it has to be done at a faster pace and the age restriction for vaccination should be done away with. “The time has come to open up the vaccination drive for all above 18 years of age. We understand that it is a challenge for vaccine manufacturers, but this is the only way out,” he said. A senior doctor from the District Immunology Department said that as of now 200 session (vaccine) sites are operational and around 1,000 staff are engaged. This can be scaled up to 500 sites and 2,500 staff can be deputed to speed up the vaccination. Poor response The vaccination drive began on January 16, and so far the response has been far from desirable. In the first phase for health workers, the response has been only around 75%. In the second phase for frontline workers, it has been around 45% and for the third phase (45+ with co-morbidities) it has been around 40 to 45%. Visakhapatnam district has a population of around 46 lakh, and so far, only two lakh have been vaccinated. Health experts opine that at least by June or July, if 30 lakh take the jab, then the herd immunity can be expected to develop. Special drive To step up the vaccination process, the district administration is embarking on a drive and health teams will move to the premises of PSUs and major institutions to give the jab. This apart, the administration is also contemplating imposition of fines for not wearing masks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/second-wave-of-covid-19-has-arrived-in-district-say-officials/article34166445.ece
26 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||ANGRAU scientists get patent for granular jaggery||An innovative technology for preparation of granular jaggery, developed by scientists of Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University (ANGRAU) at All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Post-Harvest Engineering Technology (PHET), at Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS), Anakapalle, here, has bagged a patent. ANGRAU Vice-Chancellor A. Vishnu Vardhan Reddy announced this at the Kisan Mela-cum-technology and machinery demonstration mela at RARS, Anakapalle, on Thursday. The Vice-Chancellor and Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath participated as guests at the mela. The patent for ‘machinery and process of manufacturing of cane jaggery in crystal form’ was granted to Dr. S. Ramakrishna, retired Principal Scientist, AICRP on PHET, RARS, Anakapalle, Dr. A. Padma Raju, retired Director Research/Vice-Chancellor, Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University and Dr. P.V.K. Jagannadha Rao, Principal Scientist and Head, AICRP on PHET, RARS, Anakapalle. Sugarcane jaggery is a traditional sweetener with high medicinal value, which has minerals, vitamins, proteins and reducing sugars along with sucrose. The inherent moisture content present in the traditional solid jaggery leads to development of microbes causing spoilage and limiting its shelf life for a period of three to four months. This is coming in the way of jaggery exports, despite its high quality, says Dr. Jagannadha Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/angrau-gets-patent-for-granular-jaggery/article34166429.ece

Andhra Pradesh Adivasi Joint Action Committee (APAJAC) leaders Ramarao Dora, Gangaraju Sonai, Radhakrishna Kuda, Suryanarayana Javvadi and Shiva Kesava met Dr. Vardhan in Paderu on Thursday and informed him that Dharmavaram Agraharam, Chammachinta, Sarugudu, Kuruvada, Kalavavoddhu Sarabhavaram and Pottinagannadora Palem in Nathavaram mandal are clearly mentioned as Fifth Schedule villages. They noted that G.O. MS no. 20 issued by the State government on March 23 includes these villages under the extended jurisdiction of VMRDA. Merger of these villages in the VMRDA directly infringes upon the Panchayat (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) as well as The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, (FRA of 2006) that grant special and exclusive powers to Adivasi gram sabhas.

26 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Jab drive not reaching sanitary staff||Digital divide, indifference and lack of awareness have meant that a large number of sanitary staff working with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation have not received the vaccination against COVID in the city. “They are giving the vaccines in Budwel. I was told I will get it but after that there has been no information,” says Amruta, a sanitary worker with the GHMC sweeping the road near Rajendranagar. She estimates that she is aged about 55. Her colleague Ramachandriah too says he didn’t get the vaccine. “I was told I will get the vaccine and I registered. A message came to my phone, I went to bada dawakhana (Osmania General Hospital) and got the vaccine along with other members of my squad,” says Chinamma, who stops sweeping and sits down to have chai near Ziyaguda abattoir. She reels off the names of her colleagues who have received the vaccine. More than a year after cheering for frontline workers, and being the first to get the vaccines, a large number of sanitary workers in the city have not received them after the rollout began on January 16, 2021. The rollout is linked to identity cards with Aadhaar being the most preferred one followed by government issued identity cards and PAN card. The registration is being done on an app as well as the CoWIN website customised for the purpose. And the first bit of information on the website is: “Register or SignIn for Vaccination. We will send you a One Time Password on your phone number.” While most ASHA workers and sanitation workers have cellphones, some of them don’t have. The result: Some sanitation workers, though classified as frontline workers and eligible to receive the vaccines, have been left out. All the sanitation workers who said they have received the vaccine in Purana Pul, Malakpet and Rambagh area, owned or shared cellphones. Sanitation workers in some areas of Sirimale Nagar and Rajendranagar, who said they didn’t get the vaccine didn’t own cellphone. “We didn’t take the vaccine as I was away in my village. Now, they say the disease is over,” says Chiranjeevi, who is part of an 18-member squad that cleans near Zehra Nagar in Banjara Hills. “Vaccination is now available to everyone who can walk in with an Aadhaar card. The population priority sequencing didn’t work as the app and the website had glitches. Either the sanitation workers are not informed properly or this is about vaccine hesitancy,” said Sujatha Rao, former Health Secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jab-drive-not-reaching-sanitary-staff/article34166244.ece
26 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Problems persist over ‘podu’ lands: State govt.||The State government has admitted in the Assembly on Thursday that the ‘podu’ lands issue is persisting in several districts with tribal population, particularly due to the dispute of ownership between the Revenue and Forest Departments.

Bhatti Vikramarka during the Question Hour, informed that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had already assured to lead a team of officials and legislators to the podu lands in dispute soon as part of working out a solution.

The remaining 9,976 claims for 40,932 acres land were rejected by the district-level committees as they were found ineligible.

He said he had been demanding Rs. 1,000 crores for the constituency development and house sites to the poor but there was no response from the government. He said proposals for a medical college for Sangareddy were sent long back but the government shifted the college to Siddipet. He reminded that CM KCR had promised in the Assembly itself that Sangareddy would be given a medical college but the promise is not honoured so far. Mr. Reddy said in 2013 about 5,000 people were given house pattas but the TRS government had cleared all those poor people from those sites now. About 40,000 people are waiting for house sites but there is no response from the government. He said he had been requesting for funds for the constituency but it is being deliberately ignored. Congress party is given little time in the Assembly and whenever there is an effort to raise issues of public concern the mike is immediately cut, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sangareddy-is-being-discriminated/article34166266.ece
26 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bills passed on retirement age, legislators’ health expenses||The Telangana Assembly passed two Bills with a voice vote and without any debate on Thursday increasing the age of superannuation to the State government employees, pension to former legislators and cashless treatment limit for the sitting and former members and their spouses. The bills passed were – The Telangana Payment of Salaries and Pension and Removal of Disqualifications (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and The Telangana Public Employment (Regulation of Age of Superannuation) (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Minister for Finance T. Harish Rao explained that several former legislators had approached the government that the pension they were getting was not sufficient to meet their basic needs. Accordingly, the Bill provides for increasing the minimum pension to Rs. 50,000 per month from the existing Rs. 30,000 with an upper limit of Rs. 70,000 per month. Further, the limit for cashless treatment of the sitting and former legislators and their spouses was being increased from the present Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh a year. The proposal had come from Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao himself as the plight of former legislator C. Baganna from Zaheerabad, who died following illness in NIMS recently, was taken to his notice. An amount of Rs. 2.5 lakh bills were due at the time of his death. The government was sanctioning the amount beyond Rs. 1 lakh limit but it was taking time for correspondence causing inconvenience to the former and sitting legislators and their spouses undergoing treatment in hospitals, Mr. Harish Rao said. Another Bill passed was to ratify the recent announcement of the Chief Minister to increase in the retirement age of the State government employees to 61 years from 58 years. Mr. Harish Rao stated that the process for filling 50,000 vacancies would be taken up soon so that there is no impact of increase in the retirement age of employees. Promotions are being given at all eligible employees and the posts that would get vacant in the process would be filled, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bills-passed-on-retirement-age-legislators-health-expenses/article34166258.ece

Hearing a couple of PIL petitions, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy sought to know from Waqf Board why it had failed to secure the 2,186 properties. The board had identified in 2020 that these assets were being illegally occupied by others. Despite receiving favourable orders from the court, why the board was not reclaiming the properties, the bench asked the Waqf Board counsel. It directed the counsel to file a report within two weeks as to what action was being taken to ensure they were safe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-waqf-properties-not-reclaimed-hc/article34166249.ece

26 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||18 diagnostic centres in districts by April-end||To ensure early treatment for patients coming to government health facilities with early detection of their ailments, the State government would open 18 diagnostic centres in districts by April-end that can conduct 60 different types of tests, Health Minister Eatala Rajender told the Assembly on Thursday. Responding to a question asked by TRS members Gandra Venkata Ramana Reddy and Dr. Methuku Anand during the Question Hour, the Minister explained that such diagnostic centres were being established under the ‘hub and spoke model’ with a cost of up to Rs. 1.5 crore each. He stated that two such labs had already started functioning, including the one at Siddipet. In Hyderabad, the government has established a modern pathological lab with an investment of about Rs. 12 crore in the blood bank complex at Narayanguda and samples collected in about 325 centres in the city would be taken to the lab for various prescribed tests. Reports of such tests would be sent directly to the patients and hospitals/health facility concerned in online mode. About 5,000 samples were being tested every day at the Narayanguda lab with a capacity to conduct 2,000 samples an hour, the Minister said. Besides, smaller testing facilities had already been established with Rs. 50 lakh each equipment in eight health centres and another 12 in the process of establishment. In response to Dr. Anand’s suggestion to establish the facilities for breast and cervical cancer detection, he said the government was also planning to add radiology diagnosis in district hospitals. Mr. Ramana Reddy suggested the government to provide sugar, blood pressure and COVID testing facilities in 104 vehicles along with medicines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/18-diagnostic-centres-in-districts-by-april-end/article34166242.ece
26 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Space farming may be possible, says study||During the deep space missions, astronauts carry canned spaced foods for their survival. Is it possible for them to grow their own foods in the space stations (space farming) and enjoy the benefits of naturally grown vegetables? A collaborative discovery of novel bacterial strains aboard the International Space Station (ISS) by researchers from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and University of Hyderabad (UoH) suggests that it could be possible. A recent discovery of new bacterial strains from different locations aboard ISS flights may help in creating the ‘fuel’ to help plants withstand such stressful situations. The strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations aboard the ISS across two consecutive flights. While one strain was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum , the other three were previously undiscovered and belonged to a novel species. Genetic analyses revealed them to be closely related to Methylobacterium indicum . The researchers named the novel species as Methylobacterium ajmalii , in honour of the renowned Indian biodiversity scientist, Dr. Ajmal Khan (former professor at Annamalai University). The genome analysis of Methylobacterium ajmalii strains revealed the presence of genes that are involved in promoting plant growth. Commenting on the discovery and based on the genomic data, the lead authors said that the strains might possess “biotechnologically useful genetic determinants that may help growing plants in extreme places where resources are minimal”. However, further experimental validations are being done to prove that it could, indeed, be a potential game-changer for space farming. These research findings are a collaborative effort of three organisations from USA. The teams were led by Dr. Kasthuri Venkateswaran (NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory), and C.C. Wang (WorldQuant Initiative for Quantitative Prediction) and Prof. Appa Rao Podile from the UoH.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/space-farming-may-be-possible-says-a-study-by-top-researchers/article34166241.ece

Mr. Reddy, in his letter written to the HC, accused the hotel management of constructing the building in violation of different norms of Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, while issuing notices to the government, impleaded Tulips Grand hotel management as respondents in the plea. The bench directed the government and the hotel management to respond to the contentions of Mr. Reddy within four weeks by filing counter affidavits. The MP contended that the hotel building, located in Turkayamjal municipality (earlier a gram panchayat) coming under Ranga Reddy district, was built without obtaining permissions from the HMDA authorities. He charged that it was constructed illegally. Standing counsel for Municipalities Praveen Kumar informed the bench that it was Turkayamjal gram panchayat which had accorded permission for construction of Tulips Grand hotel. As per the permission, the management of the hotel was supposed to construct ground plus two floors. However, they had constructed the hotel building with ground plus five floors. The counsel told the court that the hotel management had applied for regularisation of the floors additionally constructed in 2016. The matter is pending in the backdrop of the court orders issued in various writ petitions filed by the neighbours of the hotel building and the hotel management.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-issues-notices-to-govt-on-hotel-construction/article34166261.ece

Several students and organisations staged protests in Suryapet and Nalgonda, and alleged that the State government, keeping in mind the Graduates’ MLC polls, had kept various institutions open. But after the conclusion of the polls, COVID-19 became an excuse to shut down the institutions again, they said.

26 March 2021||New Delhi,||New registration renewal fee has left vehicle owners confused||A deluge of inquiries regarding the renewal of registration of vehicles older than 10 and 15 years has inundated Motor Licencing Offices (MLOs) across the city after the Centre announced that such vehicles need not be scrapped necessarily. Earlier this month, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) issued a draft notification proposing an increase in fees for the renewal of registration of vehicles older than 15 years from October 1. However, sources from the Transport department claimed that the precise provisions under the new policy, allowing more frequent cycles of assessment for older vehicles whose registration can be renewed subject to payment of higher fees, are currently somewhat unclear. As a result, a slew of inquiries about the process is not only jamming phones but has also increased the rush of visitors at MLOs in the Capital as COVID-19 cases rise, a senior transport department official complained. Queries galore “We keep getting calls about one scenario or the other from vehicle owners – my vehicle will be ten years old on so and so date, how much will it cost to renew its registration, what if I intend to renew my registration in advance, should I buy another vehicle instead of paying higher fee for this one – and similar queries,” an official said. “It would have been better had the Centre also clarified these specifics instead of just announcing the broad objectives of the scheme. It is increasing the rush of visitors at offices whom we cannot help because we do not have the answers to their questions ourselves,” another official said. At some Regional Transport Offices, visitors with queries are coming across notices asking them to wait till October – when the new policy comes into force – for answers. Most of the queries, sources said, were regarding whether the policy would only apply to vehicles older than 15 years or ten years in addition to other specific criteria.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh dismissed the petition noting that no specific incidents of such violation have been mentioned in the plea. The High Court, however, gave the petitioner the liberty to file before the appropriate forum mentioning specific incidents. The court said there are provisions already under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act to address the grievances raised in the plea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/plea-against-giving-loose-medicines-declined/article34166216.ece
26 March 2021||Sivasagar,||Future meets past for jailed present in Sibsagar||The 18th century Rangghar, considered Asia’s oldest amphitheatre, is more than just a landmark in eastern Assam’s Sivasagar. It symbolises Assamese cultural pride, was witness to the birth of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom in April 1979 and most recently, the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The only posters near this centrepiece of Ahom architecture are of Raijor Dal (RD), one of two new regional political parties sired by the violent anti-CAA movement that landed its president Akhil Gogoi in jail 15 months ago. The posters display Mr. Gogoi along with Lurinjyoti Gogoi, president of Assam Jatiya Parishad, the other party forged in the anti-CAA fire. A team of volunteers, many of them college and university students are armed with Mr. Gogoi’s posters and cut-outs as they fan out of an unused Naga cuisine restaurant turned party office located 5 km from Rangghar to seek votes for their jailed leader. “It is tough campaigning without our candidate in person. The BJP and the Congress are trying to take advantage by telling people that a candidate absent before election will not be seen after. But our volunteers are making people understand that he has been kept out of campaigning deliberately,” Bedabrata Gogoi, a Jawaharlal Nehru University student handling the RD chief’s campaign told The Hindu . “Sivasagar is steeped in history. It was once the kingdom of the mighty Ahoms whose monarchy was more democratic than today’s Assam. The people are realising our candidate is the jailed present to a better future without CAA and other anti-people rules imposed on us,” he added. RD also hopes Priyada Gogoi, Akhil Gogoi’s 84-year-old mother would help garner the sympathy votes. “People are shedding tears for me as I have been for my son. All I want is for my son to be free, and I know they can help him get out of jail by voting for him,” she said. Protim Sharma, a college teacher and political commentator, said the candidature of Akhil Gogoi — accused of ties with Maoist — has rejuvenated the Left-leaning voters of Sibsagar. The constituency used to be a CPI stronghold before former Assembly Speaker Pranab Gogoi made it a Congress bastion since 2001. Congress candidate Subhramitra Gogoi, a newcomer who has the responsibility of defending the seat for the party, brushes aside the challenge from the jailed leader. “He is not a major factor. He may gain sympathy from some, but most people here do not trust him,” he said.  ‘Welcome graduation’ The BJP’s Surabhi Rajkonwari, who had lost the 2016 election narrowly to Pranab Gogoi, welcomed the RB president’s “graduation” from “street andolan (agitation)” to electoral politics. “He has his agenda, we have our own, and that is development for all. Let’s see who the people opt for,” she said. A total of six candidates, including Ajit Hazarika of Nationalist Congress Party, are contesting the Sibsagar seat that goes to the polls on March 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/future-meets-past-for-jailed-present-in-sibsagar/article34166222.ece

26 March 2021||Mumbai,||No transfer scam in Maharashtra: CS’s report||A report into the phone tapping allegations submitted by Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday ruled out any wrongdoing in the transfers of police officials by the State Home Department. The Hindu is in possession of a copy of the five-page report. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fandavis had alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had suppressed former Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla’s report, which claimed that as per intercepted phone calls, some police officials and politicians were allegedly involved in a transfer scam. The Chief Secretary’s report has censured Ms. Shukla for misleading the State government and securing permission to tap phones. The report confirmed that no IPS officer was transferred and there were no pending transfer proposals between June 27, 2020, and September 1, 2020, as the State administration was busy taking measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. Ms. Shukla sought permission to tap phones in July last year and submitted her report on August 25, the report said. BJP’s claims debunked Mr. Kunte’s report said the phone surveillance mentioned in Ms. Shukla’s report was of private individuals and had no relation to transfers of police officials. The report debunked Mr. Fadnavis’s claims that he was in possession of 6.3 GB of data on phone surveillance. It confirmed that Ms. Shukla did not submit any pen drive to the State government. The report said, “Rashmi Shukla purposely misled the government and sought permission under the Indian Telegraph Act to tap phones, claiming possible law and order problem. This Act can be used only to combat anti-national activities, preserving national security and maintaining sovereignty of the nation. Political differences, commercial conflicts, and family matters cannot be brought under this law. Since the State government was misled, an explanation was sought from her.” The report said when Ms. Shukla was asked to give an explanation, she apologised personally to the Chief Minister and State Home Minister. She told them she was grappling with family problems and the responsibility of looking after her children following the death of her husband. “It was only on humanitarian grounds that no action was taken against her,” the report said. Mr. Kunte’s report said a copy of Ms. Shukla’s report was in the public domain and leaking such top-secret letters was a serious issue. “Her actions have jeopardised the privacy of the officers named as well as subjected them to defamation for no fault of theirs. Her report has proved no wrongdoing whatsoever,” it said.

26 March 2021||Mumbai,||Sachin Vaze’s NIA custody extended till April 3||A special court on Thursday extended till April 3 the custody of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in the Antilia bomb scare case, with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) claiming that the alleged crime fell in the category of a “terrorist act”. The NIA told the court it wanted to confront Mr. Vaze with the other accused in the Mansukh Hiren murder, a related case, and probe 62 unaccounted for bullets found at Mr. Vaze’s house. Mr. Vaze pleaded that he had been made a “scapegoat”. He was produced before the court after his earlier remand expired. The NIA sought his custody for another 15 days. “I have been made a scapegoat and have nothing to do with the case,” Mr. Vaze told judge P.R. Sitre during the hearing. “I was investigating officer of the case for one and a half days, and did whatever I could in that capacity. But there was suddenly change in some plan somewhere. I went to the NIA office on my own and was arrested,” he said. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, the NIA lawyer, told the court that Mr. Vaze’s crime being “a terrorist act” and as a person (Hiren) was killed and explosives were planted, further 15-day custody was needed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sachin-vazes-nia-custody-extended-till-april-3/article34165835.ece
26 March 2021||Mumbai,||Asha Bhosle to be honoured with Maharashtra Bhushan||The Maharashtra government on Thursday said singer Asha Bhosle has been selected for the Maharashtra Bhushan award, the State government’s highest honour. A committee chaired by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray decided to select Ms. Bhosle for the award for the year 2020. The award, instituted in 1996 by the State government to recognise distinguished work and achievements of eminent persons from the State, representing different walks of life, carries a cash prize of Rs. 10 lakh and a citation. Ms. Bhosle, whose sister Lata Mangeshkar won the award for 1997, said she got to know from Mr. Thackeray that she has been selected for the award for 2020. “I thank him that he thought of choosing me for the award,” Ms. Bhosle said. “People of Maharashtra have loved me a lot and have treated me as part of their family over these many years,” she said. Asked what does it feel to be in her mid-80s, Ms. Bhosle said, “Age is just a number. I feel I am as old as my mind.” Born on September 8, 1933, in Maharashtra’s Sangli district, Ms. Bhosle was initiated into music by her father, the renowned Marathi stage actor-singer Dinanath Mangeshkar. Having sung her first song for a Marathi film in 1944, she has the distinction of having sung thousands of songs in practically every major Indian language. The versatility of her voice and talent has been acknowledged through a host of awards conferred on her, including the National Award twice, the prestigious Filmfare Award eight times, and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in the year 2001. Ms. Bhosle received the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for 2000. The first Maharashtra Bhushan awardee was Marathi writer P.L. Deshpande and the last winner of this award was historian Babasaheb Purandare who got it for the year 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/asha-bhosle-to-be-honoured-with-maharashtra-bhushan/article34165830.ece
26 March 2021||Mumbai,||Rashmi Shukla pressured MLA to join BJP after polls: Awhad||State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad claimed on Thursday that former Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla misused her powers to pressure Rajendra Patil Yadravkar — Independent MLA and current Minister of State for Medical Education, Public Health and Family Welfare — to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instead of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) after the Assembly polls. Mr. Awhad said, “Rashmi Shukla called, met and asked Rajendra Yadravkar to not join the MVA. She instead asked him to join the BJP. We had come to know about this matter then. When the MVA government was formed, she apologised for her actions.” The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader on Wednesday alleged that Ms. Shukla had intercepted calls without permission from the then Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sitaram Kunte, who now serves as the Chief Secretary of Maharashtra. Mr. Awhad said a section of officers have been working for the BJP and many of them are still working in the present government. “Rashmi Shukla presented false reasons to secure permission for phone tapping. Phones of different individuals were tapped and it was a systematic plan to defame the State government,” he said. The minister said that none of the officers mentioned in Ms. Shukla’s report were transferred. “Above all, these conversations are of individuals who have no relation whatsoever with the Home Minister or with the concerned officer. It seems, the whole thing was planted with a purpose to trouble the government,” he said. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, State Congress chief Nana Patole alleged that some IPS officers in the Maharashtra cadre, who have been secretly helping the BJP on directions of the Central government, will face action. “We have come to know that there are some officers who have been secretly helping the BJP against the MVA government. They have breached the oath of secrecy, and hence they will face action,” he said. Reacting to Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s allegations, Mr. Patole said, “He is clearly misleading the people and maligning the image of the State at the national level.” The BJP has been targeting the Maharashtra government ever since it lost power, he alleged. Asked if the MVA government is shielding Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in the wake of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations of corruption against him, Mr. Patole said, “We are setting up an inquiry into the charges. When Mr. Fadnavis was the chief minister, he used to give a clean chit to his ministers.” A delegation of MVA ministers will soon be meeting Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. A delegation from the BJP had met Mr. Koshyari on Wednesday, requesting him to seek a status report from the Chief Minister on the State’s law and order situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rashmi-shukla-pressured-mla-to-join-bjp-after-polls-awhad/article34165839.ece
26 March 2021||Mumbai,||Singh files petition against Deshmukh in Bombay HC||Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh on Thursday filed a public interest litigation in the Bombay High Court seeking an “immediate and unbiased” probe against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who he claimed asked police officer Sachin Vaze to collect Rs. 100 crore from bars and restaurants. The IPS officer had earlier this week approached the Supreme Court, which on Wednesday termed as quite serious the matter in which he had filed a plea against Mr. Deshmukh, but asked him to approach the Bombay High Court with his grievances. Mr. Singh said in his plea before the High Court that Mr. Deshmukh held meetings at his residence with several Mumbai police officials, including Mr. Vaze, in February. In these meetings, Mr. Deshmukh instructed the officers to collect Rs. 100 crore per month from various establishments, the plea reads. It added that Mr. Deshmukh regularly interfered with police functioning and often misused his office. Mr. Deshmukh’s conduct warranted a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the plea in the high court read. ‘Need CBI probe’ Mr. Singh urged the court to direct the CBI to conduct an immediate, unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial, and fair investigation” in the “various corrupt malpractices” of the minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/singh-files-petition-against-deshmukh-in-bombay-hc/article34165832.ece
26 March 2021||Mumbai,||‘Won’t act against official in Delkar case till Apr. 9’||The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Thursday that it will not take any coercive action against Dadra and Nagar Haveli Collector Sandeep Kumar Singh, who has been booked for abetment of suicide of MP Mohan Delkar, till April 9. Delkar, a Member of Parliament from the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, died by suicide in Mumbai in February this year and had left behind a note naming several persons, according to the police. Mr. Singh had approached the high court on Wednesday seeking that the FIR, filed on a complaint by Delkar's son Abhinav, against him in the case be quashed. A Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and Manish Pitale accepted the State’s counsel Deepak Thakre’s statement and adjourned the hearing on the plea to April 9. Mr. Singh’s counsel, senior advocate Amit Desai, said the FIR that named his client as one of the accused in the case was baseless and politically motivated. In his plea, Mr. Singh said that there was no specific allegation against him in the FIR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/wont-act-against-official-in-delkar-case-till-apr-9/article34165833.ece

The summons was issued last week by Metropolitan Magistrate, Mazgaon, but the detailed order was made available on Wednesday. The film is based on a novel by S. Hussain Zaidi and Jane Borges, and is being being produced by Bhansali Productions. The summons was issued to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Bhansali Productions, the authors and Bhatt. A defamation case was filed by Babuji Shah through lawyer Narendra Dubey. Mr. Shah, the adopted son of Gangubai Kathiawadi, said chapters in the novel on his mother were defamatory, tarnished her reputation and infringed upon the right to privacy and self-respect. Mr. Shah, in his complaint, said Kathiawadi was a social worker who fought for the rights of sex workers, and lived her life with dignity and respect.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gangubai-kathiawadi-film-producers-alia-get-summons/article34165831.ece
26 March 2021||Cairo,||Suez Canal temporarily halts navigation||The owners of a giant container vessel blocking the Suez Canal said on Thursday that they were facing “extreme difficulty” refloating it, prompting Egypt to suspend navigation through one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it was trying to refloat the Panama-flagged MV Ever Given , a 400-metre-long vessel that veered off course and ran aground in a sandstorm on Tuesday. Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs Inc show the 59-metre-wide container ship wedged diagonally across the entire canal. Japanese ship-leasing firm Shoei Kisen Kaisha said it owned the giant vessel and was facing “extreme difficulty” trying to refloat it. “In co-operation with local authorities and Schulte Shipmanagement, a vessel management company, we are trying to refloat [the ship], but we are facing extreme difficulty,” Shoei Kisen Kaisha said in a statement on its website. As shipping specialists warned it could take days or even weeks to budge the vessel, the Suez Canal Authority announced it was “temporarily suspending navigation”. New dredger Maritime sources told AFP on Thursday that a new dredger had been deployed to speed up the operation while northern convoy ships remain docked in the waiting areas of the canal. “We’ve never seen anything like it before,” said Ranjith Raja, an oil and shipping researcher at international financial data firm Refinitiv. “It is likely that the congestion ... will take several days or weeks to sort out as it will have a knock-on effect on other convoys.” The blockage has already hit world oil markets. Crude futures surged 6% on Wednesday as traders assessed the likely impact on deliveries. Broker Braemar warned that if tug boats are unable to move the giant vessel, some of its cargo might have to be removed by crane barge to refloat it. “This can take days, maybe weeks,” it said. The vessel’s managers, Singapore-based Schulte Shipmanagement, said its 25 crew were unhurt and the hull and cargo undamaged. A MarineTraffic map showed large clusters of vessels circling as they waited in both the Mediterranean to the north and the Red Sea to the south. Historic sections of the canal were reopened in a bid to ease the bottleneck, with dozens of ships waiting at both ends of the waterway. It is an “absolutely critical” route because “all traffic arriving from Asia goes through the Suez Canal”, said Camille Egloff, a maritime transport specialist at Boston Consulting Group. Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal last year carrying more than one billion tonnes of cargo, according to the SCA. Egypt earned $5.61 billion in revenues from the canal in 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/suez-canal-temporarily-halts-navigation/article34165473.ece
26 March 2021||Beijing,||China flays foreign brands over Xinjiang accusations||Chinese state TV on Thursday called for a boycott of H&M as Beijing lashed out at foreign clothing and footwear brands following Western sanctions on Chinese officials accused of human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region. The ruling Communist Party criticised H&M for saying in 2020 that it would stop buying cotton from the northwestern Chinese region. The Swedish retailer joined other brands in expressing concern about reports of forced labor there. The party newspaper Global Times also criticised statements by Burberry, Adidas, Nike, New Balance and Zara about Xinjiang as early as two years ago. “For enterprises that touch the bottom line of our country, the response is very clear: don’t buy!” China Central Television said on social media. It said the ‘H’ and ‘M’ in the Swedish name stood for Chinese words meaning lie and falsehood. The attacks follow Monday’s decision by the 27-nation European Union, and Britain, Canada and the U.S. to impose travel and financial sanctions on four Chinese officials blamed for abuses in Xinjiang. More than 1 million people in Xinjiang, most of them from predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, have been confined to work camps, according to foreign researchers and governments. Beijing denies mistreating them and says it is trying to promote economic development and stamp out radicalism. “The so-called existence of forced labor in the Xinjiang region is totally fictitious,” said Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-flays-foreign-brands-over-xinjiang-accusations/article34165464.ece
26 March 2021||Washington,||Will run for presidency in 2024 too, says Joe Biden||At his first press conference since assuming office on January 20, U.S. President Joe Biden said he expected to run again for the presidency in 2024. “The answer is yes. My plan is to run for re-election. That’s my expectation,” Mr. Biden said when asked why he had not already announced a second run. He said Mr. Trump needed to announce his re-election early on in his [Mr. Trump’s] term. “ My predecessor…oh god I miss him,” Mr. Biden said sarcastically. He also said he expects Vice-President Kamala Harris to be his running mate again.  Mr. Biden also remarked on and responded to questions regarding migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, the COVID-19 pandemic, the filibuster, voting rights laws, and troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and China. Mr. Biden said it was going to be difficult to get U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by May 1 — a deadline set by Mr. Trump following talks with the Taliban. He, however, added that he did not expect to have troops there next year. There are between 2,500 and 3,500 U.S. troops in the country, as per differing estimates. On China, Mr. Biden recounted a two-hour conversation he had as President with Xi Jinping and said he told him that he was not looking for confrontation but he knew there would be “steep, steep competition” and that he would insist that China play by the rules. Mr. Biden also talked about shoring up alliances, including with European allies, with whom he was scheduled to hold talks later in the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/will-run-for-presidency-in-2024-too-says-joe-biden/article34166101.ece
26 March 2021||Seoul,||N. Korea launches ‘ballistic missiles’||North Korea fired two suspected ballistic missiles into the sea on Thursday in its first substantive provocation to the new U.S. administration of Joe Biden. The nuclear-armed North has a long history of using weapons tests to ramp up tensions, in a carefully calibrated process to try to forward its objectives. Donald Trump’s first year in office was marked by a series of escalating launches, accompanied by a war of words between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Pyongyang had been biding its time since the new administration took office, not even officially acknowledging its existence until last week. But Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said the North fired two short-range missiles into the Sea of Japan, known as the East Sea in Korea, from South Hamgyong province. They travelled 450 km and reached a maximum altitude of 60 km, the JCS added, and after an emergency meeting South Korea’s National Security Council expressed “deep concern” at the launch. North Korea is banned from developing any ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions and is under multiple international sanctions over its weapons programmes. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was unequivocal, telling reporters that “North Korea launched two ballistic missiles”. It had been a year since the last such incident, he added, saying, “This threatens the peace and security of our country and the region. It is also a violation of the UN resolution.” Tokyo said they came down outside the waters of Japan’s exclusive economic zone. Pyongyang has made rapid progress in its capabilities under Mr. Kim, testing missiles capable of reaching the entire continental United States as tensions mounted in 2017. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim then embarked on an extraordinary diplomatic bromance, holding two headline-grabbing summits in Singapore and Vietnam. The U.S. pulled back on some joint military exercises with South Korea while the North froze intercontinental ballistic missile tests. However, the February 2019 Hanoi summit broke up over sanctions relief and what North Korea would be willing to give up in return.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/n-korea-launches-ballistic-missiles/article34165469.ece
26 March 2021||Minsk,||As crackdown widens, Belarus opposition to restart protests||Opposition activists in Belarus were preparing for fresh protests on Thursday to breathe life into a movement against President Alexander Lukashenko that fizzled out in the face of a severe crackdown. The authorities were moving military vehicles into the centre of the capital Minsk in preparation, according to videos circulating on social media and published by local media. Rallies erupted in the ex-Soviet country last August after President Lukashenko claimed a sixth term in a vote the opposition and Western diplomats said was rigged. But a sustained police crackdown saw weekly mass demonstrations in city centres peter out by the end of the year, with thousands of protesters detained and several killed. The opposition has since changed tactics, calling for supporters to gather in small groups in every district. The Nexta Telegram channel, which has mobilised and coordinated demonstrations, urged protesters to march through courtyards and organise flash mobs on Thursday. It called on drivers across the country to sound their horns at 6:30 p.m. (1530 GMT) and for a nationwide firework salute to end the day at 9:00 p.m. “We want to declare March 25 the day when the cities are ours!” Nexta wrote. The resumption of the protests coincides with Freedom Day in Belarus, which the Opposition marks each year on the anniversary of the country’s declaration of independence in 1918. Officials have said the planned protests are illegal and have moved to crack down on dissent this week, accusing a group representing Polish people in Belarus of stirring up racial hatred and the “rehabilitation of Nazism”. Police detained the head of the Union of Poles in Belarus, Anzhelika Boris, for 15 days on Wednesday and searched the group's offices, the homes of its activists and at least one Polish school.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/as-crackdown-widens-belarus-opposition-to-restart-protests/article34165459.ece
26 March 2021||Washington,||Biden chooses Harris to lead efforts to tackle migration||U.S. President Joe Biden has tapped Vice-President Kamala Harris to lead the White House effort to tackle the migration challenge at the U.S. southern border and work with Central American nations to address the root causes of the problem. Mr. Biden made the announcement as he and Ms. Harris met at the White House on Wednesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandra Mayorkas and other immigration advisers to discuss the increase in the number of migrants, including many unaccompanied minors, arriving at the border in recent weeks.  “When she speaks, she speaks for me,” Mr. Biden said, noting that her work as California’s Attorney-General makes her specially equipped to lead the administration’s response.   Ms. Harris is tasked with overseeing efforts to deal with issues spurring migration in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, as well as pressing them to strengthen enforcement on their own borders, officials said. She is also tasked with developing and implementing a long-term strategy that gets at the root causes of migration from those countries. Mr. Biden suggested former President Donald Trump’s decision to cut $450 million funding in 2019 to the region was partly to blame for the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-chooses-harris-to-lead-efforts-to-tackle-migration/article34165461.ece
26 March 2021||Washington,||Social media giants to testify on misinformation, speech||The CEOs of social media giants Facebook, Twitter and Google will face a new grilling by Congress on Thursday, focused on their efforts to prevent their platforms from spreading falsehoods and inciting violence. This has been a familiar theme for lawmakers over the past few years. But the pressure is even higher following the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, the rise in COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and united Democratic control of Congress and the White House. The latter could make legislative action more likely, although it remains far from a sure thing. Support from both sides There’s increasing support in Congress for imposing new curbs on legal protections regarding speech posted on their platforms. Both Republicans and Democrats — including President Joe Biden as a candidate — have called for stripping away some of the protections under the so-called Section 230 of a 25-year-old telecommunications law that shields Internet companies from liability for what users post. While Republicans have stepped up their complaints of alleged censorship and anti-conservative bias at the social media platforms, Democrats are largely focused on hate speech and incitement that can spawn real-world violence. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, whose company owns YouTube, will testify in a virtual hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The session’s title is: “Disinformation Nation: Social Media’s Role in Promoting Extremism and Misinformation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/social-media-giants-to-testify-on-misinformation-speech/article34165465.ece
26 March 2021||Manila,||Manila sends more ships to South China Sea||The Philippine military ordered the deployment of more navy ships to the South China Sea on Thursday amid a growing diplomatic row over a fleet of Chinese boats parked near a disputed reef. China claims almost the entirety of the resource-rich sea, and was accused by the United States this week of efforts to “intimidate and provoke others” by parking its vessels near the Whitsun Reef. ‘Incursion of territory’ Manila has ordered Beijing to recall 183 boats at the reef around 320 km west of Palawan Island, describing their presence as an incursion of its sovereign territory. Around 220 boats were detected by the Philippine coast guard on March 7, but this was made public last weekend. A military aerial patrol over the reef on Monday found 183 of them were still there. China says the fishing boats are sheltering from poor weather near the reef, which it claims is part of the contested Spratly Islands. A spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Philippines said the additional navy ships would carry out “sovereignty patrols” in the waterway. He did not say if the ships would go near the reef or what type of vessels would be used. The diplomatic row has escalated with several countries, including Canada, Australia and Japan, expressing concern over the renewed tensions in the region. Beijing often invokes the so-called nine-dash line to justify its apparent historic rights over most of the South China Sea, parts of which are also claimed by Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. China has ignored a 2016 international tribunal decision that declared its assertion as without basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/manila-sends-more-ships-to-south-china-sea/article34165471.ece
26 March 2021||Dhaka,||Police fire tear gas at anti-Modi protesters||Bangladesh police on Thursday fired rubber bullets and tear gas at hundreds of mainly student demonstrators, who were protesting against an upcoming visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Police said the protest got out of hand as demonstrators marched in the capital Dhaka, with many throwing rocks and stones at officers, injuring at least four. “We fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. There were 200 protesters. We have also arrested 33 persons for violence,” police official Syed Nurul Islam toldAFP. A spokesperson for the march said 2,000 mainly student protesters joined the demonstration. The protesters accused Mr. Modi of stoking religious tensions and inciting anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002. “Some 40 protesters were injured, including 18 hospitalised with injuries from police beatings and rubber bullets,” Bin Yamin Molla, a senior official of the Student Rights Council, which organised the protest, toldAFP. At a separate smaller protest elsewhere in Dhaka, hardline protesters slaughtered a cow on the street.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/police-fire-tear-gas-at-anti-modi-protesters/article34165457.ece
26 March 2021||Sao Paulo,||COVID-19 deaths in Brazil cross 3,00,000||Brazil was in a political disarray as it surpassed 3,00,000 COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday evening. Foes and allies alike are pleading with President Jair Bolsonaro to change course to stem a recent surge of daily deaths accounting for almost one-third of the total worldwide. Shifting rhetoric Mr. Bolsonaro this month began shifting rhetoric on the value of vaccines but continues to refuse restrictions on activity he paints as infringement on personal freedom and still promotes unproven COVID-19 cures. “Should I change my narrative? Should I become more malleable? Should I give in? Do what the vast majority is doing?” Mr. Bolsonaro said on Monday during a ceremony at the presidential palace.  “There is a lot of solidarity, but everything has its limit. Everything,” the House’s speaker, Bolsonaro ally Arthur Lira, said in Congress. Another prominent senator from a centrist party anticipates the chamber opening an investigation next month. That could further damage Mr. Bolsonaro’s popularity ahead of his 2022 re-election bid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/covid-19-deaths-in-brazil-cross-300000/article34165462.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Here is why the electoral bonds scheme must go||The Supreme Court, after a brief hearing on March 24, reserved orders on the question of whether or not to stay the electoral bond scheme, ahead of the upcoming State elections. For the last three years, electoral bonds have been the dominant method of political party funding in India. In their design and operation, they allow for limitless and anonymous corporate donations to political parties. For this reason, they are deeply destructive of democracy, and violate core principles of the Indian Constitution. A blow against democracy If democracy means anything, it must mean this: when citizens cast their votes for the people who will represent them in Parliament, they have the right to do so on the basis of full and complete information. And there is no piece of information more important than the knowledge of who funds political parties. Across democratic societies, and through time, it has been proven beyond doubt that money is the most effective way of buying policy, of engaging in regulatory capture, and of skewing the playing field in one’s own favour. This is enabled to a far greater degree when citizens are in the dark about the source of money: it is then impossible to ever know — or assess — whether a government policy is nothing more than a quid pro quo to benefit its funders. The Indian Supreme Court has long held — and rightly so — that the “right to know”, especially in the context of elections, is an integral part of the right to freedom of expression under the Indian Constitution. By keeping this knowledge from citizens and voters, the electoral bonds scheme violates fundamental tenets of our democracy. It is equally important that if a democracy is to thrive, the role of money in influencing politics ought to be limited. In many advanced countries, for example, elections are funded publicly, and principles of parity ensure that there is not too great a resource gap between the ruling party and the opposition. The purpose of this is to guarantee a somewhat level playing field, so that elections are a battle of ideas, and not vastly unequal contests where one side’s superior resources enable it to overwhelm the other. For this reason, in most countries where elections are not publicly funded, there are caps or limits on financial contributions to political parties. The electoral bonds scheme, however, removes all pre-existing limits on political donations, and effectively allows well-resourced corporations to buy politicians by paying immense sums of money. This defeats the entire purpose of democracy, which as B.R. Ambedkar memorably pointed out, was not just to guarantee one person, one vote, but one vote one value. However, not only do electoral bonds violate basic democratic principles by allowing limitless and anonymous donations to political parties, they do so asymmetrically. Since the donations are routed through the State Bank of India, it is possible for the government to find out who is donating to which party, but not for the political opposition to know. This, in turn, means that every donor is aware that the central government can trace their donations back to them. Given India’s long-standing misuse of investigative agencies by whichever government occupies power at the Centre, this becomes a very effective way to squeeze donations to rival political parties, while filling the coffers of the incumbent ruling party. Statistics bear this out: while we do not know who has donated to whom, we do know that a vast majority of the immensely vast sums donated through multiple electoral cycles over the last three years, have gone to the ruling party, i.e. the Bharatiya Janata Party. Gaps in government’s defence The government has attempted to justify the electoral bonds scheme by arguing that its purpose is to prevent the flow of black money into elections. The journalist Nitin Sethi has already debunked this rationale in a detailed 10-part investigative report, which has also highlighted reservations within the government as well as by the Election Commission of India to the electoral bonds scheme. That apart, this justification falls apart under the most basic scrutiny: it is entirely unclear what preventing black money has to do with donor anonymity, making donations limitless, and leaving citizens in the dark. Indeed, as the electoral bonds scheme allows even foreign donations to political parties (which can often be made through shell companies) the prospects of institutional corruption (including by foreign sources) increases with the electoral bonds scheme, instead of decreasing. It is important to be clear that the objections to the electoral bonds scheme, highlighted above, are not objections rooted in political morality, or in public policy. They are constitutional objections. The right to know has long been enshrined as a part of the right to freedom of expression; furthermore, uncapping political donations and introducing a structural bias into the form of the donations violate both the guarantee of equality before law, as well as being manifestly arbitrary. The judiciary needs to act This brings us to the all-important role of the courts. One of the most critical functions of an independent judiciary in a functioning democracy is to referee the fundamentals of the democratic process. Governments derive their legitimacy from elections, and it is elections that grant governments the mandate to pursue their policy goals, without undue interference from courts. However, for just that reason, it is of vital importance that the process that leads up to the formation of the government be policed with particular vigilance, as any taint at that stage will taint all that follows. In other words, the electoral legitimacy of the government is questionable if the electoral process has become questionable. And since the government itself cannot — in good faith — regulate the process that it itself is subject to every five years, the courts remain the only independent body that can adequately umpire and enforce the ground rules of democracy. It is for this reason that courts must be particularly sensitive to and cognisant of laws and rules that seek to skew the democratic process and the level playing field, and that seek to entrench one-party rule over multi-party democracy. There is little doubt that in intent and in effect, the electoral bonds scheme is guilty of both. Thus, it deserves to be struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. In this regard, the conduct of the Supreme Court so far has been disappointing. The petition challenging the constitutional validity of the electoral bonds scheme was filed in 2018. The case, which is absolutely vital to the future health of Indian democracy, has been left unheard for three years. The Supreme Court’s inaction in this case is not neutral: it directly benefits the ruling party which as we have seen, has received a vast bulk of electoral bond funding through the multiple State and one general election since 2018, and creates a continuing distortion of democracy. It is a matter of some optimism that a start was finally made when the Court heard the application for stay before this round of elections. One can only hope that the Court will stay the scheme so that it does not further distort the coming round of elections, and then proceed to hear and decide the full case, in short order.

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Remove the wedges in India-Bangladesh ties||The friendship between India and Bangladesh is historic, evolving over the last 50 years. India’s political, diplomatic, military and humanitarian support during Bangladesh’s Liberation War played an important role towards Bangladesh’s independence. Nearly 3,900 Indian soldiers gave up their lives and an estimated 10 million Bangladeshi refugees took shelter in India. Now it is about cooperation Post-Independence, the India-Bangladesh relationship has oscillated as Bangladesh passed through different regimes. The relationship remained cordial until the assassination of Bangladesh’s founding President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in August 15, 1975, followed by a period of military rule and the rise of General Ziaur Rahman who became President and also assassinated in 1981. It thawed again between 1982-1991 when a military-led government by General H.M. Ershad ruled the country. Since Bangladesh’s return to parliamentary democracy in 1991, relations have gone through highs and lows. However, in the last decade, India-Bangladesh relations have warmed up, entering a new era of cooperation, and moving beyond historical and cultural ties to become more assimilated in the areas of trade, connectivity, energy, and defence. Bangladesh and India have achieved the rare feat of solving their border issues peacefully by ratifying the historic Land Boundary Agreement in 2015, where enclaves were swapped allowing inhabitants to choose their country of residence and become citizens of either India or Bangladesh. The Bangladesh government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has uprooted anti-India insurgency elements from its borders, making the India-Bangladesh border one of the region’s most peaceful, and allowing India to make a massive redeployment of resources to its more contentious borders elsewhere. Bangladesh today is India’s biggest trading partner in South Asia with exports to Bangladesh in FY 2018-19 at $9.21 billion and imports at $1.04 billion. India has offered duty free access to multiple Bangladeshi products. Trade could be more balanced if non-tariff barriers from the Indian side could be removed. On the development front, cooperation has deepened, with India extending three lines of credit to Bangladesh in recent years amounting to $8 billion for the construction of roads, railways, bridges, and ports. However, in eight years until 2019, only 51% of the first $800 million line of credit has been utilised whilst barely any amount from the next two lines of credit worth $6.5 billion has been mobilised. This has been mostly due to red-tapism from India’s end, and slow project implementation on Bangladesh’s end. Bangladeshis make up a large portion of tourists in India, outnumbering all tourists arriving from western Europe in 2017, with one in every five tourists being a Bangladeshi. Bangladesh accounts for more than 35% of India’s international medical patients and contributes more than 50% of India’s revenue from medical tourism. The connectivity boost Connectivity between the two countries has greatly improved. A direct bus service between Kolkata and Agartala runs a route distance of 500 km, as compared to the 1,650 km if it ran through the Chicken’s Neck to remain within India. There are three passenger and freight railway services running between the two countries, with two more routes on their way to be restored. Recently, a 1.9 kilometre long bridge, the Maitri Setu, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, connecting Sabroom in India with Ramgarh in Bangladesh. Bangladesh allows the shipment of goods from its Mongla and Chattogram (Chittagong) seaports carried by road, rail, and water ways to Agartala (Tripura) via Akhura; Dawki (Meghalaya) via Tamabil; Sutarkandi (Assam) via Sheola, and Srimantpur (Tripura) via Bibirbazar. This allows landlocked Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura to access open water routes through the Chattogram and Mongla ports (https://bit.ly/3vXySpB). Bones of contention Despite the remarkable progress, the unresolved Teesta water sharing issue looms large. Border killings are yet to stop. The year 2020 saw the highest number of border shootings by the Border Security Force. The shots are fired at civilians, usually cattle traders, who are usually unarmed, trying to illegally cross the border. India not only has failed to stop the border killings but at times has even justified them. The statement by India’s External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar, during his recent visit to Dhaka, that “our shared objective should be a no crime-no death border...”, raises questions as to why killings, and not due legal proceedings, are being followed in tackling border crimes. The Modi government’s proposal to implement the National Register of Citizens across the whole of India reflects poorly on India-Bangladesh relations. It is not comprehensible why people of all religions and ethnicities barring Muslims will be excluded from the Bill. It remains to be seen how India addresses the deportation of illegal Muslim immigrants, some of whom claim to have come from Bangladesh. Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives, once considered traditional Indian allies, are increasingly tilting towards China due to the Asian giant’s massive trade, infrastructural and defence investments in these countries. In spite of its ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’, India has been losing its influence in the region to China. Bhutan also does not abide by Indian influence as evinced by its withdrawal from the BBIN (Bhutan-Bangladesh-India-Nepal) motor vehicles agreement. China, in lieu of its cheque-book diplomacy, is well-entrenched in South Asia, including Bangladesh, with which it enjoys significant economic and defence relations. Keeping the momentum going India-Bangladesh relations have been gaining positive momentum over the last decade. As Bangladesh celebrates its 50 years of independence (March 26, 1971), India continues to be one of its most important neighbours and strategic partners. As the larger country, the onus is on India to be generous enough to let the water flow and ensure that people are not killed on the border for cattle even if it is illegal when there are appropriate means for justice. These small but important steps can remove long-standing snags in a relationship which otherwise is gradually coming of age in 50 years. To make the recent gains irreversible, both countries need to continue working on the three Cs — cooperation, collaboration, and consolidation.

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Faster, sooner||Just three weeks after it rolled out the second phase of the mass vaccination programme for people above 60 years and those above 45 years with comorbidities, India has now undertaken course correction — to vaccinate anyone above 45 years immaterial of comorbidity status from April 1. By following the U.K. model of vaccination based on age bands rather than on comorbidities, millions would become eligible to receive the vaccine and be fully protected. Indeed, people with comorbidities are at greater risk of becoming critically ill and even dying. However, the list of comorbidities that made a person eligible for a vaccine was not only highly restrictive but also focused on multiple comorbidities, and that too of severe nature. Also, the need for a medical certificate meant that vaccinating as many people as quickly as possible was unachievable. Since a vast majority, particularly the poor and those in rural areas, are ignorant of their underlying disease, the decision, though belated, to make comorbidities redundant for a vaccine is commendable. As vaccines are a tool to promote health equity, all attempts should be made to remove any artificial barriers, more so when several States are witnessing a surge in cases. While hesitancy towards the two available vaccines was partly responsible for the low uptake initially, there is now increasing willingness to get vaccinated. While 0.8 million doses administered on February 25 was the highest before the second phase began, the numbers have been rising steadily thereafter; increasing the gap between two Covishield doses partly addresses vaccine shortage. Yet, the seven-day rolling average crossed two million doses per day only in the last couple of days; only about 50.23 million doses have been administered as on March 24, or less than four doses per 100 people. The vaccination programme has also been witnessing lukewarm participation by private medical facilities. The reasons for this, besides the slow pace of expansion in some States, need to be fixed. Though the COVID-19 vaccination, which targets adults, is vastly different from the universal immunisation programme, India has the wherewithal to accelerate the daily vaccination rate. What is missing is the political will to achieve that, reflected in absent targets and awareness building exercises, including vaccine safety, vaccine sites and permissibility of walk-ins. Also, unlike the immunisation programme, overreliance on the CoWIN platform has made vaccination into a largely passive, facility-based exercise rather than a public-health initiative. Lack of microplanning and outreach activities are further impacting uptake. Clearly, there is a case for reaching out to people to quickly increase vaccine uptake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/faster-sooner/article34165428.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||An unequal providence||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has steered through Parliament the Finance Bill of 2021, which includes 127 amendments. Among the major changes is a tweak in the proposal to tax income on PF contributions over Rs. 2.5 lakh a year. Responding to MPs’ concerns on the tax, she said that nearly 93% PF account holders will be covered by the Rs. 2.5 lakh per year limit, while a mere 1% were abusing the system. Yet, she introduced an amendment doubling the threshold for annual PF contributions to Rs. 5 lakh, only for employees whose employers do not remit any contribution to their retirement fund account. For the crores of Employees’ PF account holders in the private sector, this Rs. 5 lakh threshold is a non-starter as an employer-employee relationship is an implicit requirement to open an EPF account. While employees may voluntarily enhance contributions beyond the statutory wage limit of Rs. 15,000 a month and employers are not bound to match enhanced contributions, a ‘zero employer contribution’ scenario is not possible for EPF members. This suggests that only some senior government staff who joined service before 2004 and are not part of the NPS will benefit from this concession, as they contribute to the GPF account and get a defined benefit pension separately. In a country with a large informal workforce and sparse social security systems, reasonable savings for retirement should not be penalised. But to give tax relief for such savings only to government employees smacks of bureaucratic preservation of self-interests deriding an equitable approach to taxation. The least the government could have done was to offer the same cap of Rs. 5 lakh to EPF members, by including their employer contributions during the year. As things stand now, annual investments into the PPF that anyone can open, are capped at Rs. 1.5 lakh. Similarly, employee PF contributions beyond Rs. 1.5 lakh are not tax-deductible under Section 80C of the I-T Act, but income on such contributions beyond Rs. 2.5 lakh will be taxable and employer contributions into the EPF, NPS or any superannuation pension fund are capped at Rs. 7.5 lakh. And the income on GPF contributions up to Rs. 5 lakh would be tax-free. This dissonance suggests an unconscionable disconnect between policy makers and the aspirations of the working class to save for their sunset years. To top this off, the new Wages Code will compel employers to pay higher EPF contributions by linking them to at least half of their total pay on a cost to company basis, rather than 24% of basic pay presently. This will virtually force many EPF members into contributing over Rs. 2.5 lakh a year. This either reflects a lack of system-wide thinking, with two arms of the government working at cross purposes, or an ingenious ploy to stir up tax collections. With doubts on the implementation of this new tax yet to be addressed, the government must consider putting it on hold and think through its implications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/an-unequal-providence/article34165429.ece
26 March 2021||MUMBAI,||Das sees no reason to cut FY22 forecast||Despite the fresh threat from rising COVID-19 cases, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) chief maintained the central bank’s forecast for GDP growth in FY22 at 10.5%. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said though the renewed surge in COVID-19 cases in many parts of India was a concern, this time around growth would continue ‘unabated’. He said the Reserve Bank remained ‘fully committed’ to use all policy tools to secure a robust recovery of the economy from the debilitating effects of the pandemic. “We have to keep in mind that this time around, compared to where we were last year, let us say in March or April, we have some additional insurance against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said in his inaugural virtual address at ‘The Times Network India Economic Conclave 2021’. “The first is that the two vaccines which are being rolled out,” he said, adding that the speed of the roll-out had been ‘very fast’ and about 5 crore people had already been vaccinated. “The second aspect is that overall, by and large people are now used to the COVID-19 protocols. So one would expect that people who have lowered their guard would step up their guard against the spread of COVID-19 [virus],” he said. “And third, at this point... one does not foresee a kind of lockdown that we had experienced last year. Because last year, it came as a huge shock. This time we all know what the pandemic is all about, notwithstanding some new strains which have developed,” he added. ‘Preliminary analysis’ Mr. Das asserted, “revival of economic activity which has happened should continue unabated going forward and I don’t foresee [a downward revision], although I should not be saying this before the details are presented by our research teams. But my understanding and our preliminary analysis show that the growth rate of 10.5% for next year, which we had given, would not require a downward revision.” To a question on keeping rising bond yields in check, Mr. Das said, “The relationship between the central bank and bond markets need not be combative, it has to be cooperative. We have been emphasising time and again that there should be an orderly evolution of the yield curve and not sudden spikes or any knee-jerk reaction to certain incoming numbers.” Stating that the government’s borrowings for the next year would remain in the same range as it had been this year, Mr. Das said that the RBI would manage the borrowings and that there should not be any ‘disorder in the yield curve’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/das-sees-no-reason-to-cut-fy22-forecast/article34165405.ece
26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Must ensure all voices are heard’||Regulations are beneficial when they safeguard citizens’ fundamental rights and reinforce online freedom; however, regulating online content requires striking a careful balance between protecting from harm while preserving human rights, including freedom of expression, privacy and procedural fairness for everyone, said Kathleen Reen, senior director, Public Policy and Philanthropy, APAC, Twitter. In an email-interview, Ms. Reen said that Twitter’s purpose was to serve public conversation. “We believe that public conversation is at its best when as many people as possible can participate,” she said. “Participation is a function of a free and open Internet; an Internet that is global, not walled off, not censoring critical or vulnerable voices, and one that is safe and promotes diversity, competition and innovation,” she added. Twitter recognised that free speech and safety were deeply interconnected and could sometimes be at odds, she added. “We must ensure that all voices can be heard, and we continue to make improvements to our service so that everyone feels safer participating in the public conversation,” Ms. Reen said. Replying to a query on the new guidelines for intermediaries by India, Ms. Reen said that Twitter supported a forward-looking approach to regulation that protected the open Internet, drove universal access, and promoted competition and innovation. The U.S.-headquartered firm is currently studying the updated guidelines and is engaging with a range of organisations and entities impacted by them. “We look forward to continued engagement with the Government of India and hope to strike a fair and dynamic balance between transparency, freedom of expression, and privacy for everyone using Twitter,” she said. With Assembly elections coming up in five States, the company, which sees itself as an essential service where people come for credible information, has also set up a global cross-functional team. “A global cross-functional team with local, cultural and language expertise is in place and has been tasked with keeping the service safe from attempts to incite violence, abuse, and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm,” Ms. Reen said. She added that Twitter had prioritised its approach to tackle misinformation based on the highest potential for harm in the context of these elections, which is why it focussed on “synthetic and manipulated media and civic integrity.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/at-twitter-no-one-is-above-rules/article34165411.ece

He would take over from Mr. Srinivasan in 2023. “We have inducted Mr. Speth to keep the firm future ready,” said Mr. Srinivasan. “We need a person who can be the chief mentor of the company. He is one of the most respected leaders in the automotive industry globally. He understands quality, patent, design and technology. He has built a company from a small size to a global level.” Asked if he was stepping aside as he was almost 70, Mr. Srinivasan said: “There is no such reason. I am not stepping aside.

26 March 2021||PARIS,||Turkey shock for the Netherlands||The Netherlands slumped to a dramatic 4-2 defeat against Turkey in its opening 2022 World Cup qualifier on Wednesday, while reigning champion France was held by Ukraine despite a brilliant Antoine Griezmann goal and Belgium came from behind to beat Wales. European champion Portugal battled to a 1-0 victory over Azerbaijan, but 2018 World Cup runner-up Croatia lost 1-0 in Slovenia. Yilmaz’s hat-trick At Istanbul, Turkey led 3-0 shortly after half-time through two Burak Yilmaz goals and a Hakan Calhanoglu strike, but substitutes Davy Klaassen and Luuk de Jong gave Frank de Boer’s Dutchmen hope. Yilmaz’s wonderful free-kick sealed him a hat-trick and Turkey a crucial win, though, in a match between the two favourites to qualify from Group G. The defeat was a dreadful start to the campaign for the Netherlands, which failed to qualify for either Euro 2016 or the 2018 World Cup, but is one of the fancied sides ahead of the delayed Euro 2020 finals this year. France kicked off its title defence with a 1-1 draw against Ukraine. Griezmann curled a fine finish from outside the box into the top corner in the 19th minute to draw level with David Trezeguet in fourth place on France’s all-time goal-scoring list, with 34. But Presnel Kimpembe put through his own net before the hour mark to draw Ukraine level. Belgium, the world’s No. 1 side, fell behind early against Wales but fought back to outclass its opponent 3-1. Harry Wilson scored an excellent 10th-minute opener for Wales in Leuven, but Kevin De Bruyne and Thorgan Hazard netted in the space of six minutes to put the hosts ahead before the half-hour mark. Belgium’s record goal-scorer Romelu Lukaku wrapped up the points with a penalty 17 minutes from time, gaining the Red Devils a measure of revenge for their Euro 2016 quarterfinal loss to Wales. Roberto Martinez’s men sit second in the early Group E table behind Czech Republic, which thrashed Estonia 6-2 on neutral ground in Poland, with West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek scoring a hat-trick. A struggle Portugal, which defends the title at Euro 2020 later this year, struggled in its Group A opener against Azerbaijan in Turin. But Maksim Medvedev’s own goal nine minutes before half-time was enough, despite Cristiano Ronaldo, on 102 international goals, failing to close the gap to Iranian Ali Daei’s all-time record of 109. Portugal’s group rival Serbia battled back to beat the Republic of Ireland 3-2 as Aleksandar Mitrovic came off the bench to grab a second-half double. Elsewhere, Russia stuttered to a 3-1 win in Malta while Croatia was beaten by Sandi Lovric’s early goal for Slovenia.  The results:   Portugal 1 (Medvedev 36-og) bt Azerbaijan 0.   Serbia 3 (Vlahovic 40, Mitrovic 69, 75) bt Republic of Ireland 2 (Browne 18, Collins 86).   Finland 2 (Pukki 58, 77) drew with Bosnia and Herzegovina 2 (Pjanic 55, Stevanovic 85).   France 1 (Griezmann 19) drew with Ukraine 1 (Kimpembe 57-og).   Belgium 3 (de Bruyne 22, T. Hazard 28, Lukaku 73-pen) bt Wales 1 (Wilson 10).   Estonia 2 (Sappinen 12, Anier 86) lost to Czech Republic 6 (Schick 18, Barak 27, Soucek 32, 43, 48, Jankto 56).   Turkey 4 (Yilmaz 15, 34-pen, 81, Calhanoglu 46) bt The Netherlands 2 (Klaassen 75, L. de Jong 76).   Latvia 1 (Ikaunieks 40) lost to Montenegro 2 (Jovetic 41, 83); Gibraltar 0 lost to Norway 3 (Sorloth 43, Thorsvedt 45, Svensson 57).   Malta 1 (Mbong 56) lost to Russia 3 (Dzyuba 23, Fernandes 35, Sobolev 90).   Cyprus 0 drew with Slovakia 0.

26 March 2021||PUNE,||India looks to deliver the knockout punch||Over the last two months, twice in as many formats has India come back with a bang to win the series, first in the Tests and then the T20Is. Things will be slightly different on Friday, however. While India will be relishing the opportunity to seal the ODI series with a second successive win, England, the reigning world champion in the 50-over format, will be desperate to stay alive. In its quest to do an India on India by winning the last two games, England suffered a major setback ahead of the second ODI at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium. Captain Eoin Morgan has been ruled out of the remaining two ODIs while Sam Billings will be unavailable for selection on Friday. While Morgan batted despite splitting his webbing trying to stop a ball in the series-opener, Billings suffered a shoulder injury when fielding on Tuesday. Livingstone to play The England team management, while releasing an update on the second ODI, confirmed on Thursday evening that Liam Livingstone will make his ODI debut. With no other specialist batsman as a back-up, it will be interesting to see the combination that England is forced to go in with. India, on the other hand, has plenty of options to replace the injured Shreyas Iyer. A team spokesperson confirmed on Thursday that the No. 4 batsman had been “ruled out of the remainder of the series” after suffering a serious shoulder injury on Tuesday.  India can either draft in Rishabh Pant or hand Suryakumar Yadav an ODI debut. Both have been in superlative form and will be hoping to get some game-time. Despite criticism of Kuldeep Yadav’s ordinary outing in the series-opener, it would be prudent for the team management to back the left-arm wrist-spinner. Kuldeep has spent most of the last four months on the bench and deserves to be given a longer rope if the management believes he can play a vital role in the T20 World Cup later this year. For two years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Kuldeep and Yuzvendra Chahal had emerged as a lethal spin combination in limited-over cricket. But with Kuldeep losing zing — a combination of a reduction in confidence and the slowing of his pace, something that works against a spinner in modern-day cricket — he has moved south in the preferred spinners’ list. If Kuldeep is persisted with on Friday, it may be a make-or-break opportunity for him, with Chahal waiting in the wings to wear India’s blues one last time before joining the IPL bandwagon. Ahead of the series, questions were raised about its context. But with India within touching distance of stunning the World champion and snatching its No. 1 ODI ranking, there will be no dearth of context for Friday’s game.  The teams (from):   India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rishabh Pant, K.L. Rahul, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Krunal Pandya, Washington Sundar, T. Natarajan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, and Shardul Thakur.   England: Jos Buttler (Capt.), Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Tom Curran, Liam Livingstone, Matt Parkinson, Adil Rashid, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, Reece Topley, and Mark Wood.   Match starts at 1.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-looks-to-deliver-the-knockout-punch/article34165544.ece

CSK's pre-season camp started on March 8 at the M.A Chidambaram Stadium with skipper M.S. Dhoni leading the way. “The players felt the fortnight-long camp was very beneficial.

26 March 2021||KOLKATA,||BFI to look into boxers’ allegations||The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) said on Thursday that it would look into the allegations of misbehavior leveled by Ankush Dahiya and Ashish Insha against head coach C.A. Kuttappa. Both boxers have written to Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, Sports Authority of India and BFI about the issue and have highlighted their grievance on social media. It is learnt that they had taken leave from the National camp at Patiala for personal reasons and were allegedly misbehaved by Kuttappa on their return to the camp. Ankush even alleged that Kuttappa “kicked his injured back”. Non-compliance According to a source, the issue cropped up due to the boxers’ non-compliance of quarantine rules. “We will look into the matter and find out what’s the truth,” said a BFI official. Kuttappa could not be contacted for his reaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bfi-to-look-into-boxers-allegations/article34165784.ece

26 March 2021||Karachi,||Pakistan ready to embark on twin tour of SA, Zimbabwe||All the 22 members of the Pakistan squad and 13 officials tested negative for COVID-19 on Thursday and they will leave the country for the twin tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe on Friday. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had carried out COVID-19 tests four times on all the players and officials ahead of the tour. One player, Hasan Ali, had tested positive initially, but he too later cleared three tests.  In order to avoid any COVID-19 related mishaps, the PCB has decided to fly the entire squad by a chartered flight to Johannesburg for the South Africa leg. The squad will also fly to Bulawayo from Johannesburg by a chartered flight for the Zimbabwe leg and return home the same way. Pakistan will play three ICC men’s World Cup Super League matches from April 2 to 7 and four T20Is from April 10 to 16. After the South Africa leg, Pakistan will play three T20Is and two Tests in Zimbabwe, before returning home on May 12. The itinerary of the Zimbabwe leg is, however, yet to be announced. Big challenge Pakistan head coach Misbah-ul-Haq said going to South Africa would be challenging given the way some series were affected and postponed because of COVID-19 issues in the African nation. “But at same time as the biggest stakeholders, it is responsibility of players to carry on and fulfil a moral duty to the game,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pakistan-ready-to-embark-on-twin-tour-of-sa-zimbabwe/article34165790.ece
26 March 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Late’ events at athletes’ insistence: Deepa||Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) president Deepa Malik has said it was the athletes who had forced organisers to conduct some events of the National Para Athletics Championship at night, under the light of of mobile phone torches, at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Wednesday. On the sidelines of the championship — a crucial Paralympics qualification event — a defiant Deepa said the light from the mobile phone torches had been “sufficient”. “Many athletes compete in both track and field events, which makes scheduling a challenge. Last night, we gave the athletes the option of redoing their events, but the athletes forced us to hold the events at night. “Those who were not comfortable with the light last night were given the option of doing their events today afternoon. “ Also, the athletes in last night's events were not in the visually-impaired category. They were actually in the least disabled category. They are adults who made a choice to compete. I don't think the light was insufficient," Deepa said on Thursday. Deepa stated that since many tournament officials did not show up, there were delays that forced organisers to hold some events at night. "We were not prepared for such delays," she said. Deepa also dismissed concerns raised by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) regarding COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures like physical distancing not being followed at the championship. “There are hardly 50 people here, and it is an open area. In an open area, even political rallies are allowed. The rules are different for open venues," Deepa said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/late-events-at-athletes-insistence-deepa/article34165792.ece

26 March 2021||Iwaki,||Olympic torch relay finally sets off||The Tokyo Olympics torch relay got underway on Thursday after a year's coronavirus delay, with officials hoping it will be a "ray of light" after the problems caused by the pandemic. Spectators were barred from the departure ceremony and first leg over ongoing fears about the coronavirus. But they will line the rest of the route during the 121-day relay, which will criss-cross Japan and involve 10,000 runners before the torch lights the Olympic cauldron on July 23. Organisers are hoping the relay will dispel doubts about holding the Games during a pandemic, and Tokyo 2020 chief Seiko Hashimoto called the flame "a ray of light at the end of the darkness". "This little flame never lost hope and it waited for this day like a cherry blossom bud just about to bloom," she told the ceremony at Fukushima's J-Village sports complex, which was a base for responding to the 2011 nuclear disaster. Azusa Iwashimizu, one of Japan's 2011 World Cup-winning women's footballers, was the first to carry the rose-gold, cherry blossom-shaped torch, accompanied by former teammates. She passed the flame to Fukushima high school student Asato Owada, who like all the runners wore an official white tracksuit with a red diagonal stripe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/olympic-torch-relay-finally-sets-off/article34165542.ece
26 March 2021||PUNE,||Nothing beats game-time: Rahul||When K.L. Rahul was included as wicketkeeper-batsman ahead of Rishabh Pant in India’s team for the opening ODI against England, a lot of eyebrows were raised. But the connoisseurs weren’t surprised. After all, since the start of 2020, Rahul has been extremely successful as the preferred gloveman-cum-finisher in the longer of the coloured-clothing formats. Despite a horrendous run with the bat in the T20I series, Rahul justified his inclusion with an unbeaten 62 off 43 in a blitzkrieg association with Krunal Pandya that took the game away from England. Ever since being sidelined with a wrist injury midway through the tour of Australia, Rahul has been deprived of game-time — something he had no qualms admitting he struggled to deal with. “Being in the middle, playing games is what gives me the best touch, so having not got as much game-time as I would have liked — I won’t say did play on mind — but I knew that somehow or the other I’ll have to find a way to get myself best prepared with whatever opportunities [I had] at training,” Rahul said on Thursday, ahead of the second ODI. “In terms of that, I tried to prepare in the best way possible. Having said that, nothing beats game-time.” Rahul was also delighted for his younger Karnataka mate Prasidh Krishna, who took a four-wicket haul on debut. “I am not surprised with what he did. I was always very confident that the next player to come out of Karnataka was going to be Prasidh,” Rahul said. Shreyas to miss IPL Shreyas Iyer will miss the upcoming edition of the IPL as he is is set to be undergo surgery on his injured left shoulder just before the tournament begins next month.  The Hindu understands that Shreyas, in consultation with the BCCI medical team, has decided to go under the knife on April 8. The batsman suffered a labrum tear while fielding during India's first ODI against England on Tuesday.  Personally, I prefer Virat doesn't get runs, because that's not good for us... every team and every player has a certain way of operating in the field, which makes them successful Stokeson whether he prefers ‘nice’ or ‘fiery’ Kohli||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nothing-beats-game-time-rahul/article34165548.ece
26 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Dipika to be fully fit by May-end||Multiple Commonwealth and Asian Games medallist Dipika Pallikal-Karthik has indicated to the Squash Rackets Federation of India (SRFI) that she would be back to full fitness by the end of May. She would be available to take part in camps in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games, she has said. The former World No. 10, however, expressed inability to participate in the first CWG camp at the Indian Squash Academy here from April 1 to 5. Dipika started training in December last year. She left for Egypt in January so that she could be ready by April. But she injured her right knee and had to return to Chennai. Currently she is undergoing rehabilitation, strength and conditioning with her trainer. Her 12-week rehab is expected to conclude on May 23. SRFI secretary Cyrus Poncha said Dipika would be invited for the camp. “It’s been more than two years since she participated in a tournament. We’ll have to see how she plays at the camp,” he told The Hindu on Thursday. SRFI, Poncha insisted, would select the best team for the CWG. Selection would be based on performance at the camps, National championships and PSA tournaments and the criteria laid down by SRFI, he said. All the top men — Saurav Ghosal, Mahesh Mangaonkar, Ramit Tandon, Vikram Malhotra, Aditya Jagtap, Abhay Singh, Abhishek Pradhan, S. Velavan, Yash Fadte, Veer Chotrani and Aadit Zaveri — will attend the camp. Among the women, participants include Joshna Chinappa, Sunayna Kuruvilla, Tanvi Khanna, Sachika Balvani, Urvashi Joshi and Aparajitha Balamurkan. Meanwhile, the first HCL-SRFI Indian Tour to be hosted since the pandemic, from March 27 to 31, will be held under strict COVID-19 protocols.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dipika-to-be-fully-fit-by-may-end/article34165420.ece
26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indian women win 25m sports pistol||There was cheer in the Indian camp as Rahi Sarnobat, Chinki Yadav and Manu Bhaker combined strongly to win the 25 metre sports pistol team gold with a resounding 17-7 victory over Poland in the shooting World Cup at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Thursday. Even though it was a collective triumph, Asian Games gold medallist Rahi, who was pushed to the silver in the individual event by Chinki, was a class act. In 12 series, Rahi has a perfect 5 six times, a 4 five times and once a three. Out of 60 rapid fire shots, she missed the bull’s-eye only on seven occasions. Rahi’s incredible performance lifted the team. Chinki managed to find a semblance of her form, and though Manu struggled a bit in patches, the team came good. In women’s 50-metre rifle 3-position event, Anjum Moudgil, Shreya Saksena and Gaayathri Nithyanandam, shooting in the kneeling, prone and standing positions respectively, were beaten 47-43 by Poland in the gold match. Aneta Stankiewicz, Aleksandra Szutko and Natalia Kochanska had shown their class by topping qualification in the first and second stages. Controversy There was a lot of drama in the men’s rifle 3-position team gold match and it did not take place. India was scheduled to meet Hungary but an internal issue in the Hungary team, especially between Istvan Peni and Peter Sidi, saw the latter concede the match. However, instead of declaring India the winner, the organisers elevated the third team, USA, to have a go at the gold on the morrow, against the host. India tops the medals table with 10 gold, six silver and five bronze ahead of USA (3, 2, 1). Denmark (2), Poland, Kazakhstan, Iran, Britain and Slovenia are the gold winners so far.  The results: Women: 25m sports pistol: 1. India (Rahi Sarnobat, Chinki Yadav, Manu Bhaker) 17 (419) 844; 2. Poland (Joanna Iwona Wawrzonowska, Julita Borek, Agnieszka Korejwo) 7 (399) 848.   50m rifle 3-position: 1. Poland (Aneta Stankiewicz, Aleksandra Szutko, Natalia Kochanska) 47 (872) 1315; 2.

26 March 2021||Mumbai,||Three top contenders in the Indian Derby mix||The 2021 Indian Derby will be the 79th running of the prestigious event on the Indian racing calendar and for the sixth consecutive year Kingfisher Ultra will be associated with the RWITC. However, this year it will be a closed-door affair, with only a limited number of people allowed at the Mahalaxmi race course. Seventeen races have been framed for the Derby weekend (March 27 and 28) with the total prize money for Indian Derby being Rs. 1.52 crore and the winner’s purse worth Rs. 91.5 lakh. According to the present form and record among the 13 contestants vying for premier honours, the three contenders to watch out are Lagarde, Immortality, and Forest Flame. Will Attaolahi succeed? Bengaluru-based trainer Suleiman Attaollahi, who has not tasted the success of winning this blue riband event, has two prime contenders in Lagarde and Forest Flame. Top colt Lagarde stands tall with five wins out of six races in his career, including the Bangalore Derby & 2000 Guineas, Indian 2000 Guineas, and the Ruia Cup over 2000m here. Attaollahi’s queen filly Forest Flame, who has won 5 out of her 7 starts, was beaten by stablemate Lagarde in the Bangalore Derby and was pipped at the post by Immortality in the Indian Oaks. She maintains her form, and having gone over the 2,400m trip twice, is capable of avenging the above defeats. Trainer Pesi Shroff’s champion filly Immortality, who ran last in her debut as a two-year-old, has shown a vast improvement this year by winning a Class 4 race over a mile, the Golconda Oaks, and the Indian Oaks over 2,400m. She is in great heart as evidenced by her track performances and may add another feather to her hat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/three-top-contenders-in-the-indian-derby-mix/article34165585.ece

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||A great disciple||Ramanujacharya’s disciple Kooratazhvan had all the traits that an Acharya would desire in his sishya. Ramanujacharya and Kooratazhvan travelled to Kashmir to study Bodayana vritti. Kooratazhvan had such an outstanding memory that with just one reading he was able to commit the entire work to memory. His intellect was matched by his humility and his total surrender to the wishes of his Acharya, said P.B. Rajahamsam in a discourse. Ramanujacharya was so fond of Kooratazhvan that he wanted his disciple to have a direct connection to his (Ramanujacharya’s) Acharyas. Once when Peria Nambi asked Ramanuja to pick one of his disciples to accompany him (Peria Nambi), Ramanuja left the choice to Peria Nambi himself. Nambi chose Kooratazhvan as the ideal person to be with him, and thus Ramanuja helped establish a direct connection between Kooratazhvan, his disciple, and Peria Nambi, his own Acharya. Kooratazhvan wrote five works, which are collectively known as Panchastava. They are Sri Stava, Vaikuntha Stava, Atimanusha Stava, Sri Sundarabahu Stava and Varadaraja Stava. While each is a gem in its own right, Varadaraja Stava has the unique distinction of being presented before Lord Varadaraja. Kanchi Varadaraja kshetra is considered dvaya kshetra, because it is here that the Lord and His Consort Perundevi are together often. In Srirangam, Lord Ranganatha and Goddess Ranganayaki are together only once a year. In Tirumala, Lord Srinivasa is on the hill, but the thayar is at the foot of the hill. It is only in Kanchi that they are most often together, which, therefore, makes it dvaya kshetra. Srirangam is the kshetra associated with the Ashtakshara and Tirumala with the charama sloka, while Kanchi clearly drives home the significance of dvaya mantra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/a-great-disciple/article34165534.ece

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Vada with verve||Food in India is decided by season, and the ingredients available in the region one lives in. The festival of colours, Holi is just round the corner and, as the temperature rises, celebrations are incomplete without food that not only tickles your taste-buds, but also cools you down. Rajani Jain, a home chef in Delhi says, “What better way than cool dahi vada after spending hours outside playing Holi?” The dahi (curd) cools you down and the common urad dal vada s, laced with masalas — cumin, coriander and chat masala powder — bring forth a burst of flavours. “I prefer ginger juliennes on it, with anar dana (pomegranate seeds),” she adds. There are many such preferences and not restricted to toppings alone. There are variations that give this dish an interesting spin, like vada s made with mixed lentil,  moong dal  , bread, oats or even with jeera butter cookies. An illustration to go with Tarla Dalal’s recipe, for instance, suggests vada s can be made with jeera butter cookies, slightly soaked in lukewarm water before dunking them in a pool of seasoned yoghurt. The mixed lentil variety, also called masala vada , consists of chana dal , urad dal  and moong dal , all coarsely ground. The tough question  Dahi vada is a simple dish, but it can get complicated if the vadas are not soft enough. According to chef Garima Poddar, dahi vada s are unique, because though they are deep fried, they melt in your mouth. She adds: “A lot of people get stuck with hard vada s or bhalla s. To avoid this, one can soak the fried vada s in water for a few seconds, then squeeze the water out gently by pressing them between one’s palms and drop them them in dahi .” Having said that, softness need not be an obsession, adds Garima, “In Rajasthan, the vada s are made with a slightly coarse paste of lentils, so there is a bite to its texture.” Chef Kunal Kapoor suggests that the urad batter be made with less or no water, to get soft vadas . Whisking the batter well, for quite some time, right before frying the vadas will also be helpful, he says. Season to taste As for spicing the yoghurt, Garima says, “There is no thumb rule to seasoning the dahi . The same applies to its consistency. Some like it thick and creamy, others like it slightly runny. Experiment with what works for your palate on a small quantity of dahi .” One of Garima’s favourite variations of dahi vada is the South Indian version, which uses a runny curd base. She says, “I also enjoy the tempering on it. One can play it up with any seasoning. I have tasted it with a garnish of peri peri masala, and also read about dahi vada with Tabasco sauce.” Kunal suggests creative toppings: “It is a season of fruits, so there is no harm in adding chopped fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes or even melons to the whisked yoghurt.”  Experimental matchmaking Street food lovers in Cuttack, Odisha have created their own twist to the dahi vada , pairing it with alu dum in a treat exclusive to this city. The now-iconic street food dahi vada and alu dum is a fusion experiment that has clicked very well, says consultant chef Rachit Kirteeman. He elaborates, “The Cuttack region of Odisha produces a lot of milk. So instead of letting it go waste, curd was made. Vada is a staple breakfast. Someone who had surplus of both curd and vada mixed it together and added the alu dum as an unusual accompaniment. Dahi vada in Odisha uses diluted curd, so when alu dum is added, it becomes a complete dish.”     Dahi vada is a simple dish, but it can get complicated if the vadas aren’t soft enough||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/vada-with-verve/article34165795.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Traditional fare, ethnic flair||Jaishri P. Rao has spent over a decade collecting information on the traditions, rituals and cuisine of the Maharashtrians settled in Thanjavur. Her initial idea was to bring out a booklet for the community, but the information proved too voluminous. The result of her research has now been published as Classic Cuisine and Celebrations of the Thanjavur Maharashtrians . Chennai-based Jaishri took up this task after her elder son was employed overseas and younger one joined university. “The Thanjavur Maharashtrian diaspora is spread across the globe, and assuming that both my sons would one day leave the country, I wished to preserve our community’s unique cooking traditions and cultural heritage for the next generation,” says Jaishri. The book features over 150 recipes, many of which are offered as naivedya (prayer offerings) during festivals, besides everyday dishes and delicacies. As festivals and religious rituals are a quintessential part of Maharashtrian culture, the author has structured the book chronologically, starting with the festival of Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaithra (March/April) and ending with the festival of Shimga Puneva (Holi) that falls in the month of Phalgun (February/March). “As the community follows all rituals and celebrates festivals with fervour, I decided to follow this structure, where I mention the festival, talk about the rituals involved, and the dishes associated with a particular celebration,” says Jaishri. In the section on Gudi Padwa, she lists staple heritage dishes such as puran poli, chinch bhath (tamarind rice), limbacha bhath (lemon rice), vaangi bhath (brinjal rice), ambode (a deep-fried spicy snack made with dal ) , pitla (mixed veg and lentil curry cooked in tamarind water) , kadi (buttermilk-based curry) and other recipes. Over three centuries, the Thanjavur Maharashtrians have also created new dishes, influenced by the Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka cuisines. “ Pitla and daangar ( urad dal flour blended with curd) are typical Thanjavur Maharashtrian dishes, evolved over a period of time. “Early migrants also replaced certain ingredients with locally available ones. For example, copra (dried coconut) is widely used in many Maharashtrian dishes, but in our community freshly grated coconut is roasted and then used to get thecoprataste,” she says. Coriander seeds, cumin and coconut are the dominant spices used in this cuisine. “We use various spice powders toasted in a minimal amount of oil to flavour the dishes. The simplicity of preparation with a good balance of spices is the hallmark of Thanjavur Maharashtrian cuisine,” says Jaishri. A classic combination is ambat bhaaji, daangar and kaatracha misiringa ( mor molaga Thanjavur style). “ Ambat bhaaji is a signature dish of our community. This spinach sambar is prepared with a liberal amount of toor dal, spiced with green chillies and seasoned with mustard, dry chillies and fenugreek. In sweets, puran poli, doodh poli and besan ladoo top the list.” Methkoot and daangar are typical examples of the protein-rich diet of this diaspora. Methkoot is a powder made using a mix of lentils such as toor , channa , moong and urad . Coriander, cumin and dry ginger are used to flavour this powder, which can be used in multiple ways as an accompaniment or even mixed with curd or tamarind water. “The book has been well received by the diaspora, especially the younger generation, and it has also won the Best Vegetarian Cuisine Book in the World Award by Gourmand International for the year 2020,” says the author.  The book and Kindle versions are available on Amazon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/traditional-fare-ethnic-flair/article34165798.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Colours of the past||We were on a road trip to Kolkata. On day three, we crossed over into Bengal in our trusted old Ambassador. My siblings and I were tired and irritable and my mother was nursing a headache. Distracted, my father drove on. We found ourselves in a quaint, picturesque village at the foothills of a mountain. It was a bright March morning and the air was fresh, laden with the scent of jasmine. As we drove through, we heard the sound of temple bells. The houses on either side of the road were old but well cared for. There was not a soul in sight. Halfway down the road, our car coughed, spluttered and gave up the ghost. “We’ll have to get it fixed,” he said. We groaned, moaned and complained. We picnicked by the roadside. As the afternoon wore on, the ringing of the bells grew louder. The village lay basking in the evening sun. Springing to life Then we heard laughter, music, the jingling of bangles and the tinkling of anklets. “Ghostlike,” whispered my sister, sending shivers down our spine. Suddenly, the quiet was shattered and the street burst into life. There were people everywhere. They threw coloured powder on one another and, when they saw us, they swept us up into their revelry. We were caught up in clouds of purple, pink, red, green, laughter and song. The bells continued to ring. Eerie calm I am not sure how the night ended but we woke up with the sun on our faces. Memories of the previous night flooded in. But, there was no trace of anything. The bells, too, were silent. It was eerily calm. “We need to get out of here. I don’t like this place,” said my father. Determined, he fiddled with the car. Whatever he did seemed to work and we were off. When we told our host in Kolkata about our experience, he told us the story of the village. “When Alivardi Khan became the Nawab of Bengal, his ascension was challenged. So he sought the help of the Marathas in Nagpur, who obliged by sending a cavalry. But the Bargis, as they were known, plundered and killed, destroying the village. It was on the eve of Holi. It was the last happy festival the village celebrated. According to legend, if you happen to be in the village on the eve of Holi, you can participate in the festival. But, sadly, not many have lived to tell the tale.”  Note: In April 1740, Alivardi Khan became the Nawab of Bengal. Later, to secure his position, he requested the help of the Marathas, who were known as Bargis. They looted and plundered the village of Garh Panchkot. The rest of the story is fictional.

Mohit is here with his architect- father JJ and Neel has come with his grandmother Ann from Australia and her friend Nisha from New Zealand.  “What do you mean your great-great-something-grandfather travelled ‘unwillingly’?” asked Mohit. “Was he kidnapped?” Neel nodded. “Kind of. He and many others like him were tricked into getting onto a river boat for a ‘joy ride’ from somewhere around this part of India. Before they knew what was happening, they were on a long sea voyage and finally landed in Fiji. He was ‘sold’ to work in the fields there, but worked his way out and set up his own business and became quite successful. Later his children and grandchildren moved to Australia.’ Disbelief “That’s like an adventure story,” said Mohit. “Oh, it’s very real. Grandma’s friend Nisha’s story is also similar. Her granddaughter Susan — you must have seen her around the village — is busy trying to find out more about Fijian Indians and Indian Indians and the land of our forefathers…” “In other words, she’s a bit of a pain, right?” said Mohit. “Totally,” muttered Neel. “I don’t care about origins and forefathers and all that!” “So here you are, helping to build houses!” said Mohit brightly, clapping him on his shoulder. Neel made a face. “I thought I would have a nice time looking around while others worked, but someone is always calling my name and saying, ‘More bricks’ or ‘Get that bucket’.” As he spoke, Neel looked for his grandmother and Nisha and saw their hats bobbing around the ruins of a house. Beside them, he could see eager-beaver Susan. He pointed her out and said, “She seems to think that building a house is a fine pastime during her holidays!” “I know! It’s painful to see someone so willing and eager to work, isn’t it?” said Mohit, watching her. “I have many people like that in my family. My Dad, for example. Like I told you, he finds WORK entertaining!” Suddenly, the two of them felt heavy hands on their shoulders and a gruff voice said, “I wondered where you had disappeared to…” Mohit lost his carefree grin. “Uh – uh – Dad – uh…” he began, obviously hoping that his father had not heard his last remark and thinking desperately of some excuse. But his father didn’t wait to hear anything. “Come on,” he said. “I have a really neat job for you two.”  To be continued   He and many others like him were tricked into getting onto a river boat for a “joy ride”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/brick-by-brick-back-to-work/article34166466.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||A dish to celebrate with||A recent addition to the UNESCO’s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage is Couscous, a dish staple to Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania. The word comes from the language of the Berbers, an ethnic group native to North and West Africa. This processed grain product made from coarse grains of Durum wheat flour has been included as an Intangible Heritage because the traditions and practices of its preparation are unique. The practice of making couscous begins with the growing of the grain. The harvested cereal is then ground to the consistency of semolina, hand rolled and steamed. After shaping it, cornstarch or wheat flour is added and the couscous is dried. Preparing the dish involves the use of specific tools and utensils. Clay utensils are made by potters and wooden ones by artisans whose workshops are family run. Couscous is prepared for ceremonial events, local or religious festivals and for family get-togethers. There are local variations on the art of preparation and recipe is kept within in the family. Depending on the region, season and the occasion, the couscous is accompanied by meats and vegetables. Another variety of the couscous is the mesfouf, which is prepared from finely rolled semolina and butter.  Fun Facts  An anonymous 13th century North African cookbook, The Cookbook of Maghreb and Al Andalus , refers to the dish with a recipe that was “known all over the world.  Couscous is derived from the Berber seksu/kesksu, meaning “well rolled”, “well formed”, or “rounded. The world’s first manufacturing plant to produce couscous was established in Algeria in 1907. It makes an excellent vegetarian meal and also is an ideal stuffing for peppers, aubergines, and more. There are three main types of couscous: Moroccan, Israeli, and Lebanese. The first comprises tiny grains of semolina and cooks very quickly. Israeli couscous is the size of peppercorns. The Lebanese variety is the size of small peas. One cup of cooked couscous contains 200 calories (12% from protein, 87% from starch, and 1% from fats). It provides 35% of the recommended daily requirement of nutritious fibres and a range of B vitamins and minerals needed for its efficient absorption into the body. It symbolises luck, blessings and abundance according to North African tradition.

Dadi turned her attention to mom, “You must get everything by evening from the market or else some item might not be available.” “Don’t worry. Today, everything from salt to sugar can be ordered online and it will be delivered at our doorstep,” mom assured her. “But why online when the kirana shop is just around the corner?” Dadi retorted. “Oh ho, dadi, what is the need to go to the kirana shop when we can get the stuff at our doorstep tomorrow?” said Sarvang, coming out of his room. Dadi tried to reason with him, “But the kirana shop is hardly 100 metres away.” “Oh dadi! You are so outdated. This is age of online shopping.” Sarvang laughed and ran off with his cricket bat. “We walked kilometres to fetch whatever was required at home when we were young. We never cared about whether goods would be delivered at our doorstep or not.” Dadi was annoyed but there was no one to hear her. A waiting game In the evening, Dadi asked, “I hope all the ingredients required for dahi vada and gujhiyas have been ordered.” Young Mihir replied, “Yes, mom ordered everything online the moment you gave her the list.” Dadi quietly said, “Gokul from the kirana shop is so considerate. He brings our order even when it’s raining. He could also have earned something if we had ordered from his shop.” “Dadi, our order has been placed online; rest assured.” Sarvang smiled confidently. The next morning, dadi was eager to know the status of the order. So Mihir checked and confirmed, “Dispatched and expected tomorrow”. Now dadi was left with no other option but to wait. The next day, she was informed that the status of the order was “Out for Delivery” but nothing arrived that day. On the third day, dadi was restless and could not hide her displeasure, “Two more days for Holi and your online order is yet to arrive. How can we prepare the gujhiyas if all the ingredients are not available in time?” Everyone was eagerly waiting for the delivery, except dadi who murmured again, “If I had had my way, I would have bought the goods from Gokul’s shop”. Suddenly the door bell rang and everyone rushed to the door. A smart delivery boy greeted mom and handed over the carton. mom heaved an ecstatic sigh of relief. Dadi was still annoyed, “I don’t like these last-minute preparations. We used to prepare gujhiyas at least two days in advance.” “I will soak the dal for the vadas and help you with the gujhiyas tomorrow. Let us relax now since the ingredients have arrived,” mom tried to soothe dadi’s feelings. Something amiss The next morning when mom unpacked the carton, she looked worried. “I cannot find the khoya .” She called the helpline of the online service but the executive only offered polite apologies for the mistake. Dadi asked Sarvang to call Gokul’s kirana shop. He came back with the reply that all the khoya had been sold. mom was disappointed when she noticed dadi’s dejected face but nothing could be done at this hour. Suddenly the doorbell chimed and the sound rang through the silent house. To everyone’s surprise, Gokul stood there holding a box. “I had kept some khoya for my home; I brought half of it for you. If no gujhiyas are prepared at your home, how can we enjoy ours?” he said, as he gave the box to dadi.  “But why online when the kirana shop is just around the corner,” Dadi retorted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/saved-by-the-bell/article34166496.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||On top o f the world||A very hungry Hanuman is still chasing the orange. As he gets closer, it seems to be moving father away. Hanuman (to the air molecules): Friends, help me move faster. I am very hungry!  Air Molecules: But Hanu...  Hanuman: Shhh! Just do as I say!  Air molecules (to each other): Didn’t Hanuman say we are friends? Now, he has started ordering us!  Hanuman: Faster!  Air molecule: Okay. But there are various levels of speed: Sonic, Subsonic, Supersonic, Hypersonic. Which speed would you like to travel at?  Hanuman: How is one different from the other?  Air molecules: Sonic means travelling at the speed of sound — 343 miles per second. Subsonic means slower than the speed of sound; supersonic means faster than the speed of sound; and hypersonic means five times faster.  Hanuman: I want to go at hypersonic!  Air molecules: But then, you will break the sound layer, which can cause a heavy explosion-like noise called sonic boom. This may disturb people in Heaven and Earth.  Hanuman: I don’t care. Let’s go!  Air molecules: Okay. (In whispers) Lord Vaayu, please help us. Hanuman flies through the atmosphere like a rocket, which creates a thunderous sound. He crosses Bhuvar Loka (Troposphere) and reaches the peak of Mount Meru, arriving at Svarga Loka — the place ruled by Indra (Ozone layer and Stratosphere). People on Earth are shocked by the sonic boom. Enter Indra Indra comes out of his palace to check what is happening and sees a young monkey chasing the sun. He mounts Airavat, his flying elephant, and goes to stop Hanuman, unaware that he is the son of Vaayu.  Indra: Hey monkey! How are you flying? And why are you creating a ruckus?  Hanuman: I have no time! I am hungry and I have to get that orange!  Indira: You mean the sun?!  Hanuman: Get out of my way!  Indra: Do you know who you are talking to? I am the king of Svarga Loka!  Hanuman (to the air molecules): Friends, this man doesn’t know how powerful you are. My dad always says, ‘When someone tries to pull you down, show them what you are capable of’. Let’s show him!  Indra: Ha ha ha! Show me!  Hanuman: Dear Vaayu sena, help me blow air 10 times faster than hypersonic speed. Hanuman blows with so much power that Indira and Airavat are thrown away. Indira is shocked by the force (Mass x Acceleration) generated by Hanuman. He takes out his weapon and creates lightning bolts and directs them at Hanuman. One of them partly hits Hanuman’s cheeks. The air molecules are shocked. They remember Lord Vaayu’s order to protect Hanuman.  Air Molecules: Hanuman, remove the jewellery that you are wearing and throw them away. Metals are better conductors of electric charges (lightning) than your body. The lighting bolt will be directed towards your jewellery and we can escape to the Mahar Loka (Mesosphere). The plan works and Hanuman reaches Mesosphere. Indra continues to chase Hanuman as he moves towards Mahar Loka (Mesosphere; 50-70 km above the planet); Jan Loka (Ionosphere; 70-90 km above the planet); Tapa Loka (Thermosphere; 90-700 km above the planet) and Satya Loka (Exosphere and Beyond 700 km and more above the planet). The air molecules start to worry now; as Hanuman moves higher, they are becoming weaker. The Vaayu sena’s numbers start to dwindle (air density becomes lesser as you move away from Earth’s gravity). They call out to Lord Vaayu, who appears and takes stock of the situation. As Hanuman reaches the airless space, he begins to feel breathless. To save him, Vaayu pulls out every single air molecule from Earth and diverts them into Hanuman, who expands as there is no air pressure outside. Hanuman becomes bigger than the sun and blocks it. Suddenly, there is no air or light on Earth and the people are distressed. Hanuman opens his mouth to swallow the sun. Suddenly, he hears a booming voice: “Stop!” He sees a person with four heads standing there...  To be continued...   The author is the founder and CEO of Vaayusastra Aerospace, an IIT-Madras incubated ed-tech start-up that offers Air Science workshops for children between five and 14 years.

Mars is known as the Red Planet because red soil or dust, which looks like rusty iron, covers almost all of the planet. Mars has clouds and wind, just as Earth does. Sometimes the wind blows the red dust into a dust storm. Tiny dust storms can look like tornadoes, and large ones can cover the whole planet, causing the entire planet to look red.  Why can’t wekeep our our eyes open when we sneeze?  Your eyes automatically close when you sneeze as a result of your body’s involuntary reflexes. That means your brain sends a signal to your eye muscles to close your eyes before a sneeze without you even thinking about it. Some believe this reflex developed to prevent what is being sneezed out from getting into the eyes. Others believe it’s simply a reflex with no particular purpose whatsoever!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-the-world-know-how-curious-you-are/article34166460.ece

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Across the Palk Strait||Yazhpanam P.S. Balamurugan had to cancel nearly a dozen performances in India last year, after the pandemic made it impossible to travel from Jaffna, where he lives, in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province. “I participated in some online events, and in another instance recorded a performance here and shared it with organisers there, but there’s nothing like a live performance in front of an eager audience,” says the nagaswaram artiste, who has a steadily growing fan base in south India. Those who heard him play Charukesi at a Chennai concert over two years ago have neither forgotten the rendition nor been able to appreciate other Charukesis since, without being reminded of his. The robust sound emanating from his wind instrument, sustained by long, full breaths, brimming with life and emotion, casts a spell on audiences. For Sri Lankan artistes like him, performing in India defied the usual logistical complications of going abroad. The relatively friendly visa regime, innumerable flight options, and the short travel time — a Colombo-Chennai flight takes less than an hour, and a Jaffna-Chennai flight was introduced in 2019 — made travel fairly simple. “I can’t wait to travel and perform there again once borders open up,” says Balamurugan. Kandyan dance exponent and guru Upeka Chitrasena has performed across the world, but the audience in India, especially Chennai, is “something else,” she says. “Rows and rows of elderly people and children sit through performances, keeping taal and responding with spontaneous applause when they like something. It is rare to see that sort of engagement and passion.” Collaboration with Nrityagram The stronger magnet pulling her, however, is some 370 km away from Chennai. When she says she dearly misses India, she means she misses Nrityagram, the Odissi dance village near Bengaluru that has been second home for the renowned Sri Lankan artiste since 2003. This is the longest she has been away, given that she usually makes five or six trips a year. “I stopped performing in 2011 and only teach now, so seeing dancers at Nrityagram learn and rehearse gives me the energy of my own performance days,” she says. Artistes from the Colombo-based Chitrasena Dance Company, named after Upeka’s father, Sri Lanka’s pioneering Kandyan dance exponent, and the Nrityagram group have been collaborating for a decade now. Two productions, ‘Samhara’ (2012) and ‘Ahuti’ (2019), bring the two very different but delightfully complementary traditions, Kandyan and Odissi, in conversation. The pandemic meant that the two groups missed some joint performance tours last year, but they have stayed in touch all through. Their long professional and artistic collaboration has birthed precious friendships — like Chitrasena’s with Nrityagram’s artistic director and Odissi exponent Surupa Sen. Several trips across the Palk Strait from both sides, both planned and impromptu, have strengthened these ties. It was 2019; artistes from the two dance schools were rehearsing for ‘Ahuti’ in Bengaluru. Surupa had casually mentioned to Chitrasena’s artistic director, Heshma Wignaraja, and principal dancer, Thaji Dias [both Chitrasena’s nieces], how lovely it would be to have Upeka Chitrasena for Guru Poornima the next day. “I got a call on a Saturday evening from my nieces about this. And by 5 p.m. on Sunday, I was at Surupa’s doorstep, surprising her. I cannot forget her expression when she saw me there,” says Chitrasena, adding: “So many memorable rehearsals, performances, conversations, and birthdays together — I miss all of those!” Her mother, the senior Kandyan dance exponent, choreographer and guru, Vajira Chitrasena, was chosen for the Padma Shri award in India last year, but the pandemic meant she could not travel to New Delhi to receive the honour. Colombo-based Bharatanatyam artiste and teacher Thivya Sujen has had different reasons to go Tamil Nadu every year. If she was not taking her Abhinayakshetra School of Dance’s productions there, she was visiting to work on the music score. “It was our honour to collaborate with composers like Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and Rajkumar Bharathi for our productions. I would spend about a fortnight there for the recordings,” she says. Thivya also took her students who were preparing for their maiden stage performance to Chennai for the photoshoots and to get their costumes done. But what the dancer misses most is visiting her guru, C.V. Chandrasekhar, the veteran Bharatanatyam exponent. She had been especially looking forward to meeting him on his 85th birthday last May, but travel was shut down. She decided to mark the occasion in Sri Lanka by setting up the Global Association of Sri Lankan Bharatanatyam Artistes, a platform bringing together performers and teachers who were forced to leave the country during the anti-Tamil pogrom of 1983. She also organised online lectures with Indian artistes, such as Priyadarsini Govind, and began a virtual ‘Nattuvangam’ course, again periodically roping in Indian artistes. “I believe the relationship between artistes of Sri Lanka and India must continue online until we can meet again in person,” she says. Literary meets “No one expected this sort of break,” says ‘Kambavarithy’ Ilankai Jeyaraj, a renowned Tamil scholar, who founded and helms the Kamban Kazhagam in Sri Lanka. Other than frequently travelling to India to participate in literary meets or to deliver lectures — sometimes even five times a month — Jeyaraj has been a prime force bringing senior Indian artistes and scholars to Sri Lanka every year. The Kamban Kazhagam’s ticket-free arts festivals, held in Colombo and Jaffna, are known for the huge crowds they draw. Their last festival was in early 2020, when playback singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam was honoured. “We have invited Indian artistes since the mid-1990s, and over the years they have built a special bond with audiences here. They stay in our homes, eat with us, spend time with us… only such strong relationships built over time can brave an unprecedented situation like this pandemic,” says Jeyaraj. Along with its branch in Australia, the Colombo Kamban Kazhagam held its literary meet online and has also begun sharing videos from its archives on its website. Meanwhile, Jeyaraj is remotely working with musician Bombay Jayashri, a regular and much-loved performer in Colombo and Jaffna, on an album of devotional verses. Both artistes and audiences are “yearning for interaction,” Jeyaraj says, hoping a physical festival might become possible this year.  The pandemic meant that the two groups missed some joint performance tours, but they have stayed in touch all through.

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Bringing Mozart home||Classical music lovers in Delhi trooped into India Habitat Centre with renewed ardour as the capital slowly began opening up auditoriums for live concerts this month. Filled to about a third of its capacity (due to social distancing), the venue this evening drew an eclectic mix of those with an ear for Indian classical music, connoisseurs of Western classical music, as well as enthusiasts of edgy musical experiments. A piano placed downstage on the right, the sitar and cello in the centre, and tabla at the other end raised our curiosity — what if Mozart were to meld his compositions with raga music? Shubhendra Rao, his wife Saskia Rao-de Haas and son Ishaan Leonard Rao offered a rich mix of possibilities on sitar, Indian cello and piano with a new raga, alaap-jod-jhala blending with Mozart’s Requiem, and a ragamala improvisation alongside a sonata. Shubhendra and Saskia have spent decades performing together and striking a fine balance in musical forms. “We are a family steeped in classical music,” says Shubhendra while Saskia adds, “This concert is special for us because it showcases our journey into two musical traditions.” This time, they were joined by their son, 16-year-old Ishaan making it the family’s first live music concert in Delhi after the lockdown.  Musing on Mozart Mozart’s canonical oeuvre offers multiple points of exploration. Family Rao chose to deep dive into compositions that would resonate with Indian audiences alongside the more challenging sombre shades of the legend’s music. The trio opened with an invocatory piece blending traditional Indian music with Mozart’s ‘Dona Nobis Placem’. Alternating between pathos and the playful, the composition was a gentle melodic interplay between the instruments. “It’s not fusion,” clarified Rao, “it is the coming together of two artistic traditions that must be treated with respect and sensitivity. My guru (Pt. Ravi Shankar) often used to say that to change the rules you must first deeply understand the rules.” For Saskia, the concert rekindled memories of her initial training in Western classical music. “For the last 25 years, my artistic identity is of an Indian classical musician; this journey through Mozart’s work was like revisiting the culture I grew up in.” Talking about the process of putting together the concert, she said, “It is important for the music to flow, to build a story through the structure, the logic, the mood, and the notes.” The duo doesn’t hesitate to discuss and debate while creating music together. “We are each other’s sounding board,” said Shubhendra. “My job as a partner in life and music is to constantly question and play the critic too,” quipped the cello exponent. “We try to open up the process of music-making for each other. Meaningful music comes from such a thought process, it is created in the heart and the mind, it is both mathematics and poetry.” A fine balance For young Ishaan, it is about balancing eclectic music sensibilities. He started learning the sitar at age three, a year later he started training in the cello, and by the age of six, he had decided to turn to the piano. “I’ve grown up listening to my parents practising Indian classical music, I have trained in Western classical music and we all listen to a lot of jazz and other genres as well.” A confident soloist, Ishaan presented the ‘Molto Allegro’ from piano sonata K.457 in C Minor. Reflecting on his choice he says, “I’m drawn to the melodic simplicity of this sonata.” Later in the programme, the trio improvised around another piano sonata with a ragamala. Mozart’s prolific improvisations echo with the improvisatory process in Indian classical music. Raag Yaman, Khamaj, Kaafi and Bilawal were wrapped seamlessly around the Andante Grandioso of Mozart’s Piano sonata K.331. Raga and Requiem One of the highlights of the concert was a new raag composed by Shubhendra Rao. A work in progress, the raag remains untitled, yet plays with the consonants of Mozart’s name with an emphasis on the notes ‘Ma’, ‘Sa’ and ‘Re’. “Creating a raag is not a planned event, it is an organic process,” said Shubhendra. “One morning when I was doing my riyaaz and didn’t know what to play, I just started going with the flow of the music that I experienced at that point of time.” He presented the contours of the raag with a vivid alaap, evoking pathos and sobriety. Saskia joined him to explore the raag, which is inspired by the darker side of Mozart’s music. With precise and playful layakari sections, the duo was accompanied by Pranshu Chaturlal on the tabla. They delved further into the intensity of Mozart’s compositions, concluding in D Minor. The familiar refrain from Symphony 40.K in a rondo form alternated with the alaap-jod in Keerwani. Mozart’s intriguing Requiem, often called his swansong, intertwined with the Keerwani jhala to bring home a haunting melody that bridged two different musical worlds.

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||What makes Imman’s music click||When news of composer D. Imman winning the National Award for Best Music for Siva’s Viswasam broke, the Tamil film industry and social media erupted with joy. And then, the usual debate followed. ‘Imman has done stellar work. Why this film?’ ‘Is this really Imman’s best?’ Predictable because we are speaking of the composer of albums such as Mynaa , Kumki and Rekka , whose melodies seeped into listener’s hearts. Imman’s fans drew up a playlist — from Rekka ’s ‘Kannamma’ and Tik Tik Tik ’s ‘Kurumba’ to Nenjil Thunivirunthal ’s ‘Rayil Aararo’ and Rummy ’s ‘Koodamela’. Others showcased more ‘massy’ numbers such as ‘Dandanaka’ ( Romeo Juliet ) and ‘Ennama Ippadi’ ( Rajinimurugan ). A parallel celebration was happening on social media. “This (comparison to a composer’s earlier work) happens all the time because music appreciation is subjective. People said the same thing when Rahman won the Oscars. They said that of all his songs, he wins for ‘Jai Ho…’ when there are so many other fabulous songs he has composed,” says Karthik Srinivasan, who manages the music review website Milliblog. “I'm happy for Imman. He turned his career around after Mynaa , despite having done films for Vijay earlier in his career, and has not looked back. He remains one of the top composers in Tamil,” adds Karthik. Imman began his career with the Vijay-starrer Tamizhan in 2002. It has taken him 21 years to make it big at the national level. While he had a sprinkling of hits in between, he had to wait until 2010 for his breakout album, Mynaa . “ Mynaa and Kumki brought him back to the mainstream and he quickly captured the space previously occupied by Deva, Bharadwaj and others. He has mastered the art of creating raga-based, melancholic melodies, reminding many listeners of Ilaiyaraaja of the 1980s,” says Krithikaa Ramkrishnan, a U.S.-based IT consultant, who is passionate about music and cricket. According to her, Imman is comfortable in his soundscape and the melodies “have an emotional and visceral connection that reminds us of specific genres and periods in music”. But Imman is not without flaws. “His tunes can get repetitive and jaded, and he continues to be known for ‘stand-out’ songs as opposed to ‘stand-out’ albums,” Krithikaa adds. However, he has always reinvented himself. What stands out about the National Award is that it has come to him at the relatively young age of 38, when he seems to have hit a purple patch. Researcher Nagarajan Natarajan, who tweets about all things film music, prefers ‘Vaaney Vaaney’ ( Viswasam ) sung by Shreya Ghoshal. “I'd like to think this award recognises the long-standing Imman-Ghoshal collaboration,” he says. His favourite Imman number is in Kannada — ‘Yaaro Naanu’ sung by Shreya Ghoshal for Puneet Rajkumar-starrer Natasaarvabhowma . What does Imman feel about the award for Viswasam , and ‘Kannana Kanne,’ sung by Sid Sriram, in particular? He dedicates it to all fathers since the film celebrates father-daughter bonding. “The award took me by surprise, because my understanding was that the award is given to artistic films. I did not see this coming my way.” What gratifies Imman most is that people have given it a new life by colouring it with their own emotions . “This song is just four minutes in a two-and-a-half hour long film. But they’ve made it their song. I see this as a gift,” says Imman.

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Under the banyan’s shade||When Rukmini Devi Arundale planted a banyan sapling on the Kalakshetra campus, she perhaps envisaged the institution growing as big as the tree. And like the tree’s many aerial prop roots that have over the years grown into strong trunks, many distinguished dancers have emerged from Kalakshetra. One such is Prof. Arayambath Janardhanan. Honoured recently with the title of Natya Kalanidhi by ABHAI (Association of Bharatanatyam Dancers of India), Janardhan says it was destiny that brought him to Kalakshetra. A school annual day performance of Katha Prasangam impressed his principal so much that he wrote a letter of recommendation to Rukmini Devi, asking her to take the little boy under her care. Kalakshetra soon became a second home to Janardhanan — his father, the much-revered Kathakali master Asan Chandu Panikkar was already a teacher there. At Kalakshetra, besides the intensive training in music and dance, Janardhanan assimilated a lot by observing his guru and mentor, including aspects of stage craft, light design, choreography and costume. After receiving a government scholarship, Janardhanan trained in Kathakali under Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair. His clear lines and emotional depth landed him the many roles, from Rama to Ravana, Buddha and Ajamila, that he played in various Kalakshetra productions. Recalling his student days, Janardhanan says, “Much of the learning happened outside the classroom, when we were interacting with teachers, visiting artistes and peers.” The old dance dramas It is this training that has helped him revive many of Rukmini Devi’s productions. “We were encouraged to adopt an holistic approach to dance that included story, music, choreography, costume, colours, props and lights. While reviving the plays, I just followed Rukmini Devi’s vision,” says Janardhanan. In fact, the dancer actually “recreated the entire process” just as it had been done under Rukmini Devi, including recalling the entries and exits and even her choice of material and colours. “But it has also not been easy,” says Janardhanan. “Unlike the gurukula system, the semester system with its limited hours of learning and new batches of students every academic term makes it challenging to stage the mega natya-natakams.” Another difficulty that Janardhanan points to is the inability to train dancers for multiple roles. “In our training days, dancers sometimes had to take on a new role at short notice. Or during a tour, if there was a shortage of actors, dancers doubled up to play other roles. This is difficult today,” he says. Janardhanan choreographed two dance dramas, ‘Karna Sapatam’ ( Malayalam ) and ‘ Sri Purandara’ (Kannada)  for the Kalakshetra repertory, and ‘Sri Krishna Jananam’ (for the Dhananjayans’ Bharata Kalanjali). Though early recognition eluded him, he later received several titles and awards, including Kerala Kalasree (Kerala Sangeet Natak Akademi), the Acharya Choodamani, and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. From student to teacher to principal of Kalakshetra, and today as emeritus professor, Janardhanan’s life and artistic journey is clearly umbilically linked to the institute.

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Tech meets tradition||In 2018, a team of researchers went from Chennai to Thanjavur to learn more about the art plates of the temple city. Soon they realised that not many residents knew about this unique heritage, even though as a popular gift item, it had kept its few surviving makers busy in cottage-industry units. The craft blending two cultures — Dravidian and Maratha — seemed very much on the wane. From 200 artisan families, there were now only 50 left. The researchers’ study tour metamorphosed into a grassroots project aimed at reviving the indigenous industry, with the Chennai-based Rajalakshmi Group of Institutions offering support. The plates, introduced during the reign of Bhonsle king Serfoji II (1798-1832), are seeing a surge in sales. The aim, however, was not just to rejuvenate production and sales but to highlight that the plates were more than just curios. Now, 14 years after it got a GI, the heritage craft is gaining new-age currency in markets far and near. From being just a round alloy piece typically seen in showcases and on walls of houses or hotels, it is now available in various sizes and adorns trendy jewellery, personalised diaries, photo frames, bags and dinner-sets. The project liberated the handicraft from its time warp. “The designs have ceased to be repetitive,” says R. Kalaiselvi, chief investigator of the mission under Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology (RIT).  Give-and-take It all began when RIT conducted a pilot study as part of a government scheme for the rejuvenation of art forms. Funded by the Union Department of Science and Technology’s SHRI programme, the mission shortlisted four artisans. They were brought to Chennai for a training workshop. At the workshop, the traditional artisans taught RIT’s contemporary design engineers and students the four stages of making the plates. “First, we make the basic mould, then the plate. Next is finishing and finally, polishing,” explains master craftsman J. Shankaran, the only dye-making expert in the field. “It is an art of embossing, etching and engraving on metallic surfaces. It has two main parts: maiyam , which is the primary silver relief at the centre, and talavaram , the secondary relief with alternating brass and silver wedges along the plate’s circumference.” RIT students suggested changes to the plate-making technique, but the artisans shrugged them off, saying the kungiliyam (sal) tree’s glue to stick the metal sheets would melt upon exposure to the sun. “To this, our team came up with a technological intervention,” says engineer S.

It can withstand temperatures up to 55 degrees Celsius.” The RTI team also documented the traditional tools and created a digital library, says R. Vijayarajan. “We conceptualised fast pneumatic tools for the art. Our applications, enabled by augmented or virtual reality, permits artisans to present interactive design catalogues to customers.” Adding such commercial viability has brought in a young crop of plate-makers. S Rajesh, 25, is one of them. Till last monsoon, he hadn’t bothered to learn the family craft even though his father, Shankaran, who has won several awards, has practised it for almost five decades. “Now we are tech-backed,” says the computer-literate youth. “The prices have come down; the orders have gone up.” T. Kumar, 42, who had joined the construction industry, has gone back to the craft his father, N. Thiagarajan, was passionate about. “Today, I am busy readying fresh models based on novel designs,” he says. The RIT collaboration has improved the artisans’ work environment too. “Constantly hammering on the metal-sheets and pressing between the lead dyes causes severe back strain,” points out Kalaiselvi. “We provided them furniture that suits their kind of labour.” The writer is a keen follower of Kerala’s performing arts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/tech-meets-tradition/article34166099.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Breaking stereotypes||Female percussionists are so few that their gender alone makes them the cynosure of attention. Bengaluru-based Bhagyalakshmi M. Krishna, however, has gone beyond that, earning respect for her immense skills on the morsing. She has shared the stage with Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna, Sudha Ragunathan, Sanjay Subrahmanyan and S. Sowmya, besides many other noted musicians. Senior ghatam exponent Sukanya Ramgopal says, “Bhagyalakshmi is a confident accompanist. She attracts even lay people with her rhythmic patterns and tonal qualities. I have seen the audience approaching her after every concert to convey their appreciation. It’s a very good lecture demonstration for them.” The first lessons When she was 10, Bhagyalakshmi’s father, L. Bhimachar, the first artiste to play the morsing on the radio, initiated her into the instrument at the suggestion of his friend H.P. Ramachar (kanjira exponent). Ramachar conducted an all-women percussion ensemble called Karnataka Mahila Laya Madhuri, which lacked a morsing player. Bhagyalakshmi, the youngest of four siblings, had until then not formally learned music, but had nevertheless been steeped in it. “My father and brother (B. Rajasekhar) played the morsing and my eldest brother (B. Dhruvaraj) played the mridangam. My mother (late S. Jayamma) would sing at home and they would play for her too.” Bhagyalakshmi initially learned just what was needed for the ensemble performances. “It was only a few years later, when I played at a veena concert, that I realised how much more was needed to actually play for a concert.” Besides the Indira Sivasailam Special Award 2019, the Uma Award from Kartik Fine Arts 2019 and many other awards, Bhagyalakshmi has been a constant in the senior slot of The Music Academy’s line-up since 2007, where she has won numerous awards for ‘Best Upapakkavadyam’. Vocalist Amrutha Venkatesh narrates an instance of Bhagyalakshmi’s appeal. “The competent mridangam artiste played some complicated rhythm patterns in the tani avartanam. Bhagyalakshmi followed with an extremely sweet and aesthetic turn on the morsing. Everyone in the audience and on stage could not help but smile and enjoy the melody of the instrument. It was the biggest and warmest round of applause at the concert that day. She can handle the most complex and difficult calculations with great ease but scores every time with neat, apt and crisp playing.” After her start in Ramachar’s ensemble, Bhagyalakshmi became a regular part of senior ghatam exponent Sukanya Ramgopal’s Stree Taal Tarang group. Playing technique Employed far less frequently than the ghatam and the kanjira, the morsing is a unique instrument used percussively in traditional Carnatic concerts, ancillary to the mridangam. Made of metal, it has a frame with a flexible ‘tongue,’ akin to a blade, at the centre. Bhagyalakshmi explains, “The frame is held between the teeth and sound is produced by plucking the ‘tongue’ with the forefinger or middle finger, breathing out, vocalising syllables in the throat, and a combination of any of these. When holding the instrument in the mouth, the pressure applied by the teeth must be just right such that there is a gap between the edges of the frame to allow the ‘tongue’ space to vibrate. Then, keeping the tongue folded behind, one should recite jatis (the percussive syllables of what one wants to reproduce) while plucking appropriately. The skill lies in getting all these simultaneously in precise proportions.” The pitch makes a difference in the ease or difficulty of playing the instrument — a high pitch reduces resonance, she says, requiring more vigorous plucking and harder and stronger vocalisation of the jatis. The lips and the finger used to pluck the instrument can cut and bleed after a long bout of playing, which is why one will sometimes see a morsing artiste’s finger bandaged. Senior mridangist H.S. Sudhindra says, “An ever-smiling lady, who respects her seniors both on and off stage, Bhagyalakshmi has good musical sense. She is very sincere in preparing for concerts, understanding the sensitivities of the artistes on stage and avoiding unnecessary accompaniment. She calls me before the concert, reconfirms the sruti, discusses the pieces to be performed in the concert, and the planning of the tani avartanam. She works on new ideas with utmost dedication and takes special interest in RTPs. She is a dependable, dedicated artiste who does not resort to shortcuts.”  The author writes on classical music   and upcoming musicians.   It was only a few years later, when I played at a veena concert, that I realised how much more was needed to actually play for a kutcheri||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/breaking-stereotypes/article34166087.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||High notes of Holi||It is hard to imagine Indian festivals without music. As most festivals are associated with the change of seasons and the arrival of a new crop, song and dance provide an opportunity to cherish the old and embrace the new. Holi assumes a special place in music as an entire genre called Hori is dedicated to the festival. In the classical format, it is closer to Dhrupad, while in semi-classical it is decorated with elements of Thumri. Sung across the Gangetic belt, Horis, set to Dhamar taal, celebrate the divine romance between Radha and Krishna. Over the years, Hindi cinema has drawn extensively from semi-classical and folk music, and Holi songs provide a great opportunity not just to tease the beloved but also to make a statement. V. Shantaram not only captured the vibrant nature of the festival in ‘Arey ja re hat natkhat’ ( Navrang , 1959) but also how the day encompasses gender equality. More than seven-minute long, lyricist Bharat Vyas imbues the song with interesting wordplay where the girl says, ‘Arey ja re natkhat, na chhoo mera ghoonghat, palat ke doongi tujhe aaj gaari re, mujhko na samjho tum bholi bhali re’ (don’t touch my veil, I will give back in the same language; don’t consider me docile) and the boy responds: ‘Meethi lage aaj teri gaari re’ (your abuses sound sweet today). Some of the best Holi songs reflect the composite culture of the Hindi film industry. Mehboob Khan, Naushad and Shakeel Budayuni had a knack for creating Holi songs to depict the flow of time. In Mehboob Khan’s Mother India (1957) , Shamshad Begum sings ‘Holi aayi re kanhai rang chhalke’ as Naushad brings Western music-style orchestration into play. Naushad and Shakeel combined again to create ‘Tan rang lo ji aaj man rang lo’ for S.U. Sunny’s Kohinoor. But before that, the duo had already hit the right chord with ‘Khelo rang hamare sang aaj din rang rangeela aaya’ in Aan (1952). Picturised on Dilip Kumar, Nimmi, Nadira and Premnath, it is again used as a narrative device by director Mehboob Khan and brings out the egalitarian idea behind the festival with lines like ‘aaj koi raja na koi rani hai.’ A Holi song that very easily comes to mind is “Rang barse bheege chunar wali’ from Yash Chopra’s Silsila. Sung by Amitabh Bachchan and composed by Shiv-Hari (Pt. Shiv Kumar Sharma and Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia), the song has outlived the film. They wanted a Hori and it was Yash Chopra who came up with the idea that they should approach Harivansh Rai Bachchan, who was in Bombay those days, to write the song. He came up with the lyrics, based on a rural folk song. Holi songs have also been used to underline or mitigate social evils. In Kati Patang ’s ‘Aaj na chhodenge... khelenge hum Holi,’ Shakti Samanta used the song to portray the sorrow of widows who are expected to stay away from colours. In a radical move, the song ends with the heroine’s (Asha Parekh) white sari doused in gulal . Anand Bakshi and R.D. Burman combined again in Sholay where the festival played a crucial part in the narrative to create ‘Holi ke din dil mil jaate hain, rangon main rang mil jaate hain’. As Hindi film music became less lyrical and the festival more physical, Holi songs have been increasingly reduced to poor versions of ‘Rang barse’ or became just an excuse to drench bodies. But recently, sanity was restored with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Bajirao Mastani, where Birju Maharaj and Shreya Ghoshal combined to create the lyricism of yore with ‘Mujhe rang do laal nand ke lal’.  Some of the best Holi songs reflect the composite culture of the Hindi film industry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/high-notes-of-holi/article34166077.ece
26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Trailblazer and inspiration||Around midnight on March 20, Laxmipriya Mohapatra, better known as the wife of Odissi legend Kelucharan Mohapatra, passed away in Bhubaneswar. She was 93 and had stopped dancing several decades ago. Yet, the news of her death was mourned by lovers of Odissi across the globe. She was cremated with full State honours. Laxmipriya’s identity was not just as the wife of Kelucharan; she made history when she became the first dancer to perform Odissi on stage, and Kelucharan would often acknowledge her inspiring presence in his life and art. Much before her celebrated husband embarked on his dance journey, Laxmipriya had established herself as a star dancer at the famous Annapurna Theatre in Puri. Driven by poverty, her actress-mother Tulasi Devi had sent her to the theatre when Laxmipriya was just seven. At 17, she moved from Puri to Cuttack, the cultural capital of Odisha. Here, she got an opportunity to share the stage with her future husband when the two acted in a play in which Laxmipriya performed the role of Mohini while Kelucharan was Mahadev. Historic solo performance It was followed by her historic solo Odissi presentation, the first of its kind, in 1946, accompanied by Kelucharan on the mardal. Her stunning performance of this new dance form — yet to be named ‘Odissi’ — captivated audiences so much that there would be queues to buy tickets to watch the dancer. The late and eminent actor-dancer Minati Mishra talked on many occasions about how as a child she had watched Laxmipriya dance and been motivated to learn Odissi. Two other exponents — Priyambada Mohanty Hejmadi and Kumkum Mohanty, both from Cuttack, were equally inspired by Laxmipriya, who was instrumental in encouraging girls from educated and established families to train in Odissi. Also proficient in folk and tribal dances, Laxmipriya performed these at Republic Day parades in New Delhi in the early 1950s. With her strong foundation in theatre, she acted in a number of classic Odia films. She guided and supported Kelucharan during his formative years as a choreographer. “Guruji would keenly observe her moves and expressions and include them in his choreography,” recalls Kumkum Mohanty. “He would insist on his wife’s presence when he worked on a new piece. He valued her inputs immensely,” says Pranati Mohanty, a senior disciple of the couple. “Kelucharan admired her beauty and talent since he first saw her dancing. He had been by her side, as a dance partner as well as a trusted friend. Laxmipriya was and continues to be his inspiration even after 50 years,” wrote Ileana Citaristi, Kelucharan’s distinguished disciple and biographer, two decades ago in her book, The Making of a Guru . Though a highly accomplished artiste, Laxmipriya decided to step back from performances to take care of the family and support her husband. She was instrumental in building Srjan, the famed institution that Guru Kelucharan established in Bhubaneswar, which has groomed dancers across the globe.

26 March 2021||March 26 2021 00:00 IST,||Stickler for tradition||With the passing of Lalitha, the elder sibling of the Hyderabad Sisters, on March 23 in Hyderabad at the age of 70, the world of classical music has lost a fine artiste. The sisters performed at an online concert, organised by Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram, just three days before Lalitha’s demise. The sabha’s founder Ananda Mohan Voruganti, expressing shock, said that even the accompanying artistes did not know about her ill health. “Haripriya wanted to cancel the event but Lalitha insisted on going ahead,” he recalls. The sisters’ musical journey, which started in 1960 at Sankara Mutt at Nallakunta, Hyderabad, took them around the world. After their first concert in Chennai at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, the sisters also became an integral part of the city’s thriving music scene and were appreciated for upholding the sanctity of the patantharam. Rigorous training Disciples of T.G. Padmanabhan (a direct disciple of Alathur Venkatesa Iyer), Lalitha and Haripriya were drawn to Carnatic music while watching their mother Saroja train under Padmanabhan. In an earlier interview, the sisters confessed to being ‘reluctant musicians’ initially, but they took to it wholeheartedly once the training began. Singing as a duo was not planned either. They underwent rigorous training and developed a manodharma that lent an edge to their music, drawing them huge audiences. The sisters followed the Alathur bani that is marked by clarity in rendition. Most of their students are carrying forward this style.  Says D. Seshachari, of the Hyderabad Brothers, “Lalitha would diligently write down notations the day before a concert and rehearse with her sister. Their thorough preparation is what used to make their concerts appealing.” Seshachari and his brother Raghavachari knew the sisters since childhood. Strict disciplinarian “Since we also perform as a duo, we used to discuss technique and approach, and share our concert experiences. Lalitha’s demise is a personal loss for us. Though an extremely affectionate person, she was a strict disciplinarian,” says Seshachari. Hailing Lalitha’s service to the field of Carnatic music, Y. Rama Prabha, secretary and former principal, Andhra Mahila Sabha College of Fine Arts, says that while training the next generation of singers, the Hyderabad Sisters were like a bridge between the past and the future. “Their excellent coordination while singing on stage, time management and their approach towards fulfilling their responsibilities were exemplary,” adds Rama Prabha, who became acquainted with Lalitha during their many travels abroad. “Music is bhava, raga, tala pradhanam, and the Hyderabad Sisters’ concerts were exactly that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/stickler-for-tradition/article34166089.ece

26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Maintain status quo on supply of Yamuna water’||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the States of Haryana and Punjab and the Bhakra Beas Management Board to maintain status quo in the supply of water to Delhi till March 26. A Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde passed the order on a plea filed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) alleging that Haryana would cut 20% of its water supply to Delhi due to repair work in one of its canals. Appearing for the DJB, senior advocate A.M. Singhvi and advocate Gautam Narayan, said it had asked them to defer the work as any substantial reduction in the water supply in the peak of summer would affect the national capital badly. Mr. Singhvi said both the ‘aam admi Delhi’ and the ‘Lutyens Delhi’ would be equally starved of water if supply is cut. He said the court could even appoint a court commissioner to conduct a field inspection of the “repair work”. Mr. Singhvi said the DJB is not against the conduct of the repair work, but was only saying that it should be done in the monsoon or in autumn and not in summer. Senior advocate Vikas Singh said the water level has come down six feet. Senior advocate for Haryana, Shyam Divan, denied the board’s allegations. “The full and complete supply is being given to Delhi... not a drop less. A series of wrong statements are being made. Levels are being maintained,” Mr. Divan objected. The court said it would not know till it gets a complete picture on the nature of the repairs. Chief Justice Bobde, however, said the issue is matter of access to clean water, which is a fundamental right. The court agreed to hear the case on March 26 on an urgent basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/maintain-status-quo-on-supply-of-yamuna-water/article34166202.ece
26 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Maintain status quo on supply of Yamuna water’||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed governments of Punjab, Haryana and others to maintain status quo on supply of Yamuna water to Delhi till tomorrow. The apex court was hearing an application filed by Delhi Jal Board (DJB) which has sought directions to the Haryana government to cease the discharge of untreated pollutants into the Yamuna and release sufficient water to the national capital. File responses A Bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde issued notices to Haryana, Punjab and Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) and asked them to file their responses on the application by Friday. Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, appearing for the DJB, said that the water level has fallen in the national capital. Senior lawyer Shyam Divan, appearing for Haryana, said that full level of water supply has been made. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who also appeared in the matter, said that a court commissioner should be appointed to verify the water level. Mr. Divan said no application has been filed for the appointment of court commissioner in the matter. “This is about the fundamental right to water. We will not go into technical issue whether court commissioner can be appointed only after the application. If the need arises, we can appoint it,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian. Advocate Gautam Narayan, who also appeared for DJB, argued that Haryana says they are doing some repair work. Mr. Singhvi said that canal repair works should not be done in the months of March and April when the water demand is at its peak. He said DJB had written several letters last month to Haryana on the issue but has not received any reply. “We have two crore urban population. We have Lutyens Delhi, we have Aam Aadmis. This will cut down 25% water supply,” he said. The Bench, while issuing notice on the application, said it would hear the matter on Friday.  We have two crore urban population.

Mr. Kishor, a poll-strategist, who had recently joined Capt. Singh as his principal advisor, on March 24 held a meeting with first time Congress legislators to take feedback surrounding various political issues in their constituencies. Former Minister and senior Shiromani Akali Dal leader Daljit Singh Cheema asserted that the role of Congress president in the State has been ‘outsourced’ and hence incumbent president Sunil Jakhar should step down. The BJP State chief Ashwani Sharma termed the hiring of Mr. Kishor by the Congress as a sign of ‘nervousness’ in the run up to the Assembly polls. “The Punjab Chief Minister has outsourced the job of party president to his new advisor PK. He is holding meetings with elected MLAs of Congress party and formulating election strategy. It will be better for Sunil Jakhar to step down to uphold the dignity of the post of party President,” said Mr. Daljit Singh.  ‘Nervous, desperate’ Mr. Sharma said by bringing in Mr. Kishor, the ruling Congress party has admitted that the party is “nervous and desperate” to face the upcoming Assembly elections. “The Congress government in the last four years has miserably failed on all fronts and has hired Mr. Kishor to bail it out of the mess it has created by non-governance in the State,” said Mr. Sharma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-oppn-takes-a-dig-at-cong-over-kishor-meet/article34165819.ece
26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Wanted criminal, accomplice arrested after brief encounter||One of the top 10 rewarded criminals and his accomplice were arrested after a brief of exchange of fire near Bhairon Marg, police said on Thursday. In a rare instance, a woman Sub Inspector was also a part of this operation. Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Shibesh Singh said that the accused have been identified as Rohit Chaudhary and his associate Praveen alias Titu, both residents of south Delhi’s Aya Nagar. A reward of Rs. 3.5 lakh and Rs. 2 lakh was announced on Chaudhary and Praveen’s arrest respectively by Delhi Police and Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 25,000 by U.P. Police. The accused are involved in cases of murder, kidnapping for ransom, and MCOC Act among others. Police said that an information was received that Chaudhary and Praveen would come near Bhairon Marg, after which a team including Sub Inspector Priyanka was formed and a trap was laid. A car was then spotted coming towards the police barricades. It then crashed and stopped. Occupants of the car fired at the police party but their bulletproof jackets saved them. Police also retaliated and fired at the accused who got hit in the legs and sustained injuries. Fake identities During a search of the vehicle, several fake identities and mobile phones and dongles were recovered. Accused were using fake identities to stay in different hotels at different locations. Mobile phones and dongles were used for communicating with other gang members through internet calling applications, police said. Talking about a woman officer being part of the encounter team, Mr. Singh said that a MCOCA case was registered against Chaudhary in October last year and she has been working on the case since. “The Sub Inspector is technologically sound and she has done a great job in tracking the accused. Her inputs were valuable and it was only fair and important that she was a part of the team at all times”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/wanted-criminal-accomplice-arrested-after-brief-encounter/article34166208.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Urvija Goel said that the accused has been identified as Varun Arora, who allegedly killed his mother-in-law Anita Sharma and sister-in-law Priyanka. His wife Divya is in coma and his father-in-law Devendra Mohan Sharma and their house help have been diagnosed with thallium poisoning. The police said that on Monday they were informed that a woman named Anita Sharma, a resident of Inder Puri, had been declared dead at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and the doctors had stated that the death was caused due to poisoning by thallium which was detected in her blood and urine. The role of his son-in-law was suspected in the poisoning. The police said that during inquiry, it was found that Divya was admitted in the ICU of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and was on ventilator support, undergoing treatment for thallium poisoning. During further probe, it was revealed that Priyanka had died during treatment at BL Kapoor Hospital on February 15 and doctors had detected symptoms of thallium poisoning in her, like hair loss and burning feet syndrome. Divya’s father was also found to have symptoms of thallium poisoning while the house help had undergone treatment at RML Hospital for similar symptoms, the police said. During investigation, it was found that in January-end, Varun had visited them and cooked fish for the family which he neither ate nor let his twin children eat, the police said. He had mixed the toxin in it and fed them. He was arrested after a murder case was registered. Subsequently, thallium was recovered from his house in Greater Kailash. It was revealed that he had ordered it online. ‘Humiliation’ During interrogation, he told the police that he wanted to avenge his “humiliation”. His wife got pregnant around the same time as his father had died and he believed his father had come back in the form of the child. However, Divya developed complications and doctors advised her not to go ahead with the pregnancy, following which she got the child aborted with the help of her family but against the wishes of Varun.

26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||DMRC will intensify drive to contain spread of COVID-19||In view of surge in COVID-19 cases, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday said that it will intensify its drive to ensure compliance of social distancing, wearing of masks and thermal screening, among other pandemic-related protocol. It said that commuters, who are found flouting norms, will be penalised. The DMRC said that as part of intensified measures for controlling the spread of the virus, entry at stations will be regulated based on social distancing. DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said: “Entry will be regulated at stations especially at major ones and interchange ones like Rajiv Chowk, Central Secretariat, Barakhamba Road, Patel Chowk, ITO, etc. during morning and evening peak hours. While waiting in the queue, passengers will be strictly required to wait on marked circles or stripes to ensure social distancing.” “If it is found that the distancing is not followed at stations, entry gates will be closed for passengers at those stations until the distancing is ensured,” Mr. Dayal said. Officials added that the DMRC will approach the district administration to facilitate necessary assistance in ensuring social distancing and maintaining law and order outside metro stations. The number of flying squads inside trains will also be increased, to ensure strict compliance of COVID-19 protocols, officials said. “The frequency of checking drives is being increased to ensure that the safety protocol is strictly adhered to by passengers and offenders will be penalised on the spot,” officials said. According to data provided by the DMRC, nearly 24,000 commuters have been fined since metro operations resumed in September last year. This year saw 3,131 people being fined in January, followed by 2,823 in February and 1,833 till March 15, for flouting COVID-19 norms. The highest number of commuters fined in a month was 5,645 in October last year, followed by 5,180 in September 2020. “Due to strict reinforcement of social distancing norms, passengers are advised to plan their journey in advance and allow for additional time of 20 to 30 minutes for their commute. If possible, off peak hour travel may also be opted by those who have flexibility to avoid overcrowding or long wait during peak hours,” the DMRC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dmrc-will-intensify-drive-to-contain-spread-of-covid-19/article34166214.ece

Before 1980s, the memorandum stated, the liquor trade in Delhi was in the hands of private traders and was taken over by the government due to regular complaints over sale of spurious liquor and mishaps. The proposed decision to open liquor shops was not in public interest and likely to disturb law and order situation, the memorandum stated.

26 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Constable traces 63 children in 3 months||After the Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of Delhi Police failed to trace an intellectually disabled minor girl, who had gone missing from Rithala metro station in 2017, Delhi Police Head Constable Seema took it upon herself to find her. Last month, her investigative skills and perseverance bore fruits as she found the child from a shelter home in east Delhi. This is one of the many successes that Ms. Seema, who goes only by her first name, has to her credit. She was transferred to Metro Unit in July 2020 and has traced 63 missing children in the last three months, reuniting them to their families. Going beyond her routine policing duties, she collects details of missing children from Zonal Integrated police Network (ZIPNET) registered at other police stations in the city and traced them. “I have been to Bihar, Meerut, Haryana and many other cities to trace missing children. Of these 63, 16 were children below eight years and the rest were under 14,” said Ms. Seema. Difficult task It was never an easy task and due to her busy schedule and other reasons, the investigation took a backseat occasionally. But she decided to pick up such cases after going through their details from ZIPNET. Interestingly, all the cases she has solved so far were not registered with the unit she is posted in. “I will thank my seniors who provided all kind of support to volunteer service to trace missing children,” she added. Ms. Seema said that many were traced to shelter homes or found in slums. The children were traced after door-to-door search, technical surveillance and coordinating with police departments of other States. Jitendra Mani, DCP (Metro), said that tracing missing children has been Delhi Police’s priority and when Ms. Seema showed her interest in pursuing the task while carrying on regular duties, he appreciated her dedication and helped her in every possible way. An inspiration “She is an inspiration for other police personnel in the unit. In total, the metro unit has traced around 100 children, including the ones she had traced. So, she has single-handedly solved more than half the cases registered here,” Ms. Mani added. In August last year, Delhi Commissioner of Police S.N. Shrivastava had issued directions and laid down an action plan for tracing missing children and reuniting them with families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/constable-traces-63-children-in-3-months/article34166212.ece
26 March 2021||Patna,||LJP seeks explanation from party MLA||Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party on Thursday sought explanation from its lone MLA in Bihar Raj Kumar Singh for voting in favour of JD(U) candidate Maheshwar Hazari in Deputy Speaker’s election. Hazari was elected Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday, polling 124 votes against zero scored by the opposition Grand Alliance which kept away from the House in protest against eviction of their members from the Assembly by the police when they were agitating against the police Bill on Tuesday. LJP’s national secretary general Abdul Khaliq served a letter to Mr. Singh, an MLA from Matihani constituency in Begusarai district, asking him to explain his side immediately for supporting the JD(U) candidate. Party’s Bihar unit spokesman confirmed issuance of letter to the legislator. The matter has caused severe embarassment for the LJP whose president Chirag Paswan had fought the recent Bihar polls on its own with the intent to ensure defeat of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s party.  ‘No consultation’ “The party has learnt that you have voted in favour of JD(U) candidate Maheshwar Hazari during election held for the post of Bihar Legislative Assembly’s Deputy Speaker on March 24 without consulting the party in this regard,” Mr. Khaliq said in the letter. “Such an act is not expected from you. Taking the matter seriously, the party directs you to give your ‘explanation’ immediately in this regard,” the letter further said without specifying any time-frame.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ljp-seeks-explanation-from-party-mla/article34165822.ece
26 March 2021||SIVASAGAR,||Future meets past for jailed present in Sibsagar||The 18th century Rangghar, considered Asia’s oldest amphitheatre, is more than just a landmark in eastern Assam’s Sivasagar. It symbolises Assamese cultural pride, was witness to the birth of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom in April 1979 and most recently, the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The only posters near this centrepiece of Ahom architecture are of Raijor Dal (RD), one of two new regional political parties sired by the violent anti-CAA movement that landed its president Akhil Gogoi in jail 15 months ago. The posters display Mr. Gogoi along with Lurinjyoti Gogoi, president of Assam Jatiya Parishad, the other party forged in the anti-CAA fire. A team of volunteers, many of them college and university students are armed with Mr. Gogoi’s posters and cut-outs as they fan out of an unused Naga cuisine restaurant turned party office located 5 km from Rangghar to seek votes for their jailed leader. “It’s tough campaigning without our candidate in person. The BJP and the Congress are trying to take advantage by telling people that a candidate absent before election will not be seen after. But our volunteers are making people understand that he has been kept out of campaigning deliberately,” Bedabrata Gogoi, a Jawaharlal Nehru University student handling the RD chief’s campaign told The Hindu .  Sympathy votes RD also hopes Priyada Gogoi, Akhil Gogoi’s 84-year-old mother would help garner the sympathy votes. Protim Sharma, a college teacher and political commentator, said the candidature of Akhil Gogoi — accused of ties with Maoist — has rejuvenated the Left-leaning voters of Sibsagar. The constituency used to be a CPI stronghold before former Assembly Speaker Pranab Gogoi made it a Congress bastion since 2001. Congress candidate Subhramitra Gogoi, a newcomer who has the responsibility of defending the seat for the party, brushes aside the challenge from the jailed leader. “He is not a major factor. He may gain sympathy from some, but most people here do not trust him,” he said. The BJP’s Surabhi Rajkonwari, who had lost the 2016 election narrowly to Pranab Gogoi, welcomed the RB president’s “graduation” from “street andolan (agitation)” to electoral politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/future-meets-past-for-jailed-present-in-sibsagar/article34165817.ece

26 March 2021||New Delhi,||HC rejects plea against grooming brand trademark||The Delhi High Court has refused to entertain a petition, which objected to a men’s grooming brand’s proposed trademark reading “not tested on animals only on rascals”. Justice Prateek Jalan said he did not find anything objectionable in the trademark. The High Court cautioned the petitioner for filing a frivolous petition and wasting the judicial time. The petitioner sought rejection of trademark application for all products bearing words “not tested on animals only on rascals” under the brand name “Ustraa” on the ground that the word ‘rascal’ was objectionable and uncivilised and it cannot be used to sell, trade or promote a product. The plea claimed that the punchline was more offensive as it has the trade dress with a turbaned pictograph implying men of a particular community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-rejects-plea-against-grooming-brand-trademark/article34166205.ece

26 March 2021||New Delhi,||BJP welcomes passage of GNCTD Bill||The BJP welcomed the passage of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Bill, 2021 stating that it would improve the administrative system in the Capital. The Delhi government had “hurt the image of the national capital” by bringing “unconstitutional Bills” in the Assembly, the BJP alleged. Health Minister Satyendar Jain alleged the BJP had time and again insulted the Constitution. And by passing the GNCTD Bill, they had murdered its spirit. “They have insulted people's right to vote. Their aim is to gain power by any means. But we will continue to fight,” he tweeted. “Why are you nervous Arvind Kejriwal? You are afraid this [the passage of the Bill] will ensure that all your secrets are out in the open,” Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-welcomes-passage-of-gnctd-bill/article34165824.ece
