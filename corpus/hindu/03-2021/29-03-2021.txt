29 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Co-WIN upgraded, 1 cr. can register for jab daily||The Co-WIN platform, for COVID-19 vaccination registration, has been ramped up to accept one crore registrations and record vaccination of 50 lakh persons daily, said R.S. Sharma, Chairman, Empowered Group on COVID-19 vaccination .  Mr. Sharma said the system has been geared up to accommodate the registration rush and vaccination load anticipated from April 1, when vaccination will be offered to everyone above 45. The system on Sunday showed over 6 crore registration. “Upgrading the system is a continuous process and with the increase in load, the system has been acclimatised to take on the load that is expected. We have seen the trends so far and the number of people seeking the vaccine has grown. The system is operating at four levels — the one that is open to public (for registration), the verification level, platform management (open to hospitals giving the vaccine) and the certificate generation,” Mr. Sharma said. Stating that this “100% government-run” system is equipped to offer privacy, Mr. Sharma, however, admitted that there were reports of errors in registration from several parts of the country. ‘Only basic details’ “During self-registration and spot registration we are seeking only three basic information — name, gender and the year of birth. We expect that this will be provided correctly by the beneficiaries,” he said. Mr. Sharma added that currently Co-WIN does not schedule the second dose vaccination appointment automatically and beneficiaries are to schedule this as per the recommended gap between the two doses. 62, 714 cases India registered 62,714 new cases and 312 deaths in the 24 hours till 8 a.m on Sunday. This is the highest daily death toll since December 25, when 336 deaths were reported. Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu — accounted for 81.46% of the new cases, a Health Ministry statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/co-win-upgraded-1-cr-can-register-for-jab-daily/article34186493.ece
29 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Rajnath, Yechury spar over Kerala probe||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday clashed over the Kerala government’s decision to institute a judicial inquiry against Central agencies investigating the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case. Both leaders were in Kerala for electioneering and met the press separately. Mr. Singh said the LDF government’s move was unconstitutional in bringing the Central law enforcement agencies within the ambit of a judicial commission of inquiry. It reflected a certain uneasiness that the investigative and regulatory agencies were edging closer to the truth, he said, adding that the bogey of a judicial probe would not deter them. Mr. Yechury countered Mr. Singh and said the States were well within their rights to limit cooperation with the Central government on issues that infringed on their constitutional rights. “The Defence Minister must re-read the Constitution. No Central agency can interfere or work in any State without the concurrence of the State concerned. If the State is not willing to give the concurrence, then it has to get a judicial intervention. It cannot be a direct intervention like what is being done now.” The LDF government’s decision on Friday to set a panel to probe the alleged jurisdictional overreach and political bias of Central agencies has reignited the debate on the BJP-led administration’s perceived trespasses on federalism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rajnath-yechury-spar-over-kerala-probe/article34186495.ece
29 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Man accused under U.P. conversion law gets bail||A Muslim man from Kannauj, who was jailed under Uttar Pradesh’s strict anti-conversion law in December 2020 on charges of allegedly hiding his identity to marry a Hindu woman, has been granted bail by the Allahabad High Court. The Hindu woman submitted an affidavit to the district police supporting the case of her husband. Mohammad Taufiq Khan was accused by the father of the woman, Priya Verma, of hiding his identity and going under a false name to trap her in love, for marriage. Woman’s father A case was registered against Mr. Khan under Section 3/5 of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. Sections 419 (cheating for impersonation), 420 (cheating), 496 and 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC were also slapped against him on the complaint of the woman’s father Subash Chandra Verma. Mr. Khan’s counsel submitted that the woman was born in 1991, and that she and the accused had been in a relationship for the last three to four years and performed their marriage on their own will as per Hindu rites and rituals. Mr. Khan also said he never pressurised Ms. Verma to change her religion. The woman’s counsel submitted in court that she had filed an affidavit before the Superintendent of Police Kannauj supporting Mr. Khan. She said she was in a relationship with him and performed marriage on her own will. Justice Neeraj Tiwari granted bail to Mr. Khan in an order dated March 18. Enticement case In another case, two women from Prayagraj who were arrested along with a Korean national and an Indian man on charges of allegedly trying to entice two Hindu women to convert to Christianity in Gautam Buddha Nagar were also granted bail by the court. In an order dated March 23, Seema and Sandhya were granted bail by Justice Vivek Varma. South Korean national Minkaygali alias Anmol and three others, Seema, Sandhya and Umesh Kumar of Prayagraj, have been in jail since December 20, 2020. The complainant Anita Sharma, who worked as a security guard but had to leave her job due to illness, claimed the accused approached her during the COVID-19 lockdown and offered her money if she removed images of Hindu gods and goddesses from her house.

Another given bail In another case, on March 19, a Bench of Justice Pankaj Bhatia granted bail to a Muslim woman in Etah who was a co-accused in an FIR lodged under kidnapping, criminal conspiracy and Section 5 (1) of the new ordinance. While pleading for bail, the counsel for the accused Nisha Naaj of Jalesar said that she had given birth to twins six months ago and was lodged in jail since December 2020. “No useful purpose would be served in keeping the applicant in custody at the cost of her two minor children,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/man-accused-under-up-conversion-law-gets-bail/article34186957.ece
29 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre mulls unique ID for all plots of land by March 2022||The Centre plans to issue a 14-digit identification number to every plot of land in the country within a year. It will subsequently integrate its land records database with revenue court records and bank records, as well as Aadhaar numbers on a voluntary basis, according to a Parliamentary Standing Committee report submitted to the Lok Sabha last week. The Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) scheme has been launched in 10 States this year and will be rolled out across the country by March 2022, the Department of Land Resources told the Standing Committee on Rural Development. An official, who did not wish to be named, described it as “the Aadhaar for land” — a number that would uniquely identify every surveyed parcel of land and prevent land fraud, especially in rural India, where land records are outdated and disputed. The identification will be based on the longitude and latitude of the land parcel, and is dependent on detailed surveys and geo-referenced cadastral maps, according to a presentation by the Department in September 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/unique-id-for-all-land-parcels-by-march-2022-says-centre/article34186496.ece
29 March 2021||Bengaluru,||COVID-19 cases: Ministers to meet BSY today||In the light of COVID-19 cases crossing the 3,000 mark in the State, a few senior Ministers will meet Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday to seek stricter implementation of restrictions or imposing additional restrictions to prevent the rapid spread of the virus, especially in Bengaluru. Ahead of the meeting on Monday, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar met Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai. “The mutated virus is spreading fast. While it was around 300 cases daily four weeks ago, it has now reached 3,000 daily. This is a 10-time increase. I feel the current restrictions are not enough,” Dr. Sudhakar told presspersons here on Sunday. Dr. Sudhakar said that if stricter measures were not put in place, hospitals would be under stress with increased load if cases rose in the State. “With the increasing number of cases, the number of deaths will also proportionally increase. It will be difficult then,” he warned. The next six to eight weeks, Dr. Sudhakar said, was very crucial in the spread of the virus, and that the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) had also felt the same. “The Chief Minister’s attention will be drawn to the suggestions given by the TAC and other related issues.” “There has to be stricter vigil in border areas for the movement of people. Stricter vigil has to be there for those coming to Bengaluru. The Home Minister also concurred with my views,” he said, adding that they would apprise the Chief Minister about the current situation and possible steps to be initiated. Besides Dr. Sudhakar, Mr. Bommai, Revenue Minister R. Ashok, and Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar are expected to meet the Chief Minister. Providing details of the meeting with the Home Minister, Dr. Sudhakar said: “In the nearly two-hour- long meeting, we discussed the further action to be taken by the Home department and how it has to be implemented.” He said that the daily reported cases in Maharashtra had increased between 36,000 and 38,000 cases. Asked if there was any proposal to seal the State border, the Minister said that there were strict guidelines from the Centre not to seal the borders. “We will have to ensure that those travelling carry RT-PCR test negative report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-cases-ministers-to-meet-bsy-today/article34186539.ece
29 March 2021||New Delhi,||HC denies relief to residents living in ‘extended area’ of Bhati village||The Delhi High Court has ruled that there is nothing to substantiate the claim by those residing at Extended Lal Dora Abadi of Bhati village here that they are all original inhabitants. Demolition issue Justice Jayant Nath also vacated the court’s November 18, 2019 order asking the authorities to maintain status quo with regard to any decision on demolition in the village situated in south Delhi’s notified Ridge area. The HC order came on a plea filed by Bari Bhati and Chhoti Bhati Residents’ Welfare Association which claimed that the occupants of Extended Lal Dora Abadi of Bhati village are all original inhabitants, descended from a common ancestor. The association also sought to settle the rights of the inhabitants of the village as “other traditional forest dwellers” in accordance with the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. Their plea stated that the inhabitants of Bhati village are of Gurjar tribe, which is a traditional herder community engaged in cow-herding and sheep rearing. Only a small portion of village land was cultivated to grow grain for sale/consumption. The plea said this is the last village situated on the border of Delhi adjacent to the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary and it continues to have the status of a forest village. They stated that as the village population increased, there was no alternative for the villagers but to build their houses on the common lands adjoining the Old Lal Dora Abadi. They claimed that this was a natural growth of the village and the residents only comprised original inhabitants of the village. They also claimed that the Extended Lal Dora Abadi of Bhati village is under process of regularisation as it is to be treated as a natural extension of the village abadi. Justice Nath, however, rejected the plea noting that the Supreme Court has in its January 1996 judgment categorically held that the area in question is Ridge area and no cultivation or any type of construction can be permitted there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-denies-relief-to-residents-living-in-extended-area-of-bhati-village/article34186955.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikram Amte maintained that no such incident like throwing footwear or stones over the vehicle happened. He, however, said further action would be taken in case anything of that sort had happened based on detailed verification of the video footage. As Mr. Shivakumar was scheduled to visit Belagavi, the home district of Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi, to a hold series of meetings and to take part in the nomination filing by Congress candidate Satish Jarkiholi, a large number of Congress workers had gathered near Sambra Airport on Sunday. However, several supporters of Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi too had gathered to stage a black flag protest against Mr. Shivakumar. Trouble started after some of the protesters, who raised “go back” slogans, managed to come on the road to block Mr. Shivakumar’s vehicle. Although the police thwarted their attempt, a gunman who tried to disperse the crowd was manhandled by them, subsequently forcing him to flee the scene on a motorcycle. As the vehicles passed by, some protesters reportedly threw stones and footwear over them. The police then resorted to caning to disperse the crowd and restore normality. Earlier at the airport, Mr. Shivakumar welcomed the protest and said such a grand welcome would further boost the party’s strength. He even ridiculed that the welcome was being accorded for the great work done, without naming anyone. ‘BJP’s failure’ Mr. Shivkumar told presspersons that people would consider the BJP’s alleged failure to respond to their problems while choosing their representative. Despite the BJP having 25 MPs, they had failed to raise issues concerning the State, he alleged. “Mr. Satish Jarkiholi is a humble politician. We all should together send him to Parliament and we will work towards ensuring his victory,” he said. He said the election was unwarranted, but the demise of Suresh Angadihad necessitated it. The Congress would showcase its unity and strength in the byelection and all would together work to ensure Mr. Satish Jarkiholi’s victory, he said. Meanwhile, the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah condemned the attack on the convoy of Mr. Shivakumar. “I condemn the act of stone pelting by followers of Mr. Ramesh Jharkiholi on the vehicles of Mr. Shivakumar. This is a BJP- sponsored act. People of Karnataka will not let this go,” he said in a tweet. “If there is no security to the State president of the Opposition party in the BJP-ruled State, then what is the fate of the common man? The failure of the Belagavi police seems to be a reflection of the aspersion cast on the Karnataka police by the lady in the alleged sex CD of Mr. Jharkiholi,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cd-scam-shivakumar-faces-protests-in-belagavi/article34186410.ece
29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Trinamool accuses EC of bias||Calling the Election Commission order relaxing the rule for the appointment of polling agents “arbitrary, motivated and biased”, the Trinamool Congress has written to the Commission, urging it to withdraw the order. According to a March 2009 rule, polling agents who are appointed by the contesting candidates shall have to be electors in the same polling stations or from neighbouring polling stations falling in the same constituency. However, the provision was amended recently to allow an elector from any part of an Assembly constituency to be appointed a polling agent. The Trinamool claimed that this change was brought about on the directions of the BJP. The party also released an alleged conversation between BJP leader Mukul Roy and another BJP functionary, where the Trinamool claims that this was discussed. The Trinamool said that no other party was consulted. The commission, the Trinamool alleged, changed the rule based on inputs and for the convenience of the candidates. ‘Ambiguous reasoning’ “Such reasoning is not only ambiguous in nature but also leads us to a conclusion that it has been implemented to help certain political parties, namely the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), due to them not possessing the strength to muster enough polling agents,” the party alleged in a letter to the EC dated March 26. It released the letter on Sunday. The party claimed that the new instructions were made with a “mala fide intention” to benefit the BJP candidates . “Such instruction passed by the Election Commission of India just before the scheduled date of election to take place in West Bengal is arbitrary, motivated and biased,” it alleged, and urged the Commission to withdraw the direction and restore the earlier rule. A delegation led by MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay had on Saturday raised the issue at a meeting with Chief Electoral Officer Aariz Aftab in Kolkata.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-accuses-ec-of-bias/article34186435.ece
29 March 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra CM calls for lockdown plan||In view of the sharp rise in fresh COVID-19 cases, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, on the recommendation of the State COVID-19 task force, asked officials to prepare a plan for implementation of a lockdown which will have minimum impact on the economy, an official release said. In a meeting held with Health Minister Rajesh Tope, the Chief Minister reviewed health infrastructure, including availability of beds, oxygen and medicines, in the State to treat COVID-19 patients. The task force then recommended that the State government implement measures such as a stricter lockdown to stem the spread. The Chief Minister asked officials to prepare a detailed plan. “There should not be any kind of confusion among the people once a lockdown is announced,” the Chief Ministar said. Maharashtra has seen a steep rise in COVID-19 cases since the last week. As many as one lakh new infections were added to the State’s tally during the period. “24,619 cases had been reported on a single day in September, 2020. However, on March 27 this year, the State reported 35,726 new cases in a day,” the release said. The State government imposed a ban on gatherings of five or more persons at night beginning March 28. On Saturday, the government also announced a ban on all types of gatherings, including political and religious events. It also ordered that restaurants, gardens and malls would remain shut between 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. beginning Saturday night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-cm-calls-for-lockdown-plan/article34186439.ece

29 March 2021||New Delhi,||NRC-excluded to get rejection slips||The Centre has told the Assam government that “rejection slips” to those excluded from the final National Register of Citizens (NRC) published in 2019 should be issued immediately. More than 19 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants in Assam were left out of the final register that took five years to be compiled and cost Rs. 1,220 crore. The office of the Registrar General of India (RGI) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) wrote to Assam Home Secretary S.R. Bhuyan on March 23 that the supplementary list of exclusions and inclusions were published on August 31, 2019 on the directions of the Supreme Court. “However, the process of issuing rejection slips to those excluded from the NRC is yet to start.” The MHA had earlier said that “non-inclusion of a person’s name in the NRC does not by itself amount to him/her being declared as a foreigner” as they would be given adequate opportunity to present their case before the Foreigners Tribunals (FTs). The time limit to appeal before the FTs, the quasi judicial bodies unique to Assam, has been increased from 60 to 120 days. Assam is the only State where an NRC was compiled under the supervision of the top court.  “In a meeting held under the chairmanship of the Union Home Secretary on February 22, 2020 it was decided that the rejection slip for the cases which are correct may be issued to the persons left out of the supplementary list of inclusion and exclusion immediately and cases where mismatch in results recorded in hard copy and entered in computer has been found by the SCNR [State coordinator, National Registration] may be referred to the concerned deputy commissioners for clarifications,” the letter by Jaspal Singh, Joint Director, office of the RGI, said. The State Coordinator of the NRC is a secretary rank officer of the Assam government who assists the RGI. Several meetings The letter added that the NRC coordination committee has been insisting since its meetings held on January 30, 2020 and July 2, 2020 to complete the activities under the approved budget of Rs. 1,602 crore. The letter mentions that the State coordinator of the NRC in the July 2 meeting had mentioned that rejection slips would be issued by the end of December 2020. The BJP-ruled Assam government has rejected the NRC in its current form and demanded re-verification of 30% of names included in the NRC in areas bordering Bangladesh and 10% in remaining State. The Assembly election is under way in Assam and the results are to be announced on May 2. According to Article 6 of the Constitution, the cut-off date for migration to India from Pakistan is July 19, 1948 whereas according to the 1985 accord, in Assam, that borders Bangladesh, it is March 24, 1971. In the letter, the joint director asked the Assam government to assess the software used for managing the register and discontinue the ones not required. The letter said the State government’s requirement of Rs. 3.22 crore per month for the upkeep of records appeared to be “too high”. It also asked to discontinue the additional staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nrc-excluded-to-get-rejection-slips/article34186456.ece
29 March 2021||KOCHI,||Speaker always tried to get close to me, says Swapna||Swapna Suresh, accused in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, gave a statement to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan had “always kept trying to get close to her and he was in need of the Consul General of UAE for his personal affairs.” The ED had submitted these statements to the Kerala High Court recently. When asked to explain her relationship with Mr. Sreeramakrishnan, Ms. Swapna said she met him for the first time at a function of the UAE Consulate. “He used to send me WhatsApp messages and used to call up frequently,” she said. Ms. Swapna said the Speaker had invited her to his official residence on several occasions. She stated that Mr. Sreeramakrishnan had called her to a flat in Marutham Apartment, Pettah, twice and told that it was his hideout. She stated that she did not agree to his “personal interests.” Ms. Swapna said she met him at the apartment along with Sarith. She said Mr. Sreeramakrishnan handed over a bag to Sarith, another accused in the case, and told him that it contained a packet that was to be handed over safely to the Consul General. He also gave a pen to Sarith, she stated. Sarith, who delivered the packet to the Consul General, said the packet seemed to have currency notes inside. Later, this bag was seized by the Customs from the residence of Sarith, she stated. WhatsApp chat When confronted with her WhatsApp chat with M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, Swapna said she had informed the Chief Minister about the circumstances in which she was forced to resign from the UAE Consulate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/speaker-always-tried-to-get-close-to-me-says-swapna/article34186414.ece
29 March 2021||Chennai,||Pilot unions urge Air India, Ministry to reverse salary cuts||The two pilot unions of national carrier Air India have urged the Minister of Civil Aviation and the airline’s chairman and managing director to roll back the reductions in their salary and reinstate their monthly flying allowances in line with industry standards. Most other airlines in India have scaled back their austerity measures. The appeals were in the form of letters and addressed to Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Air India chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal. In its March 23 letter, the central office of the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), in Chennai — it has six offices — drew the Minister’s attention to the pilots having borne the “brunt of unjust pay cuts with unilateral reductions to wages of approximately 58% from April 2020, and 55% from October 2020”, at a time when Air India has been the only major Indian airline to operate the most number of repatriation flights through the peak of the novel coronavirus pandemic. An aviation industry expert familiar with the context in which the letters were written said that as a breakup, this would work out to a 40% cut on all allowances barring salary which is a small part of the gross package. Allowances form nearly 60% to 70% of the gross pay. Also, instead of the fixed 70 hours payment which is the industry norm, the pilots are being paid based on the actual flying done. In addition, there has been a cut of 40% on the hourly rate payment.  In the case of Air India, the wage cuts applied to pilots in its other airline groups too — its low cost subsidiary, Air India Express which employs about 320 pilots, and its regional airline subsidiary, Alliance Air, with about 210 pilots. Both these airlines have foreign national pilots on their rolls as well. They too have had a pay cut but not to the extent of their Indian counterparts. These two airlines do not have a separate union, but are ICPA members. The key role In the second letter, also dated March 23, the other Air India pilot union, the Indian Pilots Guild, which is based in Mumbai, highlighted the key role the airline had played under the ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ repatriation flight schedule. Citing Civil Aviation Ministry data of March 18, it said Air India had flown 27,50,385 passengers, which is 15,92,072 passengers (inbound) and 11,58,313 passengers (outbound). The IPG, which represents 367 pilots — 342 ordinary members and 25 associate members — and operates most of Air India’s long-haul flights, said that with domestic and international passenger load factors rising, the airline’s operations department had now introduced a revised policy that did away with pre-flight COVID-19 testing to enable better crew utilisation. The aviation expert said the IPG found this to be a cause for concern. Neither the Ministry of Civil Aviation nor the Air India CMD responded to The Hindu ’s emails for their comments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pilot-unions-urge-air-india-ministry-to-reverse-salary-cuts/article34186423.ece
29 March 2021||New Delhi,||BJP will win 26 of 30 seats in Bengal Phase 1: Amit Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that the BJP would win more than 26 seats out of the 30 to which polling was held in Saturday’s first phase of the Assembly election in West Bengal. He said women had voted for the party in large numbers in the State. In Assam, he said, the party would win more than 37 of the 47 seats in the first phase. “I want to thank people in both the States that they voted in favour of the BJP in huge numbers; 84% polling in West Bengal and 79% in Assam shows the huge enthusiasm of voters. The two States were earlier known for poll violence, but polling was peaceful this time. No one was killed,” Mr. Shah said at a press conference at his residence in Delhi. “The voting pattern reflects that people want a protest-free Assam, development-prone Assam. Assam has realised the importance of a double-engine government,” he said. He said West Bengal has been afflicted with appeasement politics and unfettered illegal migration. “The funds for development work was usurped by political parties, the kind of mismanagement during COVID and Amphan was seen... After the 27-year communist rule, it was felt that some transformation will come; however nothing changed under Didi [West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee]; Bengal can develop, without appeasement a government can run, all can get religious freedom,” he said. “We will cross more than 200 seats. In Assam also we will more seats than we have now,” he said. Asked about the high-voltage contest at Nandigram between Ms. Banerjee and BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari, Mr. Shah said, “Nothing special about Nandigram, it is just a seat for us but if Nandigram does it then transformation will come. The maa, maati, maanush (Trinamool slogan) promises have been proved hollow,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-will-win-26-of-30-seats-in-bengal-phase-1-amit-shah/article34186429.ece
29 March 2021||SILCHAR,||A valley divided by the CAA cross-currents||The railway station in Silchar, the political hub of the Bengali-dominated Barak Valley comprising 15 Assembly seats in Assam, is more than a terminal for train travellers. Named Bhasha Shahid Station, it takes the local people back to May 1961 when the police shot down 11 people who protested against the “imposition” of Assamese through legislation in October 1960. The psychological divide between the valley and the Assamese-speaking Brahmaputra Valley has remained since. The BJP claims to have bridged this divide. “We have taken Barak, Brahmaputra, hills, plains along equally,” Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has often said. But the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) appears to have divided the two valleys. While the Brahmaputra Valley has been largely against the law, many in Barak Valley have supported it. The CAA seeks to fast-track the citizenship of non-Muslims who fled religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan and took refuge in India till December 31, 2014. Keen on wresting Barak back from the BJP, which had won eight Hindu-dominated seats in 2016, the Congress appears to have taken a gamble with the “guarantee” of having CAA scrapped if voted to power. The remaining seven seats are Muslim-dominated. “People are gravitating toward Congress because they have called the BJP’s bluff on CAA, which fools Bengali Hindus because of the conditions that come with it,” the party’s pointsperson in Barak and former MP, Sushmita Dev said, adding that the BJP’s avoidance of the CAA in Assam while rooting for it in West Bengal revealed its true face.  Few takers BJP State chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass said the rules of the CAA would be framed after the polls for implementation in the country. But there are few takers in Barak Valley. “CAA will never happen in Assam because the BJP would not like to lose the votes of the Assamese, many of whom are against it. Another factor is Clause 6 of the Assam Accord that guarantees Constitutional safeguards for indigenous communities, and it is unlikely that Bengalis of any religion will be considered indigenous no matter how long they have been living in Assam,” said Kamal Chakraborty of the Unconditional Citizenship Demand Forum. “CAA came as a corollary to the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which did negate the Brahmaputra Valley narrative that there are 1 crore Bangladeshi Hindus. Do you think the 19 lakh excluded from the NRC would have submitted their papers had they not believed they are Indians?” he said. Most agree the CAA and the Hindutva agenda has polarised Barak Valley like never before. “Every action has a reaction. More than one party has turned communal. Where Bengali Hindus and Muslims should have been together on issues of NRC and D (doubtful) voters, they are moving apart. For some, CAA is the dose of reassurance that nothing will happen to them so long they are with a party,” said former MLA Ataur Rahman Mazarbhuiya. The BJP is contesting 14 of the Barak Valley seats and ally AGP is contesting two. They are engaged in a friendly fight in one seat. The Congress and ally All India United Democratic Front, too, would have a friendly fight in one seat, while contesting 10 and four seats individually. The 15 seats are among the 39 going to the polls in the second phase on April 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-valley-divided-by-the-caa-cross-currents/article34186431.ece
29 March 2021||Mumbai,||Sanjay Raut hits out at Anil Deshmukh||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday called Anil Deshmukh an “accidental Home Minister”, claiming that he got the post after senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders like Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil refused the responsibility. Mr. Raut’s remarks came amid speculation that Union Home Minister Amit Shah had met NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel at a top industrialist’s residence in Ahmedabad on Saturday. In his column “Rokhthok” in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana , Mr. Raut also said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra did not have damage control machinery as was seen after former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh claimed that Mr. Deshmukh asked the police to collect Rs. 100 crore a month. “If a junior officer like Sachin Vaze was running a [money] collection racket from the Mumbai Police Commissioner’s office, why was the Home Minister not aware of it? ... Vaze was a mere API in Mumbai police. Who gave him so many powers?” Mr. Raut said. “Deshmukh unnecessarily rubbed some police officials the wrong way. A Home Minister cannot function properly if he gets surrounded by suspicious officers,” he wrote in the column.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sanjay-raut-hits-out-at-anil-deshmukh/article34186441.ece

Three persons sustained injuries, said the police. Project Director Nirman Jambulkar told The Hindu that a span of the elevated road on the highway collapsed near Daultabad village. He said he had directed the contractor to find the exact reasons for the accident. Deputy Commissioner of Police, West, Deepak Saharan, said that three persons were injured and under treatment. In a similar incident, a portion of under-construction elevated road had collapsed on Gurugram-Alwar Highway last year. Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari had inspected the progress of the Dwarka Expressway highway along with Union Minister of State and local MP Rao Inderjit Singh on March 5. During the inspection, the Union Minister was told that 50% of the construction work was completed.

29 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Lighting lamps, clapping encouraged health workers’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his prescription for honouring frontline health workers during the initial days of the lockdown with measures such as banging steel utensils, clapping and lighting a lamp, saying that these went a long way in keeping the spirits up in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking during the 75th edition of ‘Mann ki Baat’ that started in October 2014, Mr. Modi said these expressions of respecting the “corona warriors” kept them going. “You cannot imagine how much it had touched the hearts of corona warriors … and that is the very reason they resolutely held on the whole year, without tiring, without halting. Steadfastly, they endured to save the life of each and every citizen of the country,” he said. The Opposition has often derided these measures. Mr. Modi also appreciated the discipline shown by the country in over a year, beginning with the Janata curfew on March 22 last year. “It was an unprecedented example of discipline; generations to come will certainly feel proud about that,” he said. Noting that around this time last year the question was whether there would be a vaccine for COVID-19 and by when it would be rolled out, the Prime Minister said it was a matter of pride that the world’s largest vaccination drive was under way in India. On agriculture He also spoke about modernisation of the country’s agriculture. “In India’s agriculture sector, modernisation is the need of the hour. It has been delayed and we have already lost a lot of time,” he said. Mr. Modi said in order to create new employment opportunities in the agriculture sector and to increase farmers’ income, it was equally important to adopt new alternatives and innovations along with traditional agricultural practices. His comments on agriculture come at a time when the farmers’ agitation is going on relentlessly with farmers camping at the Delhi border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lighting-lamps-clapping-encouraged-health-workers/article34186452.ece

SKM call On the call of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers’ unions spearheading the agitation against the farm laws, farmers set copies of the laws on fire and demanded that the three legislations be repealed.

Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur border of Delhi with their main demand of complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for the minimum support price on their crops. So far, there have been 11 rounds of talks between the protesting unions and government, but the deadlock has continued as both sides have stuck to their stand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/on-holika-farmers-burn-farm-law-copies/article34186966.ece
29 March 2021||CHENNAI,||‘T.N. has highest revenue deficit among election-bound States’||Tamil Nadu has the highest revenue deficit among the poll-bound States, according to a report. It stood at Rs. 65,994 crore, as per the revised budget estimate for 2020-21. In terms of size of the economy, Tamil Nadu’s economy is the largest among these States (third largest in India), followed by West Bengal (sixth), Kerala (11th), Assam (17th) and Puducherry (26th). Together, they account for around 20% of India’s economy, according to a Care Ratings report on the economic and financial profile of the States and the Union Territories headed for elections. At Rs. 19 lakh crore, Tamil Nadu accounts for 9% of India’s economy, it said. Assam has witnessed a revenue surplus in 2020-21, as per the revised estimates for the year, while Puducherry had a revenue surplus for 2019-20 and is yet to announce the Budget for 2021-22, the report said. The financial position of West Bengal and Kerala is also stressed, with revenue deficit of Rs. 34,345 crore and Rs. 24,206 crore in 2020-21, respectively, the report said. According to the report, Assam has witnessed the highest average economic growth of 8.6% during the four-year period to 2019-20. West Bengal and Puducherry’s economy grew on a par with the national average, while at 6.3%, Kerala’s economic growth was lower than the national average due to the devastating floods of 2018 and 2019. The services sector accounted for 51% or over half of the Tamil Nadu’s economic output, followed by industry (38%) and agriculture (11%) for 2020-21, Care Ratings said. Tamil Nadu’s economic growth averaged 8% from 2016 to 2020, above the national average of 6.7%. Unemployment rate The unemployment rate in Tamil Nadu in February 2021 was 4.8%, lower than the national average of 6.9%, it added. The unemployment rates in other four States were also below the national average, it added. This could be on account of the State-level measures being undertaken to provide employment opportunities to its population. The process has also been driven by the upcoming elections when more effort is put to create jobs, Care said. In February 2021, Tamil Nadu’s inflation stood at 7.2%, above the national average of 5%. The inflation was 4.9% for Kerala, 5.3% for West Bengal, 8% for Puducherry and 6.5% for Assam. Although Tamil Nadu has a high quantum of outstanding debt (Rs. 4.85 lakh crore in FY21), it is perceived as being sustainable as it is within the prudential limit, while debt burden of West Bengal and Kerala are above the limits, the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tn-has-highest-revenue-deficit-among-election-bound-states/article34186433.ece
29 March 2021||New Delhi,||Mamata camps in Nandigram in the final lap to polling||In the high-stakes battle for the Nandigram seat to which polling will be held on April 1, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is camping in the constituency for three days from Sunday, attending seven public meetings and two roadshows. She is facing her erstwhile protege, Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP on the eve of the election, leaving her usual constituency of Bhawanipur. The contest is also for the ownership of the Nandigram agitation against land acquisition by the then Left Front government in 2008-09. Mr. Adhikari was the local Trinamool Congress face of the movement. Her three-day halt in the constituency began with a visit to the Reyapura Shib Mandir Dol Mela followed by a public meeting. She will attend three public rallies and one roadshow each on Monday and Tuesday. The BJP is also pulling out all the stops. Home Minister Amit Shah will address a public meeting here on Tuesday, the last day of campaigning. Ms. Banerjee’s camping in Nandigram has given her political opponent ammunition to question her party’s confidence. Mamata is nervous: BJP The BJP already has been running a campaign about Trinamool’s “nervousness”, releasing an audiotape in which the Chief Minister is reportedly heard asking for help from Proloy Pal, BJP district vice-president. “Mamata Banerjee has always said that she is the candidate for all 294 seats. The fact that she is spending three days in Nandigram betrays her nervousness. Right now, it seems her only priority is to win Nandigram,” said Dinesh Trivedi, a founding member of the Trinamool who joined the BJP last month. The Trinamool, however, says that this is not very unusual and every candidate does this. “It is a pointless argument to ask why she is spending three days in a constituency where she is contesting from. Had she not gone, then these very people would have claimed that she is ignoring Nandigram,” party leader Saugata Roy said. Political researcher Sajjan Kumar said that it would be a very close contest. “By contesting from Nandigram, Mamata Banerjee has scored the perception advantage of owning up the Nandigram movement. Also there is a committed Muslim electorate who are firmly with the Trinamool,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-camps-in-nandigram-in-the-final-lap-to-polling/article34186437.ece
29 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||27 migratory birds found dead at wildlife sanctuary in Himachal||As many as 27 migratory birds have been reported dead on account of avian influenza in the Pong Dam Wildlife Sanctuary area of Himachal Pradesh since March 25, setting off alarm bells and forcing authorities to shut down the sanctuary. Archana Sharma, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife), told The Hindu on Sunday that 14 migratory birds, mostly bar-headed geese, were found dead at the sanctuary on March 25. “Another 12 birds were found dead over the next two days. We have sent the samples to the Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar. Any confirmation about the presence of avian flu could be ascertained only after the reports come,” she said. “At this time of the year, migratory birds are on their way back to their breeding grounds in central Asia. Some of them may be infected because immunity levels are low as they are coming from different wetlands. We are assuming that it could be avian influenza — H5N1 or H5N8 — but until the reports come nothing can be confirmed,” she said. “As a precautionary measure, we have closed the sanctuary area for now. The wildlife wing of the Forest department is working actively to monitor the situation and field staff have been directed to maintain strict vigil and active surveillance on the situation,” added Ms. Sharma. Earlier in January this year, avian influenza (H5N1) led to the death of over 5,000 migratory birds in the Pong Dam Wildlife Sanctuary area in Kangra district of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/27-migratory-birds-found-dead-at-wildlife-sanctuary-in-himachal/article34186454.ece

29 March 2021||Jodhpur (Rajasthan),||Union Minister demands probe into tapping row||Union Minister and BJP leader Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Sunday demanded an investigation into the alleged tapping of phones of politicians amid a rebellion within the State’s ruling Congress last year, and said anyone found guilty should be prosecuted. The episode was an attack on privacy of public representatives and the people of the State, said the Union Minister of Jal Shakti. Talking to reporters here, Mr. Shekhawat said he had filed a complaint with the Delhi police in the matter as he was targeted by the Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government and a case of treason was filed against him by the State’s Special Operation Group (SOG). “Surprisingly, a case was registered for treason against a Union Cabinet Minister, accusing him of trying to topple the State government and (it was) withdrawn in 10 days,” he said, adding that the people and their representatives should know what dawned on the government during that 10-day period. Voice samples “Even after filing the case, many Congress leaders and Ministers said that Gajendra Singh is not giving his voice samples. I want to ask in which case they wanted my voice samples while the case they have referred to has already been withdrawn by them,” the Minister said. He also pulled up the State government for admitting the phone tapping and legitimising it by stating that it was done in compliance with legal procedure. “The Chief Minister, the Chief Secretary and the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) had claimed earlier that no phone tapping ever happened, and now Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal replied in the Assembly that recording was done but legally,” Mr. Shekhawat said. Defending his decision to file a complaint with the police, the Minister said that since these allegations were an “attempt at my character assassination and disturbed my mental peace, I wanted to have these allegations investigated and know whether there was any phone tapping or not and what procedure was followed in it”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/union-minister-demands-probe-into-tapping-row/article34186964.ece
29 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Swapna’s statement sparks war of words||Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan on Sunday reacted sharply to what he termed as attempts on the part of Central agencies to denigrate the LDF government. In a Facebook post, Mr. Sreeramakrishnan said the agencies used cherry-picked portions of deniable statements given by suspects in custody as a guise to tarnish the LDF leadership. He described the tactic as underhand, anti-democratic and politically biased. The UAE gold smuggling case had led to the doorstep of BJP fellow travellers. Hence, the Centre wanted to mislead the public by targeting the LDF government. Central agencies relied on so-called statements of accused persons to hurl accusations against the Chief Minister and the Speaker without an iota of proof. The agencies had timed their leaks to match the election cycle. Voters have recognised the vicious political plot to denigrate the people-friendly government. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Swapna’s statement was shocking. Her account has validated the accusations of the UDF. Swapna had revealed that the Speaker owned a flat in the capital in the name of a benami. She also deposed that a cabal led by the Chief Minister’s former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar and Additional Private Secretary Raveendran controlled the government. They did everything with the concurrence of the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/swapnas-statement-sparks-war-of-words/article34186853.ece
29 March 2021||Kozhikode,||Opposition misleading poll panel, says Pinarayi||The war of words between Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the Opposition over the distribution of social welfare pension and food kits ahead of the Assembly polls continued on Sunday when Mr. Vijayan snubbed the latter saying “prathipaksham” (Opposition front) should not be “prathikarapaksham” (revengeful front). The Chief Minister also accused Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala of lying and misleading the Election Commission of India (ECI) to prevent beneficiaries from getting foodgrain. “Mr. Chennithala had said in his complaint to the poll panel that the State government was trying to influence the voters by distributing the social welfare pension for April and May together. This is not true. We are planning to distribute the amount for March and April together. A government order had been issued much earlier to finish off the process by April 14,” Mr. Vijayan claimed. “The distribution of food kits for Onam in 2020 had begun on August 11 though Thiruvonam was on August 31. It is not linked to the Assembly polls at all,” he said. Foodgrain for children About the food kit being distributed among beneficiaries, the Chief Minister said they were not supposed to be linked with the Vishu festival in April. “Food kits are being distributed ever since the pandemic struck. It has been on for months.  The Food and Civil Supplies Department had issued an order in this regard on February 16. The foodgrain for schoolchildren is part of the midday meal scheme, the first phase of which was completed earlier. As per an order on February 20, the distribution was supposed to have been completed by March,” he said. Mr. Vijayan wondered how all these decisions taken much before the announcement of the Assembly polls could be interpreted as a violation of the model code of conduct. The Chief Minister said that all these things were not freebies, but people’s right. Mr. Vijayan said that such interventions should continue, but the Opposition was trying to scuttle them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-misleading-poll-panel-says-pinarayi/article34186407.ece

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Rajnath, Yechury spar over Kerala probe||The Kerala government arguably required the ECI’s permission to set the judicial probe in motion. The commission's terms of reference and the agencies that would come under the ambit of its investigation were not immediately known. Brewing showdown Since January last, an Assembly election-eve showdown with the Central government has been brewing. First, Kerala joined ranks with 11 other States to halt work on the National Population Register. Soon thereafter, the State government withdrew the general consent to the CBI to voluntarily operate in Kerala after the agency booked Life Mission officials on the charge of violating the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. (Life Mission is Kerala's flagship programme to provide free housing to low-income families). The decision to bring central agencies under the ambit of a judicial enquiry comes barely two weeks after the Kerala police booked unnamed Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials on the charge of conspiring to implicate Mr. Vijayan in the smuggling case dishonestly. Smuggling case Earlier, the Customs had said in a court filing that the woman suspect in the gold smuggling case had stated with clarity about the “smuggling of gold” at the instance of the Chief Minister and Speaker (P. Sreeramakrishnan). The submission marked a further low in the already fraught Centre-State relations. It also prompted LDF activists to lay siege to Customs offices across the State in protest.  Federalism The LDF has made an election issue out of the Centre’s alleged trespasses against federalism. BJP and Congress, on the other hand, have attacked the LDF for hobbling the Central law enforcement agencies to save the face of its political leadership. Meanwhile, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said in Delhi on Sunday that the Kerala government’s move to register a case against Enforcement Directorate officials was a “face saving exercise” as the principal secretary of the State government had been arrested in a gold smuggling case.

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||ID for all land parcels by March 2022: Centre||This is the next step in the Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP), which began in 2008 and has been extended several times as its scope grew. It’s due to come to an end next week, but the Department has proposed a further extension to 2023-24, to complete its original targets as well as expand its ambit with a slew of new schemes. “This Department has taken new initiatives under the programme like NGDRS [or the National Generic Document Registration System], ULPIN, linking of court to land records, integration [of] consent based Aadhaar number with land records etc. which necessitated its further extension beyond 2020-21 till 2023-24,” the Department told the parliamentary panel. In 10 States “Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) is proposed to be rolled out in 10 States during FY 2020-21 and by 2021-22 in the entire country,” it added. The Department’s presentation to the parliamentary panel listed the proposed cost for some of the new initiatives. Linking Aadhaar with land records through ULPIN would cost Rs. 3 per record, it said, while seeding and authentication of landowner Aadhaar data would cost Rs. 5 each. It added that the integration of the Aadhaar numbers with the land record database would be done on a voluntary basis. Linkage Creating a modern land record room in every district would cost Rs. 50 lakh per district, while the integration of land records with the Revenue Court Management System would cost Rs. 270 crore. It also added that DILRMP’s next phase would include “linkage of land record database with banks”. Service deliveries “These components will enhance the service deliveries to the citizen of the country and will also function as inputs to the schemes of the other sectors like Agriculture, Finance Disaster Management etc,” the Department told the panel, adding that ULPIN has been recommended by the Sectoral Group of Secretaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/id-for-all-land-parcels-by-march-2022-centre/article34186424.ece

The fire broke out around 7.25 a.m. at a medical store of the ICU of the LPS Institute of Cardiology, a senior police officer said. It was brought under control but smoke spread to the ICU, said Aseem Arun, Commissioner of Police. All 140 patients were safely evacuated, he said. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sought a report from the district administration and directed a team of the Principal Secretary, Health Department, and the Director-General, Fire, to visit the hospital and submit a report. According to hospital officials, two high-risk patients died in the morning but the deaths were “not caused by the fire”. About the deaths of the two patients, Vinay Krishna, Director of the hospital, said, “Tek Chand died around 6.30 a.m., even before the fire broke out. Rasoolan Bi died later. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem. Prima facie , the high-risk patients had normal deaths and the fatalities were not caused by the fire. The post-mortem will reveal the exact cause.” Dr. Krishna said the cause was “probably a short-circuit”. “Things are under control now ... There are no casualties. Over 140 patients were evacuated,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said. Windowpanes on the first floor of the hospital were broken to let the smoke out, an official said.

29 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Man accused under U.P. conversion law gets bail||A Muslim man from Kannauj, who was jailed under Uttar Pradesh’s strict anti-conversion law in December 2020 on charges of allegedly hiding his identity to marry a Hindu woman, has been granted bail by the Allahabad High Court. The Hindu woman submitted an affidavit to the district police supporting the case of her husband. Mohammad Taufiq Khan was accused by the father of the woman, Priya Verma, of hiding his identity and going under a false name to trap her in love, for marriage. A case was registered against Mr. Khan under Section 3/5 of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. Sections 419 (cheating for impersonation), 420 (cheating), 496 and 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC were also slapped against him on the complaint of the woman’s father Subash Chandra Verma. Mr. Khan’s counsel submitted that the woman was an adult born in 1991, and that she and the accused had been in a relationship for the last three to four years and performed their marriage on their own will as per Hindu rites and rituals. Mr. Khan also said he never pressurised Ms. Verma to change her religion. The woman’s counsel submitted in court that she had filed an affidavit before the Superintendent of Police Kannauj supporting Mr. Khan. She said she was in a relationship with him and performed marriage on her own will. Justice Neeraj Tiwari granted bail to Mr. Khan in an order dated March 18. Enticement case In another case, two women from Prayagraj who were arrested along with a Korean national and an Indian man on charges of allegedly trying to entice two Hindu women to convert to Christianity in Gautam Buddha Nagar were also granted bail by the court.

29 March 2021||BENGALURU,||Police, govt. have pledged State’s pride: Siddaramaiah||Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah on Sunday accused the Police Department and the BJP government of “pledging the pride of Karnataka” by failing to provide protection to the girl allegedly seen with the former Minister Ramesh Jharkiholi in a CD. Meanwhile, in the midst of the Congress planning a protest in front of the SIT office, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who defended the SIT probe, said any protest would not have any bearing on the investigation. “We have seen how (the former Minister) H.Y. Meti’s case was handled during Siddaramaiah’s tenure as Chief Minister. Even when the lady complained against Mr. Meti, the complaint was not taken. The case was finally closed. However, we have been transparent in this case,” the Home Minister told reporters in Bengaluru. Mr. Bommai said, “Protests will be handled by the local police. No developments happening outside the SIT’s ambit will have any influence on the probe. Whatever people may say, I am confident of the SIT investigation finding out the truth.” Earlier, the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah tweeted: “The Police Department and BJP government are responsible for pledging the pride of Karnataka in front of the whole country in the CD case. It is shameful that the police could not trace the CD victim even after 20 days.” He said, “The videos released by the victim clearly shows that the girl does not have confidence on both the State government and the Police Department. It looks like she is of the opinion that the police are involved in the conspiracy against her. This CD case is a classic example for the breakdown of administrative and police machinery in the State under the BJP government.” Further, he asked, “What does it mean when the police say that they are unable to trace the girl? Is she like Vijay Mallya or Nirav Modi hiding abroad?” ‘Will help her’ Later, speaking to reporters in Kolar, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the Congress would help the woman if she approaches the party. “The lady is hiding in fear. She has to come out and make a statement.” In response, Mr. Bommai said, “Allow the SIT to work. There is a set procedure of working. The police will remain the same whichever government comes to power. There should be no effort to demoralise the police force by questioning their integrity.” He reiterated that in all the five notices issued to the girl, the police have assured security while based on her plea, security has been provided to her parents. “We will provide security to her wherever she is.” Meanwhile, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, whom Mr. Jharkiholi alleged is involved in the CD and abused him on Saturday, ruled out approaching the court for defamation. “Why should I file a defamation case. I am not interested in the issue. Let us participate in the (by) elections,” he told reporters in Bengaluru. On the complaintagainst him, he said, “The law will take its course. They are trying their best by getting statements of people. Let the police force protect its honour.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/police-govt-have-pledged-states-pride-siddaramaiah/article34186411.ece

29 March 2021||Kozhikode,||SHRC orders probe into BSS activities||The Kerala State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has directed the Chief Secretary to investigate the management of Bharat Sevak Samaj (BSS), an organisation that poses as a Central government institution. The direction comes in the wake of a complaint filed by a few beneficiaries of the ‘Muttagramam’ (egg village) project of the BSS from Onchiyam in Kozhikode district. The beneficiaries complained that they were taken for a ride by the BSS through the project in 2014-15. The commission had ordered a Vigilance inquiry on the project in 2018 and had directed the banks to keep on hold loan recovery until the investigation was over. However, the Vigilance informed the commission that the BSS did not come under its jurisdiction. The BSS authorities were asked to report before the commission, but they failed to turn up. Meanwhile, the Syndicate Bank, Orkattery branch, informed the commission that the bank would face financial trouble if it did not go ahead with the recovery proceedings. In a hearing on Saturday, commission member K. Baijunath pointed out that the credibility of the organisation was under question. It noted that several people, including jobless women, could fall into the trap of similar organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shrc-orders-probe-into-bss-activities/article34186406.ece
29 March 2021||Hyderabad,||23% of endowment land encroached||About 23% of total endowment land in Telangana was encroached. The total endowment land in the State was 87,235 acres. This was declared by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India while referring to the management of endowment assets in the year 2017-18. Absence of a proper mechanism to protect temple land increased the risk of encroachments with attendant risk of increasing land disputes. Out of 20,124 acres of land encroached, the Assistant Commissioners of endowments department filed cases with Endowments Tribunals to an extent of only 3,488 acres. In a sample of eight out of 19 temples, pattadar passbooks were not available for 3,861 acres, representing 48.41% of endowment land in their possession. The passbooks were not obtained by the Commissioner for 59,898 acres out of the total 87,235 acres. Physical possession of about 10 acres of land donated in 1948 and 1983 was not taken by the department. In ten out of 14 temples of a category, accumulated gold of 91.87 kg was not deposited in Gold Deposit Bond Scheme by executive officers of temples concerned. Discussing the role of Chief Commissioner of Land Administration in the management of government land, the report said government assigned land measuring 12,666 acres with a market value of Rs. 1,096 crore was under unauthorised occupation of third parties in 24 mandals of eight test checked districts. It was also said that the State government did not resume leased land in Secunderabad area though lessees did not apply for renewal of expired lease in respect of 1.67 lakh sq yds valued at Rs. 708 crore. In two cases, land measuring 35 acres was alienated to two private institutions at lower rates than prescribed, conferring undue benefit of Rs. 117 crore which was a loss of revenue to the government. On other compliance audit observations, the CAG said companies secured credit facilities by creating charge on pari passu basis on their properties. Pari passu referred to rights in the property created in favour of lenders ranking equal without any preference or priority for any lender over the others when an immovable property of a borrower was made as security to multiple lenders. An interest of Rs. 15 crore and a penalty of Rs. 36 crore was not levied by assessing authorities of 44 government offices though dealers in 364 cases had paid tax with delays ranging from one day to 1,165 days beyond the admissible period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/23-of-endowment-land-encroached/article34186412.ece

The arrest came hours after 30 seats in southwestern Bengal, where the leader wields considerable influence, went to the polls. The NIA had earlier in the month issued summons to Mr. Mahato in connection with the murder of a CPI (M) worker in 2009, and for the alleged hijacking of passengers of the Rajdhani Express in the same year. Mr. Mahato had not responded to the summons, terming them “politically motivated”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-arrests-trinamool-leader-mahato/article34186436.ece
29 March 2021||Ariyalur,TAMIL NADU||CM deserves another term, says Anbumani Ramadoss||Lauding the AIADMK government for implementing a number of welfare schemes, PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Sunday said that the AIADMK deserves to rule the State for one more term. Canvassing votes for Thamarai S. Rajendran, the AIADMK candidate for Ariyalur constituency, at Sendurai, Mr. Anbumani said that the State election was a war between Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the farmer, and M.K. Stalin, a political businessman. Being a farmer, Mr. Palaniswami was well-versed with the problems faced by the farmers and commoners. He had delivered good governance on various fronts. His handling of COVID-19 crisis to check the spread of the virus was appreciable. “The farmer (Mr. Palaniswami) should win the war to rule the State so as to ensure inclusive developments for all and to ensure social justice to all,” he said. Mr. Anbumani said Mr. Stalin was trying to create a hype to confuse the voters. He could not succeed in it as the voters of the State were shrewd and they would not be deceived by the wrong propaganda. Mr. Stalin did not have clear understanding of current affairs and the issues and the expectations of the people. He had failed miserably in his capacity as Leader of the Opposition. Hence, he had no locus standi to aim for the Chief Ministership, he said. That Mr. Stalin had no belief in himself or his partymen to face the State elections was evident in his dependence on a Bihar-based poll-strategist, he added. Condemning DMK senior leader A. Raja for his derogatory remarks against the late mother of Mr. Palaniswami, the PMK leader said that it was unfortunate that none of the leaders of the DMK alliance parties had raised objection to Mr. Raja’s speech. Mr. Stalin too had failed to condemn his statement. It had hurt the sentiments of the people especially women. They would vote out the DMK in the elections. Mr. Anbumani also campaigned for the AIADMK and the PMK candidates at Kunnam and Jayamkondam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-deserves-another-term-says-anbumani-ramadoss/article34186728.ece
29 March 2021||B. Tilak Chandar,TAMIL NADU||Madurai South has many a need to fulfil||The iconic Thirumalai Nayak Mahal that attracts a large number of tourists from across the world is situated in the Madurai South constituency. Concentrated around the Mahal is a sizeable population of Saurashtra community that is engaged in weaving Sungudi saris, towels and other items. However, with the prospects for the trade down, the community people are looking for better opportunities in other sectors. “The community was concentrated in the Mahal area when our forefathers came here to weave clothes for the rulers of the time. But now our people have spread across the city and are looking at better avenues,” says T.K. Babulal, a weaver. He says that his son has found a job in Chennai and Babulal will be the last in their family to be in the trade. With the advancements in technology, handloom sector has taken a hit, he says. Though the plight of the sector has been made known to the leaders, nothing much has been done to improve the sector, he adds. Agreeing with him, J.S. Shekar, another weaver, says that the number of societies that take up their plight has also come down. While the livelihood of a sizeable population is a major issue in the constituency, another important issue plaguing the constituency is maintenance of Balarengapuram Government Hospital. There is a need for a major facelift and efforts must be taken to run the hospital round the clock, the people here say. Madurai-based activist C. Anand Raj says that steps should be taken to improve the quality at the hospital. Shortage of beds, staff and specialist departments is a problem. Lifesaving treatments and emergency services must be improved at the hospital to bring down the number of referrals to Government Rajaji Hospital, he says. The residents also complain of lack of infrastructure and civic issues in the constituency that need to be addressed. There is a lack of civic amenities in some areas in the constituency such as Balarengapuram, Kamarajapuram and Anuppanadi, says J. Lenin, a resident of the constituency. He says that still there are complaints from residents about irregular supply of water and poor sanitation. “Sometimes we get water only once in four days and it is not even peak summer now,” says a resident. Some of the demands raised by the residents of the constituency include development of open spaces. A well-stocked library, sports facility, children’s parks are the others demands of the people. The Mahal is getting a facelift now and development of another major landmark, Mariamman Teppakulam, into a tourist spot is needed, says Mr. Lenin. The constituency has an interesting lineup of candidates this time. Sitting MLA S.S. Saravanan of the AIADMK is pitted against M. Boominathan of the MDMK, which is in the DMK alliance. While Mr. Boominathan is banking on the alliance strength, Mr. Saravanan says he is confident of a second-time victory as the government has fulfilled its promises. The presence of TTV Dhinakaran’s AMMK is set to take away a chunk of votes which may go in favour of the AIADMK. The largest segments of voters in the constituency are Saurashtras, followed by Mukkulathors, Nadars and Naidus. The AIADMK candidate belongs to Saurashtra community, while Mr. Boominathan belongs to Mukkulathor community. The other candidates contesting from the constituency are G. Easwaran of the Samathuva Makkal Katchi in the MNM alliance, M. Abbas of the NTK and S. Raajalingam of the AMMK. Transgender activist Bharathi Kannamma of the New Generation People’s Party is also in the fray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/madurai-south-has-many-a-need-to-fulfil/article34186926.ece
29 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Traffic bottlenecks, threat of floods trouble Velachery||Velachery Main Road was riddled with potholes and road cuts making it extremely difficult for motorists to navigate. No one travelling through the road would have voted for the ruling party. But that was till last week. Now, the entire stretch is being relaid, and it looks all new and smooth. Another civic infrastructure hanging for years is the ongoing construction of the flyover at the Vijayanagar junction. Several thousands of motorists from further south suffer owing to the delayed construction of the flyover. This also congests the Velachery Main Road manifold, say residents. The ruling AIADMK has fielded M.K. Ashok again. He was the first MLA of the constituency that was carved out of Tambaram in 2011. He was there when Jayalalithaa laid the foundation for the flyover in 2016, which is crawling its way to completion now. That year though, he was not given nomination, and DMK candidate Vagai Chandrasekar emerged victorious. This year, the DMK has given the seat to its ally Congress that has fielded Tamil Nadu Youth Congress Committee president JMH. Hassan Moulana. For Makkal Needhi Maiyam (MNM), Santosh Babu, who quit the Indian Administrative Service, is the candidate. Unfortunately, this former IT Secretary of Tamil Nadu has been forced to campaign through the digital mode after contracting COVID-19. With one of the MNM’s star candidates in the fray, the results here could hint at whether or not the middle class looked at the party as an alternative to the Dravidian fronts, at least in the urban milieu. With Adyar, Thiruvanmiyur and Besant Nagar, apart from Velachery, the constituency has a sizeable population of upper middle-class voters. For the AMMK, M. Chandrabose is trying his luck, and Naam Tamilar Katchi has fielded M. Keerthana. Stalin’s home In fact, DMK president M.K. Stalin was one of the earliest residents of Velachery. He moved here when he was Chennai Mayor in the late 1990s, and many then wondered why he had chosen a suburb to live. In the two decades since then, Velachery has seen tremendous growth, but infrastructure bottlenecks persist. “For two decades, the politicians have promised to beautify the Velachery lake and make it a tourist destination. Nothing has happened even after four elections. Only the promise remains and encroachments continue to eat up the lake,” says S. Kumararaja, vice-president, Federation of Velachery Welfare Associations. While the 2015 floods could be one reason for the election of the DMK MLA from here in 2016, the storm-water drain network has reduced flooding to a great extent. Despite intermittent heavy rain last year, flooding occurred only in parts of Ward 178, and the government has taken up a Rs. 15-crore work to desilt and strengthen the canal that connects the Velachery lake with the Pallikaranai marshland, say officials. At present, the bus stand looks ugly and dust-stormed owing to the flyover work, and there has been a demand to shift it to a place near the Velachery MRTS station to ensure urban mobility. The failure of Southern Railway to link MRTS to Adambakkam and an incomplete six-vent culvert near the Velachery MRTS station, connecting the OMR to the airport, are the two other traffic bottlenecks that await action. Resident’s suggestions “The MLA should have more interactions with residents’ welfare associations,” says a retired IAS officer. A resident of Adyar, he says, “There are still households that depend on street taps for water. Some more parks should be created. Parking has become a major problem. Multi-level parking lots can be constructed at Taramani, Adyar and Thiruvanmiyur,” he says, emphasising that traffic bottlenecks should be identified and appropriate plans be prepared. A flyover at the Thiruvanmiyur junction has been a long-pending demand of not only people from here but those travelling along the ECR. “They took measurements but nothing has happened in the last decade,” says a member of Green Valmiki Nagar Movement. Better traffic management and garbage clearance at Adyar and Thiruvanmiyur are the two other demands of the residents. SAOWA TNHB Flats Association at Thiruvanmiyur has sought a police booth in the vicinity. Beaches though were maintained, the residents say. Despite being a city constituency, the undercurrent of caste runs here. Vanniyars, Thevars, Brahmins, and Dalits live in large numbers in the constituency. AIADMK sources say the Thamizhnadu Brahmin Association has asked the community to vote for the AIADMK-BJP alliance and not for the MNM that could spoil the NDA’s chances. The AIADMK candidate held a meeting with the Brahmins here and promised to redress their grievances, says an insider. In the Taramani ward, there are quite a number of Yadavas as well, locals say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traffic-bottlenecks-threat-of-floods-trouble-velachery/article34186630.ece

Some residents said they developed symptoms of COVID-19 after the launch of the care centre in the area. Five blocks in their apartment have been converted into a COVID-19 care centre by the Greater Chennai Corporation. Residents, who staged a protest, said officials did not permit them to meet the Corporation Commissioner at Ripon Building when they wanted to request him to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in their apartment. “The inmates of the COVID-19 care centre are throwing garbage, including used masks, outside the building. This is increasing the risk of infection. The asymptomatic patients in the COVID-19 care centre are coming out to visit tea shops. The same persons who visit the COVID-19 care centre supply water to the apartment complex. We have informed officials. There is no response yet,” said a resident. Last week, the Corporation set up the centre in the Athipattu Tamil Nadu Housing Board residential area near Ambattur in Tiruvallur district without prior notice to residents. After protests for a week, all the residents vacated their flats on Sunday and organised protests on the streets. Poll boycott Residents said they would surrender their voter ID cards and boycott the election scheduled for April 6. “The candidates in the Ambattur Assembly constituency have not visited our area,” said a resident. Corporation officials said over 100 patients were in the care centre, which can accommodate 5,000 patients.

29 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Many are ready to brave the pandemic to cast their votes||With COVID-19 cases rising across the country, including in Tamil Nadu, will people travel to the city to cast their votes? While holding the election has been a mammoth task for the Election Commission during the pandemic, it is an equally risky task for people who want to come to the city to vote. There are some who are willing to travel to Chennai from other States despite the pandemic. It is particularly difficult for those coming to Chennai from Bengaluru as a rule comes into place from April 1 wherein people entering Karnataka from any State must produce an RT-PCR test negative certificate. S. Ranganathan, a healthcare professional, plans to travel from Bengaluru to Chennai by train. “I have taken one dose of the vaccine and will take another one soon. I am not scared to travel because with due precaution, I know I am safe,” he said. K. Avinash, whose family lives in Velachery, said he planned to travel overnight to cast his vote. He recently found a new job in Karnataka. “I will take all precautions and vote in the afternoon since, hopefully, there would not be much crowd at that time,” he said. Some are yet to decide on whether or not to risk it and travel to the city. K. Surendra Babu, who works in Bengaluru, said he was still making up his mind about travelling to cast his vote. “It will take only an hour to vote... But I am afraid to travel due to the rising COVID-19 numbers,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-are-ready-to-brave-the-pandemic-to-cast-their-votes/article34186639.ece

Prakash has said. Speaking to mediapersons on Sunday, he said election officials had seized material worth Rs. 20 crore ahead of the election. “Checking will increase in Chennai this week. Interceptions will increase without affecting the normal activities of residents,” Mr. Prakash said.

After randomisation of 7,098 ballot units and 7,098 control units and 7,454 VVPAT, additional machines were sent for constituencies with a large number of candidates. The Kolathur constituency has received the largest number of voting machines because of the presence of 36 candidates. One machine can accommodate only 16 candidates. Of the 7,300 absentee voters, officials have received ballot papers from 1,221, including senior citizens and persons with disabilities. The process is expected to be completed in two or three days.

Every year, the Panguni Uthiram festival is celebrated with grandeur at the temple, attracting a large number of devotees for a glimpse of the Kalyanotsavam festival held on the last day. Despite the rising number of COVID-19 infections, a large crowd assembled at the temple, prompting the police to use force. T. Karunamurthy, a resident of Kancheepuram, complained that the temple authorities had failed to make any arrangements and announcements to control the crowd. This was one of the reasons that compelled the police to use force. The temple authorities should not have allowed the public owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-lathicharge-devotees-at-ekambareswarar-temple-in-kancheepuram/article34186618.ece

29 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Punish those degrading women: Palaniswami||Referring to controversial remarks made by DMK leader A. Raja, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday wondered what the fate of the women would be if such people came to power. He appealed to the voters to punish those who degrade women. “Think about what all they will say if a common man is a Chief Minister. If this can happen to a Chief Minister, who can give protection to common people like you? What will happen to the women if they come to power? Please think about it,” appealed Mr. Palaniswami, who turned emotional during an election campaign at Tiruvottiyur.  ‘Change of heart’ Maintaining that he decided against taking up this subject during his election campaign, he said he had a change of heart after noticing the presence of women in the crowd. “Women should think about what all atrocities these people will commit if they come to power... You should punish those who degrade women,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami did not mention Mr. Raja’s name but referred to him as a DMK functionary. He said all were born to mothers and punishment should be given to those insulting and denigrating mothers. The Chief Minister said his deceased mother was from a village and worked round-the-clock in her farm. Though she had died, derogatory comments were being made against her, he said. “Whether rich or poor, mothers should be respected. Be it anyone, god will punish those who speak against mothers,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami said DMK president M.K. Stalin’s capital was nothing but lies and he took them wherever he went for the election campaign. “He is asking for votes from the people with his lies. But the people are not confused and they are clear. The AIADMK government has implemented several schemes for the welfare of the people. The DMK can only live in its dreams,” the Chief Minister said. Mr. Palaniswami said the spread of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu was contained due to the steps being taken by the State government. He also recalled that the Prime Minister had commended the actions of the State government over COVID-19.  If this can happen to a Chief Minister, who can give protection to common people like you?

29 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Health Secretary cautions against laxity over COVID-19 safety protocol||Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan on Sunday cautioned against laxity among people and officials in taking measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu. Addressing the media after inspecting the allocation of more than 300 additional beds for COVID-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, he acknowledged that there was some laxity among a section of officials and stressed the need not to squander the gains achieved earlier from effective control and monitoring measures. Strict implementation Highlighting that only nine districts in Tamil Nadu had a test positivity rate higher than 2% and only five of them had more than 3% at the moment, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the officials had been asked to strictly implement the “test, track and treat” strategy. “For every person testing positive, we are asking field workers to test at least 30 of their contacts,” he said. Pointing out that more cases were reported in clusters in apartments during the second surge happening now, he said the ITIHAS software, developed by IIT Madras, was being used to identify potential hotspots. He urged people to always wear masks and maintain physical distancing wherever possible. He reiterated that those who could work from home must opt for that. He appealed to all those who were eligible to get vaccinated at the earliest. Decision on lockdown To a question on lockdown, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the government would not take any sudden decision that would cause panic among the public. He said the situation was different now with the availability of adequate health infrastructure and vaccines. The overall situation and the spread of the disease were monitored daily by the core committee formed by the Chief Secretary. Highlighting that the country was now in the ‘Unlock 6’ phase, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the benefits and restrictions in the ‘Unlock 4’ and ‘Unlock 5’ phases were being looked into.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/health-secretary-cautions-against-laxity-over-safety-norms/article34186624.ece

Accusing Mr. Palaniswami of being corrupt and stealing people’s money, Mr. Gandhi said the Chief Minister was forced to fall at the feet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah because of his corruption. Terming the Assembly election as a battle between the AIADMK-BJP-RSS and the people of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Gandhi said, the BJP govt. at the Centre was resorting to a full-scale assault on the idea of India and Tamil Nadu. “They want a Tamil Nadu that bows down to them. Tamil Nadu has never bowed down in its 3,000-year-old history. But it has embraced people who has given it love and respect,” he said and added that his relationship with the people of Tamil Nadu was one of mutual respect and understanding. “India cannot exist without Tamil Nadu,” he said. “I am not a Tamil, but I understand you. If I learn Tamil I will understand you more. I am trying to read some of your literature,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-bjp-combine-will-be-decimated/article34186737.ece

29 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Electorate in Sulur looking for development||Sulur constituency, which also includes parts of Tiruppur district such as Samalapuram, is electing its fourth MLA this time. The constituency saw a bypoll in 2019 following the death of AIADMK MLA R. Kanagaraj. V.P. Kandhasamy, who won the bypoll defeating DMK’s Pongalur N. Palanisamy with a margin of 10,113 votes has Kongunadu Makkal Desia Katchi’s Premier Selvam alias M. Kalaisamy as the main opponent this time. Mr. Kalaisamy is contesting on DMK’s rising sun symbol as part of KMDK’s alliance with the party. The vast constituency is home to a mix of population engaged in works ranging from powerloom jobs to agriculture to dairy farming. Though two major highways namely Salem-Kochi highway and Tiruchi Road pass through the constituency, people feel that many areas in the constituency require development. “Sulur does not have a government college. Students from villages around Sulur are now forced to travel to Coimbatore for college education. A government college with all facilities is the foremost requirement,” says Su. Su. Vetriselvi, a social worker from Sulur. According to her, an All Women Police Station should also be established at Sulur. Though the stretch of Tiruchi Road from Pappampatti Pirivu to Sulur had been listed as an accident black spot by the Coimbatore rural police, the section is yet to be widened. People from Sulur have also voiced the need for a flyover at the intersection of Salem – Kochi highway and Tiruchi Road where several accidents have taken place. Widening of a small portion of Avinashi Road (part of Salem-Kochi highway) at Karumathampatti is also much delayed, feels D. Prabhakaran, a social activist from the area. According to him, people from the locality should also be exempted from the toll collection at Kaniyur. In September 2017, the bus stand at Somanur in the constituency collapsed killing five and injuring 18 people. “Some of them have not yet received proper compensation from the government. People are also not updated about the inquiry conducted into the bus stand collapse,” he adds. Somanur and surrounding places in Coimbatore district and adjoining villages in Tiruppur district form one of the largest clusters of job working powerlooms. According to C. Palanisamy, president of Coimbatore and Tiruppur District Job Working Powerloom Unit Owners’ Association, “nearly 2.5 lakh people earn their income from job working powerlooms. The sector is facing a crisis due to non-revision of wages by the master weavers. The wages were revised last time in 2014. Transportation costs and fuel price increase have added to our worries. We expect the government to take immediate steps to make the wage revision happen,” he says. The main agricultural produce from the region is coconut. Plantains, sugarcane, maize and vegetables are also farmed depending on the availability of water. Dairy farmers also grow different varieties of grass to meet the fodder demand. The constituency is home to seven tanks of the Noyyal river system namely Pallapalayam tank, Kannampalayam tank, Irugur tank, Achankulam, Sulur small tank, Sulur big tank and Samalapuram tank. Water stored in these tanks recharge the groundwater in the region. River Noyyal, once the main source of water for irrigation in the region, is now shallow and highly polluted due to the discharge of untreated sewage and effluents, remarks C. Thangaraj of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam (non-political). “Government should set up facilities for the treatment of Noyyal water and take steps to protect it from pollution. Farmers in the region are also against the laying of high tension power lines though farm lands,” he adds. S.A. Senthilkumar of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, A. Ranganathan of Makkal Needhi Maiam and G. Elangovan of Naam Tamilar Katchi are among other contestants in the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/electorate-in-sulur-looking-for-development/article34186675.ece

29 March 2021||DHARMAPURI,TAMIL NADU||A tough battle for AIADMK in Veppanahalli||A predominantly rural constituency, farming is the mainstay of Veppanahalli. The constituency’s needs too have been largely related to this primary occupation. The long standing demand has been an irrigation scheme to harvest water from Aaliyalam dam to the connecting lakes. The Ennekolputhur-Badethalavu water harvesting project has remained an election issue. The government had only recently announced the Ennekolputhur project, making it effectively a non-starter. Like in most constituencies, the erratic drinking water supply under the Hogenakkal water supply scheme is an issue. The newly announced medical college is located in Veppanahalli constituency. But, the primary health centre falls woefully short to deal with major accident emergencies as it was on the accident-prone Krishnagiri –Hosur highway. Rayakottai with its horticultural produce lacks a cold storage facility.  Occasional crop depredation by elephants is also a festering grievance for farmers. A Government Arts and Science College and ITI are among the other demands of the people here. Veppanahalli faces a two-cornered contest between the two main Dravidian parties. For the AIADMK candidate and former minister K.P. Munusamy, a Vanniyar himself, the internal quota of 10.5 % for Vanniyas will fetch points – but only thus far, given that the constituency’s caste composition is a mix of Kurubas, Valmiki (Naidu), Gowdas and Vanniyars. Mr. Munusamy’s contest is rife with challenges of factionalism. The 2016 AIADMK candidate M. Hemnath was conspicuously absent at the candidate’s introductory meeting. Mr. Munusamy himself, a native of Kaveripattinam in Krishnagiri, is an ‘outsider’ in Veppanahalli. However, in 2016, the PMK’s vote share was 2.83% (5,476 votes). So, Mr.Munusamy could lean on this vote share. DMK has fielded incumbent P. Murugan. Veppanahalli saw rumblings of discontent way back in 2016, when the seat was strongly contended by the Congress. But, it went to the DMK. This term again, DMK has wrested the seat. The DMDK, after snapping ties with the AIADMK, has fielded S.M. Murugesan. The DMDK secured 4,656 votes (2.41% vote share) in 2016 as part of the third front. Abdul Ajees Amanullah, a social worker, and Kuruba leader C.Chakkaralappa have filed nominations as Independents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-tough-battle-for-aiadmk-in-veppanahalli/article34186766.ece

Taking a dig at the Minister further, Mr. Stalin said that Mr. Sengottaiyan had in the past 15 years made the same promise of relocating the garbage dumping yard located at the heart of the town. “But he is getting only the votes and no steps were taken to relocate the yard,” he charged. He said that only foundation was laid for the project to concrete-line the Keeripallam Odai in the town and the four-lane project of Erode – Gobichettipalayam Road remained on paper even after 10 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sengottaiyan-aided-in-saffronisation-of-education/article34186769.ece

Karuppaiah himself had borrowed the money from another person to lend it to Vijayakumar. When Karuppaiah was under pressure to repay the loan, he asked Vijayakumar to return the money. After Vijayakumar asked him to collect the money on Sunday morning, Karuppaiah went to his house and found that it was locked from inside. Along with neighbours, he broke open the door of the house and found that Vijayakumar and his wife Vanishri (38) were hanging and the daughter was found dead. South Gate police are investigating.  LPG cylinder blast  In another incident, S. Saravanan (45) of Balarengapuram was charred to death when an LPG cylinder burst in his house in the wee hours of Sunday. The police said that Saravanan used to take up small-time jobs. The blast took place at around 2.30 a.m. on the first floor of the house on EE Road. A portion of the house was ripped apart in the explosion. Since, Saravanan had sent his mother to his sister’s house only on Saturday, the police suspect that the unmarried man could have taken this extreme step due to frustration. Teppakulam police are investigating. Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available on the State’s health helpline 104 and Chennai-based Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/family-of-three-found-dead-in-madurai/article34186918.ece
29 March 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘People tired of corruption, maladministration’||Electing a candidate like P.T.R. Palanivel Thiagarajan (DMK) to the Legislative Assembly would be a privilege not only to the electorate of Madurai Central constituency but to the entire Madurai district, said CPI (M) MP Su. Venkatesan here on Sunday. Seeking votes for the DMK candidate, he said that the people were tired of corruption and maladministration in the AIADMK government for the last 10 years. Time had come to show the party the doors, he added. Election surveys showed that the DMK combine would sweep the Assembly election. Hence, the victory of candidates like Mr. Thiagarajan was assured. However, the people of the constituency should ensure that the DMK candidate stood on top of the scoreboard by polling the highest number of votes in the 234 constituencies, he said. The AIADMK, he said, had pledged the rights of the people over the decade. The BJP did not treat the Tamils fairly and attempted to capture power through the back door. “The DMK combine has to bring back the sheen to the Tamils,” Mr. Venkatesan said, adding to achieve this goal, the people had the responsibility of ensuring a comfortable victory for the candidates of the secular front. Tamil Nadu had not witnessed any development. The AIADMK Ministers had been seeking votes by stating that they were like orphans as they had lost their Amma (Jayalalithaa). “Is this the way to seek votes?,” asked the MP. There was no development in the State. Hence, the AIADMK Ministers, who behaved like comedians, should be defeated. The new government under Mr. Stalin would put the State on a different pedestal, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-are-tired-of-corruption-and-maladministration/article34186748.ece

29 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Statehood is our stated policy, says former AINRC Minister||Former Minister and AINRC leader P. Rajavelu on Sunday asserted that there was no dilution in the demand for Statehood. “Our leader (Mr. Rangasamy) will make the final statement on the issue but as far we (workers) know, demanding Statehood is our stated policy. There is no dilution on the issue,” he said responding to a query on alliance partner BJP’s silence in the manifesto on Statehood. Mr. Rajevelu, who is contesting from the reserved Nettapakkam constituency, said the AINRC would have a separate manifesto. “Our leader will make an announcement on the issue. The Congress is now making false claims and crying crocodile tears on Statehood. When we were in government, the party took several initiatives but the Congress party never supported us. Now, in the last minute they are showing interest in getting Statehood,” he said. The Congress had “failed” to provide basic amenities to the people in the Union Territory. “Nettapakkam is one of the backward constituencies, lacking in proper infrastructure including roads and public transport system. The Congress party failed to deliver on any of its electoral promises. It was fighting with Centre and Lt. Governor during its tenure,” he added. The AINRC would revive growth and provide good governance, taking the welfare of the people into consideration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/statehood-is-our-stated-policy-says-former-ainrc-minister/article34187022.ece
29 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||BJP’s manifesto rings hollow: Veerappa Moily||Congress leaders on Sunday said the claims made by the BJP manifesto ring hollow as the Centre had done next to nothing in the close to five years of the Congress term in Puducherry. AICC leader Veerappa Moily told a press conference that there should be at least a semblance of performance while advancing claims while in fact the BJP’s contribution to the development of the Union Territory was negative, considering the constant assault on principles of federalism and the impediments that the Centre created for implementing schemes through then Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi. Central funds Mr. Moily and former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who had released the BJP manifesto the other day, owed an explanation to the people on why Central funds were withheld. Mr. Narayanasamy also distributed newspaper reports about the five times he had personally met Ms. Sitharaman in Delhi to seek funds for the Union Territory. Stating that a manifesto must be based on facts and evidence, Mr. Moily said the BJP had only given Puducherry the worst treatment and now they were suddenly promising the best. Mr. Moily said the Congress government had provided stable governance until it was brought down and had also won several awards for governance in spite of the obstacles put before it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjps-manifesto-rings-hollow-veerappa-moily/article34187019.ece

29 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||I was specifically asked to contest from Villianur, says Siva||DMK president M.K. Stalin had specifically directed the local leadership to contest from Villianur after he came to know that it was former Minister A. Namassivayam who engineered the defection of DMK legislator K. Venkatesan to the BJP, R. Siva, DMK leader in the Assembly and convenor (south), said here on Sunday. Mr. Namassivayam, who had won the last Assembly election on a Congress ticket from Villianur, had now shifted to Mannadipet after he joined the BJP. “ Thalapathi [Stalin] asked to me to contest from Villianur as he was upset with Mr. Namassivayam for weaning away our legislator. He asked me to contest from Villianur. That is why I have to shift from Orleanpet,” he told The Hindu while campaigning near Arumparthapuram in the Villianur constituency. The DMK leadership wanted the party to take the leader (Namassivayam), who weaned away the party MLA, head on, but he had been shifted to another constituency, Mr. Siva said. Moreover, the Villianur constituency had been represented by the DMK four times in the past. “Till 1980, we had our leaders winning from the constituency. Our leader, Mr. Stalin, will be campaigning for the party candidates on April 3 in Puducherry. We will be organising a public meeting in town,” he added. He also spoke about the DMK’s decision to join party in the case seeking implementation of the 10% reservation for National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET)-passed government school students in medical colleges. The Centre had informed the Madras High Court, while hearing a public interest litigation petition, that the Union Territory was not empowered to implement the 10% reservation policy, he said. “We are planning to challenge the Centre’s contention because Tamil Nadu has already implemented such a decision.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/was-asked-to-contest-from-villianur-siva/article34186645.ece

29 March 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK a hollow shell controlled by RSS-BJP, says Rahul Gandhi||The AIADMK, at present, is a hollow shell controlled by the RSS and the BJP, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Sunday, launching a full-fledged attack on the ruling combine. Addressing a conference of the DMK-led front, along with DMK president M.K. Stalin, in Salem, Mr. Gandhi said, “It is not the old AIADMK. This is an AIADMK with a mask. It looks like the AIADMK. If you take off the mask, you will find it is not the AIADMK, but the RSS-BJP behind the mask. That old AIADMK is dead... It is now a hollow shell controlled by the RSS and the BJP. The people of Tamil Nadu have to be careful and understand what is behind this mask.” Mr. Gandhi said no Tamil person wanted to bow in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, or touch the feet of Home Minister Amit Shah or RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The Congress leader asked why Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had submitted to the RSS, Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah. Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister controlled the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and the Chief Minister had been corrupt. ‘History under attack’ Whenever Mr. Palaniswami bowed in front of Mr. Modi, the people of Tamil Nadu had to pay a huge price for it, Mr. Gandhi added. He said the history and language of Tamil Nadu was under attack, but the Chief Minister did not say anything. Mr. Gandhi said the biggest strength of Tamil Nadu was its small and medium businesses, and the State was the manufacturing capital of the country. Demonetisation and the GST regime were an attack on Tamil innovation and manufacturing, he added. Millions had lost their jobs owing to these measures, the Congress leader said. The three farm laws were designed to steal from India and the farmers in the State, but the Chief Minister had not uttered a word against them, Mr. Gandhi said. The National Education Policy (NEP) was designed to harm Tamil Nadu, but the Chief Minister had not said anything. He had not even advanced a firm resistance to the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), he added. Mr. Gandhi said the Chief Minister had given permission to Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah to do whatever they wanted. The Tamil people would not tolerate such an attack on their history and culture, he said, adding that he could guarantee that Mr. Stalin would become the Chief Minister. He said the Tamil people had made a decision, and the election would be the process that would formalise it. Mr. Gandhi said the RSS-BJP combine had unlimited resources and money. They should be first stopped in Tamil Nadu and then removed from Delhi, he said. Mr. Stalin called Mr. Gandhi the “protector of Indian democracy”. He said Tamil Nadu had gone back by 50 years under the AIADMK regime and the Palaniswami government was submissive to Mr. Modi. The DMK president said both Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam were not bothered about the people. They were only concerned about “commission, collection and corruption”. Mr. Stalin asked Mr. Gandhi to take charge and form an alliance of Opposition parties at the national level. In Chennai, Mr. Gandhi said the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the State would be decimated in the Assembly election. The BJP government at the Centre was resorting to a full-scale assault on the idea of India and Tamil Nadu, the Congress leader added. ‘Never bowed down’ “They want a Tamil Nadu that bows down to them. Tamil Nadu has never bowed down in its 3,000-year-old history. But it has embraced people who have given it love and respect,” he said, adding that his relationship with the people of Tamil Nadu was one of mutual respect and understanding. “India cannot exist without Tamil Nadu,” he said. “I am not a Tamil, but I understand you. If I learn Tamil I will understand you more. I am trying to read some of your literature,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-is-a-hollow-shell-controlled-by-rss-bjp-rahul/article34186641.ece

29 March 2021||Soma Basu,TAMIL NADU||The power of senior voters||The elderly are not just older. They are wiser and more experienced. Driven by a strong sense of civic duty, they turn out in large numbers to show their ballot power every election and this year is no different in Madurai. They have the choice to cast postal votes. But a cross section of them are determined to go to the polling booths on April 6 as they have already taken their COVID-19 vaccination.  Dr. Sam C. Bose (93) , plastic & reconstructive surgeon : “I have not missed a single election since 1951 – 17 Parliamentary and 15 State Assembly elections. Throughout lockdown when the majority worked from home, I went to Government Rajaji Hospital every Saturday for interactive teaching sessions with PG students. I am not scared as long as precautions against COVID are in place and I have taken my two shots of the vaccine. I like to vote in person.”  Lalji Vora (79), businessman: “ We should honour our right to vote as citizens. I have voted in every Lok Sabha and Assembly election since 1962. Last July I tested positive for COVID-19, but that does not deter me from voting. I have taken the first dose of vaccine.”  Dr. P. Namperumalsamy and Dr. G. Nachiar (82), founding members of Aravind Eye Care Systems: “ People should understand the importance of our freedom struggle that has given us this privilege. Irrespective of the political scenario and notwithstanding the raging public health issue, we should not squander the opportunity to vote because as citizens we are responsible for the government we choose.”- Dr. Namperumalsamy  “A few times I had been away on work on the polling dates. Otherwise, I ensure that I and my husband reach the polling booth in the first hour to avoid crowd. Officials came to our house with the consent form for postal vote this time. But we love the experience of going to the booth.” – Dr. Nachiar   M. Salim (84), businessman: “I don’t remember how many elections I have voted in. I am usually the first voter at the booth. I reach by 7 a.m. when it is free of people and there is a buzz among the polling agents eager to help you. The EVMs are a convenient device for the aged.”  Nan Narayenen (86), soft skills trainer: “I lost my wife last year and this is the first time since 1955 that I will go alone to vote. I like to go to the booth and will take along my granddaughters, who are first-time voters. We cannot sit at home fearing the virus. I go early to the booth to avoid rush.”  S. Mohan Gandhi (88), retired Joint Commissioner (I-T): “I have not missed a single election since 1955. This time I am debating because my medico daughter-in-law is very strict. The only time I went out in the last one year was to take my first vaccine shot a fortnight ago. I may opt for postal vote but I like going to the booth. I go leisurely around noon and if there is a crowd, by virtue of my age I am let in first.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-power-of-senior-voters/article34186924.ece

Reacting to the comments made by Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) president Kamal Haasan, Mr. Yechury said the party stood for efforts to save India by keeping the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the communal forces in the country out of office. The CPI (M) general secretary was interacting with mediapersons in the Kerala capital on Sunday.

29 March 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘GST regime led to closure of over 50,000 units in State’||DMK MP Kanimozhi has said that the GST regime had resulted in closure of at least 50,000 small and tiny units in the State. Speaking at a poll campaign meeting in support of DMK and alliance candidates in Vilathikulam (G.V. Markandeyan), Kovilpatti (K. Srinivasan of CPI-M) and Ottapidaram (M.C. Shanmugiah), she said GST and the demonetisation had benefited only a few corporate houses close to those in power in New Delhi. Not realising that thousands of workers had lost jobs due to the wrong moves of the BJP, the AIADMK was not worried about this all through the last four years. Thoothukudi firing, father-son death in Sattankulam were just a few instances of the AIADMK's nonchalant attitude towards the people. The DMK, if elected, would not only open new industries, but also ensure that Tamils were given preference in employment. Similarly, vacancies in government departments would also be given only to Tamils. The AIADMK had fielded its sitting MLA Kadambur Raju here again. “What was his contribution to the constituency all these years. Has he facilitated in establishing a single industry?,” she asked. The electorate should ‘think and vote’ this time. DMK, under the leadership of M.K. Stalin, would usher in transformation in the State in a big way, Ms. Kanimozhi said. If elected, the DMK government would bring down prices of essential commodities such as milk, petrol and diesel. Similarly, womenfolk would be given financial assistance and young pregnant mothers would get increased assistance. “As a MP, I can bring funds from the Centre and coordinate with the DMK and alliance partners. Hence, the people should vote for the DMK-combine which alone would help bring in development,” she said. She interacted with voters in Melakarandai, Karuppur, Meenakshipuram in Vilathikulam Assembly Constituency, Lingampatti and Kayathar in Kovilpatti constituency and Pudiyamputhur and Pudukottai in Ottapidaram constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gst-regime-led-to-closure-of-over-50000-units-in-state/article34186745.ece
29 March 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK demands apology from A. Raja for remarks against CM||The women's wing of the AIADMK staged a demonstration against DMK leader A. Raja here on Sunday. Two days ago, Mr. Raja's remarks on Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had gone viral on social media. Many political parties condemned the DMK leader’s remark. Though Mr. Raja clarified that he had been wrongly understood and explained the background on how he compared M.K. Stalin as a ‘healthy’ baby and Mr. Palaniswami as ‘illicit’ was that Mr. Stalin had come up in politics step-by-step, while the CM was not elected by people, but only after he prostrated before a woman (Sasikala) at Koovathur where the AIADMK MLAs elected him following the demise of Jayalalithaa in 2016. Mr. Raja said that while his leader Stalin had served people in different capacities in public life, it was not the case with Mr. Palaniswami, who had come to the post by ‘accident.’ The AIADMK was up against Mr. Raja and submitted a memorandum to the Chief Electoral Officer demanding that he be barred from poll campaigns and also urged the police to register a case. The AIADMK’s women’s wing cadre staged a demonstration against Mr Raja near VVD signal. Similarly, the Tiruchendur AIADMK’s women’s wing cadre also demanded an unconditional apology from Mr. Raja and wanted the DMK president to condemn the statement in public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-demands-apology-from-a-raja-for-remarks-against-cm/article34186751.ece

The case was booked recently based on a report from the Deputy Director (Investigation), Income Tax department, Tiruchi, said police sources. The cash found in a gunny bag by the Flying Squad was subsequently handed over to the Srirangam Sub-Treasury after Income Tax department officials inquired four car-borne persons in the vicinity of the spot of seizure. However, they feigned ignorance. Sources said the Income Tax official wrote to the Tiruchi Rural Police recently to conduct further investigation into the case in order to ascertain the owner of the seized cash. The police was also informed that summons had been issued to the vehicle owner. Based on the IT official's report, the Pettavaithalai Police booked a case under section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and an investigation was carried out by the Inspector of Jeeyapuram police station. The Income Tax department had also asked the police to furnish details of the claimant of the money, if any.

Divyadharshini, demanding disqualification of his candidature. “It is shocking that law enforcers who are supposed to ensure free and fair poll were bribed at police stations. I have not come across such a practice. It is a serious matter. The Election Commission should take immediate action in this issue,” Mr. Padmanathan told The Hindu . Mr. Padmanathan demanded that Mr. Nehru be booked immediately. He said that the issue had raised a serious question on the impartiality of police personnel in conducting the poll in Tiruchi. Mr. Nehru, who had lost the confidence of voters in his constituency, had planned to capture polling booths and distribute cash to the voters. “Without police protection election is impossible. But how are we to trust them when they are bribed,” Mr. Padmanathan questioned.

Ms. Vandana who led the operation on the Perseverance Rover which made a touchdown on Mars in February 2020 shared her experiences of significant milestone in space exploration during the inauguration of Pragyan 2021, the technology festival of NIT-T. Pragyan has achieved the ISO 20121:2012 Certification for Sustainable Event Management and the ISO 9001:2015 Certification for Quality Management Systems. With the theme ‘Metaverse’ this year, the programme kicked off on Sunday morning with Ms. Verma’s talk on space exploration. Ms. Verma pointed out that the Perseverance Rover was not only sending back images but was also collecting unique rocks and will bring them back to Earth for research purposes. The Jezero Crater, where the rover landed was possibly the best place for exploration as scientists believe this delta is what remains of the confluence between an ancient river and a lake, Ms. Verma said. She also outlined the difficulty in operating the rover as it takes about 20 minutes for signals to reach from Earth to Mars. She also informed attendees that the next few steps in the mission would involve deploying a Mars Helicopter which could fly over the surface. Director Mini Shaji Thomas, T.

29 March 2021||TIRUPPUR,TAMIL NADU||Stalin promises separate ministry for irrigation||Announcing a slew of measures to revive water resources and agriculture in Tamil Nadu, DMK chief M.K. Stalin said on Sunday that a separate Ministry for Irrigation will be established if his party forms the next government. “A ministry will be set up for irrigation. A commission for water management will also be established,” he said in an election campaign at Kangeyan in Tiruppur district. Special project The DMK chief said that a special project for the protection of lakes/tanks under the direct supervision of the Chief Minister at a cost of Rs. 10,000 crore and construction of 200 check dams at a cost of Rs. 2,000 crore will be implemented if his party comes to power. Enactment of a law to protect groundwater, implementation Tamirabarani, Karumeniyar and Nambiyar river linking, Cauvery-Gundar linking project, strengthening of the banks of estimation and rejuvenation of streams, strengthening and improvement of the banks of Cauvery, Tamirabarani and Vaigai, establishment of monsoon special control rooms and complete implementation of Athikadavu-Avinashi scheme were other promises of Mr. Stalin.  Poultry research centre His promises for the region included establishment of a poultry research centre at Palladam, Kangeyam bull research centre and bull shanty at Kangeyam, ring roads at Kangeyam, Vellakoil and Palladam, ESI hospitals at Palladam and Kangeyam, upgradation of Government hospitals at Dharapuram and Kangeyam and a study on the possibility to bring surplus water from Noyyal to fill tanks in Palladam. Campaigning for DMK candidates contesting in Kangeyam and Dharapuram and MDMK nominee at Palladam, he claimed that the AIADMK and the BJP will not win a single seat if his cadres work hard, not taking rest till the last voter is taken to the pollution station.  Pre-poll surveys “Pre-poll surveys say that DMK will come to power. But we should continue to do our hard work and not to take rest,” said Mr. Stalin invoking the advice of party’s patriarch late M. Karunanidhi. “BJP will not win even if they resort to whatever tricks they know. They have been washed out which we saw in the Parliamentary election [in Tamil Nadu]. At the same time, not a single AIADMK [candidate] should win. If you ask me why I am adamant that DMK should win in all the 234 seats, I am not greedy. Because if a single AIADMK candidate gets to win, he/she will be a BJP MLA. Not an AIADMK MLA,” he said. Mr. Stalin added that this was proven by Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam’s son P. Raveendranath Kumar, the only AIADMK candidate to have won in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, alleging that his letterhead bears the image of Prime Minister and BJP supremo Narendra Modi. Ridiculing that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was in fear of defeat, Mr. Stalin said that so many people have joined hands against the DMK which is not in power in the Centre and in the State. “They think that DMK can be defeated when ‘Kalaignar’ is not there. But he is there on the ground - in the minds of the cadres,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ministry-for-irrigation-to-be-formed/article34186651.ece

29 March 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Purchasing votes through money power is not good for democracy’||Since 1971, DMK general secretary Duraimurugan has contested from Katapadi for nine times in the Assembly elections. The 83-year-old veteran seeks re-election for the tenth time in the April 6 election. He appeared confident of victory and seemed relaxed when The Hindu met him at his house at Gandhi Nagar, Katpadi. Dressed in his trademark white T-shirt and dhoti, he spoke about how ideas of politics and politicians have changed and what he plans for the constituency.  From wall-posters to digital campaign, how do you see the change? Now there are no wall-posters, it is a digital culture. Owing to the advances in technology, news can spread faster than the conventional media. Our messages are now reaching the youngsters easily, and they are spreading them everywhere. You have been in politics for five decades. What changes do you see today? Politics has become money-minded, and service to the public has taken a back seat. Purchasing votes through money power is not good for democracy. I started competing in elections in 1971. The difference between the election then and today is that now money is the motive and I don’t think service is given enough importance. Earlier, the public used to demand improvements to amenities, such as water, transport, infrastructure and education, and renovation of temples. They would be happy if we fulfilled their wishes and used to vote for us. Now people have begun asking us how much money a candidate will give them. Who is to be blamed for this? Politicians have mentally spoilt the people by giving money. I don’t like this trend. The affluent think that they can win in an election if they have money. They don’t bother about service. Some politicians are contesting from unfamiliar constituencies and not from their home towns. They try to purchase votes and I’m betting even if they win, they will not bother to visit the constituency again or promote the welfare of their voters. People should understand that those who purchase votes will not serve them. This is the first Assembly election without your mentor and DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi. What advice from him propels you still?  Thalaivar [Karunanidhi] used to ask us to serve without any expectation. Winning or not is secondary, service should come first. How do you see the new generation of politicians? Especially after seeing stalwarts... Politicians of my generation developed knowledge by learning from scratch. I came to politics, having been inspired by former Chief Minister C.N. Annadurai’s Dravida Nadu ideology. I researched other small nations that got freedom and how they were managing their affairs. Now, people are not coming to politics to pursue any ideology. On the first day of joining, they ask what post he/she would get. They don’t know about leaders or their ideology. Not knowing something is okay, but remaining ignorant of it is no good. How do you strike a chord with the people in your constituency? I don’t do any preparation and don’t campaign door to door. People gather around me and I become one among them. I speak their language, and this has helped me win hearts all these years. What is the first thing that you will do for Katpadi if you win? Every election, I promise something, and I have fulfilled it. I have brought Palar water to Katpadi. If I am not able to keep my promise, I explain the reason. This time, I have promised to set up a super-speciality hospital like AIIMS. The second promise is to bring a SIPCOT [park] here on condition of giving jobs to local residents, too. I am confident of winning this election and fulfilling my promises.  Earlier, the public used to demand improvements to amenities. Now, people are asking us how much money a candidate will give them||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/purchasing-votes-through-money-power-is-not-good-for-democracy/article34186611.ece
29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Promised irrigation schemes can transform this dry region||The driest constituency of Virudhunagar district, Tiruchuli is craving for irrigation schemes that could help farmers raise a variety of crops from paddy to cotton. Except for Kariapatti Town panchayat, the constituency is dominated by rural areas of Kariapatti, Tiruchuli and Narikudi panchayat unions. For three decades, two irrigation schemes - Kambikudi and Sennalkudi schemes - that could bring surplus water from Vaigai river could not be properly executed. “Both the AIADMK and the DMK governments could not implement the most important Kambikudi channel scheme that would fill up 21 tanks to irrigate around 50,000 acres in the otherwise rain-fed areas,” said farmer A. Ammasi of Aviyur. Farmers growing paddy with rainwater often face shortage of water at the crucial period. “Ironically, this time around paddy, chilly and onions raised on vast areas were damaged by continuous rain. The inordinate delay in disbursal of compensation under crop insurance scheme also weighs down the worried farmers,” he said. Charcoal-making Lack of water has left sprawling areas of farmlands with wild growth of ‘karuvela’ trees (Prosopis juliflora). “The farmers saw an opportunity to make charcoal out of the invasive weed. But it is only the big traders who end up making money while those involved in making charcoal still struggle with a hand-to-mouth existence,” said S. Pethu, 36, of Thonukal. The labour and transport cost have become higher, eating into the profits, he rued. Lack of agriculture and industrial development has forced majority of the educated and illiterate masses to migrate to other towns seeking jobs. Both the ruling party and opposition parties have promised to implement both the irrigation schemes. “The Cauvery-Gundar river linking project will be expedited to benefit this dry area,” said All India Moovendar Munnani Kazhagam candidate S. Rajasekar, who is contesting on AIADMK’s Two Leaves symbol. An industrialist from Sivaganga and a known Thevar community leader, Mr. Rajasekar has been fielded against Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s Thangam Thennarasu, who is eyeing a hat-trick from Tiruchuli Assembly constituency. A former Minister, Mr. Thennarasu said a check dam across Gundar that has been sanctioned will help irrigation to some extent. However, local farmers have been complaining about ruining of Gundar with unchecked illegal sand mining all these years. “My immediate focus is to bring an arts and science college to the constituency. A college sanctioned by the DMK government was shifted to Sattur by the subsequent AIADMK government,” Mr. Thennarasu said. Stating that after upgradation of several schools when he was Minister for School Education, Mr. Thennarasu said that the number of students, both boys and girls, who want to get college education has increased manifold and they need to travel out of Tiruchuli to go to college. A farmers’ association leader, Mr. Rajasekar said that he would promote organic farming with periodical training with the help of experts. He has also promised to provide coaching centres for NEET and other competitive examinations. Industrial development too has been promised by both the Dravidian parties. Bus connectivity has still not matched the expectations of the rural people. So are the poor condition of roads in the constituency that shares borders with Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga and Madurai districts. In the Mukkulathor-dominated constituency, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam has fielded a strong candidate in K.K. Sivasamy, a former AIADMK MLA and Virudhunagar district secretary. Among other candidates in the fray are: S. Murugan (Makkal Needi Maiam), A. Anandajothi (Naam Tamilar) and K. Thirumurgan Palanisamy (Puthiya Tamilagam).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/promised-irrigation-schemes-can-transform-this-dry-region/article34186744.ece

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Readers Mail||For residents of Kanapadi hamlet at the foot of Pachaimalai hills, driving on the rough surface of the four kilometre stretch till Narasingapuram is an ordeal. TNSTC Tiruchi region operates services in the morning and evening for the convenience of school and college students. The road under the control of Uppiliyapuram Panchayat Union has not been renovated though several petitions were submitted to the authorities. Residents dependent on two-wheelers for their livelihood struggle particularly during the night hours as there is overgrowth of vegetation on the sides. The authorities must ensure safe driving for the residents of the hamlet at the earliest. Saravanan Natesan  Puthanampatti   During the course of immunisation of citizens against COVID-19 pandemic, the authorities must make sure that the aged people, particularly those with disabilities and belonging to the marginalised sections, are not left out. Those with poor physical and mental health and facing acute financial insecurity must be identified and immunised to prevent premature death. The COVID-19 crisis could well become the turning point for better treatment of older people. M.A. Aleem  Tiruchi   Adherence to COVID-19 safety protocol seems to have diminished. The current rise in cases could be blamed on the laxity in wearing face masks and maintaining physical distancing. Now being election time, higher precautions are required. T. M. Ranganathan  Srirangam   While the government's decision to carry out COVID-19 vaccination in the newly-started mini-clinics is appreciable, rural people can be covered under the immunisation drive only through equipping local clinics for the purpose. Regular presence of doctors and para-medical staff in local hospitals is a must at this crucial juncture. S.

Kanyakumari being a beautiful place with a large number of waterbodies, trees and paddy fields, it is sensible to give preference for environmental protection over a large privately-owned container terminal.

The last time it crossed the 3,000 mark was on November 5, 2020. According to the Department of Health and Family Welfare’s media bulletin, 2,004 cases were reported from Bengaluru Urban alone. The number of active cases in the State stood at 23,037 and 204 patients are being treated in intensive care units. As many as 1.06 lakh COVID-19 tests were conducted on Sunday. The positivity rate for the day stood at 2.89%, while the case fatality rate for the day stood at 0.38%. As many as 12 COVID-19 deaths were reported, taking the total number of deaths to 12,504.  A total of 3,806 people were vaccinated on Sunday, taking the total number in Karnataka to 16.87 lakh. This includes first and second doses of healthcare workers, frontline workers as well first doses of those above 60 years and between 45 to 60 with co-morbidities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cases-cross-3000-mark-again/article34186562.ece
29 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Property tax: Several cases to be reopened||The BBMP is once again attempting to recover dues from the owners of over 100 commercial properties that had been undervalued. The Total Station Survey (TSS) that was taken by the civic body of over 100 commercial properties in all zones in the city had revealed that the BBMP had lost more than Rs. 500 crore in property tax, including Rs. 116.93 crore in East zone alone. The report was tabled in the BBMP council in August 2020, following which the civic body issued notices to the property owners. However, after receiving their replies, many cases were closed by the zonal joint commissioners. But the Commissioner is in no mood to allow this. Civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad said the cases that were closed have all been reopened and fresh notices have been served to the property owners. “We are going to initiate stringent action to recover all dues from these commercial property owners who have undervalued their properties and declared less dues to the BBMP,” he said and added that the civic body would recover the dues along with interest. The TSS report was tabled more than once before the previous elected body. Former Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar had also constituted a committee to examine the TSS report, whether the demand notices raised for collection of dues had been issued properly and how much had been recovered. Citizens can pay the tax they owe to the BBMP under the Self-Assessment Scheme (SAS). The BBMP has the powers to examine it, sources said and pointed out that the TSS found large-scale discrepancies between what was declared and paid as tax by the owners of over 100 commercial properties and the ground reality. The BBMP is also looking at recovering dues from 4.1 lakh property owners who have reportedly wrongly assessed their tax. The civic body has already issued notices to 78,000 property owners, and would be issuing notices to others shortly. Property tax is one of the major revenue sources for the BBMP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/property-tax-several-cases-to-be-reopened/article34186549.ece
29 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RT-PCR rule hard to implement, say experts and officials||Although the State has made an RT-PCR negative certificate mandatory for people entering Bengaluru from all States from April 1, implementation of this rule is a Herculean task, said officials and COVID-19 experts. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Thursday announced that those who do not possess a negative certificate will be tested on arrival. Sources said this is practically impossible as scores of people come to Bengaluru by rail, road, air, besides private vehicles every day. Hard to monitor “Also, checking negative certificates at the entry points (except at the airport) of all travellers is not possible. This will only lead to a pile-up of vehicles at the borders and entry points,” said an official. Giridhar R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, admitted there are many practical difficulties in implementing this rule. “However, as the Government of India’s guidelines clearly indicate that inter-State travel cannot be restricted, this is the best the State could have done,” he said. “As done through the last year, it is yet again time for people to show the same amount of social responsibility in following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Even if random checks are done, it will send out a message that having a negative certificate is a must,” said Dr. Babu, who heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Indian Institute of Public Health in Bengaluru.  V. Ravi, another TAC member who is also the nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, also stated that implementation is a major bottleneck. “Unless some digital system such as Seva Sindhu, the portal used during lockdown for prior registration of people coming to Karnataka from other States, is activated again, it is impossible to check every traveller. This is the best option to help tighten enforcement,” he said. Stating that checking the negative certificate of every person arriving is practically impossible, the doctor said it would only lead to huge traffic blocks at the entry points. Also, collecting swabs at the entry points and making them wait till the test reports come is another ordeal, he said. Seva Sindhu was used extensively last year and had streamlined the process of screening at entry points. “If that is in place again, people will have no other go but to upload their certificates on the portal for entry into Bengaluru. I will raise this in the next TAC meeting,” said Dr. Ravi. Protocol awaited BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said the Health Department will come out with protocol for implementing the guidelines. “We will follow the department’s protocols,” he said. Asked if Seva Sindhu would be reactivated as part of the implementation strategy, the commissioner said the government will take a call on that in a day or two. Meanwhile, the TAC met late on Friday night to review the testing targets based on the new positivity rate in districts.  Unless some digital system such as Seva Sindhu is activated again, it is impossible to check every traveller. This is the best option to help tighten enforcement V.

29 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pandemic exposed State MSMEs to miseries||The pandemic-brought lockdown and an unproductive year was like a violent storm followed by an uneasy calm for about 10 lakh medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs) in Karnataka that employ around 60 lakh people. Most of these have seen a total destruction of their supply chain. With revenue streams drying up and labour force returning to their hometowns, they faced a huge cash crunch. Micro enterprises were left to operate at suboptimal levels; many had a hand-to-mouth existence, and were unable to purchase raw materials or pay wages. Meeting overheads/operational costs became a daunting task for most MSMEs as banks refused them credit. But what was worse was that most schemes and relief packages by the Union and State governments came with riders and restrictive clauses. Fighting for survival A year after, and cases rising again, Karnataka’s once vibrant MEME ecosystem tells a different story: thousands of micro businesses have gone down the drain, hundreds of small businesses are still fighting for survival while only a small number of medium and large-scale enterprises have managed to survive. Trade bodies who represent these enterprises say that businesses need government support without riders so that relief packages become more real, meaningful and inclusive. President of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Perikal M. Sundar was of the opinion that the government should support the MSME sector by offering direct cash benefits instead of pushing them under the debt trap by compelling them to borrow. “Small and medium scale firms are still staring at the uncertainty promulgated by the devastating pandemic-induced lockdown. Unfortunately, MSMEs which did not have existing loans or were not classified as NPAs (non-performing assets) weren’t qualified to benefit from the government's Rs. 20 lakh crore relief package,” he said. The hike in fuel prices was an additional burden. Trade bodies in general claim that the operating cost of MSMEs has gone up by 30% as a consequence of the recent hike in fuel prices. Despite drastic disruptions followed by the lockdown and economic slowdown, some enterprises could overcome some supply chain bottlenecks and be able to bring back some normalcy in the last couple of quarters. “However, if there is a second wave, the MSME apple cart would be upset beyond recovery and repair,” warned K.B. Arasappa, president, Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association (KASSIA). “Notwithstanding the challenges and current circumstances, MSMEs in the State are hopeful that things will turn close to normalcy by 2022,” he added. D.R. Subramanyam, member, CII Karnataka State Council, said, a few sectors like defence and aerospace were seeing some recovery while many other industries, mostly due to price hike in commodities and raw material are yet to get back on growth track. Other sectors where demand has not picked up yet included garments and textiles, he added. Digital acceleration On the positive side, the pandemic ushered in digital acceleration, which probably would not have happened in the next 10 years. T.R. Parasuraman, president, Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC), said, “A large number of MSMEs were able to catch up with online and digital race in the last one year.” MEMEs built a substantial online presence for themselves. As a result, their customer touch-points have dramatically increased. To an extent, these digital advancements brought in some amount of comfort and confidence to the MEME ecosystem. In addition to this, many micro and small enterprises innovated their businesses and repurposed their production centres to make essential commodities and items, Mr. Parasuraman added. MSME segment has over 65 million units and gives employment to over 120 million individuals. It adds to more than 30% of the GDP. It acts as a strong catalyst for the socio-economic development of the country. MSME units are also manufacturing ancillary to large corporations, with a sizeable number operating in backward areas. With the Government’s focus on achieving a $5 trillion economy target by 2025, the untapped potential of the MSME sector towards this target is worth noting for building a resilient ecosystem all across the country, as per a study by BCIC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pandemic-exposed-state-msmes-to-miseries/article34186553.ece
29 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Surge in positivity rate in some districts a matter of concern||As the number of COVID-19 cases surge, the positivity rate in some districts is a matter of concern. According to analysis provided by the State COVID-19 war room, the symptomatic positivity rate in Bengaluru Urban is as high as 17.1%, followed by Bengaluru Rural (10.3%), and Dakshina Kannada district (10.1%). The symptomatic positivity rate over the last seven days across the State stood at 2.7%. Even while experts have acknowledged the second wave of COVID-19 infections in the State, 12 districts have managed to have a symptomatic positivity rate below 1%. The asymptomatic positivity rate, however, continues to remain at 0.8%. The asymptomatic positivity rate in Bidar stands at 2%, while it is 1.8% in Bengaluru Rural and 1.7% in Kalaburagi. M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said people were becoming lax about COVID-19 appropriate behaviour such as wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. “The new variants are more contagious and therefore, the positivity rate in many districts like Bengaluru Urban is high,” he said. He also added that the vaccination was taking place at a negligible pace. He, however, was optimistic and hoped that the number of people who are hospitalised during the second wave would reduce. Many districts with high test positivity rates were given revised testing targets so that the infections could be detected early. N. Manjunath Prasad, Commissioner, BBMP, said the civic body was conducting targeted testing of symptomatic patients, which was leading to a higher symptomatic positivity rate. He said the Chief Minister would convene a review meeting on Monday to review the surge in cases in Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/surge-in-positivity-rate-in-some-districts-a-matter-of-concern/article34186564.ece
29 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kannada crosswords now on mobile phones||If reading the newspaper with a steaming cup of coffee is still a routine for many, solving crosswords – that daily fixture in most newspapers – seems to be a fast vanishing hobby, especially among the youth. Coming to the rescue of crosswords are apps, bringing them to your mobile phones. Indic Crosswords, an app for crosswords in Indian languages started over a year ago, recently started services in Kannada, offering a crossword a day for free. Gautam Chandra, a Telugu-speaking techie presently based out of South Korea, had always been a crossword aficionado. This was disrupted once he moved abroad as crosswords in his native tongue were not available. “To fill this gap, which I was sure many others staying abroad also felt, I started an app publishing a crossword everyday and soon expanded it to Tamil as well. The response was so good that I have now started publishing crosswords in Kannada as well,” Mr. Chandra told The Hindu.  Indic Crosswords has now tied up with noted Kannada crossword writer A.N. Prahlad Rao, who has begun publishing a 7X7 crossword on the app daily. “Sadly, solving crosswords is a vanishing habit. Earlier, elders and women at home used to regularly solve them, while children were prescribed to do so to improve their language. But nowadays, that doesn’t seem to be the case. I hope that taking crosswords to mobile phones will encourage the youth,” he hoped. While the app will publish a crossword everyday for free, Mr. Chandra said he plans to introduce a gallery of over 500 crosswords which one can subscribe to and solve.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kannada-crosswords-now-on-mobile-phones/article34186555.ece
29 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Common exam board remains a dream||The State government’s plan to merge the Karnataka Secondary Education and Examination Board (KSEEB) and the Department of Pre-University Education (DPUE) to have a single examination board that will conduct the class 10 and 12 examinations for 2020 seems to be a distant dream. Although the government constituted a committee and a sub-committee to look into the modalities and suggest measures for smooth transition of the boards, no further concrete efforts have been made. A member of the committee said that so far, two meetings were planned and scheduled but were cancelled. A Government Order for constituting the committees was formed on March 1, 2021. The plan for a common board was mooted in 2016 after the Chemistry II PU examination paper was leaked twice, causing distress to lakhs of students. Each year, around 8.5 lakh students appear for the SSLC examination and six lakh students appear for the II PU examination. According to sources, having a common board would help maintain the confidentiality in the examination process and help DPUE and the Department of Public Instruction look into various administrative matters pertaining to school and PU departments. A source in the department said: “Having a common board will ensure that more reforms are brought into the examination sector. Further, the separate body can be entrusted with analysing the performance of students so that proper remedial action can be taken in particular subjects or educational institutions,” a source added. Susheela S., parent of a class 12 student, said: “Besides conducting the examination in a confidential manner, the board would have helped ensure that the examination this year is conducted keeping in mind the safety concerns of students.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/common-exam-board-remains-a-dream/article34186561.ece

The SIT wants to question him on the allegation made by the woman in the CD, based on which the police registered an FIR against him. It may be recalled that this is the second time Mr. Jarkiholi is being questioned by SIT after the one on March 16. His phone had been taken on March 24 for an FSL analysis. The SIT officials also issued notices to the family members of the prime suspects who are on the run. Meanwhile, Jagadish Kumar, advocate representing the woman in the CD, said that she was likely to appear before the court on Monday to give her statement. This is because the woman had a trust issue with the SIT, especially after her parents who were questioned, were allegedly forced to give a statement favouring Mr. Jarkiholi. The statement before a magistrate, according to Mr. Kumar, will be authentic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sit-asks-jarkiholi-to-appear-before-it-for-questioning/article34186580.ece

When it comes to passengers trains, we are running about 10% because they are unreserved and protocols needs to be followed strictly. We are constantly in touch with State governments and the Health Ministry regarding permitting people to travel without reservations. Moving forward, every day, we are increasing the number of services, especially mail express.” He further said that the Railways had made notable achievements in terms of operating freight trains after the outbreak of the pandemic. “Freight services were not operational for four months after the outbreak. But later, it picked up well. In the current financial year, we have carried more freight than the entire period of last year. We are expected to touch the highest ever freight loading in the history of railways, indicating that the economy is bouncing back and railways is the engine of economic growth,” he added. “Traditionally, we were carrying iron ore, steel, coal, and cement. This year, we added different streams of traffic by loading automobiles, fly ash, sand and other items,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/more-trains-to-be-operated-in-coming-days-railway-board-chief/article34186551.ece

This comes after the State government made it compulsory for food handlers to be tested for the viral infection once every 15 days. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) N. Manjunath Prasad told The Hindu that all those who tested positive were asymptomatic and had been isolated. “All those who had visited the pub in the recent past should consider getting tested. While the pub has not been closed, it has been sanitised and may function with the remainder of the staff who have tested negative,” he said. It may be recalled that the BBMP Hoteliers’ Association and hotel owners had initially resisted testing of food handlers. The civic chief said in the light of increase in cases in the city, it was important to regularly test food handlers, especially given that most of those who are testing positive are asymptomatic. “All sorts of food handlers, including caterers, are being tested,” he said. Meanwhile, there are 30 COVID-19 positive persons who have been admitted to the COVID Care Centre at Haj Bhavan, including 22 men and 8 women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/staff-of-pub-test-positive/article34186556.ece

The protest was staged soon after Mr. Jarkiholi’s supporters protested against Congress State president D.K. Shivakumar in Belagavi. The protesters shouted slogans accusing the government of protecting Mr. Jarkiholi despite being booked in a rape case. “The rules in the State are so strong that even anyone involved in eve-teasing or misbehaving with a woman will be arrested. Then why there is different treatment for Mr. Jharkiholi,” the protesters wondered. As soon as the FIR was filed against Mr. Jarkiholi with serious charges, he held a press conference to clarify. Instead of arresting him, the police gave protection to him for the press conference, they ridiculed. Meanwhile, Congress women’s wing protested outside Mr. Jharkiholi’s residence demanding that he be arrested. The police detained over 30 members later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/arrest-former-minister-demands-youth-congress/article34186577.ece

In addition, about 5,500 post-graduate students will write the examinations from mid-April. The undergraduate examinations will be conducted in 200 centres. The number of examination centres for undergraduate students have been reduced from 211 last year as some colleges expressed difficulty in conducting the examinations due to various factors, he said and added that the post-graduate examinations will be held in 16 centres. “Like the last time, we will hold special examinations for such students who are not able to write their papers if they are positive for COVID-19 and under quarantine,” Mr. Dharma who is also in-charge Registrar (administration), said. He said that the classes on the university’s Mangalagangotri campus were suspended for a week till March 29 after 15 students on campus were found positive for COVID-19.

29 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Approach legislators to get issues resolved, says Kateel||Dakshina Kannada MP and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Sunday urged people to approach legislators to get their issues resolved with regard to developmental projects instead of courts that delay the projects. He was speaking after laying the foundation stone for two twin railway underbridges (RUBs) under two railway lines and connecting four-lane road at Mahakalipadpu between Morgan’'s Gate and Jeppinamogaru here. Mr. Kateel said people from nearby areas of developmental works would be inconvenienced during execution. It is only temporary for the good of the entire city. Referring to a complete halt to projects under the Smart City Project for three months due to court stay, he appealed to people to amicably resolve the issues with the help of elected representatives. Otherwise developments would come to a standstill. The demand for Mahakalipadpu RUBs was more than three decades old and the present governments at the State and the Centre were able to resolve the same. While D. Vedavyasa Kamath, Mangaluru South MLA, could get the RUBs part sanctioned under the Smart City Project (Rs. 30 crore deposited with the Railways), another Rs. 19 crore was arranged through MPLAD, Mr. Kateel said. Contract was awarded to M/s Mugrodi Constructions, who have built the Gurupura bridge in record time of one year instead of two. The RUB project top, Mr. Kateel hoped, would get completed early, before the given time of one year. On the occasion, Mr. Kateel felicitated one Thukaram, who agreed to provide 23 cents of land for road widening under the TDR scheme. Mr. Kamath said the face of Mangaluru would completely change by 2024-25 with a host of developmental works being undertaken by MSCL, the government and the Mangaluru City Corporation. The MCC was able to get over 20 acres of land to widen over 200 km roads in the city, a unique achievement among city corporations in the city. The MLA said he was working with the MP and the Railways to get another RUB constructed near Kannagudde for a road connecting Moobidri-Mangaluru highway with Mangaluru-Bengaluru highway. The road was being widened to 60 MTS and would join the Bengaluru highway near Padil skirting Bikarnakatte. Mayor Premanand Shetty said the Mahakalipadpu RUBs would also help formation of the Netravathi riverfront road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/approach-legislators-to-get-issues-resolved-says-kateel/article34186947.ece

29 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||RUBs to solve commuting woes of residents of South Mangaluru||Commuting woes of residents of South Mangaluru towards Thokkottu and Kerala as well as visitors from those areas to central business district are on the way of getting addressed with the foundation stone being laid for two twin Railway under bridges (RUBs) and development of connecting road at Mahakalipadpu on Sunday. With frequent passing of trains to and from Mangaluru Central, the gate at the Mahakalipadpu Railway Level Crossing gets closed frequently that results in vehicles lined up at both the ends on the narrow stretch of the road. The stretch has been a thoroughfare between Jeppinamogaru (National Highway 66) and the central business district, including Hampanakatte, Fishing Harbour and surrounding areas with thousands of vehicles making use of the same for daily commute. The existing narrow road with width varying from 4.5 m to 5 m would be widened to a uniform width of 18 m with four lane carriageway, concrete box drainages, street lights and other facilities at a total cost of Rs. 50 crore. Of the 1,0789 m long road between NH 66 Junction and Morgan’s Gate, 941 m would be 18 m wide and 137b m near the Junction would be 24 m wide. Of this, Rs. 30.7 crore, coming from Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) would be utilised for the construction of two twin RUBs while Rs. 19.87 crore from the MPLAD funds would be utilise for the construction and widening of the approach road. The four-lane road would not take the existing alignment; but moves on a new alignment. The existing two-lane RUB under the Mumbai Railway line would be demolished and a twin RUB with box pushing technology would be built at the same spot. While the existing road from the NH junction takes a right turn after this RUB towards Mahakalipadpu level crossing gate, the new alignment has proposed another twin RUB beneath the Mangaluru Central line, just after the Mumbai line. Thereafter, the new road passes besides the Yenepoya Timber factory and joins Morgan’s Gate via Shettibettu Junction, said MSCL’s General Manager Arun Prabha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rubs-to-solve-commuting-woes-of-residents-of-south-mangaluru/article34186949.ece

29 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Major roads identified for development in new layouts||To ease the flow of traffic in key growth areas of the city, the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) has identified 14 roads for development. Though these are not the main arterial roads of the city, they provide critical links within the fast-developing localities and hence the MUDA will develop them at a cost of Rs. 24 crore in the new financial year. This road connecting J.P. Nagar to the Outer Ring Road and linking to Mandakalli and BEML Layout and entails widening the existing stretch to 18m or nearly 60 ft. Similarly, the Adichunchanagari Road from Srirampura 2nd stage to Manandawadi Road will also be developed and widened to ease congestion seen during peak hour. The MUDA has allotted Rs. 1 crore each for both the road works. The New Kantharaja Urs Road is emerging as a major commercial stretch and though it is within the MCC limits, the MUDA proposes to complete the extension work that is under way for which it has earmarked Rs. 50 lakh. The existing stretch linking Christ Public School at Bogadi with the main road will be developed into a 80-ft road given the high traffic in this part of the city. Similarly, the road linking Netaji Circle at Dattagalli 3rd Stage, through survey number 170/1 and 238, with Outer Ring Road will be repaired and developed by the MUDA. These are some of the new localities that are fast developing in Mysuru and the road link was critical for the commuting public, according to the MUDA authorities. In Vijaynagar 3rd Stage coming under Hinkal gram panchayat, the existing 24m wide road will be extended and linked with the Hunsur Main Road at a cost of Rs. 1.75 crore.

29 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Survey done to establish forest area, clear encroachments||A GPS-based survey conducted jointly by the Revenue and the Forest departments in Chamarajanagar district is expected to end years of confusion and dispute over land ownership and the extent of encroachment around BRT Tiger Reserve. The joint survey covering nearly 22,000 acres of land was completed recently. M.R. Ravi, Deputy Commissioner, Chamarajanagar, confirmed the completion of the survey and said the exercise had helped demarcate forest land from revenue land but it was only the first step. Clarification sought “I have sought clarification from the government on certain technical aspects and the question of clearing the encroachment comes next,” he added. The Forest Department could be occupying revenue land in some places and it could be the other way round in other areas and the survey has given a clear picture, said Mr. Ravi. The issue came to the fore when the Upalokayukta heard a complaint filed by K. Somanna in 2003. The complainant had alleged that though they had been cultivating the land, Forest and Revenue departments authorities had not demarcated the land or taken steps to confirm their rights by mutating the names in the revenue records according to their occupation. In 2003, the Lokayukta directed that the Survey numbers 2, 3, and 4 of Biligirirangana Betta measuring 22,640 acres and 6 guntas be taken up for a joint survey but it was not taken up.  ‘Darkhast’ grant It also came to the fore during the case that in the 1960s, nearly 300 acres of land was granted as ‘darkhast’ to tribal people and another 125 acres of land was transferred to the Revenue Department. But in the absence of records of the exact area of land granted,demarcation could not be taken up and the legality of the transfer of forest land was questioned. The institution of the Upalokayukta was also informed by the Deputy Director of Land Records that the land under cultivation or unauthorised occupation had increased and was higher than the land released by the Forest Department. However, the Forest Department in 2011 submitted that the Maharaja of Mysore had invoked provisions of Section 35 (iii) of Mysore Forest Act XI of 1900 and through a GO dated February 26, 1938 notified nearly 22,600 acres of land as forest area. Hence it wanted all grants to be cancelled, including the land transferred to the Revenue Department, and the land restored to the Forest Department. The Upalokayukta noted in it order dated 2018 that the records indicate that an area of 22,611 acres of Biligirirangana Betta was declared as a reserve forest under the then Mysore Forest Act. Despite that the government of the day granted 425 acres of land as ‘darkhast’ in the 1960s, officials were unable to provide documents for de-reserving the forest land. Also, based on the documents submitted by the Chamarajanagar district administration to the Upalokayukta, the order indicated that 56 people had been granted land of different dimensions during 2008 and these land come under forest area. The Upalokayukta passed its final order on February 27, 2018 directing the authorities to remove all encroachments and restore the entire forest area as per the notification “within one month”. But after three years of the order, the joint survey has just been completed and will help determine the forest area from revenue land and pave the way for clearing the encroachments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/survey-done-to-establish-forest-area-clear-encroachments/article34186583.ece
29 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Post renovation works, BR Hills temple to reopen on April 3||The doors of the historical Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Temple at BR Hills at Yelandur in Chamarajanagar will reopen to devotees on April 3, consequent to the completion of the renovation works. Rituals from today Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi said that various rites and rituals related to the presiding deity will commence from Monday and will go on till April 2 after which the temple will be open to the public from the next day. Rs. 2.5-crore cost The temple was closed in 2017 and the restoration works were taken up with guidance from the Department of Archaeology at a cost of Rs. 2.5 crore. This included dismantling the slab stones, pillars and beams and relaying or replacing them where necessary apart from plugging the seepages which affected the structural stability of the temple. In addition, a gopura has been constructed apart from relaying the floor and electrical works within the precincts for power supply. The Deputy Commissioner said a few minor works remain to be completed but it will not come in the way of the devotees visiting the temple. Though it was initially planned to complete the works and reopen it last year, the outbreak of COVID-19 and the extended lockdown delayed the completion of the works. This is the first time in the history of the temple, said to be at-least 500 years old, that it was closed for the public and a repair and renovation work on this scale has been taken up. B.R. Hills is a popular destination for tourists and a visit to the hills is incomplete without a visit to the temple. Information about the deity as provided in the official website of the Muzrai Department suggests that the idol of the Sri Ranganathaswamy, was installed by the sage Vashishta thus underlining its hoary past.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/br-hills-temple-to-open-on-apr-3/article34186566.ece

Shivakumar. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, KPCC spokesperson M. Lakshmana condemned the use of abusive language.

29 March 2021||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||Mudgal is base camp for parties fighting Maski bypolls||Mudgal town in Lingsugur taluk of Raichur district has turned out to be the centre of attraction for political parties after the announcement of byelections for the Maski Assembly Constituency. A fort town, Mudgal, which has connections to the Kakatiyas, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Bahmani Sultanate and the Devagiri Yadavas and has rich heritage, has seen many a battle between the Vijayanagar Kings and the Bahmani Sultans to capture the fort. It was an important outpost of the Kakatiya kingdom in the beginning of the 14th century and also an educational centre for students from various parts of the country in the11th century. Now, after the declaration of the bypolls, both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have set up camp in the town by making all arrangements for the stay of their respective leaders to prepare plans to win the byelections in Maski which is just 15 km away from Mudgal. Lingsugur Congress MLA D.S. Hoolageri and Hungund BJP MLA Doddanagowda Patil have allowed party activities in their bungalows and also converted them as houses for the stay of Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah and BJP State vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra, respectively. On the other hand, a farmhouse has been set up for the stay of KPCC working presidents Satish Jarkiholi and Eshwar Khandre and also for senior Congress leader and MLA Amaregowda Bayyapur. “All arrangements for the stay of the leaders have been made. Leaders of both parties are expected to discuss the party strength and make strategies to win the byelections,” sources close to both parties have said. There is no information about other leaders who may accompany Mr. Vijayendra. As the Janata Dal(S) is not contesting the byelections, the BJP and the Congress have taken this bypolls as a prestigious fight and are considering one another seriously. Mr. Siddaramaiah is expected to arrive on Monday to take part in the filing of nomination papers by the Congress candidate Basanagouda Turvihal. According to preliminary information, he will arrive by helicopter at a helipad set up near the bungalow of Mr. Hulageri. “Mr. Siddaramaiah will go to Maski from Mudgal and participate in the filing of nomination papers,” the sources said. Meanwhile, the reason why political parties have chosen Mudgal for their activities is that the town has good road connectivity to Lingsugur, Maski and Sindhanur towns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mudgal-is-base-camp-for-parties-fighting-maski-bypolls/article34186785.ece

Visvesvaraya Railway Terminal at Baiyappanahalli, which is all set for commercial operations, was inspected by Railway Board Chairman Suneet Sharma on Sunday. Once operational, the terminal is expected to handle 32 pairs of trains. After the inspection, he told mediapersons that facilities provided at the new terminal are in tune with the development of Bengaluru. “The Railways has provided state of the art facilities, which include centralised AC, seven platforms, escalators, spacious parking lots. The terminal will give the much-needed respite for railway passengers as it will help in decongesting the other two operational terminals (KSR Bengaluru and Yeshwanthpur) in the city,” he said. Asked about the inauguration date, he said, “We are waiting for a date from the Prime Minister’s Office, and the terminal will be operational shortly.” About maintenance of the AC station once it becomes operational, the Divisional Railway Manager (Bengaluru) Ashok Kumar Verma said an agency has already been roped in to maintain cleanliness. Officials claimed that platforms and other public areas of the station will be cleaned on a regular basis, like metro stations. The new terminal is spread over 4,200 square metres and can handle passenger footfall of 50,000. On measures to improve patronage for the airport train services, General Manager of SWR Ajay Kumar Singh said that, at present, demand for unreserved tickets is not promising and action will be taken to improve the ridership once the COVID-19 situation improves. Hardly 100 people travel each day in five pairs of trains from the city to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/baiyappanahalli-terminal-will-be-made-operational-shortly/article34186550.ece

Stricter vigil has to be there for those coming to Bengaluru. The Home Minister also concurred with my views,” he said, adding that they would apprise the Chief Minister about the current situation and possible steps to be initiated. Besides Dr. Sudhakar, Mr. Bommai, Revenue Minister R. Ashok, and Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar are expected to meet the Chief Minister.

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi, facing sexual harassment charges, addressed the press on Saturday minutes after the parents of the woman accused KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar of engineering the whole “conspiracy”. Mr. Jarkiholi said the parents’ statement was proof of his “innocence”, thumped his chest and called himself a true gandasu (man), while describing his adversary with an unprintable abuse that alliterates with the same word . Coming from a man accused of sexual harassment, this choice of language, loaded with toxic masculinity, made one’s eyes pop. In fact, through the controversy, the debate has constantly veered, in one manner or the other, away from the question at the heart of the issue — was a young woman sexually exploited by a man in a position of power? A similar sidetracking happened when Health Minister K. Sudhakar(in picture)made it all out to be a question of personal righteousness and dared all MLAs to take a test of monogamy. Are we to think that in a country where women are worshipped, “sexual harassment” is an idea beyond the imagination and even the vocabulary of all the good men?   During the recent protest in the Legislative Assembly over the CD scandal, Congress members were in a competition of sorts in shouting slogans. Members, including Bheema Naik, Ajay Singh, Priyank Kharge, Rizwan Arshad, Anjali Nimbalkar, and Sowmya Reddy(in picture), demonstrated not only the art of coining innovative slogans but also their lung power. Others were only found repeating after them. It was a good photo op too as they held CDs in their hands. Among the winning slogans were ‘Bombay Mitai beda beda ‘, ‘Down, down Bombay boys’, making references to the Mumbai sojourn of the MLAs who deserted the Congress and the JD(S) and joined the BJP to eventually bring down the coalition government. While senior leaders stood in the well of the House, young members maintained the tempo of sloganeering for more than an hour, till the House adjourned for lunch on the last day of the Budget session. Of course, some members had a glass of water more than once. Bageshree S.  Nagesh Prabhu||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cop/article34186575.ece
29 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Ambalappuzha to keep everyone guessing||Ambalappuzha has a history of working-class struggles and resistant movements. But that doesn’t mean the constituency is an absolute Left bastion. It has often sided with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI (M)] but at times embraced the Congress and its allies. In the 1965 Assembly polls, the first since its inception, CPI(M) leader V.S. Achuthanandan tasted defeat in Ambalappuzha against K.S. Krishna Kurup of the Congress. A bit of history Mr. Achuthanandan emerged victorious in the seat in the next two elections in 1967 and 1970. However, he was prevented from completing a hat-trick in Ambalappuzha when he lost poll in the 1977 election. Both CPI (M) and Congress candidates won from the constituency in the following elections. The turn of the century saw D. Sugathan of the Congress emerging victorious in the 2001 poll. That remains the last time a UDF candidate won from Ambalappuzha. Mr. Sudhakaran, Public Works Minister in the present Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, won thrice on the trot (2006, 2011 and 2016) in Ambalappuzha. The last of the victories saw him defeating his nearest rival Sheikh P. Harris of the UDF by a margin of 22,621 votes. With Mr. Sudhakaran not in the poll fray this time, it is a new ball game altogether in the constituency. The LDF has fielded H. Salam of the CPI (M) to continue the winning streak, while the UDF has given ticket to District Congress Committee president M. Liju. The National Democratic Alliance, which is expecting a good show, has fielded Anoop Antony, national secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of BJP. The NDA had garnered 22,730 and 25,061 votes in the segment in the 2016 Assembly polls and 2019 Lok Sabha elections respectively. The emergence of the NDA is expected to make the battle much closer this time. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, UDF candidate had gained a lead of 638 votes in the Assembly segment. However, the LDF came to power in all the five grama panchayats and Alappuzha municipality (part of the Alappuzha municipal area falls in Ambalappuzha Assembly constituency) in the 2020 local body polls. On Sunday afternoon, LDF candidate Salam was on the second round of his electioneering at Municipal Stadium and Mullakkal wards of Alappuzha municipality. In receptions accorded to him at Kongini Chudukkad and near Thumba Parambh temple, he says that he is one among them. He urges the electorate to vote for continuity. Mr. Salam says that to continue development initiatives it is imperative the LDF remains in power. UDF candidate Mr. Liju in the morning visited a church at Punnapra and met believers on the occasion of Palm Sunday. Liju, who is trying his luck for the second time in Ambalappuzha, is seeking votes for a change. Mr. Antony, the NDA candidate, who had a busy schedule on Sunday visited church, met Alappuzha Diocese Bishop Fr. James Anaparambil and in the evening participated in a roadshow and campaign meetings with Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Giriraj Singh. He is highlighting the achievements of the BJP government at the Centre and his development plans for the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ambalappuzha-to-keep-everyone-guessing/article34186901.ece

The 110-year-old church, presently under the CSI (Church of South India) Church, was constructed in Gothic style. The church is linked to a British cemetery, which was constructed much earlier. The authorities are keen on keeping the church intact and the maintenance work is being undertaken without disturbing the original structure. It is likely to be reopened for public after a week. According to Suresh B., treasurer of the church, the renovation of the roof is nearing completion. The church will be maintained intact, he added. The church authorities have decided to preserve the nearby cemetery as well. It is a historical landmark in Munnar which attracts tourists, he said. The construction of the church started in 1910 and was completed in 1911. The church was built using rough-hewn granite and most of the materials were imported from England. Henry Mansfield Knight, manager of the British tea plantation, built the church to fulfil the wish of his wife to be buried near a church. His wife, Eleanor Isabel May died at an young age, soon after her marriage due to cholera. Her tomb was the first to be built, even before the construction of the church. According to documents, Eleanor died at the age of 24 on December 23, 1894. Other Britishers who died in Munnar were also buried on the hill. There are plaques inside the church mentioning the contributions made by the Britishers to Munnar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/munnars-british-era-church-getting-a-facelift/article34186872.ece

GopakumarKochi,KERALA||Don’t shield corrupt officers, HC tells police info panel||The Kerala High Court verdict holding that the information authority under the police cannot shield the names of officers who have been found guilty or dismissed from service on charges of corruption or human rights violations has brought cheers to Right to Information (RTI) and human rights activists. Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan passed the verdict while disposing of a petition filed by the State Public Information Officer (Deputy Superintendent of Police) and Appellate Authority (Superintendent of Police) of the Crime Records Bureau, Thiruvananthapuram, against the State Information Commission’s directive to publish details of corrupt officers who are found guilty in a court of law or dismissed from service on charges of corruption and human rights violations and also upload the names of the officers against whom charges of corruption or human rights violation are established through investigation on the website of the police. Court ruling The court, however, ordered that the details of officers against whom the offences had been established on investigation, but a conclusive finding has not been arrived at by a court of law need not be published. The court upheld the other directives of the State Information Commission to publish the names of officers convicted on corruption or human rights violations and were removed from services after a due process of inquiry. The High Court also ordered that these directives be strictly complied with. The court added that the police information authority “will not be justified in shielding the names of such officers and will be bound to publish the same” notwithstanding the fact that Section 4 of the RTI Act did not oblige them to publish such information. The petitioners contended that if the information sought by the RTI activists was disclosed it would demoralise the police force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dont-shield-corrupt-officers-hc-tells-police-info-panel/article34186873.ece
29 March 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Claims and counterclaims as campaign shifts gears||It was 6.30 a.m. and the vehicle was ready outside the house to pick United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate Satheeshan Pacheni. Wearing a white shirt and dhoti, he hurriedly gets into his vehicle to ensure that he starts the campaign early and meets the maximum number of people at various places in the Kannur constituency. He needs no introduction as people easily recognises him when he steps out of his vehicle to greet them. As he quickly moves between houses, shops and educational institutions, people assure him their mandate. Mr. Pacheni says Kannur had always been a UDF belt and the people have faith and confidence in him. Though the UDF suffered a setback in 2016, it was a closed chapter now and the coalition is working as one unit to win back the constituency. “People were expecting a solution to traffic congestion. We were told road infrastructure will be developed, flyovers will be constructed, and port infrastructure will be developed, which will help traders and the business community. We were hoping that the handloom and tourism sectors will get a push. What happened to these promises? All these remained on paper. LDF governance was a disappointment,” he tells a group of voters. On the contrary, Left Democratic Front candidate Kadannappally Ramachandran, who has been fielded for the second time to contest against Mr. Pacheni, says these are baseless allegations. Walking through the narrow lanes at Valiyannur North, he stops to meet 103-year-old Kalyaniamma. She becomes emotional on meeting him. She poses for a photo and blesses him victory. The Congress (S) leader says the LDF government had done a remarkable job and fulfilled the promises given to the people and carried out development works worth Rs. 1,400 crore in the constituency. District hospital The district hospital has been developed. Schools and ITI have been made hi-tech, macadam roads have come. People have recognised the work of the LDF in the constituency and the other factors, predicted to favour the UDF, do not bother him, he says. Meanwhile, National Democratic Alliance candidate Archana Vandichal, who is busy campaigning at Varam in the constituency, says people want a change and they are pinning their hope on the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition. Most of the development works the LDF and the UDF boast about are, in fact, Central government schemes. Any development whether it is development of the Payyambalam beach, roads, and many others are included in the the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme implemented by the Centre, she says. “Many other schemes which will help the poor have lapsed. We are bringing these things to the attention of the people,” she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/claims-and-counterclaims-as-campaign-shifts-gears/article34186896.ece

Venugopal has said. Speaking to the media here on Sunday, he said they had only opposed the delay in the distribution of kit with an aim to get votes. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] believed that it could win the elections by postal and fraudulent votes and this could not be accepted, he said. Mr. Venugopal said the study conducted by his party found more than 10 lakh bogus voters included on the voters’ list in the State. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had already given proof of 4.5 lakh such voters to the Chief Electoral Officer of Kerala. The AICC had also asked the Election Commission of India to take immediate action on the issue. It was found that some voters had multiple votes in some constituencies, and at times in the same booth. Names of people who had passed away were also found on the voters’ list, he alleged. Mr. Venugopal said the names of Congress leaders were also added to the list multiple times to avoid any controversy over the double vote. Double entries of Congress leaders’ names were part of a CPI(M) conspiracy, he said. The Congress had demanded the removal of all those who had double votes. The CPI(M) had not yet lodged a complaint or demanded that the dual vote on the voters’ list be rejected. The Election Commission should take action against such anti-democratic measures, he added. Mr. Venugopal also alleged fraud in the postal vote schedule in the State. Postal ballot was being given to those who did not even have ID card, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/venugopal-refutes-charge/article34186877.ece

29 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||A five-cornered fight on the cards||Entering the Kochi Assembly constituency, one gets the impression of an electoral bullring with all conceivable space being consumed by campaign materials. Quite unsurprising for a constituency, a rare one across the State to witness a five-cornered contest with the relatively new apolitical outfits, Twenty20 and V4 People, also throwing their hats in the ring along with the three major fronts. As the battle gets intense, candidates are leaving no stone unturned to win it. United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate and former Mayor Tony Chammany could be seen wielding a long knife to slice a piece of meat at an abattoir on Statue Road at Fort Kochi during the course of his campaign. “Unlike the last election, the UDF is a united front, and we are expecting a victory margin of not less than 15,000 votes. The deep sea fishing scam has a resonance in coastal areas so as the current incumbent’s failure to build seawalls and breakwaters to stop sea erosion,” said an upbeat Mr. Chammany taking a break after the door-to-door campaign. Notwithstanding his marginal victory in the last election, taking advantage of the division in the UDF camp, Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate K.J. Maxy exuded confidence of a second win on the trot on the strength of his work. “We don’t need a divided UDF to guarantee victory. Besides, Twenty20 and V4 People will largely eat into their votes to our advantage,” he said wrapping up his campaign at Thoppumpady. Some 10 km away at Puthanthodu along coastal Kannamaly, BJP candidate C.G. Rajagopal emerged fully drenched after staging a protest in the sea against the absence of seawall, a long-standing demand of the coastal people. “Neither the LDF nor UDF could resolve basic issues, and there has been no drinking water supply in the West Kochi area for some days now. This time, we have been able to reach out to the minority sections as well,” he said. Twenty20 candidate Shiny Antony banks on the Kizhakkamabalam model development and corruption-free governance in her campaign run by professionals. “Our idea is to restore Kochi, which remains ruined by the short-sightedness of political fronts, to its rightful place of glory. We have proved naysayers wrong in our past electoral fights, and we are confident of repeating it,” she said during het door-to-door campaign at Kumbalanghi. Though perceived to be of similar interests, there seems no love lost between Twenty20 and V4 Kochi, which has fielded its campaign controller Nipun Cherian in the constituency, as both remain disparaging of the other and questions each other’s motives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-five-cornered-fight-on-the-cards/article34186858.ece
29 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||High-voltage campaigns, intense debates make the contest gripping||With high-voltage campaigns led by national-level leaders and intense debates on various acts of omission and commission of the State government electrifying the poll scene, Ernakulam district is witnessing a gripping political contest. All the major political formations have cared to ensure the presence of their top-rug leaders in the district. BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah chose the Thripunithura constituency to kick-start his campaign with a brief road show. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh too is expected to address the voters. While CPI (M) leaders Prakash Karat, S. Ramachandran Pillai and Subhashini Ali canvassed votes for the Left Democratic Front candidates, several Congress leaders including Randeep Singh Surjewala gave the required impetus to the United Democratic Front campaign. Face-off It is to be seen how the face-off between the Latin Catholic Church and the State government over the controversial deep-sea fishing project would influence the poll outcome in the district. The Latin Catholic votes matter in at least three constituencies, Ernakulam, Kochi and Vypeen. While the voters of Ernakulam unwaveringly stood with the UDF, Vypeen has the electoral history of being with the Left for long. The issue of double votes/fake votes raised by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has found resonance in the district with Congress leader Hibi Eden, MP, approaching the Election Commission of India with a complaint. Mr. Eden alleges that the LDF sabotaged the electoral mandate in the Kochi Corporation through bogus voting. The UDF has registered five election cases in trial courts. The fronts have taken serious note of the presence of Twenty20 candidates in eight constituencies, especially Kunnathunad, Kochi and Ernakulam considering the low margin of the winners. While V. P. Sajeendran managed to retain the Kunnathunad seat by 2,679 votes, K. J. Maxy won 1,086 votes more than his rival in Kochi and T. J. Vinod retained Ernakulam by edging past his rival by a margin of 3,673 votes. Nipun Cherian of the V4 Kochi, another non-political outfit, which ensured the defeat of a few UDF candidates in the polls to the Kochi Corporation and thus denied the UDF continuation of power in the civic polls, has also fielded himself in the constituency. Systematic manner After its delayed start, the UDF and the Congress have put their act together and settled the inner-party conflicts whereas the LDF campaign is progressing in a systematic manner. The National Democratic Alliance too is making its strong presence felt in the district, whereas the volunteers of the Twenty20, who come out to the streets wearing T-shirts with its election symbol Pineapple printed on it, could be seen engaged in door-to-door campaign. A host of pre-poll surveys conducted by television channels have fired up the political debate. While most of the surveys suggested that the UDF may retain its upper hand in the district, which has 14 Assembly constituencies, some have predicted electoral sabotages too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-voltage-campaigns-intense-debates-make-the-contest-gripping/article34186892.ece
29 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Footballer shoots straight on politics||A lover of wildlife, footballer C.K. Vineeth went on an impromptu trip across the country early this year. And what fascinated him was people and their lives, not places! On the Delhi border, he saw moats being dug and transport buses used to prevent the protesting farmers from marching on. The enterprising farmers used their tractors to remove the roadblock, but news channels were airing one-sided reports portraying it as a case of farmers vandalising public property. “But what’s the purpose of a bus? Is it something to be used to block highways?” Mr. Vineeth shoots the question with a striker’s precision. A talk with farmers He had hours-long discussions with the protesters while on way to Amritsar, when a roadblock called by the protesters gave him enough free time. “I think their struggle is genuine. Farmers know what they want. Look at the removal of some farm produce from the list of essential commodities. Isn’t it just to support the corporates and hoarding?” he asks. Mr. Vineeth, a native of Kannur, comments on social and political issues he strongly feels about. He had taken part in the relief operations in the wake of the floods of 2018 and lent a hand at the COVID-19 helpline centre. “Politics for me is to be with the poor. If a few people listen to me, that’s an opportunity to give them back,” he says. ‘Why malign Kannur?’ Kerala and Kannur, he feels, come under attack for standing up to the communal forces. People who do not know Kannur well vilify the place. “Political killings have happened there at times, but is it the only such place? The vilification of Kannur is part of a political agenda, much like the maligning of Malappuram in the aftermath of an elephant succumbing to an injury. Was the clamour out of love for the creature? Unlike north India, Kerala is not communally split. Those who survive on communal polarisation want to see that happening here too. Sabarimala is also used the same way,” he says. Some time ago, in a television discussion, activist Rahul Eswar was heard saying Mr. Vineeth’s son, being brought up without religion, was naturally a ‘Hindu’ and a priest on the panel supported it. “I don’t know why a priest should say that. What’s wrong if my son embraces another religion? Let him make his choice when he grows up. What’s ‘my’ culture? I was brought up as a human being, not as a Hindu. I go to all these places of worship during festivals for watching things like Theyyam. Let your faith remain a private matter. I should not affect anyone else,” he says. Mr. Vineeth thinks that post-election change in political affiliations by elected representatives is betrayal of the voters’ trust. Kerala has so far resisted communal forces. “That will remain so till the time a secular government is in power,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/footballer-shoots-straight-on-politics/article34186876.ece
29 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Palm Sunday celebrated in city amid COVID curbs||Amidst COVID-19 restrictions, Christian community in Kochi and suburbs celebrated Palm Sunday, heralding the Holy Week during which the community recalls the New Testament accounts of the crucifixion of Jesus and resurrection. The Palm Sunday observance at St. Francis Assisi Cathedral in the city was led by Archbishop Joseph Kalathiparambil of Varapuzha. The celebrations included the blessing of palm leaves. The Palm Sunday observance is a recollection of biblical account of the triumphant entry of Jesus into Jerusalem ahead of his trial at a Roman governor’s court after which he was condemned to death by crucifixion. The Holy Week continues into Maundy Thursday and Good Friday before the Easter celebrations on Sunday. The Palm Sunday observations at the St. Mary’s Basilica was led by Cardinal George Alencherry, Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar church, while Catholicos Baselios Thomas I of the Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church led the ceremonies at the St. Athanasios Partriachal Cathedral at Puthenkurisu.

29 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||When movies inspire campaigns||The hero flicking up the dhoti with one swift movement of the foot, twirling up his moustache and strolling majestically, in slow motion, amid fireworks and delivering punch dialogues are scenes designed for mass movies to evoke hysteric whistles in theatres. Those tropes seem to have inspired an avalanche of election campaign videos capturing candidates doing all this and much more, some with considerable panache and others with perceptible discomfort. While well-crafted mass movies guarantee success, can the same be said about campaign videos? Renji Panicker, who penned blockbuster political thrillers like Thalasthanam and Sthalathe Pradhana Payyans , finds nothing wrong in such campaign material using cutting-edge modern technology. “It’s all about the people featured in such videos. If the person has an image in people’s minds that resonates with the videos, then they work, else they won’t. People don’t care about such things, and that’s why they are being used even in local body elections. Anyway, symbols of simple lifestyles have disappeared, and even candidates of parties claiming to represent the proletariat have access to better gadgets and facilities,” he observed. Sebastian Paul, a political observer, though begs to differ, saying that optics do matter in an election campaign. “People may be appreciative of the glitz of movies. But when it comes to their representatives, voters still want to see them rooted to the ground. They may not take kindly to such videos,” he said and added an election campaign was all about direct and personal communication between the candidate and the voter. Criticisms K. Ajitha, social activist, summarily disapproved of such macho videos, terming them a reflection of patriarchy pervading all fields of life, including politics. “But then, it is unsurprising, as a society rooted in patriarchy and views women merely as sex symbols cannot be expected to change overnight with an election,” she said. So, how effective are the videos in serving the purpose of winning over the electorate? Mable Davis, a clinical psychologist, said there was no guarantee that they would.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-mass-movies-inspire-campaigns/article34186868.ece

A police team arrested Jijendran Alex, 31, of Sai Sadan, Palayam, Thiruvananthapuram, from Poojappura in the State capital. He used to hand over samples of ganja to those who went to AP in search of it. He then arranged loading of the drug into customer vehicles. Several tonnes of the narcotic are suspected to have been routed to Kerala thus.

The UDF victory will put Kerala back on the path of growth and development. It will be dangerous for the people of Kerala to have the LDF in the State and the BJP at the Centre as together they will wreak havoc in Kerala. In many ways, the BJP and the LDF are the two sides of the same coin. Mr. Goud says the Narendra Modi government failed India in its hour of need. The Central government mishandled the lockdown and COVID crisis, resulting in the sharpest economic downfall in 70 years. People have been left jobless, factories closed, labourers left stranded on roads. However, there are friends of the government who made Rs. 12 lakh crore since the lockdown, he says. As the country is witnessing a rapid surge in COVID, the government is more worried about its global presence than taking care of its citizen, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-cannot-afford-to-let-ldf-win-says-goud/article34186899.ece

29 March 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Development talks rule Punalur campaigns||Development is the buzzword powering P.S. Supal’s speech as the LDF candidate goes on his campaign spree in and around Punalur municipality. The CPI leader, who represented the constituency in 1996 and 2001, says the government has kept all its promises and stood with the people despite back-to-back challenges including Okhi, Nipah, floods, and COVID-19. “The LDF gives priority to the problems of commoners and that is why the government cleared all arrears due to social welfare pensioners that was pending for 18 months when the UDF was in power. They mock us by calling ‘kit government, but we consider it an honour’.” He talks about Punalur taluk hospital that was developed into a multi-storey high-tech building and lists all other projects implemented in the last five years. “For this growth to continue, the Left government should come to power again,” he concludes, before returning to the vehicle. From Sprinkler to gold smuggling and deep-sea fishing, UDF candidate and IUML leader Abdul Rahman Randathani banks on the recent controversies and allegations as he opens his speech. Claims, counter claims Pointing out that all the major development projects in Kerala were launched during the time of last UDF government, he adds that the Left Front is trying to fool the people of Kerala by distributing free kits. The former Thanoor MLA also talks about lack of drinking water projects, difficult living condition of plantation workers and the failure in tapping the pilgrim tourism potential. “This Assembly segment has the highest number of persons who are yet to get title deeds. Plantation workers still live in layams and their wages have remained the same during last 15 years,” he adds. NDA candidate and Karshaka Morcha district president Ayoor Murali urges the voters not to repeat the error every five year by opting between LDF and UDF. “We have experimented with both for the last 65 years and now the State has a debt over Rs. 3 lakh crore. What we need is a change and BJP is contesting this election for the poor and the faithful,” he says. Punalur, the Assembly segment with its population of farmers, plantation workers, and cashew labourers, has remained loyal to Left for the last 25 years. The constituency consists of Punalur municipality and seven panchayats including Anchal, Aryankavu, Edamulakkal, Yeroor, Karavalur, Kulathupuzha and Thenmala.

In Guruvayur “… It is not a coincidence that the BJP does not have a candidate in Guruvayur. It cannot be a mistake or a mere lapse. The UDF candidate resorted to certain campaign tactics that could garner the support of the BJP,” Mr. Vijayan told the media here on Sunday. He alleged that the Congress and the IUML were not really opposed to the communal politics of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). On Mr. Khader’s reported statement that the IUML would “help people fill applications for citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act”, Mr. Vijayan wondered what had happened to his support for the Kerala Assembly resolution against the Act. “His public actions during the poll campaign indicate that Mr. Khader wants the votes of a particular section. This can be seen as a statement in support of the BJP.

29 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||The sector wants next govt. to keep up its spirits||Industry status to real estate sector, incentives for small-scale contractors, promoters in all government jobs, and purchases and exemption to small-scale builders from RERA are what the stake-holders expect from the next government, builders say. They feel the real estate sector, as of now, is in good spirits thanks to some measures, including self-certification by promoters for buildings up to 300 sqmt and setting up of the Real Estate Regulation Authority (RERA), rolled out by the present LDF government. For the industry, the government’s decision to do away with the waiting for the formal permit from local authority to undertake construction and remove the hurdles of removing earth from the building sites after excavations has been bold steps. State chairman, Builders Association of India, P. Harikumar says the government has taken keen interest to promote ease of doing business, and measures taken by various departments and Kerala State Electricity Board have helped real estate sector. But there is need to reduce stamp duty and registration fee for property transfers. Registration charges are among the highest, at 10%, as compared to less than 5% in other States. “Since real estate sector is the largest provider of employment and a significant contributor to the exchequer by way of taxes, any improvement in the sector will be productive for the State,” he says. Agreeing with him, S.N. Raghuchandran Nair, convenor general, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), Kerala, says the outgoing government has been supportive to the real estate sector’s revival through proactive measures and to bring down the level of corruption. With the formation of RERA, the projects have come down drastically and fly-by-night builders have all of a sudden disappeared. “The demand is there, but supply is less,” he says. Like other sectors, the real estate sector has been hit badly by the pandemic. The NRI market has come down by 30% and the local market has gone up with housing loans getting cheaper and IT concessions made available for the second hours. Mr. Nair says the demand is only for apartments under Rs. 75 lakh and the challenge is to cater to this market. The lag in settlement of the bills of the contractors from various departments during the pandemic period has been a vexed issue, Mr. Harikumar says. The government was reluctant to provide relief measures declared by the Central government during COVID-19 period, he points out. Among the systems that need improvement are the ones providing building permits, occupancy certificates, and other documents. Mr. Harikumar says a single window system to help promoters right from application to execution stage will bring in sizeable revenue also.  The government has taken keen interest to promote ease of doing business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-sector-wants-next-govt-to-keep-up-its-spirits/article34186890.ece

Addressing an election campaign meeting of NDA candidate of the Irinjalakuda constituency Jacob Thomas on Sunday, he said Kerala had become a haven for anti-national and terrorist elements. “It is time to rescue the State from the Left and Right fronts, which have been ruling it for the past seven decades. Though Kerala is culturally rich, it is underdeveloped. Political violence has become common,” he said. The BJP had proved that it was a party that fulfilled its promises through the decision to construct the Ram temple and revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. “Our policy is to ensure justice to all. We will not allow anybody to hurt sentiments of any religion. The BJP will bring out a legislation in the Sabarimala issue.” Mr. Singh said that the BJP had a special programme for the development of Kerala. “Jacob Thomas was a very honest official while in service.

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||UDF guards terrain as Left looks to expand||As the heat of campaign battles outstrips the summer heat in Kottayam, the question being asked is whether the Left Democratic Front’s gains in the region are far more durable than just a local body election. Emboldened by the entry of Kerala Congress (M) into its fold, the Left coalition has laid out an ambitious expansion plan for the rubber heartland this time. The United Democratic Front, on the other hand, counts on a consistent yet narrow margin to maintain the upper hand once again. The National Democratic Alliance, meanwhile, hopes to align the electorate in at least one seat around a choice other than the UDF and the LDF. As electioneering in Kottayam enters its final stretch, several of the issues that were in the focus initially have now taken a backseat. The period, in which the parties kept up their withering attack on one another, also saw a battery of of national-level politicians including the likes of Amit Shah and Rahul Gandhi, hitting the campaign trail in person. An unexpected rebel Starting with the high-profile battle in Pala, the poll scape in Kottayam has witnessed several twists and turns with the entry of Lathika Subash as a Congress rebel and the heckling of P.C. George in Erattupetta further stirring up the scene. And as against routine agendas of agrarian and rural development, issues like the attack on nuns by alleged Sangh Parivar activists in Uttar Pradesh and the unending war of words between the Nair Service Society and the LDF over the Sabarimala issue have come up to dominate the political discourse. Among the nine Assembly segments, the fight between Jose K. Mani and Mani C. Kappan in Pala still remains to be the most keenly watched contest. The poll scene in Poonjar, meanwhile, is witnessing a playback of the 2016 elections with Mr. George, the sitting legislator, locked in a bitter battle with the UDF and LDF candidates. The ground situation, however, appears to be starkly different this time with a section of locals, who used to be a trusted vote bank for Mr. George, openly coming out against his ‘hate-speeches.’ The fight in Vaikom will be watched for setting the stage for an all-women battle while in Ettumanur, the entry of a woman, Ms. Subash, appears to have complicated the UDF’s calculations. The Congress, meanwhile, counts on winning the sitting seats of Kottayam and Puthupally without much fuss.  The stance of the Church and the Hindu upper castes are expected to be most crucial in Changanassery and Kaduthuruthy, where the two Kerala Congress factions have squared up to each other while in Poonjar, the consolidation of Muslim votes is expected to be the deciding factor. NDA’s target Banking on the KC(M) support, the LDF seeks to tilt the trend its favour in at least four seats other than the sitting seats of Vaikom and Ettumanur. The NDA, meanwhile, hopes to stage a major upset in a couple of seats and of these, Kanjirappally appears to top its priority list. No matter the direction to which Kottayam will swing this Assembly election, the election across the segments here are worth watching to assess whether the region, long known for its pro-UDF position, will make a noticeable shift to the Left this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-guards-terrain-as-left-looks-to-expand/article34186898.ece

Every summer, the tribal people living in the Agency set the fallen Mahua leaves on fire to keep the ground under the tree clean. It helps the tribal people collect the Mahua flowers easily. On March 24, a forest fire that spread over a few hundred meters was reported between Chintoor and Edugurallapalli, a 30-km forest stretch that has a lot of Mahua trees. “The practice of setting afire the leaves was rampant in Chintoor Agency a few decades ago. However, it is believed that many tribal people still practice it,” says social worker Subhani Syed, who works in the Agency. Collection of Mahua flower is the prime source of livelihood in the summer as a majority of the tribal families generate an additional come by seelling Mahula flower that has a good commercial value. “A major chunk of Mahua flowers are procured by traders from Chhattisgarh,” says a senior forest official.  Prevention mechanism An activist working on tribal livelihood options told The Hindu: “The Forest Department should have a mechanism to tackle the forest fires. The Fire Tracing Lines (FTLs) must be marked in the strategic locations to prevent the spread of forest fire. But there is no such mechanism in place here as of now.” A huge chunk of Reserve Forest (RF) cover on the Andhra Pradesh-Chhattisgarh border in Chintoor Agency is home for the Mahua trees.  Awareness campaign “We have appealed to the tribal people not to set fire in the forest for collection of Mahua flower. A ground-level campaign is also being under way in the weekly markets, persuading the tribal people to stop the practice,” said Chintoor Divisional Forest Officer V. Saibaba.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/officials-urge-chintoor-agency-tribals-not-to-light-fire-in-forest/article34186503.ece

29 March 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Modi flouting election code by taking up campaign in Bangladesh: CPI||The Communist Party of India (CPI) national Secretary K. Narayana has accused the Prime Minister Narendra Modi of having flouted the election code by taking up campaign from Bangladesh. Addressing the media here on Sunday, he called Mr. Modi’s claim of having participated in Bangladesh liberation movement as a ‘blatant lie’, adding that it was unfortunate for a Prime Minister to unabashedly utter a lie on foreign soil. He recalled that several groups in Bangladesh had protested against the arrival of Mr. Modi for the golden jubilee fete. Mr. Narayana wondered how he could use the soil of a neighbouring country to indirectly campaign for his party. The CPI leader accused the Central government of misusing the CBI and other Central investigating agencies as a tool against the opposition parties. The Centre had foisted false cases against the LDF leaders in Kerala, he alleged. “The Chief Ministers of the Telugu States, Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and K. Chandrasekhara Rao, are also resorting to double-talk fearing backlash from the Centre. If they continue to remain indifferent and fail to claim the rightful share of funds from the Centre in the garb of avoiding confrontation with the Centre, the people will show them their rightful place,” he warned. On the Tirupati by-election, Mr. Narayana accused the BJP candidate and former bureaucrat K. Ratna Prabha of having resorted to large-scale irregularities during her stint. “The BJP’s stand on corruption is quite evident when it pits such candidates,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/modi-flouting-election-code-by-taking-up-campaign-in-bangladesh-cpi/article34186508.ece

29 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Taking precautions is the only way to check spread of coronavirus: Vedika||The second wave of COVID-19 is very dangerous as the patients are not showing any symptoms of the disease. The only way to check its spread is through S M S (sanitisation, using mask and social distancing), Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV) State general secretary T. Kameswara Rao has said. PAV organised an awareness programme and distribution of pamphlets at the Seethammadhara Rythu Bazaar on Sunday. Addressing the consumers, Mr. Kameswara Rao said that while vaccination would prevent hospitalisation, observing S M S was important even after taking the vaccine. He appealed to the Rythu Bazaar officials to ensure strict implementation of masks by not allowing consumers, who come without masks. He said that an awareness campaign would be conducted at MVP Rhythu Bazaar on Monday and Kanacharapalem Rythu Bazaar on Tuesday and later a campaign was planned to be held at the Fishing Harbour. PAV State committee member Chandramouli appealed to the government to ensure free distribution of masks to the public.

29 March 2021||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Teacher’s bike library spreads reading habit||In the era of smart phones, kids have almost forgotten reading habit. For them reading means only class books. However, a private college lecturer who observed the adverse impact of the mobile phones started a mobile library to benefit the students of the villages that don’t have libraries. The lecturer, Reddi Ramana, carries books on his bike and stays in a village for nearly three hours. He has modified the bike design to carry books visibly and attract kids easily. The students who gather at panchayat buildings and temples will be distributed books of their choice. They can read and get clarifications from him if they have any doubts. He believes reading of story books, comic books, epics such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and biographies of great personalities such as Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Subhash Chandra Bose will ensure the overall development of children and makes them good citizens in future. Mr. Ramana, who established the Ashya Youth Association to create awareness about the importance of books and libraries, travelled nearly 920 km in the last six months by visiting 36 villages in Cheepurupalli and Garividi of Vizianagaram and Rajam, G. Sigadam, Laveru and other mandals of Srikakulam district. “As many as 2,600 students read books during my visits. They eagerly wait for my next visit. I have bought books which are suitable to different age groups. Fortunately, parents and elders of villages are also happy with my mobile bike library. In their presence, I give gifts to kids who remember stories and continue the reading habit at least for 21 days,” says Mr. Ramana. Financial constraints In fact, buying books is a financial burden for Mr. Ramana in the absence of a regular income due to the closure of colleges and delay in payment of wages. Rising petrol price has added to the burden, but this has failed to dampen his spirit and he keeps visiting village after village engaging children with his inspiring and educative books. Vizianagaram Member of Parliament Bellana Chandrasekhar has congratulated him for implementing the novel ideal successfully. He has inspired many youngsters to establish libraries in their villages. Recently, Regati Youth Association has established ‘Maa Voori Grandhalayam’ in Regati Agraharam of Garividi mandal. “Mr. Ramana’s commitment has made us establish this library where books for competitive exams are also available. Now, students are preparing for exams and spending quality time in the library,” says K. Rambabu of the association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/teachers-bike-library-spreads-reading-habit/article34186984.ece

The threat of a possible second wave of COVID-19 has eclipsed the annual mega annual fete of Vasantha Paksha Tiru Kalyana Brahmotsavams to be held from April 13 to 27. Like last year, the celestial wedding will be out of bounds for devotees in Bhadradri temple following the decision of the State government to celebrate the fete in a simple manner in the presence of a limited number of essential temple staff. A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level meeting conducted by Endowments Minister A Indrakaran Reddy with senior officials of the Endowments and other departments in Hyderabad on Saturday night, sources said. Live telecast Devotees may find some solace in watching live telecast of the celestial wedding on television, the arrangements for which are being chalked out by the temple authorities, sources added. Temple executive Officer B Shivaji said government restrictions on public gatherings during the upcoming events would be strictly followed to protect public health. The traditional ritual of preparing Talambralu got under way in a customary manner in conformity to safety protocols on Sunday. Money would be refunded to the devotees, who had booked sector-wise tickets for the event, the EO informed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/restrictions-on-celestial-wedding/article34186820.ece

29 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID tests in State cross 1-crore mark||The number of tests performed in Telangana to diagnose coronavirus crossed the one-crore mark on Saturday with a total of 57,942 samples being examined. The total tests now number 1,00,19,096. While 535 persons tested positive, the results of 1,143 were awaited. Three more COVID patients died. The new cases include 154 from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation region, 49 from Medchal-Malkajgiri, 39 from Rangareddy, 22 from Sangareddy and 21 from Mahbubnagar. Only one case was detected in Mulugu. Of the total 3,06,339 cases, 4,495 were active with 3,00,156 having recovered. The death toll stands at 1,688. Increased testing The number of tests in a day is once again being increased to 60,000 to 70,000 a day. The daily tests were low when the cases started to surge in the State in March last year. People clamoured for more tests and hassle-free sample collection. The demand was addressed from mid-June. Private labs, too, were allowed to conduct tests. The Health department started to share data on the daily tests around the same time. The number of people tested in a day gradually increased thereon — from a maximum of 4,000 tests a day in June to around 2,000 by end of July. A sharp spike in daily tests was observed from August 25 to September 11 when around 60,000 samples were examined per day. It was during this period that 2,000 to 3,000 people tested positive on a daily basis.  The number of tests dropped to around 40,000 to 55,000 in October. Thereafter, the numbers decreased each month. When the cases were decreasing in January and February this year, 30,000-43,000 samples were being examined in a day.  Signs of second wave started to appear from March 9 and testing was gradually ramped up. Currently, around 60,000 samples are tested in a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-tests-in-state-cross-1-crore-mark/article34186812.ece
29 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Sewage diversion work halted due to poor contract management’||Poor contract management by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board led to delays and gaps in the construction of sewage pipeline as part of the project for diversion of sewage from Musi River, the report by the Comptroller & Auditor General for the year ending March 2018 said. A duplicate main for conveying 90 million litres of sewage per day through trenchless technology remained futile after completion of almost 90 per cent work, because the contracting agency as well as HMWS&SB paid no heed to the geophysical features of the terrain. Technical sanction As per the government order, technical sanction was given for Rs. 75.41 crore, for laying of the pipeline via Kacheguda, Vittalwadi, and Basheerbagh for a distance of five kilometres. Work was entrusted in 2008 under Engineering, Procurement and Construction system, to be completed by August, 2010. The work included manning, operation and maintenance of sewer main for a period of 24 months, till August, 2012. However, the agency could not complete the work despite periodical extensions up to August, 2016. No liquidation damages were imposed for delay in completion of the work, the report noted. Ten years after 2008, the contractor could complete 4.3 kilometres out of five kilometres, that too with gaps in the entire stretch along the pipeline. Work was held up at four locations reportedly due to presence of hard dense rock/granite and large boulders. When the water board commissioned the services of the Geological Survey of India for investigation of soil strata at locations where work was held up, it was revealed that the strength of rock was much higher than the capacity of the cutters employed by the agency. The CAG report noted that water board was aware of the rocky terrain which would involve trench excavation at a depth of more than four metres. While the contractor had not conducted proper site investigation prior to execution of the work, and had not employed proper equipment, which was in violation of the agreement, the Board too had not ensured that the contractor fulfilled the conditions thereof, the report noted. Notice issued Realising that the trenchless technology had failed, the balance work was proposed to be executed in an open cut method. The Board issued notice to the agency for non-completion of work, and the provision to get the balance work executed at the risk and cost of the agency was invoked. Though the balance portion was removed from the contractor’s scope of work, and re-tendered twice, it has not yielded any response, rendering the entire work completed useless.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sewage-diversion-work-halted-due-to-poor-contract-management/article34186826.ece
29 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Towards finding a cure for malaria||Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum transmitted among humans through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It continues to be a serious threat to mankind due to failure in curbing the disease. Lack of an effective vaccine, development of resistant parasites to all the available anti-malarial drugs, and emergence of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes are the major impediments in controlling the disease. A novel discovery led by a team of researchers from the University of Hyderabad (UoH) could be the next big step in finding a cure for malaria. The research team of researchers led by Mrinal Bhattacharya found a correlation between the fever induced by malaria and the antigenic variation of the malarial parasites. These findings are published in a reputed journal titled Molecular Microbiology by a team lead by Bhattacharyya and his students, Wahida Tabassum, and Shalu Varunan (Department of Biochemistry) in collaboration with Sunanda Bhattacharyya (Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad). The Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-membrane-protein 1 (PfEMP1), the protein from the malarial parasite under current study, is the most predominant molecular determinant of antigenic variation in this parasite. There could be up to 90 variants of this protein and only one protein is expressed at a given time, and this expression is completely random. These proteins do not live through multiple generations as the malaria parasites keep changing from one protein form to the other, hence the human host fails to mount a robust antibody response against these variant proteins. The present study uncovered how the parasites manipulate the expression of malarial proteins on the surface of the infected red blood cells in response to fever, a common manifestation of the disease. Heat-shock response They found that exposure to febrile temperature modulates the expression of virulence genes that could impact the extent of infection. A direct implication of this would be the failure of the human immune system to produce adequate antibodies against each type of new antigen. The study suggests that targeting the parasitic proteins involved in the heat-shock response during fever is likely to restrict the antigenic variation in the parasites and thereby, prevent malaria.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/towards-finding-a-cure-for-malaria/article34186816.ece
29 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Wrong decisions in execution of STPP, says report||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has observed that wrong decisions in the execution and operation of Singareni Thermal Power Plant (STPP), established as a pit-head unit by Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) as part of its plans of diversification due to depleting profitability in coal business, had resulted in a loss of about Rs. 1,276 crore. In the performance audit of STPP for the period from September 2016, when the first unit of 2×600 megawatt project started commercial operation, to March 2018, the CAG report placed before the Assembly recently faulted the management on several counts. The report pointed out that the thermal power project was conceived on the ground that coal generated from the company’s own mines would be used in it. “The presumption, however, was ignored in the changed reality brought about by the New Coal Distribution Policy of October 2007, under which the coal allocation was to be made centrally, and the Ministry of Coal had allotted Naini coal mines in Odisha to STPP”, the report noted. As a result, it was necessitated that coal needs of STPP till 2023 are met from Singareni mines under the bridge linkage resulting in payment of premium charges of Rs. 289.91 crore on procurement of 83.24 lakh tonnes of coal. The increase in coal charges (price) has led to increase in the generation cost from Rs. 2.37 per unit to Rs. 3.42 per unit (March 2018). Further, STPP did not apply for swapping of coal linkage from Naini coal mines to the company’s own mines, although the facility was available. Initially, the company planned to avail 150 MW out of 1,200 MW capacity of the project for its internal consumption, but it was ignored when it entered into power purchase agreement with Discoms in January 2016 to sell 100% of generation. It resulted in purchase of power for mining activity at a higher cost from the Discoms entailing an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 288.96 crore during 2017-18 alone. The CAG report pointed out that STPP was required to sell a minimum of 85% of generation capacity and award contracts through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) to claim Mega Power Project status and get duty exemptions. However, it calculated the net saleable power incorrectly and awarded contracts on nomination basis losing on duty exemptions of Rs. 293.55 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/wrong-decisions-in-execution-of-stpp/article34186837.ece
29 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Funds for medical colleges not spent, says CAG||A Centrally sponsored scheme to strengthen and upgrade State government medical colleges for increase in post-graduate seats was a failure as the funds committed were not applied to the project. The scheme launched in 2008 was targeted at Osmania, Gandhi and Kakatiya medical colleges to increase post-graduate seats and the commensurate increase in their infrastructural facilities, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said in his report. Non-starter The Central government introduced another scheme in June 2013 for establishment of multi-disciplinary research units in government medical colleges to undertake research in non-communicable diseases and bridging the gap in their infrastructural facilities. But, the units sanctioned for Osmania and Gandhi medical colleges were non-starter due to their failure to meet milestones and pre-requisites as per Central government time schedule and non-release of subsequent funds. The report highlighted failure of municipal corporations of Warangal, Karimnagar, Khammam, Nizamabad and Ramagundam to comply with the mandatory provisions of rainwater harvesting despite collecting money from building owners to construct the structures. Delay by Karimnagar corporation in remitting Employees Provident Fund contributions resulted in avoidable expenditure of Rs. 3.83 crore towards damage charges and interest. A major objective of a project to conduct comprehensive household survey and installation of automatic meter reading system remained unachieved by Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board. Non-achievement of deliverables led to non-release of Central assistance of Rs. 2.77 crore to the board. Therefore, the board had to commit an additional amount of Rs. 3.64 crore out of its own funds for installation of automatic meters. Improper project management by National Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management derailed a public-private partnership project to set up a four-star business class hotel in Hyderabad. This led to recurring annual loss of revenue of Rs. 2.50 crore to the institute besides denying students employment and training opportunities. Compensation under National Family Benefit Scheme was not paid as per the rate fixed by Central government which resulted in short payment of Rs. 14.26 crore to 13,373 bereaved families. Seventy-four per cent of funds released under constituency development programme in 2014-18 remained either unspent in the Personal Deposit accounts of Chief Planning Officers or not supported by utilisation certificates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/funds-for-medical-colleges-not-spent-says-cag/article34186839.ece
29 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Timings, basic info missing at sample collection centres||It has been over a year since people have been visiting government health facilities for COVID-19 tests and yet, basic details that can minimise communication with the staff or the need to stay back longer are not displayed at the sample collection centres. There is no mention of timings for collection of samples, time taken for test results or the numbers to call if results are delayed. Apart from Primary Health Centres, samples for both RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests are collected at major hospitals including Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases at Nallakunta, also known as Fever Hospital, and Nature Cure Hospital in Begumpet. Hundreds of people opt the two centres to undergo tests and the numbers are again increasing. However, there is no board or banner displaying basic details regarding the tests. In such a scenario, people have to enquire with the staff taking down details for registration about test results and other doubts regarding sample collection. Waiting time An elderly person who visited Nature Cure Hospital on Monday had to wait for almost half hour to find out his test results which were delayed by three days.

These tubes were manufactured with complete indigenous technology starting from raw material supplied by MIDHANI to the finished tubes developed and manufactured at NFC under the Atmanirbhar Bharat mission. First set of SG tubes consisting of 2,489 tubes of 26 m length U-bend in 72 different bend radii against stringent quality specifications was dispatched on Saturday with the NFC chief executive Dinesh Srivastava and MIDHANI chairman & managing director S.K. Jha flagging off the consignment. The critical equipment required for manufacturing these tubes was indigenously developed and deployed for production. The supply of the balance two sets of tubes to BHEL for this order is being planned in this calendar year. NFC is one of the limited suppliers with the capability to manufacture these tubes required for critical application in nuclear power generation. NFC has also received an order from NPCIL to supply 40 sets of tubes (one lakh tubes) for forthcoming 10 reactors to be set up by NPCIL under fleet mode. The process of manufacturing these tubes for fleet reactors will commence shortly at NFC which had previously supplied 20,000 tubes in 2015-16 for Kakrapur Atomic Power Plant (KAPP 3&4) and Rajasthan Atomic Power Plant (RAPP) 7&8 which were processed with imported raw material.

However, the incident came to light only on Sunday. According to Malakpet inspector N Venkata Ramana, the girl Nenavath Sreenidhi, daughter of Savya, hanged herself from the ceiling with a skipping rope and died. It is suspected that a playful act with her three-year-old younger brother Sai must have led to her death. On March 23 around 1.30 p.m. she was getting ready to visit a nearby temple, and Sai was insisting to join her. However, she threatened to hang herself if he joined her. This makes police suspect that she might have playfully staged the hanging scene, but it proved fatal. Sreenidhi was the eldest among three siblings, and was a student of Class IV.

The demonstration was held under the aegis of the Private Teachers and Lecturers Association at the Dharna Chowk.

Representatives of the Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation (TPTF) and various private educational institutions expressed solidarity with the protesting private teachers and lectures. Narrating their travails, the demonstrators deplored that the sudden closure of schools aggravated their financial problems pushing them to penury. The protesters wondered how bars and restaurants, cinema theatres and political meetings could continue when there was a spurt in COVID-19 cases. They urged the State government to either reopen schools in adherence to the COVID-19 safety norms or provide Rs. 10,000 per month to each private teacher and lecturer for at least five months to help them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/teachers-seek-aid/article34186841.ece

According to information issued by the District Medical & Health Office, nearly 70 persons were identified as COVID-positive, including the 38 fresh cases that were confirmed on Sunday. A total 312 tests were conducted only on Sunday, locally and for temple-related persons, and 38 were positive. Officials have intensified the tests in the past three days, and reportedly, the target victims are more often found in sources linked to the temple treasury, priests and other staff. The initial suspicion was out on Thursday when one of the priests, who participated in the temple brahmotsavam, tested positive. Earlier on Saturday, temple executive officer N. Geetha released information that certain staff of the temple were diagnosed with COVID-19, and hence, many devotees’ arjitha sevas and anna dana service were temporarily suspended till March 30. Now, fresh cases reported also point to infection among a few other priests. Officials said more tests will be conducted to check the infection at the earliest. A decision on continuation or regulation of temple services will also be taken soon. Following the fresh bout of infection, the devotee footfall was lower on Sunday.

They have eyed it in the category of implementation of technology. The police are nowadays appealing to people to register themselves in the Skoch website and vote for the department for doing a good work in ensuring women’s safety. Their claim for the award is the successful implementation of Hawk Eye app in coordination with cab services for safe travel of women. Those who downloaded the app can press the SOS button, which is integrated with the software of cab services, in case of an emergency while travelling in cabs. Immediately, an emergency alerted is sounded to seven wings of police including the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Circle Inspector, police control room and the local area patrolling vehicle.   The Panchayati Raj Minister narrated in the Assembly the other day how the Centre was not giving funds matching State’s performance in implementation of several schemes. He said the Union government had given several awards to Telangana and as Minister he was overburdened by sheer weight of awards received so far. However, there was no use with the awards since the Centre was not giving funds to match the good work being done. “Telangana needs the weight of funds and not just the weighty awardsto improve its performance further,” the Minister said, suggesting that the BJP members use their political weight to get the funds from the Centre.   BJP member in Assembly M. Raghunandan Rao commented that the TRS government had the attitude of taking/claiming credit to everything good in the State and pass the blame to the Centre for everything that goes wrong in the State. Rebutting the BJP member’s remarks, Minister T. Harish Rao said the TRS government would always do good for all sections. He went on to say that ‘BJP and Congress vidhaanalu ammakam, TRS vidhaanalu nammakam’ (the policies of both BJP and Congress were to sell everything (PSUs) and the TRS believes in reviving even sick units) and cited a few examples of how the government brought Vijaya Dairy and others out of red.

This locality doesn’t have adequate drains or drinking water supply. The roads are in pathetic condition and there are no public toilets or parks either. It is high time that town planners studied this burgeoning suburb and save it from becoming an inaccessible ghetto by strictly implementing the approved building plans to avoid usurping of roads. Mohd Ikramulla, P&T Colony   At many crossroads in the twin cities, there is no pedestrians crossing signage indicated by the white lines, making it difficult for people to cross the roads. Moreover, many motorists jump the signals even when there is red light, putting the lives of pedestrians in peril. I request the GHMC and traffic police departments to arrange painting of white lines enabling pedestrians to cross the roads safely. G.V.N. Murthy, Quthbullapur   We have been raising the issue for quite some time and it is so heartening to see that the crucial EME Gurudwara Road road serving many residents from Secunderabad are being addressed with the recent road repairs.

29 March 2021||GURUGRAM,||Inmates bring out creativity as ‘Jail Radio’ becomes a hit||When Vartika Nanda, a prison reformer, went to visit Panipat Jail a week ago to talk to the inmates about the newly launched “Jail Radio”, an 80-year-old convict told her that he was feeling elated for the first time ever since he was in jail. “It was a very interesting conversation. He has been in prison for a long time. He told me that since his entry into this jail, he was happy for the first time. When asked about the reason behind his smile, he told me that he was to present Ragini [local folk theatrical performance] on Jail Radio that day,” recalled Dr. Nanda while speaking to The Hindu . Her foundation “Tinka Tinka” has launched this ‘Jail Radio’ project in Haryana jails in collaboration with the State government. “This is what we want,” emphasised Dr. Nanda, referring to the conversation with the elderly convict. Though Dr. Nanda’s journey as a prison reformer started around a decade ago when she launched “Tinka Tinka” in 2013 to “contribute to the society in a serious manner”, her association with Haryana Jails is just two years old. “I was working on a book on Prison Radio in 2019 when I approached Haryana government. It was quite surprising that Tihar [Jail] had it, but Delhi’s next-door neighbour did not have it. This is how it started, and we divided our work for Jail Radio into phases,” said Dr. Nanda, Head, Journalism Department, Lady Shri Ram College. In the first phase, three prisons in Haryana — Panipat and Faridabad district jails and Ambala Central Jail — were taken up for the project and “Jail Radio” was set up. Panipat was the first to get it on January 16 this year. It was followed by setting up of a “Jail Radio” in Faridabad on January 28 and in Ambala on March 8. “It is an in-house production run by the inmates. The programmes are broadcast from a studio inside the premises and reach to the inmates through speakers in the barracks. We mostly play Bollywood songs but also encourage them to present their own programmes such as playing musical instruments or presenting raginis,” said Devi Dyal, Superintendent, Panipat Jail. In the second phase, the project will be launched in four more jails and the preparations for it are almost done Important aspect Dr. Nanda said the most important aspect of the project was that “it is for the inmates”. “No commercial interest, no outside intervention, no ads, and no commercial breaks,” she remarked. Dr. Nanda said the aim was to bring out the inmates’ creativity, give them meaningful engagement. “These inmates would go back to society one day. It is, therefore, important that they are given a meaningful intervention. Many of these repent and regret what happened in the past. They need healing,” she said. The prisons were looked at from the point of view of punishment, said Dr. Nanda, adding that she was working on her own “Tinka Model” of prisons looking at them from the human side. “How human resources can be best utilised? This is how my model of prisons is being designed,” said Dr. Nanda, author of three books on the subject. In the first phase, 21 inmates, including five women, were shortlisted from among 70 to be deployed as “radio jockeys”. In the second phase, 26 inmates, including a transgender, have been trained. “We were looking for people who were interested, wanted to bring a change and had energy and passion didn’t want anybody to come with a baggage,” said Dr. Nanda. In just six days, these inmates were trained to take up their new roles. Mr. Dyal said the “Jail Radio” was now a big hit and he was getting a lot of requests from the inmates to be the “Radio Jockeys”. In Panipat Jail, the “Tinka Tinka” foundation has also set up a library adjoining the studio. Director General of Prisons, Haryana, K. Selvaraj, said the project was received well and the government planned to extend it to all 19 jails in the State, except Palwal and Rewari, which may be taken up later. “The project is very useful in these times when we have to create awareness among the inmates. It also has an entertainment quotient. We plan to take up five jails each in the next two phases,” said Mr. Selvaraj. With plans to take the project beyond Haryana to jails across the country, Dr. Nanda reflected that she always wanted to prove that if you do something with a pure heart, you always succeed, but she never expected huge support for her endeavour and this was its “ biggest beauty”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/inmates-tune-into-new-talents-with-jail-radio/article34186709.ece
29 March 2021||GURUGRAM,||Three hurt as section of elevated road on Dwarka E-way collapses||A section of the under-construction elevated road on Dwarka Expressway collapsed, injuring three labourers, the police said on Sunday. The collapse on the National Highway 248-BB, which connects Delhi and Gurugram, is the second such incident in the latter in less than a year. Similar incident A portion of the under-construction elevated corridor had collapsed on Gurugram-Alwar Highway in a similar fashion in August last year. The under-erection span and the adjoining span of the elevated corridor on the highway came crashing down near Daultabad Chowk at 7.30 a.m. along with the launcher with a deafening sound heard in a radius of several hundred kilometres. “Of the three labourers who sustained injures, two of them had superficial injuries and one had fractures. We are recording the statements of the three following which a case would be registered,” said Deepak Saharan, Deputy Commissioner of Police (West). Around two dozen labourers working on the night shift had a miraculous escape as they left the site just minutes before the collapse. “Around 20-25 labourers were present at the construction site standing on top of the section 10 minutes before the collapse. Though their shift ends around 8 a.m., they left early today [on Sunday] because of Holi. It is Sunday so the labourers for the next shift did not come,” said Rajbir Singh, an eyewitness. Dharmendra Yadav, who was in a crane parked under the section, also escaped unhurt. “Just minutes after I parked the crane under it, I heard a faint creaking sound. I looked outside to see dust falling from the top. Even before I could figure out anything, the two slabs came crashing down. Luckily, they did not land on the vehicle,” said Dharemendra. Rohit Chaudhary, a resident of Paras Dews in Sector 106, said he went rushing to his flat’s balcony when he heard a loud thud. He thought maybe a plane had crashed, but he soon spotted the collapsed portion of the corridor on the highway. The National Highways Authority of India, in a press statement, said an expert committee was being constituted to ascertain the reason for failure leading to the accident and the key officials of the contractor and supervision consultant were suspended. “The authority has viewed the incident seriously and pending the outcome of the investigation by the committee, the personnel concerned of the Contractor M/s L&T and Supervision Consultant M/s AECOM have been suspended as per Standard Operating Procedure of the NHAI,” read the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/three-hurt-as-section-of-elevated-road-on-dwarka-e-way-collapses/article34186721.ece
29 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Gangster who escaped custody killed in shoot-out with police||A gangster, who had escaped custody, was killed on Sunday following an exchange of fire with policemen in Rohini, the police said on Sunday. Teams from Special Cell and Crime Branch were working to nab Kuldeep alias Fajja. The raid was conducted at a flat in Rohini’s Sector 14 at 1.45 a.m. Tip-off from accomplice The Special Cell said they got a tip-off on Saturday that Kuldeep was hiding in a flat at Tulsi Apartments. They got the information from Kuldeep’s accomplice, Bhupinder Mann, who was arrested at 9.30 p.m. on the same day. Next, the police said they made a strategy because the flat was located in a residential area and unplanned operation could have been dangerous. They choose night time as there would be less movement in the gated society. “Police reached the area and raided the flat. They asked Kuldeep to surrender, but he opened fire at police. In retaliation, police fired and Kuldeep suffered injures. He was rushed to the Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital at Rohini where he was declared brought dead,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said. Around 20 rounds were fired — eight by Kuldeep, said an officer. The flat belonged to Yogender Dahiya, also an accomplice of Kuldeep. He has been arrested, they said. A senior officer said the escape plan for Kuldeep was hatched by his accomplices to revive the Gogi gang. How he escaped On March 25 afternoon, Kuldeep escaped from custody after a gunfight broke out at GTB hospital in East Delhi. At the hospital, the assailants first threw chilli powder at the police team and then started firing at them. The police retaliated with 12 rounds of fire, killing one of them on the spot and injuring another.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gangster-who-escaped-custody-killed-in-shoot-out-with-police/article34186718.ece
29 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Happiness Curriculum helped students during lockdown’||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday said that during the pandemic, children studying in Delhi government schools endured an immense loss of learning, but it was mindfulness learnt as a part of their Happiness Curriculum that helped them to apply life skills to deal with stressful situations. “Almost 3-4 lakh students who practiced mindfulness and different activities helped their homes to be strong and emotionally sound. Through the happiness curriculum, we have been able to encourage our ecosystems to think about long-term approaches to mental health,” Mr. Sisodia said. The Minister was speaking at the Harvard Social Enterprise Conference to deliberate on innovations in mental health. “I believe that wellbeing needs to be made as a mainstream subject in education. This is the time to change our strategy and push wellbeing into our domains of learning and mainstream subjects. Failures are a part of life, but our students should be able to bounce back from them, analyse and learn from both successes and failures, and relentlessly persevere to achieve their goals,” Mr. Sisodia said. ‘Technology here to stay’ He added that the biggest takeaway from COVID-19, for our public education, has been that technology is here to stay. “We need to quickly adapt our systems and encourage the use of technology. Adopting the right approaches to inculcate technology within our education would in fact make learning more inclusive,” he said. He said Delhi Board of School Education, which the government is introducing, will eventually move towards testing mindset rather than testing knowledge. “It will play a key role in ensuring that schools develop a holistic learner profile of students, assessing and pushing for social and emotional learning in schools,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/happiness-curriculum-helped-students-during-lockdown/article34186714.ece

They said they don’t want to lose another year due to the pandemic. “Online education resulted in dropouts and students are excluded from learning due to lack of Internet and smart phones. This turmoil in education that we have witnessed in the past year is set to continue if campus remain closed,” AISA said. It added that there would be a surge in drop out rates if the discriminatory mode of online education continues. “Governments should immediately vaccinate students, teachers and staffers from school, colleges and universities in order save another academic year from destruction. If this is done, the government will not be able to use COVID-19 as an excuse to keep campuses shut,” AISA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aisa-demands-free-vaccine-at-the-earliest/article34186710.ece

29 March 2021||Yangon,||Global outrage after Myanmar bloodbath claims over 100 lives||Defence chiefs from a dozen countries on Sunday jointly condemned the bloodbath in Myanmar a day earlier, when at least 107 people — including seven children — were killed as security forces opened fire on anti-coup protesters. The junta on Saturday staged a major show of might for its annual Armed Forces Day as the death toll from crackdowns since the coup climbed to at least 423, according to a local monitoring group. The UN put Saturday’s death toll at 107 people — including seven children — but expects it to rise further. The defence chiefs of 12 countries, including the U.S., Britain, Japan and Australia, condemned the Myanmar military’s use of lethal force against civilians. “A professional military follows international standards for conduct and is responsible for protecting — not harming — the people it serves,” the rare joint statement said. “We urge the Myanmar Armed Forces to cease violence and work to restore respect and credibility with the people of Myanmar that it has lost through its actions.” Troops fire at funeral Meanwhile, Myanmar security forces opened fire on Sunday on a crowd attending the funeral of student who was killed on the bloodiest day yet of a crackdown on protests against last month’s coup, local media reported. According to the report, several people attending the funeral were arrested. It did not say if anyone was hurt or killed. But at least nine people were killed elsewhere on Sunday as the crackdown continued, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which has been tallying deaths during demonstrations against the coup. Relatives of 13-year-old boy Sai Waiyan, who was shot on Saturday while playing outside his house in Yangon, cried over his casket on Sunday afternoon, local media reported. At some of the funerals held on Sunday, crowd chanted pro-democracy slogans and raised the three-finger salute.  The military is also continuing to battle ethnic Karen fighters in the country’s east. About 3,000 villagers from territory controlled by the Karen fled across the border to Thailand on Sunday after military aircraft dropped bombs on a Karen guerrilla position, said workers for two humanitarian relief agencies. The Karen National Union is one of the organisations that have been fighting for decades to gain more autonomy from Myanmar’s central government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/global-outrage-after-myanmar-bloodbath-claims-over-100-lives/article34186399.ece
29 March 2021||Makassar,||Suicide bombers target Indonesia cathedral||Two attackers blew themselves up outside a packed Roman Catholic cathedral during a Palm Sunday Mass on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, wounding at least 20 people, police said. A video showed body parts scattered near a burning motorbike at the gates of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Cathedral in Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province. Reverend Wilhelmus Tulak, a priest at the church, said he had just finished celebrating Palm Sunday Mass when a loud bang shocked his congregation. He said the blast went off at about 10:30 a.m. as a first batch of churchgoers was walking out of the church and another group was coming in. He said security guards at the church were suspicious of two men on a motorcycle who wanted to enter the building and when they went to confront them, one of the men detonated his explosives. Woman suspect Police later said both attackers were killed instantly and evidence collected at the scene indicated one of the two was a woman. The wounded included four guards and several churchgoers, police said. The attack, a week before Easter in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, came as the country was on high alert following December’s arrest of the leader of militant group, Jemaah Islamiyah, which has been designated a terror group by many nations. Indonesia has been battling militants since bombings on the resort island of Bali in 2002 killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/suicide-bombers-target-indonesia-cathedral/article34186402.ece

The latest dispute, Manila said, was triggered by what it described as a swarm of more than 200 Chinese fishing vessels that have refused to withdraw from waters off the Whitsun Reef, near the disputed Spratly Islands, in an area located within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone. China, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, has said the ships were sheltering there because of weather conditions, a claim that Manila, which has lodged a protest with China over what it called an incursion, has rejected. Philippines Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the Air Force has now begun daily patrols over the fishing vessels, Agence France-Presse reported from Manila on Sunday. The Navy and Coast Guard have also been deployed in the vicinity of the Chinese ships, sparking a stand-off near the reef. “We are ready to defend our national sovereignty and protect the marine resources of the Philippines,” Mr. Lorenzana said. The stand-off follows a similar incident in 2019 triggered by Chinese fishing vessels near another disputed island in the Spratlys. As it did then, Manila has called on Beijing to acknowledge the 2016 arbitration case which recognised many of its claims. President Rodrigo Duterte mentioned the ruling in a meeting with the Chinese envoy in Manila this week, his spokesperson said. Beijing has rejected the arbitration, emphasising its sovereignty over the South China Sea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/philippines-deploys-aircraft-as-china-ships-spark-tensions/article34186393.ece

At least one million Uighurs and people from other mostly Muslim groups have been held in camps in the northwestern region, according to U.S. and Australian rights groups, which accuse Chinese authorities of forcibly sterilising women and imposing forced labour. China has repeatedly bridled at criticism of its treatment of the group. “A serious negotiation is at the present moment taking place between the Office of the (UN Human Rights) Commissioner and the Chinese authorities,” Mr. Guterres told Canada’s CBC television network. “I hope that they will reach an agreement soon” to allow a visit “without restrictions or limitations,” he added. Mr. Guterres said the Chinese had repeatedly affirmed to him “that they want that mission to take place.” On Saturday, Beijing announced sanctions against two Americans, a Canadian and a rights advocacy body that had criticised its treatment of the Uighurs, which U.S. officials have said constitutes genocide.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-in-dialogue-with-china-for-unrestricted-xinjiang-visit/article34186474.ece

He spoke out after China announced sanctions against two Americans, a Canadian and a rights advocacy body, in response to sanctions imposed this week by the two countries over Beijing’s treatment of the Uighur minority.

China crossed the 100 million-landmark amid a stepped up campaign at home, which reached a new daily high of 6.12 million vaccines administered on Friday. Wu Liangyou, deputy director of the NHC’s disease control bureau, said on Sunday the plan “focuses on key groups, including people who are in large or mid-sized cities, port cities or border areas, state-owned enterprise staff, college students and lecturers, and supermarket staff”, the Global Times newspaper quoted him as saying. In contrast to many other countries, China has focused on the 18-59 age group initially rather than on its senior citizens, with officials saying the idea was to inoculate those who are more likely to spread the virus, even if local transmission in China has been broadly controlled. China is now ranked second in the world in terms of total administered doses, with the U.S. having administered 130 million, the Global Times noted, with a plan to cover 40% of the entire population by June, which will require a stepped up daily rate of 10 million doses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/over-100-mn-vaccinated-says-china/article34186397.ece

The protesters — mostly from the hardline Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam — were angry at the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Bangladesh marked 50 years of independence, accusing him of stoking communal violence against Muslims in India. Five people died on Friday, and another six the next day, after police shot at demonstrators in several major districts across the Muslim-majority nation of 168 million people. The 19-year-old boy died in a hospital in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria after being caught up in clashes in the rural town of Sarail on Sunday, Shawkat Hossain, a doctor at the state-run centre, said. The cause of death was not yet known, he added. Two other people were feared dead, Sarail’s government administrator, Ariful Haq Mridul, said. Mr. Mridul said about 3,000 Hefazat supporters and Muslim villagers had taken part in the Sarail protests.

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Weighing in on the saga of a vaccine||The AstraZeneca SARS-CoV2 AZD1222 vaccine, which was developed at the University of Oxford, is a chimpanzee adenovirus strain which was engineered so that it could not replicate any more in humans. The team at Oxford had already begun to use this chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine technology to produce candidate vaccines against many pathogens including influenza, Zika and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. When work began They had also begun, with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), to use this technology in preparation for ‘Disease X’. When the sequence of SARS-CoV2 was released in January 2020, they moved very quickly to engineer a new candidate vaccine and begin work on a trial. Sarah Gilbert who led the team with others at the University of Oxford and the Jenner Institute announced very early on that she thought that we would have a vaccine available by October. This was really quite remarkable given that everyone else was predicting that we would not have vaccines available for at least 12 to 15 months. The team at Oxford and the Jenner had been working for a long time on candidate vaccines, and had the capacity to make pilot lots for clinical trials, but they did not have the capacity to make vaccines at scale, particularly those that would require millions or billions of doses. So, working with CEPI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Oxford team began discussions with multiple companies in order to figure out who could be a manufacturing and development partner for the vaccine. Initially, it was thought that it might be possible to engage with Merck, an American leader producing vast amounts of vaccines, but ultimately it was decided to go with AstraZeneca, a company that had no experience of vaccines other than a nasal flu spray, but was a British-Swedish pharma conglomerate. The vaccine began to be tested in humans in April 2020 and technology transfer agreements were agreed with SKBio in South Korea and the Serum Institute of India, and others; the goal was to make a vaccine that was suitable for use in immunisation programmes around the world and could be made at very large volumes. By December we had results that indicated the vaccine worked. Interpreting the vaccine data But before and after December, it has been an incredibly bumpy road for AstraZeneca. Before the trial results became available, the trial was stopped for a while to investigate a case of transverse myelitis in the United Kingdom. In India, a case of neurolupus led to questions about the responsibilities of investigators, sponsors and regulators. When the results were announced in December, the first report was by press release and indicated an efficacy of 70%, with some peculiar results showing that in some groups, efficacy could be as high as 90%. It first turned out there were several issues. The vaccine trials compared a single dose and two doses, and decided to go with two doses, but with supply issues, wound up with some people with a single dose and others with two doses, but with varying intervals because there were long gaps while waiting for supply initially, and then closer to the originally proposed four week interval as enough vaccine became available. To complicate matters further, there was an error in calculating doses, and some individuals had received vaccine doses that had less of the viral vector. Initially, it was reported that highest efficacy was seen with a lower first dose, and scientists scrambled to try and find an explanation. It was hypothesised that it might be because antibodies made in response to the first dose inhibited response to the second dose, but given that the difference was one of 25 billion and 50 billion viral particles, it seemed a bit unlikely. Later, as more data became available, it was clear that the longer time there was between doses, the immune response and efficacy were better. But considerable damage had already been done because of the messy sequential communications, even though results from multiple analyses were being rapidly published by the Oxford team. The vaccine data were reviewed by the regulator in the United Kingdom, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which gave emergency use authorisation, and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended initiation of vaccination in the U.K. with a 12 week gap. The data were reviewed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which also approved the vaccine and recommended its use. Since this vaccine was suitable for use within routine immunisation programmes, this was a reason to celebrate, because Serum, SKBio and AstraZeneca had all committed to making the vaccine available to the COVAX facility which is committed to providing vaccines to at least 20% of the world’s population, irrespective of the ability to pay. The case in Europe Unfortunately, the controversies continued. A few European countries refused to use the vaccine in older individuals, citing the lack of data from this subset in clinical trials. And then, cases of haematological side-effects which combined blood clots and low platelets began to be reported. So far, the data do not indicate a signal of side-effects that are above the baseline of thromboembolic events, but in a limited number of cases, the clinical picture is unusual and has been labelled vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia by researchers in Norway and Germany. This will continue to be investigated until we understand the association and the level of risk, but it is clear, and stated by the EMA and WHO, that the benefit far outweighs any rare risk. Even as the vaccine began to be widely used, the global community awaited trials of the vaccine in the U.S. and South America under Operation Warp Speed, and when a press release in March stated 79% efficacy, there was a sense of relief that, finally, clean and clear data from a study that included 32,000 people were available. This was followed swiftly by an unusual announcement by the U.S. government’s National Institutes of Health to say that the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) felt it essential to report that the data were outdated. The company said that they were reporting data until February 17 based on 141 cases and scrambled to get a fuller analysis of 190 cases showing an efficacy of 74% which was released last week. This throws up a lot of questions about why the DSMB felt it essential to bring this up, when other companies like Moderna and Pfizer had also reported first interim and then final results. In any case, the data will be independently reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. regulator, and then perhaps all the controversies can finally be put to rest. This vaccine has potential, but if this saga highlights anything, it is that in clinical research and development, logistics, transparency and communication matter as much as the science.

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||The needless resurrection of a buried issue||On November 9, 2019, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court gave its judgment in M. Siddiq v. Mahant Suresh Das, which is known as the  Ram Janmabhoomi temple case. The Bench comprised Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S.A. Bobde, D.Y. Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S. Abdul Nazeer. The record does not show who the author of the judgment was, so all the five judges can be said to have authored it. The judgment is an unequivocal expression of approval of The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. The Preamble of the Act reads: “An act to prohibit conversion of any place of worship and to provide for the maintenance of the religious character of any place of worship as it existed on the 15th day of August, 1947, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” Section 5 expressly exempts Ram Janmabhumi-Babri Masjid, situated in Ayodhya, from the Act. Supreme Court’s observations After analysing the Act, the Supreme Court said: “The law imposes two unwavering and mandatory norms: (i) A bar is imposed by Section 3 on the conversion of a place of worship of any religious denomination or a section of a denomination into a place of worship either of a different section of the same religious denomination or of a distinct religious denomination. The expression ‘place of worship’ is defined in the broadest possible terms to cover places of public religious worship of all religions and denominations and; (ii) The law preserves the religious character of every place of worship as it existed on 15 August 1947. Towards achieving this purpose, it provides for the abatement of suits and legal proceedings with respect to the conversion of the religious character of any place of worship existing on 15 August 1947.” The court said that the Places of Worship Act “protects and secures the fundamental values of the Constitution.” It further said, “The law addresses itself to the State as much as to every citizen of the nation. Its norms bind those who govern the affairs of the nation at every level. Those norms implement the Fundamental Duties under Article 51A and are hence positive mandates to every citizen as well.” The court also emphatically held that “the Places of Worship Act is intrinsically related to the obligations of a secular state. It reflects the commitment of India to the equality of all religions. Above all, the Places of Worship Act is an affirmation of the solemn duty which was cast upon the State to preserve and protect the equality of all faiths as an essential constitutional value, a norm which has the status of being a basic feature of the Constitution.” The court more pithily stated: “Historical wrongs cannot be remedied by the people taking the law in their own hands. In preserving the character of places of public worship, Parliament has mandated in no uncertain terms that history and its wrongs shall not be used as instruments to oppress the present and the future.” The court took serious exception to the judgment of Justice D.V. Sharma of the Allahabad High Court wherein he had held, “Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 does not debar those cases where declaration is sought for a period prior to the Act came into force or for enforcement of right which was recognised before coming into force of the Act.” The Supreme Court declared that this is directly contrary to Section 4 of the Act. Despite the fact that Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid was exempted from the Act, the Supreme Court expressed its anguish. It said, “On 6 December 1992, the structure of the mosque was brought down and the mosque was destroyed... The destruction of the mosque and the obliteration of the Islamic structure was an egregious violation of the rule of law.” A deeply disturbing move Yet, on March 12, 2021, the Supreme Court issued notice to the Central government on a petition that was filed challenging the validity of certain provisions of the 1991 Act. The petition seeks setting aside of Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Act on the grounds that they “validate ‘ places of worship’, illegally made by barbaric invaders.” The Bench consisted of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justice A.S. Bopanna. The petition is founded, inter alia, on the basis that, “From 1192-1947, the invaders not only damaged destroyed desecrated the places of worship and pilgrimage depicting Indian culture from north to south, east to west but also occupied the same under military power. Therefore, S. 4 is a serious jolt on the cultural and religious heritage of India.” The Supreme Court’s order on issuing notice on this petition is deeply disturbing on many counts. Every argument being raised now was repelled by the five judges in their binding judgment in M. Siddiq v. Mahant Suresh Das.  Freedom of religion is guaranteed to all citizens under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution. The framers of our Constitution debated these Articles extensively. Tajamul Husain said, “As I said, religion is between oneself and his God. Then, honestly profess religion and practise it at home. Do not demonstrate it for the sake of propagating... If you start propagating religion in this country, you will become a nuisance to others... I submit, Sir, that this is a secular State, and a secular state should not have anything to do with religion. So I would request you to leave me alone, to practise and profess my own religion privately.” Lokanath Misra strongly objected to the right to propagate religion by saying, “Sir, We have declared the State to be a Secular State. For obvious and for good reasons we have so declared...” H. V. Kamath warned, “...because Asoka adopted Buddhism as the State religion, there developed some sort of internecine feud between the Hindus and Buddhists, which ultimately led to the overthrow and the banishment of Buddhism from India. Therefore, it is clear to my mind that if a State identifies itself with any particular religion, there will be rift within the State.” Pandit Lakshmi Kanta Maitra said, “By secular State, as I understand it, is meant that the State is not going to make any discrimination whatsoever on the ground of religion or community against any person professing any particular form of religious faith... The great Swami Vivekananda used to say that India is respected and revered all over the world because of her rich spiritual heritage.” T.T. Krishnamachari laid emphasis on the fact that “a new government and the new Constitution have to take things as they are, and unless the status quo has something which offends all ideas of decency, all ideas of equity and all ideas of justice, its continuance has to be provided for in the Constitution so that people who are coming under the regime of a new government may feel that the change is not a change for the worse.” The 1991 law was enacted to assuage the feelings of the Hindus who had been seeking Ram Janmabhoomi for a long, long time and to reassure Muslims that other places of their worship existing on August 15, 1947 shall be protected. The court rightly gave a quietus to this burning issue. Hopefully that was final.

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||An antidote to Islamophobia, within and beyond||If Islamist terror is a major international issue today, so is the response to it. For instance, the UN ‘Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief’ flagged the “epidemic proportions” of anti-Muslim hatred with the lament that member states responded to security threats “by adopting measures which disproportionately target Muslims and define Muslims as both high risk and at risk of radicalization”. Exploring the reasons In fact, the spread of Islamophobia across the globe has been so rampant over the last couple of decades that it is now considered an industry and a subject of study in psychiatry. Springer, one of world’s leading scientific publishers, brought out a volume in 2019 titled Islamophobia and Psychiatry: Recognition, Prevention, and Treatment .  The Cambridge dictionary describes Islamophobia as an “unreasonable dislike or fear of, and prejudice against, Muslims or Islam.”But the All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims (APPG) goes further and equates it with racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness. The APPG has a point because long before the term gained currency, Frantz Fanon, the celebrated anti-colonial writer and psychoanalyst, had engaged with Islamophobia without mentioning it, and saw it as an expression of religious racism of the colonising West. In The Wretched of the Earth , which Fanon wrote in the context of the French occupation of Muslim Algeria, he described “the church in the colonies,” as “the white people’s Church, the foreigner’s Church. She does not call the native to God’s ways but to the ways of the white man, of the master, of the oppressor.” The West’s fear Despite this depressing reality, the West’s fear of Islam or Muslims has little to do with religion and everything to do with cultural frictions and political rivalries as Graham E. Fuller rightly concluded in A World without Islam . In the case of India too it was the tussle for power that made people like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Chandranath Basu, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bhai Parmanand suspect the Muslims. If in Ananda Math ,  Bankim Chandra Chatterjee fictionalised Hindu nationalistic sentiments by narrating how “everyone was angry with the Muslims for the anarchy and lawlessness of their reign”, in the early 1900s, Rai and Parmanand floated the idea of territorially separating Hindus and Muslims long before Jinnah imagined Pakistan. Even B.R. Ambedkar was not sure about the political stability of an undivided India. In his book Thoughts on Pakistan he wanted the Hindus to concede Jinnah’s demand for a separate Muslim state because without Pakistan, India would have to contend with 65 million Muslims, while after its creation, this number would fall to 20 million thus greatly reducing the proportion of Muslim to Hindu seats in central and provincial legislatures, which would further fall once weightage was cancelled. It is this same unfounded fear of Muslim numbers that reflects in the recent enactment of laws against “love-jihad” by several Indian States, and raucous calls for a population regulation law in India to “tackle the problem of declining Hindu population and to stop the rise of non-Hindu population”. The Muslim contribution But what is inexplicable is, more than seven decades after Partition, anti-Muslim sentiment not just exists but continues to surge in India. Why is this so if Muslims have consciously stayed away from terrorism and never betrayed the faith reposed in them by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who in September 2014 had said, “Indian Muslims will live for India. They will die for India. They will not want anything bad for India.”? Apart from the aforementioned reasons, the answer lies in the fact that Muslim religious leaders have done nothing to encourage the community to win the trust of other people, a basic requirement for peaceful coexistence. Unlike political trust in liberal democracies which according to British author Marek Kohn is founded upon the suspicion that the powerful will be tempted to abuse power, social trust (as argued by American political scientist Eric Uslaner) is based on the optimistic premise that although people may follow different religions or secular ideologies, they hold fundamental values in common. The Muslim clergy has miserably failed on this front. It saw the illegal demolition of the Babri Masjid as condemnable act of religious extremism but remained a mute spectator when a Hindu temple was burnt down in Pakistan a few months ago. And when Pakistan’s Supreme Court ordered its reconstruction, no Muslim religious organisation welcomed the decision. However, provocative televangelist Zakir Naik issued a statement that non-Muslims in a Muslim state do not have the right to construct their places of worship even with their own funds. The unIslamic conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque was also greeted with either deafening silence or quiet support. Similar clerical hypocrisy prevails when it comes to condemning draconian laws in Muslim countries such as those pertaining to blasphemy and apostasy in Pakistan whose blatant misuse has resulted in the murder of both Muslims and non-Muslims. The Islamically baseless concept of ghazwa al Hind (war against India) is another issue on which the Indian ulema are silent. The issue continues to be invoked by the Hindu right to question the loyalty of Muslims, and thus, is yet another reason for Hindu-Muslim mistrust. Overcoming the suspicion If this climate of suspicion has to be overcome, the Indian ulema must emphatically declare the concept of ghazwa al-Hind to be unIslamic apart from clarifying that India is not darul harb (abode of war). They must also announce that the word kafir has no pejorative overtones and does not refer to non-Muslims. Apostasy and blasphemy have also got to be removed from the list of capital crimes under Islamic law. In short, what is needed is a radical rethink of Muslim theology. As this is not possible in India with the outdated madrasa system in existence, it is up to the Muslim laity to shed its deferential docility and start challenging the self-proclaimed epistemological supremacy of “religious authorities” and pressurise them into completely revamping the madrasa curriculum to harmonise it with the pluralistic teachings of Islam and modernity. There is no other antidote to Islamophobia from within. A. Faizur Rahman is Secretary-General of the Islamic Forum for the Promotion of Moderate Thought.

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Confronting opacity||On March 24 last year, the Government of India imposed a sudden, harsh lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19. In doing so, it gave the people of the country less than four hours to prepare for the eventuality. How successful have the governmental measures been in containing the pandemic? What explains the second wave we are witnessing now? Apart from the health cost, the pandemic has taken a huge economic, ethical and moral toll on the population. In their research for the UNESCO, with the support of the International Center for Journalists, Julie Posetti and Kalina Bontcheva document how the pandemic has spawned potentially deadly misinformation and disinformation that directly impacts lives and livelihoods around the world. They point out that one of the techniques adopted by political players to deflect attention from their own inadequacies is to discredit journalists and credible news outlets. In need of transparency In these times of unprecedented difficulties, a transparent decision-making system is the only way forward. It will help citizens know where we went wrong and how we can course correct. It will create a situation where we do not heap new policy hardships on the populace over and above an imperious decision that has already pushed many to the brink. We hoped that the highest court will stand with the people of the country in their quest for transparency and openness. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court of India, which first introduced the notorious idea of sealed envelopes, has been in the forefront of upholding and valorising opacity. How else can one read the observation of the first bench in the electoral bonds case where it concurred that the scheme protected the identity of purchasers of electoral bonds in a cloak of anonymity, but came to the conclusion that eventually the State Bank of India will know the identity of the buyer? The editorial, ‘In-house secrets’ (March 27), listed out the perils flowing from adopting opaque methods in dealing with complaints against the judiciary: “Should the confidentiality rule always hold the field? Is it possible to dismiss the allegations without disclosing who were heard as witnesses and what material was considered as evidence?” In this environment where seeking accountability is fast being replaced by endorsing those in power and their decisions, however harmful they may be, the question before journalists is this: How do we help people make informed choices? There are two components to good journalism: providing credible information and making sense of complex realities. One of the key elements that distinguishes a journalist from an onlooker is the nature of the observation. A journalist bears witness to events and happenings and that is vastly different from a casual and sometimes voyeuristic gaze. The heart of journalism In the last 35 years, I have been a reporter bearing witness and an opinion writer trying to make sense. I have no hesitation in declaring that reporting is the heart of journalism. It brings in elements of transparency, accountability and the voices of people who are impacted by the decisions taken by governments. Filmmaker Vinod Kapri exemplifies this act of bearing witness, in his documentary 1232km, in which he meticulously records the difficulties encountered by a group of migrant labourers in their arduous journey from Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of Delhi, to Saharsa in Bihar. Six years ago, British journalist Charlie Beckett posed a crucial question: Is good news really news at all? He asked a pointed question: “News can be informed and informing or crass, shallow and swift, but now it is all networked together. The choice is there for the journalists but it’s also there for consumers. Which do you want?” At that time, I did not realise that the executive would become the sole arbitrator of our life. Let us look at the functioning of our Parliament. In the last six years, the accent has been in getting more bills cleared rather than debating the pros and cons of a policy. Can someone explain the meaning of the claims that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was more than 110% and that of the Rajya Sabha was more than 120%? It was a display of the might of the majority rather than the democratic mediation of ideas. Hence, reporting alone can confront the all-pervasive opacity in the legislature and the judiciary. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/confronting-opacity/article34186386.ece
29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Tackling the period taboo||In February 2020, college authorities, including the principal, of the Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute (SSGI) in Bhuj, Gujarat, allegedly forced over 60 girls to remove their undergarments to check if they were menstruating. This shocking act, which rightly caused outrage, followed complaints that the girls had entered the temple and kitchen in the premises while on their period, which is against the institute’s rules. Four persons were later arrested. Notions of purity and pollution The stigma attached to menstruation and restrictions in the private and public sphere for the duration of menstruation have long been part of women’s lives in India. The stigma finds its roots in the notion of purity and pollution attached historically to menstruation. This was explained exceptionally by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud in Indian Young Lawyers Association v. The State of Kerala (2018), known popularly as the Sabarimala case, a decision that India is still struggling to accept. He reasoned — and rightly so — that any social practice which excludes women from participation in public life as a result of their menstruation is discriminatory on the ground of their sex. This is because it is drawn from the notion of menstruating women being “impure”, a notion which targets the physiological feature of being women. The first ground for rejecting such practices is thus differential treatment, which directly discriminates women on the ground of their sex and is impermissible under Article 14 of the Constitution. Viewed from another lens, it is also against the notion of substantive equality adopted by the Constitution. In fact, it supports a more formal notion of equality of ‘separate but equal treatment’. Women are treated differently because they have distinct physiological features than men but are nevertheless equal to men. An attractive explanation also used to justify caste discrimination previously is nothing but a guise to perpetuate and exacerbate regressive patriarchal notions of our society and must also be readily dismissed under Article 14. That apart, such social exclusion can be attacked on the ground of privacy. Incidents such as what took place in SSGI not only attack the ‘sex’ of women, but also impact a deeply personal and an intrinsic part of their privacy, namely, their menstrual status. Restrictions of movement imposed on these students are one of the many attempts of state and non-state actors to take control of their person. It is an outrageous exercise of power to prevent them from leading a dignified life during their period. It is undoubtedly an excessive invasion of a biological feature that makes them women. This surely cannot be the intent of our Constitution and its values we adopted, and needs to change. Court intervention Taking cognisance of the incident at SSGI, the Gujarat High Court, in early March this year, proposed to introduce a set of guidelines that prohibit the social exclusion of menstruating women from private, public, religious and educational places. The court also emphasised on the negative impact created by such practices on a woman’s emotional state, lifestyle and, most significantly, her health. While surely a ray of hope, the effect of court intervention is yet to be seen in a society where previous decisions of courts categorically holding menstruation to be a part of the fundamental right to (private) life have failed to change societal notions surrounding it. The hope for women is that society will slowly but surely get past the taboo around menstruation, and abhorrent practices discriminating against menstruating women will be considered abnormal. That will be a society where no exclusion will be practiced and tolerated, and no discrimination will be perpetrated. It will be a society where women can freely live dignified lives, nurturing all facets of their womanhood. And it will be a society where women will be considered neither polluted nor impure during their menstruation, but will be treated with respect.

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Limited succour||The Supreme Court’s decision on a batch of petitions seeking waiver of all interest during the period of the pandemic-specific moratorium, relief from compound interest for the period for all borrowers without distinction and extension of the moratorium period itself is a fair verdict. The Court has sought to limit the scope of its juridical intervention to the questions of whether any laws have been violated and whether any actions that banks may have taken under the policy guidance of the government and central bank likely violated any rights of the petitioners. Observing that “wisdom and advisability of economic policy are ordinarily not amenable to judicial review”, the Bench denied all but one of the petitioners’ pleas: it held that the government’s decision to limit the waiver of compound interest to loans under Rs. 2 crore was “arbitrary and discriminatory” and directed a refund of all compound interest levied during the moratorium period. The Court justly flagged the absurdity of levying the compound interest on any category of loans since by its very nature it was a penal interest intended to impose a cost on wilful or deliberate default, while a borrower’s decision to defer repayment of instalment by availing of the moratorium could not be considered wilful default by any stretch. This part of the ruling would surely come as a welcome relief to borrowers across categories and loan size, while adding a relatively smaller burden — estimated at about Rs. 7,500 crore — on lenders (or the Centre, if the government decides to foot the bill and spare banks the cost). On the other hand, the Court appears to have taken a literal view of whether the National Disaster Management Act’s provisions were contravened by authorities’ response to the economic fallout of the pandemic, which it acknowledged to be a disaster due to “biological emergencies”. While the Centre’s and Reserve Bank of India’s arguments that any attempt to extend the moratorium and/or widen the waiver to include regular interest would undermine overall stability in the financial system are undeniably germane, the fact that the pandemic has proved to be an unprecedented disaster in terms of the health and economic costs it has imposed on all sections of society and the economy ought to have evoked a more holistic and expansive fiscal response from the government. Vast sections of small formal and informal enterprises as well as lower income households are saddled with debt that they are certainly bound to struggle to service in the absence of some direct credit support mechanism. So, the Court’s ruling notwithstanding, it behoves policymakers to urgently come up with measures to help mitigate this crisis before lenders are deluged with more defaults.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/limited-succour/article34186373.ece
29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Opacity rules||The reasons given by the Supreme Court for not staying the issuance of electoral bonds are unconvincing. A Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, Justice S.A. Bobde, has said there is no justification for staying the scheme as electoral bonds have been released in 2018, 2019 and 2020 without any legal impediment; and that “certain safeguards” have been provided in the Court’s interim order of April 12, 2019. The Court ought to have considered that when the earlier order was passed, the time available was deemed to be too limited for an in-depth hearing. An order favouring the continuance of the scheme cannot be repeated year after year. The portion of the 2019 order asking political parties to submit to the Election Commission in a sealed cover all details of the anonymous contributions received through electoral bonds was meant to avoid tilting the balance in favour of either side until the matter was heard in detail. It was also underscored then that “weighty issues which have a tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country” were involved. In this context, it defies logic for the Court to maintain that no interim stay is necessary while not giving any indication when it will take up the case for final disposal. The latest order also fails to note that the submission of contribution particulars by political parties was a one-time arrangement. There is nothing to suggest that it applies to subsequent tranches of the sale of electoral bonds. Therefore, to describe it as a ‘safeguard’ has little meaning. The problem with taking up only applications for stay is that vital constitutional issues do not fall under the zone of consideration. The infirmity in the electoral bonds scheme is not, as the Court seems to suggest, limited to ‘black money’ being used to fund parties. It has laboured to point out that the scheme works solely through banking channels and can be utilised only with KYC-compliant entities. However, the crux of the issue is the anonymity given to corporate donors in combination with the absence of any ceiling. This means that the right to know of voters, recognised as a constitutional right in past rulings, is abridged. Further, the link between contributions and policy-making remains impenetrable to the citizen. Any number of shell companies can be created, and their bank accounts used for making anonymous contributions. The claim that the veil of anonymity can be pierced with a little effort by matching the audited accounts of parties with the statutory filings of companies is quite way off the mark. Parties declare a cumulative figure of amounts received through the bonds. No inference can be drawn by a company’s disclosure of its total contribution to one or more political parties. It is time the Court recognised that the electoral bonds scheme, by its very nature, undermines the voters’ right to know.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/opacity-rules/article34186374.ece

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Financial planning requires expertise, RIAs may be able to help||Q.I am a 30-year-old government employee. My net monthly savings is Rs. 30,000 and I have just started investing Rs. 7,000 a month in two ELSS SIPs with a return of about 7%. I want to invest my remaining savings of Rs. 23,000 to help me achieve my target of a Rs. 15 lakh corpus in 3-4 years. I can bear moderate-to-high risks and my taxable income for FY21 is nil. Please advise. Dileep Kumar A.If you have a goal within 3-4 years, it is not a good idea to invest in equity funds in order to achieve it. Therefore, ELSS funds are not a good vehicle for this goal. Though you’ve set your return expectations modest at 7%, we’ve been in a bull market in stocks for the last six years, as a result of which most stocks have turned quite expensive, if not overvalued. The markets can correct significantly from here. Should a deep correction materialise, even a bounce-back to current levels can take more than the 3-to-4-year time frame you have in mind. This would mean a longer wait to recoup capital losses before making a return. Yes, SIPs can help by averaging your costs lower but they can begin to deliver returns only if the markets bounce back. The other problem with ELSS SIPs is that each instalment you pay is locked in for 3 years. You will be able to withdraw your entire money only after 6 years when every SIP completes the 3-year lock-in period. Yes, ELSS SIPs are a good instrument for tax savings and goals beyond 6-7 years. But, you should consider stopping your SIPs if you were not aware of these factors before commencing them. In future, if you don’t need tax benefits, avoid ELSS and invest in plain index funds. If you are able to free up Rs. 30,000 to invest every month for the next 4 years, you can easily get to Rs. 15 lakh as the value of your capital alone over these 4 years will be Rs. 14.4 lakh. You can stick to safe instruments that offer capital preservation. A simple recurring deposit with HDFC Bank (5.3%) or Axis Bank (5.4%) can get you to over Rs. 16 lakh with minimal risk to your capital. You can also consider SIPs in very conservatively-managed ultra-short term debt and liquid funds. If you go for the growth option, it is more tax efficient than the dividend option and also recurring deposits. Your gains after 3 years will be taxed as capital gains after considering inflation indexation. Q.I am 30-year-old government servant. I invest the maximum limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh every year in PPF. I want to invest via SIPs beginning with Rs. 5,000 a month. Could you please recommend the best fund manager to invest with? My risk appetite is moderate. Sachin Thakur A.The Public Provident Fund is a good choice for any new investor with its high tax-free return and you should continue your savings with it. Before getting down to starting SIPs or choosing funds, it would be good to map out your financial goals with their timelines. It would also be good to put your investment basics in place by building an emergency fund, buying life and health insurance to protect your income in case of unfortunate circumstances. First, save up to six months’ worth of living expenses in bank FDs to take care of any interruption to your income or sudden emergencies. If you have dependants, you should buy a pure term insurance policy so that your family isn’t left short of financial security in case something happens to you. To prevent health issues from putting a big dent in your finances, get a basic Rs. 5-lakh health insurance policy. Once these building blocks are in place, list out your financial goals and those of your dependents that you plan to meet. Put timelines to each goal. Where you invest towards each goal will depend on both your return requirement and the time you have. For 1-to-3-year goals, invest in safe instruments like post office time deposits, recurring deposits and FDs with leading banks. For 3-to-5-year goals, consider SIPs in short term debt mutual funds. For 5-to-7-year goals, hybrid funds may fit the bill or post office schemes like NSC can be explored. For goals beyond 7 years, SIPs in carefully chosen multi-cap equity funds or broad market index funds would be ideal. A qualified financial adviser can help plan out all this. But if you want to choose funds on your own, it would be best to do SIPs in index funds like Nifty500 and Nifty100 rather than attempt to choose actively-managed equity funds on your own. Q.I am 38 years old and am in the private sector. I save Rs. 5,000 a month, which I’ve been investing in MFs for the past six years. I would like to target Rs. 1 crore for retirement... Anbu A A.At an assumed return of 10% CAGR, you will need to invest a total of about Rs. 13,100 a month in equity funds or other avenues over the next 20 years to get to a Rs. 1-crore corpus. However, you are wrong to assume that a Rs. 1- crore corpus would be adequate for your retirement. Remember, even at 5% inflation rate, monthly expenses of Rs. 50,000 today would have bloated to Rs. 1.32 lakh in 20 years. As a thumb rule, you should strive to have at least 25 years’ worth of living expenses by the time you retire (you can use online retirement calculators for more precise calculations). So, your retirement corpus should be roughly Rs. 3.9 crore in 20 years’ time (1.32*12*25). Retirement planning would require you to also step up those SIPs over the years, adjust your retirement targets based on your lifestyle and liabilities and constantly monitor and rebuild your portfolio to ensure its on track. Do use the services of a qualified financial planner to do a really systematic job of this if you won’t have the time or the skills. Q.Is there a government licensing agency website that can provide a list of licensed financial planners? If not, what is the best way to find a genuine and reliable financial planner? Could you give an idea of a financial planner’s indicative fee for consultations? Chandranath Patra A.It is very wise of you, indeed, to seek professional help to construct a financial plan and to help you with your investment journey. Most folks who consult doctors, lawyers, accountants and a variety of other professionals for their other requirements, like to think that they can manage their financial journey by themselves. Financial planning requires considerable expertise as it requires gauging your goals and risk profile, prioritising your goals and setting timelines, putting portfolio basics like insurance in place and making an asset allocation plan, before getting on to product choices. Your financial plan is also not a one-shot exercise and will need constant attention throughout your life. As most folks do not have requisite expertise and cannot devote sufficient time to this, it is best to engage a fee-based Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) or Certified Financial Planner. This listing on SEBI’s website will allow you to look for an RIA in your city: https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/other/OtherAction.do?doRecognised Fpi=yes&intmId=13. This link from the Financial Planning Standards Board will allow you to find a financial planner in your city: https://india.fpsb.org/cfp-certificants-directory/. Unfortunately, there’s no publicly-available rating or feedback process which will allow you to assess financial planners before selecting one. A test of a good RIA is how much time he or she spends understanding your financial situation, goals and risk profile before getting down to your financial plan. An adviser who starts pushing products from the word go is best avoided. Look for a systematic process and a fairly large roster of existing clients before you sign up. Ask for client testimonies. If you can get friends or acquaintances to recommend good financial advisers they’ve been using, that would be a good start. Fee structures range from flat to ones based on a percentage of assets managed. SEBI’s guidelines cap the maximum fee at Rs. 1.25 lakh per annum per client or 2.5% of assets under advice for registered investment advisers. However, actual fees can be much lower. Professional planners will ask you to sign a written agreement of what they will offer before proceeding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/financial-planning-requires-expertise-rias-may-be-able-to-help/article34186369.ece
29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||A pension plan can fund your retired life||An annuity policy should find a place in your basket of retirement investments. The return on investment may not look attractive, but remember it is not an investment but a protection against the risk of living too long. For this, the life insurance company charges you a premium. Living for 30 years after retirement is common now and the pension policy will fund you. If you live for 35 or 40 years after retirement, it will still be there. There are two types of annuity policies. An immediate annuity where the pension starts immediately when you pay the purchase price, and the deferred annuity where you accumulate a corpus over years and this is used to purchase an annuity on a pre-decided ‘vesting’ date – usually your retirement date. With over 25 companies and hundreds of options, which policy to buy is the haunting question. Standardised policies Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s (IRDAI) recent strategy has been to design standardised policies to serve as awareness as well as reference points for product benefits and costs. A standardised policy helps you compare pricing across companies for the same set of benefits. Comparing the benefits and pricing of this policy with other policies of the same company in the same category helps you guess the pricing matrix. Enter ‘Saral Pension,’ the standardised immediate annuity policy that all life insurers have to offer from April 1. “XYZ Life Insurance Company Saral Pension,’ as they will be called, has to be a single-premium, non-linked, non-participating immediate annuity plan. Non-linked means your premium will not be invested in the capital markets, but in a safe set of baskets as per regulations. Non-participating or non-par means that the policy will not participate in the profits of such investment. Your annuity will be fixed and guaranteed with no risk of loss and no promise of bonuses. Saral Pension will have only two annuity options viz. annuity for life with 100% return of purchase price and joint life annuity with 100% annuity to the primary annuitant, on their death to the secondary annuitant and then, return of 100% purchase price on the death of last survivor. This saves you from being befuddled by 8 or 10 options and lends clarity to the benefits and their pricing. The policy will cover male, female and transgender lives in the age group 40 to 80, on an individual basis. Minimum annuity of Rs. 1,000 if monthly, Rs. 3,000 if quarterly, Rs. 6,000 if half-yearly and Rs. 12,000 if annual, all in arrears, are to be offered, and the purchase price depends on the target annuity amount. There is no maturity benefit, but a loan is possible after six months after start of the policy. The interest rate will be equal to the 10-year government securities rate as on April 1 of that year plus not over 200 basis points. The loan is recovered from payable annuities and capped so that the interest is not more than 50% of the annuity amount. After six months from the date of commencement, the policy can be surrendered on diagnosis of specified critical illness of the annuitant(s) or any of their children. The surrender value is 95% of the purchase price less any outstanding loans and interest and the policy is terminated after this. While pricing is left to the insurers, band-wise annuity rates are to be derived based on purchase price ranges viz. less than Rs. 2 lakh, Rs. 2 lakh to less than Rs. 5 lakh, Rs. 5 lakh to less than Rs. 10 lakh, Rs. 10 lakh to less than Rs. 25 lakh and Rs. 25 lakh and above. Sounds like a lot of details? Remember, data becomes relevant only when there is a reference point for comparison. So, you can either buy the standard policy itself or use it to interpret the cost benefit of comparable policies.

29 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indian teams trap gold in style||It was a brilliant climax for the host, as the men’s and women’s teams nailed the elusive trap gold in the shooting World Cup that concluded at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Sunday. Even though the team’s spearhead Kynan Chenai was not at his best in the single-barrel competition, the Indian team pulled together remarkably well to beat the tricky Slovakian team 6-4. Michal Slamka, Adrian Drobny and Filip Marinov had helped Slovakia top the qualification four points ahead of the host, but India had the last laugh. When one point was required with three shots to go for India, Kynan missed. But Prithviraj smashed the clay to celebrate with a clenched fist. Asian Games silver medallist Lakshay Shoran put the icing on the cake by hitting the last target and triggering a celebration. The Indian women’s team of Shreyasi Singh, Manisha Keer and Rajeshwari Kumari had it relatively easy, as it outclassed Kazakhstn 6-0. The Indian team had to earlier endure the ignominy of being beaten to the gold in the men’s rapid fire pistol team competition by USA. Keith Sanderson, Jack Hobson and Henry Turner were quite sharp as USA beat India 10-2. Olympian Gurpreet Singh struggled to find his rhythm, but Vijayveer Sidhu and Adarsh Singh tried to make a fight of it, albeit in patches. India topped the medals table with 15 gold, nine silver and six bronze. USA followed a distant second with four gold, three silver and a bronze. Italy and Denmark had two golds each, while Kazakhstan, Slovakia, Iran, Estonia, Britain and Slovenia won at least one gold. The 82 medals, with 30 gold and 30 silver were shared by 22 of the 59 countries.  The results: Men: 25m rapid fire pistol team: 1. USA (Keith Sanderson, Jack Hobson, Henry Turner) 10 (571) 868; 2. India (Gurpreet Singh, Vijayveer Sidhu, Adarsh Singh) 2 (552) 857.   Trap: 1. India (Kynan Chenai, Prithviraj Tondaiman, Lakshay Sheoran) 6 (494); 2. Slovakia (Michal Slamka, Adrian Drobny, Filip Marinov) 4 (498); 3. Kazakhstan (Viktor Khassyanov, Maxim Kolomoyets, Andrey Mogilevskiy) 6 (489); 4. Qatar (Saeed Abusharb, Nasser Ali Al Hemadi, Mohammed Al Rumaihi) 4 (466).   Women: Trap: 1. India (Shreyasi Singh, Manisha Keer, Rajeshwari Kumari) 6 (321); 2. Kazakhstan (Mariya Dmitriyenko, Aizhan Dosmagambetova, Sarsenkul Rysbekova) 0 (308).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-teams-trap-gold-in-style/article34186525.ece
29 March 2021||PUNE,||Shardul, Bhuvi thwart England’s spirited chase as India wins thriller||Sam Curran waged one of the finest assaults by a lower-order batsman on Indian soil. However, the southpaw couldn’t take England home as the visiting side fell agonisingly short of what could have been one of the most memorable comeback wins to hand India the third and final ODI, and the trophy, on Sunday. After India adopted an aggressive approach from the start and got bowled out for 329 in the penultimate over on yet another belter of a surface at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, England staged a remarkable late charge, thanks to Curran’s exploits. But T. Natarajan defended 12 runs in the last over to help India clinch a seven-run win to seal the series. All-format success The ODI series win meant India registered clean sweep in each of the three formats against England over gruelling two months. But when Curran joined Moeen Ali at the crease in the 26th over, India looked to be cruising towards sealing the series. Shardul Thakur had broken the back of England’s middle-order. At 168 for six, the target of 330 looked well out of sight for England. When Moeen’s uppish drive was latched on to by Hardik at mid-off to give Bhuvneshwar his third scalp in the 31st over, India was the only likely winner. However, with brother Tom making way for Mark Wood, Sam had to rely on Adil Rashid to hang in there along with him. Had Hardik, who had earlier dropped a skier to hand Ben Stokes a reprieve earlier in the evening, not dropped running to his right from long-on off M. Prasidh Krishna, the game would have come to an early finish. But once he got the reprieve, left-handed Sam showed his all-round ability as a batsman. Mounting pressure Just when Sam and Rashid’s 57-run stand was giving India a headache, Shardul was reintroduced into the attack and captain Kohli caught a stunner at short-cover to see Rashid’s back. Then on, till the last over, Sam farmed strike and Mark Wood batted sensibly whenever he had to and the pressure continued to mount on India. His 16-over assault on Thakur in the 47th over brought England within touching distance. In the penultimate over, India dropped two more chances, thus raising England bench’s hopes. However, with 12 required off the last over, Sam slipped while turning back for the second and Hardik’s rocket throw from long-on caught Wood short of the crease. Natarajan then bowled tight to help India cross the line.  Earlier in the afternoon, India took a cue from England’s crash-bang-wallop approach and executed it to near-perfection. Despite England bowlers depriving India of running away with the game by causing two mini-collapses, India piled on a sizeable total. Thanks to quickfire partnerships between openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan; and power-hitters Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya, India brought up a total of 329 before being bowled out in the penultimate over after being asked to bat for the third time in succession. When Virat Kohli attempted an outlandish swat off Moeen’s offspin in the 18th over, the world champion could have been hoping to end the tour on a high. Virat’s dismissal was the third wicket to lose in 19 balls and the home team was in danger of throwing away the advantage. Despite pressing the accelerator from the beginning, Rohit (bowled through the gate) and Dhawan (return catch) had been undone by Adil Rashid’s googlies in successive overs after they put on 103 in less than 15 overs. But Pant and Hardik’s flawless strokeplay resulted in a 99-run stand off just 70 balls. Thakur’s cameo ensured India crossed the 320-run mark despite losing the last four wickets in eight balls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/thakur-bhuvi-thwart-englands-spirited-chase-as-india-wins-thriller/article34186467.ece
29 March 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Gokulam Kerala’s remarkable success story||From debutant four years ago to champion now — it has been a fascinating journey for Gokulam Kerala at the I-League. Expectations were not high when Gokulam Kerala opened its campaign in its maiden I-League, in 2017-18. But despite a poor start, Gokulam earned the tag of the giant killer after defeating strong teams like East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Minerva Punjab. It, however, could finish only seventh in the ten-team competition. The second I-League season proved much worse, as Gokulam ended up second from bottom. Modest beginnings Initially, it was not just the expectations of Gokulam that were modest; as was the budget. But that has changed, as the club decided to invest big money on foreign recruits. That has paid dividends too. Marcus Joseph, Henry Kisekka and Nathaniel Garcia were superb last season, which had to be cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. Gokulam was placed fifth when the league was stopped. This season too, Gokulam has been served well by its foreign players. Denny Antwi scored 11 goals to finish second in the list of top-scorers, while Sharif Mukhammed, who scored the equaliser against Churchill Brothers on Saturday, has been one of the standout performers. Right decisions The team management’s decision to rope in 36-year-old Vincenzo Alberto Annese from Italy as the coach in place of Spaniard Fernando Santiago Valero also proved right. The Italian has succeeded in turning a bunch of talented players into a champion side in so little time. Technical director Bino George, who was instrumental in putting the team together as its first coach four years ago, too has played a part in Gokulam’s success. The team has benefited immensely from his eye for sporting fresh local talent, such as Emil Benny, who was named the Player of the Match in the decider against Churchill Brothers. The maiden I-League title could not have come at a better time for Kerala. The State is no longer the dominant force it was in Indian football. Gokulam Kerala’s spectacular success could attract kids to the football ground once again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gokulam-keralas-remarkable-success-story/article34186885.ece

Midfielder Parokkottil easily converted it with the shot to the top left corner that gave goalkeeper Sabari Das no chance. It was his third goal in the KPL.

He came on as second change when the ball didn’t swing at all and it was a flat deck. It’s very difficult for a bowler to bowl in such a situation,” Bhuvneshwar said. “He changed the match during that phase. He played the role that usually spinners play; we were one spinner short today. He gave us the breakthrough and an upper hand.” Besides his four wickets, Shardul’s cameo with the bat also came in handy with India scraping home by just seven runs. Bhuvneshwar said Shardul has emerged as a confident player over the last three months. “He has improved quite a lot. He’s a typical player that the team aspires for. He is high on confidence and perform really well, be it in T20s or ODIs,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bhuvneshwar-all-praise-for-shardul/article34186485.ece

The interest of the nation would be foremost when fielding the best shooters in each event. We have all data available. We will take an informed decision,” asserted the NRAI president. The selection committee meeting is expected to be held on April 3 or 4. It was also announced that there would be reserve shooters and they would be given the same level of training as the Olympic-bound shooters in the run-up to the Games. International engagments Raninder was happy with the manner in which the young Indian shooters responded to the opportunity of competing in the World Cup at home. He said that efforts would be made to have “regular international engagements.” On the safety and health front, Raninder said that he was looking at the Indian shooters training in a bio-bubble in due course of time. He expressed anguish about the National championship not being held any time before the Olympics, owing to the prevailing situation in the country. Conceding that the health of Indian shooting was good primarily because of the emergence of young talent through the National championship, Raninder said that the system was missing a fresh batch for the second year running.

29 March 2021||Paris,||Portugal blows a two-goal lead||Cristiano Ronaldo was controversially denied an injury-time winner as Portugal blew a two-goal lead to be held by Serbia in World Cup qualifying on Saturday, while Romelu Lukaku’s 59th international goal was only enough to salvage Belgium a 1-1 draw with the Czech Republic. The Netherlands saw off Latvia 2-0 after its opening Group G defeat by Turkey, which backed up that performance with an impressive 3-0 victory over Norway. Portugal appeared to be cruising to three points in Belgrade when leading 2-0 at the interval through Liverpool winger Diogo Jota’s first-half double. Crucial performance Nemanja Radonjic’s half-time introduction proved crucial for Serbia, though, as he set up Aleksandar Mitrovic and Filip Kostic to net in the first 15 minutes of the second period. Portugal had to settle for a 2-2 draw, with Ronaldo left seven short of Iranian Ali Daei’s all-time record of 109 international goals after failing to score for a second straight match. He appeared to have netted in the 93rd minute, but without VAR or goalline technology in use, officials decided that Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic had cleared the ball before it crossed the line. Belgium, the world number one-ranked side, sits behind the Czech Republic on goal difference in the early Group E standings. Something to cheer Frank de Boer’s Netherlands gave the 5,000 fans allowed to attend at the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam something to cheer as Steven Berghuis’s 32nd-minute curling effort and Luuk de Jong’s second-half header saw off Latvia. Fenerbahce midfielder Ozan Tufan scored twice as Turkey beat a dangerous Norway side.   The results: Group A: Serbia 2 (A. Mitrovic 46, Kostic 60) drew with Portugal 2 (Diogo Jota 11, 36); Republic of Ireland 0 lost to Luxembourg 1 (Rodrigues 85).   Group E: Czech Republic 1 (Provod 50) drew with Belgium 1 (Lukaku 60); Belarus 4 (Lisakovich 45-pen, 83, Kendysh 64, Savitski 81) bt Estonia 2 (Henri Anier 31, 55).   Group G: the Netherlands 2 (Berghuis 32, L. de Jong 69) bt Latvia 0; Norway 0 lost to Turkey 3 (Ozan Tufan 4, 59, Caglar Soyuncu 28); Montenegro 4 (Beciraj 25, Simic 43, Tomasevic 53, Jovetic 80) bt Gibraltar 1 (Styche 30-pen).

29 March 2021||SAKHIR,||Hamilton bags edge-of-the-seat opener||Lewis Hamilton produced another stunning demonstration of his supreme racing talent on Sunday to resist a charging Max Verstappen and win a thrilling season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. The defending seven-time champion defended with supreme skill over the closing laps in his Mercedes to hold off the Red Bull driver and claim a record-stretching 96th Formula One victory. Hamilton came home seven-tenths of a second ahead of the Dutchman, who was forced to hand back the race lead in the closing laps after passing the champion with a move that had taken him off the track and beyond the limits. As expected, Hamilton and his heir apparent delivered an exhilarating exhibition of racing as they stormed to the flag — the pair leaving third placed Valtteri Bottas, in the second Mercedes, to finish adrift by 37 seconds. It was Hamilton’s first season-opening triumph since 2015 and surprised many observers after Red Bull had dominated pre-season testing and two days of practice and qualifying ahead of the race. “Firstly, can I just say it’s the first time I’ve seen fans in a long time,” said a delighted Hamilton. “What a difficult race that was - stopping early we knew it was going to be tough, but we had to cover Max and it was always going to take something pretty special to do it.”  The results: 1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 1hr 32mins 03.897s, 2. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) + 0.745s, 3. Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) 37.383, 4. Lando Norris (McLaren) 46.466, 5.Sergio Perez (Red Bull-Honda) 52.047, 6.

29 March 2021||Hamilton,||Conway, Sodhi fashion Kiwi cruise||An unbeaten 92 by Devon Conway and a four-wicket burst from Ish Sodhi ensured New Zealand romped to victory by 66 runs in the opening Twenty20 against Bangladesh here on Sunday. Conway, whose rollicking innings included 11 fours and three sixes, shared in a 105-run stand with debutant Will Young (53), as New Zealand posted an impressive 210 after electing to bat. Mohammad Naim made an enterprising start to the Bangladesh reply with two boundaries off the opening over from Tim Southee. But once the tourists reached 39 in the fifth over the innings fell apart as first Lockie Ferguson removed Naim for 27 and then Sodhi suffocated the momentum with his four wickets off eight deliveries. Bangladesh finished on 144 for eight and Sodhi had the impressive figures of four for 28.  The scores: New Zealand 210/3 in 20 overs (Martin Guptill 35, Devon Conway 92 n.o., Will Young 53) bt Bangladesh 144/8 in 20 overs (Mohammad Naim 27, Afif Hossain 45, Mohammad Saifuddin 34 n.o.; Ish Sodhi 4/28).

29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Serving the Lord||In Vishnu temples, Divya Prabandham (the verses of the Azhvars) and the Vedas are recited whenever the utsava idol (processional deity) is taken round the town. In Kanchipuram, in the month of May, these groups of devotees walk with the utsava idol of Lord Varadaraja, reciting praises of Him, as He moves through the streets of Kanchi. And they walk in the scorching summer heat, without footwear! They are out there on the streets until noon or even later, when the deity returns to the temple. And even after their return, they do not rest, but serve Him in other ways. There is a Vedic mantra for the star Uttarattadi, which says that obeisance is paid to Uttarattadi, the star which serves Ahirbudhnya. Ahirbudhnya is none other than Lord Narayana Himself, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. The star Uttarattadi is like the scores of devotees one sees in the Kanchi Varadaraja temple, sincere devotion and service being the hallmark of this star as well. When His devotees sing His praises, it seems as if He is more effulgent than usual. Uttarattadi is lauded by sage Valmiki in his Ramayana. He compares the four sons of Dasaratha to the asterisms Poorva Bhadra and Uttara Bhaadra. Each of these asterisms has two stars. So in all, we have four stars. Just as these stars are in pairs, so too are the sons of Dasaratha observed in pairs. Lakshmana is inseparable from Rama, serving Him devotedly. In the same way, Shatrugna is always concerned about the welfare of Bharata, and is close to him. Sage Bodhayana lays down that the mantra for the star Uttarattadi must be recited for the udaka santhi ritual. In astrology, those born in this star have a magnetic personality. They are just and intelligent, with an inclination to the fine arts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/serving-the-lord/article34186460.ece
29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||Buttler points to lack of partnerships||England skipper Jos Buttler bemoaned the lack of partnerships and poor dismissals for his side’s seven-run loss on Sunday. “We lost wickets at regular intervals and never got those big partnerships together that we wanted to,” said Buttler. “We never felt like the run rate was going to be the biggest issue. We were happy to chase that score. “When chasing big scores like that, you are looking for someone to go on to make 80 or 100, a really match-defining contribution. “Sam Curran nearly did that but just as we got partnerships up and running we lost wickets. We knew that score was manageable. We just needed the ownership from a couple of guys to go and make those starts into big scores.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/buttler-points-to-lack-of-partnerships/article34186486.ece

29 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bridging the gap||As COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the city after a two-month remission, the hope that students had nurtured of returning to classrooms has been dashed. With online classes continuing to play the role of the substitute, students from across age groups have started to feel the loss. Patchy Internet connectivity, missed internship or extra-curricular opportunities, lack of “school or college life” and navigating through home to find a place conducive for study are some of the issues students pointed out while looking back at the past year when classes went virtual. For Harshul Singh, a second-year Political Science (Hons) student, studying in DU had always been an aspiration. However, before he could even complete his first year in the university, he was forced to return to Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, his native place, due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. Problems aplenty “I have always had the aspiration to be in Delhi University and a part of the intellectual community. While the lockdown has been an introspective one, things were not convenient. Sitting behind a screen with poor connectivity and in an environment not conducive to attending classes was not easy. The lack of access to libraries was an added issue. Overall, in the past year we have missed out on the essence of being a part of DU,” said Mr. Singh. Talking about the difference in the quality of learning, Ramjas College student Sneha Saxena said: “The quality of online classes can never match that of physical classrooms. There were network issues due to which we even had to change the format of our mid-term examinations. Even though professors tried to help, the lack of proper discussions in class was a big disadvantage,” she said. “Finding a place at home to attend these online classes was also an issue. I have two other siblings and initially we did not have enough devices for all three of us to attend classes simultaneously,” added Ms. Saxena, a native of Uttar Pradesh’s Shahjahanpur.   At the school level, the number of hours spent in front of the screen as well as lack of continuous supervision by an adult has led to its own set of problems. GeetaBisht, who bought a smartphone for her son to attend online classes, says that she was shocked during a parent teacher interaction when told that her son had not been attending classes. “Once I went back to my job, I would leave my son at home with the phone unsupervised. He was busy playing games and chatting with friends. I feel that he has lost out completely on a year. At first we took it as a positive that we can spend time as a family. But now, online class is no substitute,” Ms. Bisht said. Missing campus life Although online classes can tick the boxes of having finished covering the syllabus, students studying at premier schools or colleges feel they have missed out on the “experience” of studying at an institution that is irreplaceable. Navya Jain, a student of Indraprastha College for Women, lamented: “What I have missed the most in the last one year is the college experience that one looks forward to. Online classes are not as interactive as regular classes as most of the times people have their videos off and it is not the same.” Several students also spoke about the “lack of connect” to professors, fellow classmates and the courses. Veerangana Chauhan, a student of Political Science in Lady Shri Ram College for Women, said: “It feels like I am not being able to do anything properly these days. The most important factor is lack of connect with whatever I am trying to pursue. There are 80 people in our class and often with online teaching, professors are not able to devote individual time to all. These days even if there are tutorials scheduled, I am more concerned about saving data for the classes. Attending classes from home was another challenge as distractions were aplenty with family members around.” Lack of internships was another drawback. “When I started college, I was looking forward to an overall experience including opportunities to get good internships. Under current circumstances, the scope for such opportunities is no longer possible. I was a part of the debating society among others most of which I have had to let go now,” said Ms. Chauhan. Lack of discussions inside and outside classrooms have affected the teaching-learning process over the past year, according to professors. Tanvir Aeijaz, professor at Ramjas College, said: “Initially the feeling was that this is going to last momentarily and that we will all be back soon. But at this point, teachers are worried and frustrated. The vibrant discussions in classrooms are missing in online classes. It has become more like someone giving sermons. Usually most of the learning is done outside classrooms, which is no longer an option now.” Teachers’ apprehension Teachers have other doubts too. “In the backdrop of the New Education Policy (NEP) there is also apprehension among teachers that the government is pushing for online classes. Any policy which is top-down will have its repercussions if the primary stakeholders are not taken into account,” said Mr. Aeijaz. While at the school level, parents have been sceptical about sending their students back to school due to the virus, at the university level, student groups have been demanding the reopening of colleges at the earliest. Students feel that the digital divide has created a gap that will be very difficult to bridge as students are not allowed on campus immediately. The Students’ Federation of India along with other organisations that held a protest and hunger strike to demand reopening of campuses earlier this month said: “Students want campuses to reopen. There are so many infrastructural facilities, libraries and laboratories that students are restricted from accessing, thus decreasing the quality of their educational experience. Many students relied on these easily available resources on their campuses and university areas but the prolonged lockdown has reduced their opportunities. It is very evidently exclusionary and against the interests of the student community.” Changing face To help bridge the gap, EdTech companies have launched a number of innovative products to help create a favourable learning experience. When the lockdown happened, not many institutions were prepared to deal with shifting to online classes but as the year went along, solutions were found to leap over many of the hurdles. Chandrabhanu Pattajoshi, founder of Glossaread, a platform that helps in making higher education more accessible and convenient, says that despite the challenging times, his company has seen an exponential growth in terms of expansion. “The EdTech industry has undergone a sea change with the shift towards online learning and greater adoption of technology tools. The lockdown has caused the transition from offline to online, especially for Indian education system at a much faster pace with classes, doubt-solving sessions, remedial and even assessments moving online,” Mr. Pattajoshi said. He added that in a post-pandemic world, we will see a blend of online and offline learning in higher education. The industry believes that in the coming months and years, more students will prefer to study online and access content or study material online as it also addresses challenges such as expensive books, poor library infrastructure, multiple and fragmented sources of study material and the sheer amount of time one takes in gathering the relevant study material. SumeetMehta, co-founder and CEO of LEAD, an EdTech company, observed that adoption of technology has been brought forward by a couple of years and that most schools undertook a ‘jugaad’ to set up online learning to make up for school shutdown. However, he feels that going forward as the school reopens, there is a need to cover the learning gaps from last year and hence bridging courses are imperative. “Schools need to follow hybrid schooling which gives an option to switch between school modes [offline/online] and let the schools decide the days students will attend online class or physical school. Despite the challenging environment, we need to continuously add value and reinvent our learning models as we move away from the analogue world to the post-COVID world,” Mr. Mehta said. Virtual school An indicator to the change the COVID-19 had brought to learning can be seen from the announcement made by the Delhi government during the budget that it plans to launch a Virtual Delhi Model School. Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that the school will be based on the principle of “anywhere living, anytime learning, anytime testing” and it will not have four walls or a building but there will be children, teachers, regular teaching- learning, examinations and assessments.   “It will be a unique experiment in itself, and will probably be the first virtual school in the world. This will benefit students in Delhi as well as all those children who live in any part of the country but want to benefit from the Delhi education model,” Mr. Sisodia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bridging-the-gap/article34186701.ece
29 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ghazipur protest site gets solar panel to fight power shortage||To overcome power shortage in operating kitchens at the Ghazipur border protest site, protesters on Sunday installed a 5KW solar panel. Protesters said that the solar panel will help them keep running fridges, roti-maker machines and fans inside kitchens. The decision was taken after they failed to get any help from the local administration, they said. “We decided to switch to solar power as it is a clean source of energy. Power generators operating on diesel could be an option, but not a permanent solution as it will cause pollution,” said Bhoopinder Singh, a protester. The solar panel was inaugurated by farmers’ leader Rakesh Tikait. “We have installed it under ‘our home, our electricity’ plan. In future, we will be installing more solar panels at the Ghazipur protest site to meet power demand. The panel has been fixed on a rotatable table to ensure it gets maximum exposure to the sun,” said Mr. Tikait, adding that “not withdrawing farm laws will be the biggest mistake of this government”. Another protester said that they have constructed more thatch to keep the roof of their tents cool. They will also sprinkle water on it in case of intense heat. “We are continuously making changes at the protest site to keep the protesters safe because this fight is going to be big and they have to be prepared for any situation. We all have made such houses in our villages. All farmers are skilled in making chappar [thatch] and know the construction techniques to get cool air,” said Vinod Chaudhary, a farmer. Farmers will gather to burn the copies of the farm laws as part of ‘ Holika Dahan ’ celebrations on Sunday. “We have invited security personnel deployed at the Ghazipur border to come and celebrate Holi with us,” said Ambrish Singh, another protester. Power cut on Sunday BKU-Tikait claimed that electricity was cut off at the agitation site on Sunday. “The power supply on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway above the flyover has been disrupted for several days. On Sunday, the power below the flyover was also cut off,” said a statement from the union’s spokesperson Dharmendra Malik. On Sunday, BKU leader Mr. Tikait warned that if power was not restored, farmers would obstruct toll collection on all U.P.’s national highways. After this, power was restored around 6 p.m., said the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ghazipur-protest-site-gets-solar-panel-to-fight-power-shortage/article34186704.ece
29 March 2021||Chandigarh,||BJP stages dharna in Punjab over attack on party MLA||Several Punjab BJP leaders staged a sit-in outside the official residence of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh here on Sunday to protest the attack on a party MLA in Muktsar district. BJP MLA from Abohar in Fazilka district Arun Narang was allegedly thrashed and his clothes torn by a group of protesting farmers in Muktsar’s Malout on Saturday. The BJP leader had gone to Malout to address a press conference. A delegation of Punjab BJP leaders called on Governor V.P. Singh Badnore and submitted a memorandum. After the meeting, the BJP leaders headed to the Chief Minister’s residence. A few BJP leaders even took off their shirts as a mark of protest. The protesters raised slogans against the Congress government, alleging that law and order had completely broken down in the State. “Does the Opposition party (BJP) has no right to put forth its views,” Mr. Sharma asked while condemning the attack on Mr. Narang. “The voice of the BJP cannot be suppressed. We have never seen democracy being shamed this way,” he said.  BJP leader and former Minister Tikshan Sood demanded Capt. Amarinder’s resignation. “BJP leaders are being targeted. There is no sign of democracy in the State. We came here to tell him (the CM) that he is not capable of running the State and should resign,” he said. Later, addressing a press conference, Mr. Sharma said, “The incident has exposed the tall claims of the State government regarding the law and order situation. I want to say that it is the Vidhan Sabha which was stripped, not Arun Narang. It is the responsibility of the CM and the Speaker to ensure the safety of a member.” Meanwhile, the BJP leaders and workers held protests at Gurdaspur, Patiala, Jalandhar, Batala and Ludhiana against the attack on Mr. Narang.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-stages-dharna-in-punjab-over-attack-on-party-mla/article34186694.ece
29 March 2021||Kolkata,||Will the stars align this Bengal election?||In the first week of March, veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty graced the famous Brigade Parade Ground here to join the BJP and begin his political journey with a new dialogue: “ Aami ekta cobra, jat ghokhro, ek chhobol e chhobi [I am a cobra, I will bring death in one strike].” Around the time of the inclusion of the actor, once seen as close to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, a host of other celebrities jumped on the bandwagon in the midst of one of India’s most interesting elections in recent history. While the Trinamool Congress is known for bringing celebrities into its fold, the BJP has followed suit, fielding television stars and other popular figures this time. Will it cut ice or is it just another ploy by political parties that is bound to fall flat on its face?  ‘ Politics not cinema’   Soumyadip Mitra, a 29-year-old techie from Behala East, said the BJP has lost out on a seat by fielding Paayel Sarkar (actor). He says, “Sovan Chatterjee used to win by huge margins when he was with the TMC. Paayel is clueless about the dynamics here.” “TMC candidate Ratna Chatterjee has visited our apartment thrice, but Paayel not once,” he said. Mr. Mitra claims Paayel cannot be considered a big star like Dev or Mithun. In Behala West, where the BJP has fielded actor Srabanti Chaterjee against veteran TMC leader Partha Chatterjee, people seem to be ignorant about the “star”. Shamyal, a driver, said: “Politics is not cinema. Partha [Chaterjee] has worked for us over the years. Srabanti is an actor, what does she know?” Asansol Dakshin, an Assembly constituency in Paschim Bardhaman district, is one of the places where celebrities will have a face-off. A BSc (Hons.) student, Binit Chakraborty, said: “I want to ask if designer Agnimitra Paul [BJP candidate] or actor Saayoni Ghosh [TMC candidate] will stay with us after their win? One of them stays in Kolkata and the other in Delhi. We need someone from our city, like Sushanto Ghosh (CPI-M). He is an advocate from Asansol.” “Last time, the TMC won because they fielded Tapas Banerjee who is from the city. How many people even watch movies on OTT platforms here to know Saayoni Ghosh?” he said. The same sentiment was reinforced when Maya, a domestic help, said she has just heard that Saayoni is an actor. Baranagar, once a Left bastion which was taken over by the TMC in 2011, too has an interesting scenario. The TMC is banking on veteran Tapas Roy, while the BJP will go with actor Parno Mittra, a newbie. A housewife, requesting anonymity, said: “We do not know Parno much. She did not even visit us. Mr. Roy, of course, is familiar.” Someone familiar At Uttarpara, a government official said the TMC should have fielded someone with a political background. “We need someone who knows the area. Kanchan Mullick [the TMC candidate] is a comic relief.” Namin, a municipal worker, reiterated the same point: “Does the party consider us fools?” Tollygunje, the south Kolkata locality popularly known as the centre of the Bengali film industry, is not seeing many new faces this electoral battle, except CPI(M)’s Debdut Ghosh. Retired government employee Ardhendu Narayan Guha said when Mamata Banerjee came to power, there were some communal tensions at a Hindu-dominated slum in the area. “Aroop Biswas [the TMC candidate] might have irked some people at the time, but his other good work might keep him in good stead.” In Barrackpur, popular film director Raj Chakraborty will face tough competition from BJP candidate Chandramani Shukla. “Mamata tends to discard old team members for new ones. It’s more of a ‘Tollywood Trinamool Congress’ now. The people have understood that dorkari jake pai, sorkare takei chai [Whom we get during crisis, we want them in power],” said Nilabhra, a cultural worker. Mani, a rickshaw-puller, has a slightly different take. “We need someone who can help us get employment. We have lost a lot during the lockdown. BJP’s Chandramani Shukla might get sympathy votes as his son, Manish Shukla, was murdered,” he said. Rupam, a social media manager with Indian Railways, said Raj Chakraborty made the cut as the TMC had to field a clean candidate. “His rags-to-riches story might sell too.” At Krishnanagar Uttar (North), Koushani Mukherjee from the TMC is winning hearts. “She is campaigning well and understands the politics of the region,” says primary teacher Anupam. Greenhorn dividend Meanwhile, some people believe that the political inexperience of celebrities is compensated by their ‘clean’ image and might bring in poriborton (change). At Rajarhat-Gopalpur, banker Pratayay Gupta said of singer Aditi Munshi, the TMC candidate, “One does not need to have a political background to take administrative decisions. Most political leaders are corrupt anyway. The cleanliness that celebrities bring is refreshing. But it all depends on how they manage to retain hold after the polls.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/will-the-stars-align-this-bengal-election/article34186685.ece
29 March 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha suffered losses worth Rs. 31,945 cr. in eight cyclones||The Odisha government received Central assistance of meagre one-sixth of the losses incurred in eight different cyclones that visited after the Super Cyclone 1999. After the Super Cyclone 1999, the State was hit by Phailin (2013), Hudhud (2014), Titli, Phethai and Daye (2018), Bulbul and Fani (2019) and Amphan (2020). In these cyclones, Odisha suffered losses of life and property worth Rs. 31,945.80 crore. “The State government had sought assistance to the tune of Rs. 29,480.37 crore from the Centre. However, the government has received only Rs. 5,285.65 crore,” Sudam Marandi, Revenue and Disaster Management Minister, informed the Assembly. As far as the loss is concerned, Phailin was the most devastating, with the State losing Rs. 14,373.47 crore. The government had then sought Rs. 4,242.41 crore assistance from the Centre whereas it received only Rs. 1,149.83 crore. Two years ago, coastal Odisha was again devastated by cyclone Fani. The State government estimated the loss at Rs. 9,336.27 crore. Hudhud and Title followed the two major cyclones with estimated loss of Rs. 4,949.39 crore and Rs. 2,779.32 crore respectively. The Centre had granted Rs. 3,114.46 crore. Fani had affected 20,367 villages whereas the impact of Phailin was experienced in 18,374 villages. Other six cyclones had impacted less than 10,000 numbers of villages. Loss of life Total 160 persons had died in the eight cyclones during the past two decades. While highest 72 had died in Titli cyclone, Fani claimed 64 lives. In four out of eight cyclones, as per Mr. Marandi’s reply, not a single life was lost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/odisha-suffered-losses-worth-rs-31945-cr-in-eight-cyclones/article34186689.ece
29 March 2021||March 29 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Bengalis have seen through BJP’s lies’||Former Silchar MP and All India Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev is the most visible Congress leader in southern Assam’s Bengali-dominated Barak Valley, comprising 15 Assembly seats. She says the disillusionment of the people with the BJP’s “fake love” for Bengali Hindus could help the Congress regain the valley. Excerpts:   Is there a pro-CAA sentiment in Barak Valley that is perceived to help the BJP?  The Hindu Bengalis took the CAA bait because NRC was a fearful exercise for them as well as for Bengali Muslims. I have been asking people mesmerised by CAA if they really think it will protect them. Why then is the BJP speaking about implementing it in West Bengal and not in Assam where there has been opposition to the law (in Brahmaputra Valley)? Why didn’t (Prime Minister Narendra) Modiji speak about it when he came for a rally in Karimganj? Because they know it is a fake promise and people have understood their fake concern for Bengali Hindus. The BJP is using many tools to say Hindu Bengalis are getting away from the Congress. But our vote share will increase this time.  BJP claims it has narrowed the divide between the Assamese-speaking Brahmaputra Valley and the Bengali-speaking Barak Valley. Has it?  They talk of bringing the people of the two valleys together. But they drove the wedge deeper with CAA besides polarising the voters of Barak Valley on religious lines. If you look at the demography of Cachar (district), you cannot win seats unless you have the votes of every community. We are not a party of one community. Bengalis have seen through the BJP’s lies through steps such as cancellation of holiday on Rabindranath Tagore’s birth anniversary. How can you do that? Is he a Bengali icon or an international icon? And six of the eight BJP legislators are Bengali Hindus from Barak Valley but Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal makes them stand in the back. They have done nothing for Hindu Bengalis.  How important are detention centres and D-voters as issues for Congress?  Very. Our manifesto talks about resolving the problem of D-voters, an unconstitutional concept that has hounded the people of Assam for so many years. They are silent about it. I have visited detention centres, our MLAs have, a special team led by Jairam Ramesh did. Has one BJP leader done that? We are talking about these issues, but they are not. All they are promising is to review and rectify the NRC, which means they are going to exclude more people. How can you leave so many people stateless? Do you not have regard for international laws?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bengalis-have-seen-through-bjps-lies/article34186687.ece
29 March 2021||New Delhi,||HC orders assault case accused to do community service at de-addiction centre||The Delhi High Court has ordered a man, who publicly assaulted a woman at PVR complex, to do a one-month community service at a de-addiction centre here after the victim said she did not want to pursue the case any further. Justice Subramonium Prasad said, “Since the complainant does not want to pursue the case, it would be futile to continue with the prosecution.” “However, looking at the facts and the conduct of the petitioner [Vikramjeet Singh], this court is inclined to direct the petitioner to do some social service to atone for his sins. He is also warned not to repeat such actions in future,” Justice Prasad added. As per the complaint registered by the woman at Vikaspuri police station, on July 15 last year, at about 4.30 p.m., after finishing work at office, she was sitting at PVR complex on the backside of PVR slums beside an open gym with three colleagues. Mr. Singh came towards them and started talking. He said he was a millionaire. However, he was asked to go away and he left. He returned after ten minutes tried to speak to the woman again. When she tried leave, Mr. Singh held her hand and twisted it behind her back. She also complained that he had hit her on her face and hit her with his bag. As she raised an alarm, people started gathering and Mr. Singh fled. On the basis of her complaint, he was arrested on July 21 and later released on bail. The woman stated before the High Court that she and Mr. Singh have amicably settled the matter and no useful purpose would be served in continuing the proceedings “In the present case, it is the victim who is the ultimate sufferer. She has been harassed by the petitioner and she is being further harassed in the proceedings initiated against the petitioner,” the court noted. “A perusal of the complaint shows that the petitioner has acted in a very high-handed manner,” the High Court said. The High Court also imposed a cost of Rs. 1 lakh on Mr. Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-orders-assault-case-accused-to-do-community-service-at-de-addiction-centre/article34186696.ece

He said he was stocking gold for his daughter’s marriage, the police said on Sunday. The accused have been identified as Sarvapal Singh alias Ginni and Jasmeet Singh alias Mocki (24), residents of Bhadurgarh in Haryana, they said. The police said that on February 17, a case was registered where the complainant alleged that two persons snatched her gold chain and ran away on a black scooter. The rider was wearing a helmet while the pillion rider was wearing mask, the police said. On March 17, the accused snatched a gold chain of another person in Dabri area, they said. “During investigation, the police identified the scooter used in the snatching incidents. The police got a tip-off that the owner was living on rent at Bahadurgarh. They raided the area and apprehended both the accused,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said. Mr. Sarvapal used to wear a black mask, a black helmet, and hide the front number plate by pasting white paper on the last four digits and rear number plate by putting mud on it, the DCP said. He also took his son Jasmeet along with him. He used to come towards Delhi, snatched gold chains and returned to Bahadurgarh, the police said. Mr. Sarvapal disclosed that he wanted to stock gold for the marriage of his daughter, who is already engaged. The marriage is due in two months.

The regional party, which had created a sentiment among the tribal masses with Tipraland (separate state for indigenous people) and other contentious issues, is now speaking words of harmony and need of bonding among the communities. The changes in the IPFT’s style of politics came after it backed out from an electoral understanding with the TIPRA (Tipraha Indigenous People’s Regional Alliance) last month and was compelled to tie up with the BJP — its senior ally in the State’s coalition government. Minister and IPFT general secretary Mevar Kumar Jamatia launched a verbal attack against TIPRA founder Pradyot Kishore Debbarman for allegedly trying to fan trouble in the hills. “He [Mr. Pradyot] has been instigating people with his ‘Greater Tipraland’ demand,” he said at an election rally at Ampura in Khowai district. Mr. Jamatia, IPFT leaders and the party candidates are not raising the ‘Tipraland’ demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ipft-puts-pet-tipraland-demand-on-the-backburner/article34186691.ece
