22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Charges against Anil Deshmukh are serious, says Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar on Sunday said the charges against senior NCP leader and Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, made by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh, are “serious” and any decision regarding him will be taken by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. On Saturday, in an e-mail letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Singh had alleged that the Home Minister had asked police officers, including the suspended officer Sachin Vaze, to collect Rs. 100 crore every month from bars and hotels in the city. Mr. Pawar, however, questioned the timing of the allegations levelled by Mr. Singh, pointing out that they were made after he was removed as police chief over “lapses” in the probe into the security threat outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence. Mr. Pawar suggested an in-depth probe by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Julio Ribeiro, whose “credibility is beyond questioning”. He claimed that Mr. Vaze, who was suspended for over 16 years for his role in a custodial death case, was reinstated by Mr. Singh last year and neither the Chief Minister nor the State Home Minister was responsible for it. “The allegations against the Maharashtra Home Minister are serious. Chief Minister has the full authority to take a decision regarding an inquiry on these allegations against the Home Minister,” Mr. Pawar said, adding, “I would suggest to Uddhav Thackeray to seek former IPS officer Julio Ribeiro’s help for looking into the claims made by Param Bir Singh.” The NCP chief told reporters at his official residence in Delhi that Mr. Param Bir Singh did meet him but it was only “when his transfer orders were about to be issued by the Maharashtra government”.

22 March 2021||KALABURAGI,||Helping migrant children get basic education||Around 50 families from different villages in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, migrate to Kammarachedu village in Ballari district, for three months every year for agricultural work. While the adults of the families go to the farm fields in the surrounding villages, the children, the old and the sick spend their days in the temporary tent camp that they set up on the outskirts of the village. Though the workers hail from particular villages in the neighbouring State, they don’t have a definite place to live as they move from one place to another in search of livelihood. The uncertainty of their place of living deprives their children of formal schooling. The Constitutional provision that mandates the State to provide free and compulsory education to all children in the six to 14 age group has no meaning for these children. However, fortunately this time, the nomadic children have something to cheer about. Sanmarga Geleyara Balaga, a Ballari-based group of charity-oriented individuals, set up a makeshift school in the camp about a month ago to ensure that the children are not deprived of their right to education. The self-funded organisation has appointed two Bachelor of Education degree holders as instructors for an honorarium of Rs. 6,000 a month. It has provided the children with study and exercise material such as slates and books that were procured from donors. It is also providing food, sweet and snacks to the children. All the 44 children in the camp are attending classes that are scheduled between 4.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. every day. “I am astonished and happy to see the progress of the children. Only around 10 children who had opportunities to attend anganwadis in the places where their parents had migrated to had some knowledge about the alphabet and numbers. The rest of the children were literally illiterate. In a short span of about 25 days, they have improved a lot. I feel content to see the children’s enthusiasm. I have also been deprived of formal education after completing Class IV. Even today, I feel embarrassed and uncomfortable when I come across messages in English or situations where I am expected to be more knowledgeable. I always feel that none should face the situation that I had,” B. Chandrashekhar Acharya, secretary of the group, told The Hindu . Ballari Additional Deputy Commissioner P.S. Manjunath, who inaugurated the makeshift school, has offered all possible assistance for the children’s education after seeing the learning enthusiasm in them. The Sanmarga Geleyara Balaga, which does all of its social service activities from donations from its members and well-wishers, a majority of whom are well-settled government officers working in Ballari district and beyond, is also ready to offer assistance even after the children move from Ballari along with their parents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/helping-migrant-children-get-basic-education/article34127740.ece
22 March 2021||AIZAWL,||Myanmar border shut amid strains over refugee crisis||Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga held a virtual meeting on Sunday with Foreign Minister of Myanmar Zin Mar Aung amid the ongoing military crackdown following the February coup, even as India sealed all entry points along the border with the southeast Asian neighbour and is closely monitoring them to prevent any Myanmar national from entering the country. “Had a fruitful meeting [online] this morning with Zin Mar Aung, Hon’ble Foreign Minister, Myanmar. Our thoughts and prayers are with Myanmar in these trying times,” Mr. Zoramthanga said on Twitter. He had earlier written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging intervention so that “political refugees” from Myanmar are given asylum and food and shelter in the country. Sensitive issues The tussle between the Centre and the State on the issue has created a tough time for New Delhi and security agencies in handling the situation on the ground, multiple officials said. In the letter dated March 18, Mr. Zoramthanga said the people residing on both sides have close linkages. “India cannot turn a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in front of us in our own backyard,” the Chief Minister said. The letter comes after a series of exchanges between the State and the Central governments over the handling of the refugees. Stating that the whole of Myanmar is in turmoil and “innocent hapless citizens are being persecuted” by the military regime, who are supposed to be their guardians and protectors, Mr. Zoramthanga said the “Myanmar area bordering Mizoram is inhibited by Chin communities, who are ethnically our brethren with whom we have been having close contacts throughout all these years even before India became independent.” Following the February 1 coup when the Myanmar military overthrew the democratically elected government, around 300 Myanmarese nationals, including many policemen, have crossed into India and sought refuge. Deep ties There is considerable support and sympathy among the people of Mizoram over the situation in Myanmar as many have relations across the border, a government official stated, adding that it was a very emotive and sensitive issue in the State. India and Myanmar have an arrangement called Free Movement Regime (FMR), which allows locals on both sides to go upto 16 km across the other side and stay up to 14 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/myanmar-border-shut-amid-strains-over-refugee-crisis/article34127433.ece

22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Centre punishing AAP govt. for supporting farmers’||Delhi Chief Minister and national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party Arvind Kejriwal said the Centre was punishing his government for supporting the farmer’s in their agitation against the three agricultural laws. “I have been a part of this movement since the beginning and refused to sign the documents to convert stadiums into jails where agitating farmers would be held. I supported the farmer’s agitation due to which the Narendra Modi government is causing us great inconvenience,” Mr. Kejriwal said while addressing a kisan mahapanchayat in Moga, Punjab. He added that the Centre has brought in a Bill last week in Parliament, which proposes taking away the powers from elected government and giving them to the Lieutenant-Governor in Delhi. He assured the farmers that as long as he is the Chief Minister, he would not let the Central government take any action against those protesting in Delhi and that his government, along with the farmers, would overcome all obstacles that are being created for them. ‘Unfulfilled promises’ Making an electoral pitch for the Punjab Assembly polls, scheduled to be held next year, Mr. Kejriwal said four years ago the State’s Chief Minster, Amarinder Singh, made many promises to the people of Punjab but “all of them remained unfulfilled”. “AAP is the only party that can make 24-hour electricity possible in Punjab. If the people of Punjab vote for AAP, the State can have free education and good health services like we promised and delivered in Delhi,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal also promised to provide employment to 20 lakh youth in Punjab who were issued unemployment cards by the Congress government in the State. He said AAP will give unemployment allowance to the people and requested them not to throw the card away since it will make them realise how they have been “deceived by a party in the name of votes”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-punishing-aap-govt-for-supporting-farmers/article34127974.ece
22 March 2021||Ghaziabad,||HC to consider transfer of Hathras case||Responding to an affidavit filed by the elder brother of the Hathras gang rape and murder victim to stay the trial proceedings given the “real and grave risk of a miscarriage of justice”, the Allahabad High Court has asked the District Judge, Hathras, and the Inspector General, CRPF, to look into the allegations and submit a report within 15 days. A two-judge Bench of Justices Rajan Roy and Jaspreet Singh said on Friday that it would “consider whether trial in question before the Special Judge (SC/ST), Hathras, is required to be stayed and is to be transferred elsewhere in the exercise of powers under Section 407 of CrPc”. ‘Threatened in court’ The affidavit submitted by the victim’s brother on March 18 said that on March 5, when he, accompanied by his wife, and counsel Seema Kushwaha, went to the Special Court of B.D. Bharti in Hathras to record prosecution evidence, an advocate named Tarun Hari Sharma stormed into the courtroom and charged towards him and his counsel, shouting and issuing threats. Mr. Tarun Sharma seemed to be under the influence of alcohol and said that Ms. Kushwaha could not represent the victim’s family. On account of fear for their life and security, the affidavit said, the prosecution witness could not depose properly. When the proceedings resumed, the affidavit stated, another advocate, Hari Sharma, the father of Mr. Tarun Sharma, entered the courtroom and issued threats. After this, the affidavit said, the presiding judge was forced to stop the proceedings, ask police personnel present in the court to provide security cover and direct the Station House Officer (SHO), Kotwali, to provide safe and secure passage to Ms. Kushwaha. The Bench has asked for CCTV footage, if any, of the incidents of March 5 to be preserved. The High Court further provided that till the next date of listing, the trial court should conduct the proceedings in-camera in the letter and spirit of Section 327 of the CrPc. The filing of the affidavit comes days after the Supreme Court on March 12 dismissed the petition of the victim’s family to transfer the case out of Uttar Pradesh. Munna Singh Pundhir, one of the lawyers of the accused, alleged it was “just a drama being created” to get the case transferred out of Hathras. Hathras Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal said he had no idea of the incident till the HC order came to light through media reports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-to-consider-transfer-of-hathras-case/article34127654.ece
22 March 2021||MYSURU,||Three States plan effective patrolling, anti-poaching drives||Patrolling and anti-poaching activities in the tiger reserves contiguous to Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu will be intensified with greater coordination among Forest Department personnel in these areas. This was decided at a meeting involving senior officials and field staff drawn from Bandipur, Nagarahole, BRT, Mudumalai, Sathyamangalam, and Wayanad tiger reserves besides representatives from the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary in Chamarajanagar and held at Bandipur last week. The outcome of the meeting is significant as it entails greater protection to what is recognised to be the world’s largest tiger habitat that spans across the three States and supports nearly 700 tigers in the wild.  Intelligence gathering Intelligence gathering mechanism will be stepped up and the information shared among the field staff for greater efficacy in curbing poaching and other illegal activities in the region. With greater coordination and information sharing, anti-poaching activities will receive a thrust and be more effective. In the past, poachers used to strike in one area of a State and slip away into an other area, taking advantage of lack of coordination among the forest staff. It has been decided to intensify joint patrolling operations along the forest boundaries that span the three States. Bandipur in Karnataka shares boundary with Mudumali in Tamil Nadu while Nagarahole shares borders with Wayanad in Kerala. The Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary abuts the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve and it was in this part of the landscape (Cauvery–Sathyamangalam) where poachers had a free run owing to lack of patrolling. The meeting also decided to conduct a special operation or a drive entailing the staff of the three States and crack down on smugglers of wildlife derivatives and poachers suspected to be operating in these regions and strengthen protection to forests and wildlife. This will entail confiscation of unlicensed weapons and it was resolved in the meeting to crack down and seize such weapons, including guns without licence, in possession of people living in the villages bordering the forest region spanning across the three States. S.R. Natesh, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said a meeting of senior officers would be held once in two months at the tri-junction — where the borders of Bandipur, Nagarahole, and Wayanad meet — to review their activities and progress. Besides, field staff of the three States where the forests are contiguous would support each other in firefighting operations, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/three-states-plan-anti-poaching-drives/article34127487.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre warns of COVID-19 spike at Kumbh||A Health Ministry team has reported that nearly 10 to 20 pilgrims and 10 to 20 locals at the ongoing Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, are being reported positive every day. Such a positivity rate had the potential to rapidly turn into an “upsurge” in cases, the team said. ‘No test needed’ The report assumes significance given that Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat has stated that a negative COVID-19 test wouldn’t be a requirement for those intending to visit the festival at Haridwar. The Uttarakhand government had also been told that the daily testing numbers being reported in Haridwar, around 50,000 rapid antigen tests and 5,000 RT-PCR tests, were inadequate, given the expected number of pilgrims. ‘No obstructions’ Mr. Rawat’s predecessor, Trivendra Singh Rawat, had mandated a negative test as part of the Standard Operation Procedure for pilgrims. However, the CM, following a meeting of the State Cabinet last week, said while guidelines such as “masking and sanitising” would be followed, there would no obstructions to the “smooth” movement of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kumbh-mela-centre-warns-of-covid-19-upsurge/article34127436.ece
22 March 2021||MANGALURU,||145 MIT students among 170 who test positive for COVID-19 in Udupi dist||With the continued spurt in new COVID-19 cases, Udupi district reported 170 cases on Sunday. Of these, 145 cases were reported from Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT) campus alone. Now, the total number of fresh COVID-19 cases reported from MIT campus has touched 300. Udupi District Health Officer Sudhirchandra Sooda said that the 145 students who tested positive on MIT campus are primary contacts of students who tested positive a few days ago. However, they are all asymptomatic. The Udupi district administration declared the MIT campus as containment zone after 52 students tested positive on March 16 and 17. The district administration decided to test all the 5,000 students on campus. “Testing of all students is now on,” Dr. Sooda said. Meanwhile, MIT Director D. Srikanth Rao has, in a letter on March 20, asked students not to make any travel plans until the district administration lifts the rules pertaining to the containment zone. Asking students to remain on campus, Mr. Rao said that they should restrict their movement to essential things. The Community Medicine Department of Kastruba Medical College and the Health Department were managing the fever clinic and testing facility on MIT campus. Screening and testing based on symptoms and primary contacts will be carried out at these facilities. Assuring support from the institute and all faculty members to students, Mr. Rao said that teacher guardians (for first year students) and class coordinators (for higher semesters) will be in constant touch with students. Block wardens, caretakers and security staff will also be available for assistance, comfort and help, he said. With the discharge of 24 patients, the number of active cases in Udupi on Sunday rose to 358. In Dakshina Kannada, there were 54 new COVID-19 cases. As many as 19 patients were discharged on Sunday taking the number of active cases to 527. A fine of Rs. 38.05 lakh has been collected in 36,978 cases of people not wearing masks so far, said a bulletin from the Dakshina Kannada district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/145-mit-students-among-170-who-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-udupi-dist/article34127910.ece

Later, it was shifted to a cage and released into the forest. According to Shankaranarayana Range Forest Officer Chidananda, the leopard chased a pet dog and followed the latter into the storeroom of the house of Agensh Shetty near Billadi village at about 5.30 a.m. Hearing the commotion, Mr. Shetty locked the shed from outside and informed the forest officials. The Forest Department officials, who rushed to the spot, placed a cage outside the door, which was the only exit for the leopard, of the room. At about 11 a.m. as the department personnel slowly opened the door the leopard attacked the dog and then moved inside the cage. Mr. Chindananda said that a government veterinary doctor examined the leopard and following his clearance, it was released into the forest. The condition of the dog is serious and it is undergoing treatment at a nearby veterinary hospital, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/leopard-strays-into-human-habitat-caught-released-into-forest/article34127911.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Association opposes diversion of doctors||The Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA) has opposed the diversion of doctors by the Health Department to Chennai for COVID-19 work. It has said that its members will not comply with the order and will go a flash agitation, if forced. At an emergency meeting held on Saturday, the TNGDA State executive committee discussed the issue and passed resolutions. In a letter to the Health Secretary, the TNGDA called the diversion “inhumane” and asked all diverted medical officers to stay at their present station. “Government doctors are already exhausted by the COVID-19 work in the past one year. Ever since the normal activities resumed at government hospitals, the crowds have exceeded the pre-COVID-19 level. We have pooled up cases, and our workload is high. We need to take precautions, too,” TNGDA president K. Senthil said. He said the State was “exploiting” government doctors. “We have had no benefits. The government has not fulfilled its promises to the doctors on COVID-19 duty. Let the Health Department divert doctors of the Indian systems of medicine and involve private medical college hospitals and private hospitals [in the COVID-19 work],” he said. Dr. Senthil said COVID-19 cases in Chennai were not so high as to warrant diversion of doctors. Last year, doctors who were diverted to the city when the cases peaked worked there for three months, he said. The TNGDA suggested in the letter that only those doctors — of any cadre, any health directorate and any post-graduate course — who were willing should be diverted. Such doctors could accept the diversion through the proper channel and the TNGDA office-bearers. Dr. Senthil said promotion and transfer counselling was held but orders were not issued on account of the Assembly election. “Counselling is a routine activity, and the government should have sought permission from the Election Commission to issue the orders. This is an administrative delay and if the government can divert doctors, why can’t it issue the orders?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assn-against-diversion-of-govt-doctors/article34127536.ece
22 March 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,||Kraal being readied to capture and treat Rivaldo||The Forest Department is readying a kraal in Vazhaithottam village in the Nilgiris to capture an injured wild elephant named Rivaldo, inhabiting the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. A kraal is a structure made of wood to restrict the movement of an elephant. It is used to tame captured wild elephants. The Madras High Court had recently said: “As far as Rivaldo is concerned..., the only purpose [of assisting the animal] is to provide healing to his chopped trunk which impedes his food intake and to take care of the impaired vision in one eye. The State reports that Rivaldo is now doing well and the State does not intend to keep Rivaldo in captivity for any great length of time.” The order pointed out that the government had agreed to release Rivaldo after treatment. “We are building the kraal in full view of Rivaldo, who has been with our team of forest staff for the last five days,” said L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (Buffer Zone). According to him, Rivaldo was finding it difficult to eat and had impaired vision, for which he would be treated. Asked to confirm whether or not Rivaldo would be released after treatment, Mr. Srikanth said the elephant could get acclimatised itself to a life in captivity if he was treated for a prolonged period of time in the kraal. He refused to declare that Rivaldo would be released into the wild. He said he was yet to receive the court order. Rivaldo’s health N. Mohanraj, a conservationist in the Nilgiris, said there was nothing wrong in the physical health of Rivaldo. “An elephant can be rehabilitated. It only requires the dedication of the Forest Department to ensure that people stop feeding it,” he said. If Rivaldo is removed from the wild, “a unique Asian elephant, noted for his size and capable of emerging as one of the dominant males in the region, would be removed from the genetic pool of wild elephants.” “Even if the elephant is unwell, it is unnecessary to intervene in what is a natural process. In the past, it was standard practice not even to take care of elephant calves that were abandoned. This sets a very bad precedent,” another conservationist said. He wondered whether all elephants which got injured in the wild would be considered for capture. Mudumalai Tiger Reserve Field Director K.K. Kaushal said the department would decide on whether or not to capture Rivaldo once it received and interpreted the court order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kraal-being-readied-to-capture-and-treat-rivaldo/article34127593.ece
22 March 2021||Bengaluru,||State seeing the beginning of second wave: Sudhakar||Karnataka is “at the beginning of the second wave” of COVID-19 and people’s cooperation to contain the spread of the virus is vital, said Health Minister K. Sudhakar on Sunday. “Let us join hands to control it because the next two to three months are crucial,” he told reporters. He said he would discuss with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa the current situation and measures to be taken immediately. The Minister pointed out that the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on the pandemic had given clear guidelines to the government and warned of serious consequences if certain activities were not controlled. “We will all be responsible for the consequences if the government and people do not respond to experts’ advice,” Dr. Sudhakar said. “We have crossed 1,000 cases a day just in Bengaluru. We cannot be in denial any more. My fervent request to people is to adapt COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. Controlling the spread is in the hands of people,” he said, appealing to youth to ensure that the elderly in their households were vaccinated. They should also shun all unnecessary gatherings, whether parties or jatras, he added.  The Minister pointed out that the government had not entirely banned any activity so that people’s livelihood was not affected, while requesting people to exercise caution. Karnataka has so far not heeded the TAC’s more stringent recommendations such as banning all public functions, especially in closed spaces. The TAC has also suggested closing religious institutions and all schools and educational institutions where there are no exams going on, for at least the next two weeks.  Fears ahead of bypolls  Dr. Sudhakar favoured holding an all-party meeting in the light of the upcoming bypolls to discuss how COVID-19 protocols could be maintained during campaigns. To a question whether election-related activities will also be curtailed, he asked, “Will Coronavirus spare any activity? Will it spare political parties or religious congregations?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/start-of-second-wave-in-state-says-sudhakar/article34127480.ece

They load tobacco products and hand over the vehicles to another team, which then returns to Chennai from Krishnagiri. It is then taken to warehouses near Minjur and packed into smaller packets. They are then carried to sub-dealers across the city by dawn in smaller vehicles,” a police officer said. A total of 7.6 tonnes of contraband and eight trucks were seized. Three people were arrested and more arrests would be made in the coming days, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tobacco-smugglers-held-near-red-hills/article34127555.ece

The government is under an obligation to develop a green belt of native tree species on about 485 hectares, which is roughly 33.31% of the total project area, according to official sources. Another important sub-component of the EMP is the mandate to set up a 10-metre high dust curtain that shields the ancient Kanya Teertham temple which is surrounded on three sides by the steel plant site, and raise a 50-metre green belt buffer zone around it. These are among the 24 specific conditions laid down by the expert appraisal committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change which have to be complied with in a time-bound manner. River protection Some of the other conditions are the installation of a waste recycling plant for recovering metal and flux from the blast furnace slag, water consumption should not exceed 3.96 cubic metres per ton of steel produced and the development of a biodiversity park on 10 hectares. The Penna river which flows 1.60 km from the site is to be protected from effluents. A 24×7 effluent and emission monitoring system is also to be put in place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-1815-cr-for-environment-protection-at-kadapa-plant/article34127371.ece

Reviewing the progress of Palamuru-Rangareddy project with ministers and MLAs of erstwhile Mahabubnagar district and senior officials, Mr. Rao said the government has completed ongoing works on projects like Kalwakurthy, Nettempad, Bhima and Jurala to turn 11 lakh acres in southern Mahabubnagar fertile. But, there were some unfinished works. In these circumstances, Mr. Rao asked officials to consider ways to fast-track these works drawing inspiration from Kaleshwaram project. He noted that the water yield in Krishna had reached danger levels with Karnataka and Maharashtra constructing projects, Andhra Pradesh diverting water through pipes and less rainfall in the catchment. In this backdrop, Telangana must tap its rightful share to the last drop. Hence, all the pending projects in Krishna basin should be expedited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/complete-palamuru-rr-lift-by-year-end-says-kcr/article34127764.ece

He said the Crime Branch case against the ED reflected the Left Democratic Front government’s growing anxiety with the probe closing in on racketeers. Interacting with mediapersons here during his visit to the State to campaign for candidates of the National Democratic Alliance in the Assembly polls, Mr. Thakur said the ED’s probe into the gold smuggling racket had been troubling Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “As the head of the State, he should be open to a free and fair probe if he has nothing to hide. He has instead been shying away from investigation. The law will take its own course and the ED is entitled to approach the right platform (to fight the case),” he said. He claimed the Left Democratic Front rule had resulted in “brain drain and brain washing”, with a large number of unemployed youth forced to leave the country in search of jobs. “Competent youths have been finding it increasingly difficult to gain employment, even while undeserving people are finding job opportunities,” he said. Mr. Thakur said the government had also provided a safe refuge for radical groups that had been using the State as a launch pad for extremist activities in the country.  Sabarimala issue Citing the controversy over entry of women to Sabarimala, Mr. Thakur accused the State government of attempting to destroy faith and tradition to promote its vested interests. He also claimed that Kerala benefited far greater under the NDA regime than during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) rule from 2009-14. While tax devolution stood at Rs. 29,841 crore during the UPA’s term, the State received Rs. 71,713 crore during 2014-19. Similarly, grant-in-aid grew from Rs. 15,297 crore to Rs. 44,856 crore and the Finance Commission’s grant from Rs. 602 crore to Rs. 18,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ed-probe-has-made-govt-anxious-anurag-thakur/article34127802.ece

Kerala reported 1,875 new cases, Karnataka 1,715, Tamil Nadu 1,289 and Andhra Pradesh 368. In Telangana there were 394 cases on Saturday. Karnataka’s Health Minister K. Sudhakar said the State was “at the beginning of the second wave” and sought people’s cooperation. The Minister said the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on the pandemic had given clear guidelines and warned of serious consequences if certain activities were not controlled. “We have crossed 1,000 cases a day just in Bengaluru. We cannot be in denial any more. My fervent request is to adopt COVID-19-appropriate behaviour,” he said, appealing to youth to ensure that the elderly in their households were vaccinated. People should also keep away from unnecessary gatherings. The government had not banned any activity so that people’s livelihood was not affected, he said. The TAC had suggested closing religious institutions and all schools and educational institutions where there were no exams going on, for at least two weeks. Across Karnataka, 1,715 new cases were detected. Bengaluru Urban district accounted for 1039. Two patients – one each in Bengaluru Urban and Bidar – succumbed to the virus. Among the 13,493 active cases, 137 patients were in ICUs. The positivity rate for the day stood at 1.68%.

Mr. Sisir Adhikari, who represents the Kanthi Lok Sabha constituency in Purba Medinipur district, said that he was pushed towards the BJP by the Trinamool. “There is no question of having any ties with the Trinamool,” he said. His son Suvendu Adhikari had joined the BJP in December and is contesting against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee from the Nandigram constituency in the district. ‘Battle for Medinipur’ “It is battle for the prestige of Medinipur... Whatever Suvendu is saying will turn true… Suvendu will win Nandigram,” Mr. Sisir Adhikari said. At Mr. Shah’s rally, the senior leader raised the slogan Bharat Mata ki Jai (Long live Mother India), and said that he had joined the BJP the very day Mr. Suvendu Adhikari joined the party. Another MP from the district, Dibyendu Adhikari, who belongs to the same family and represents the Tamluk Lok Sabha constituency, has not ruled out the possibility of joining the BJP. Addressing the rally at Egra in Purba Medinipur, Mr. Shah emphasised on the party’s slogan of making Sonar Bangla (golden Bengal) in the next five years, propelled by the double-engine government at the Centre and the State. The Home Minister also promised to implement the Seventh Pay Commission for employees of the government of West Bengal if the BJP was voted to power.

22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 cases see a new high||A year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a ‘janta curfew’ that ended up being a prelude to the national lockdown on March 25 last year, new daily cases skyrocketed to 43,846 — a new high for this year — on Sunday. This took the number of confirmed infections in India to nearly 11.6 million. Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh accounted for 77.7% of the new cases in the 24 hours to 8 a.m. on Sunday. Maharashtra reported 27,126 cases followed by Punjab with 2,578 and Kerala with 2,078. A little over 80% of the new cases reported were from six States. In Maharashtra, Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane and Nashik were the districts reporting the highest number of cases. Over 4 crore doses Almost 4.4 crore vaccine doses had been administered till 7 a.m. on Sunday. The beneficiaries include 7.7 million healthcare workers who have received at least one dose and 4.8 million who have got both. About 8 million frontline workers have got the first dose, and 2.6 million have got both doses.

22 March 2021||N. RahulHYDERABAD,||ECI lets Telangana govt. announce pay revision||The decks were cleared for the State government to announce pay revision for its staff after the Election Commission on Sunday expressed ‘no objection’ to the government’s request, but laid down a condition that “no undue publicity be given to it to gain political mileage” in view of the model code of conduct in force for by-election to Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency next month. The government had earlier in the day requested the EC to be allowed to announce acceptance of Pay Revision Commission (PRC) report by extending immunity from code of conduct. The development paved the way for Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to make an announcement on pay revision when he replied to the debate on budget in the Assembly on Monday afternoon. He had said in the Assembly on Wednesday that he will himself announce the same in the House after the results of elections to the Legislative Council were declared. He maintained that the pay pack would be respectable and pleasing to the employees. Pay revision for government staff was due since July 1, 2018, and caused severe unrest among them, particularly after the first PRC headed by a retired IAS officer C.R. Biswal fixed a fitment of 7.5 per cent on basic pay a few months ago while the unions bargained 63 per cent hike, much higher. At 7.5 per cent, the burden to the exchequer was estimated at Rs. 2,252 crore. The commission was also said to have recommended extension of age of superannuation of staff from 58 to 60 years and reduced the house rent allowance payable in four categories. It defended 7.5 pre cent fitment on the ground that the salary and pension bill of the government had mounted from Rs. 16,378 crore in 2014-15 when Telangana State was created, to Rs. 35,282 crore in 2017-18. The employees took to the roads near the Secretariat in protest but Mr. Rao, in a trouble-shooting mode, invited leaders of employees’ unions and told them that their pay would be more than one or two per cent higher than their counterparts in Andhra Pradesh. The AP government had announced 27 per cent interim relief to its employees in July 2019, a year after it’s own PRC recommendations lapsed. On the contrary, the employees had gone into a tizzy when Mr. Rao announced 43 per cent hike immediately after TRS rode to power in 2014. The then PRC headed by P.K. Agarwal had recommended 29 per cent fitment when it submitted its report to the erstwhile AP government three days before bifurcation of the State on June 2, 2014. On Mr. Rao’s instructions, a three-member committee headed by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar was constituted to negotiate with the unions. After the panel completed the talks, the code of conduct for Legislative Council elections came into force and resulted in a stalemate in implementation of pay revision. This again led to anguish among employees, but TRS leaders pacified them during election campaign. A purported deliberate leak by the government that it was willing to concede 29 per cent hike to staff created furore in political circles that the code of conduct was violated. It also became an issue in Council polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eci-lets-telangana-govt-announce-pay-revision/article34127366.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Indian-Israeli collaboration testing oral COVID vaccine||An Indian-Israeli collaboration has reportedly developed an oral vaccine for COVID-19, one that can be swallowed like a pill instead of being injected, as is the norm. A preliminary test in animals showed that the vaccine produced the expected antibodies that confer protection. However, the findings have not been reported in a scientific publication yet and cannot be independently verified. The product is also far from being tested in human trials, though company promoters say depending on how tests pan out, the vaccine could be ready for human trials in the next three months. Premas Biotech, a Gurugram-based biotechnology firm, and Oramed Pharmaceuticals, a Jerusalem headquartered company, have a long-standing collaboration on developing new drug delivery techniques. The nascent COVID-19 vaccine candidate is a “protein-based VLP (Virus Like Particle) vaccine candidate” that generates “triple protection” against the SARS CoV-2 virus, i.e., it is able to target the spike, membrane, and envelope proteins of the coronavirus.  Oravax, the company developing the vaccine, is a joint venture between Premas and Oramed. “The vaccine candidate is also safe, efficacious and well-tolerated at normal to high doses, and generated high titres of neutralising antibodies. The VLP is manufactured using Premas’ proprietary D-Crypt™ platform, which is highly scalable and can be manufactured on large scales,” Oravax said in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/joint-venture-develops-oral-vaccine-for-covid-19/article34127395.ece

In 1671, Borphukan led the Ahoms in the Battle of Saraighat, considered the greatest naval battle on a river, to victory over the Mughals. The Prime Minister said Borphukan was the inspiration behind strengthening India’s naval force and revitalising inland water transport and creating infrastructure. The Congress termed Mr. Modi’s new take on the legendary Ahom General as “damage control” after the gaffe almost a fortnight ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ahom-warrior-a-symbol-of-atmanirbhar-military-pm/article34127381.ece
22 March 2021||New Delhi,||Rahul, Priyanka criss-cross Assam, but skip West Bengal||With Congress general secretary Priyanka Vadra making a strong pitch on behalf of Debabrata Saikia, Leader of the Opposition in the Assam Assembly, at Nazira on Sunday, she and her brother, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, have focussed on the State for the third day in a row. Assam campaign Mr. Gandhi wound up his two-day trip on Saturday with the release of the manifesto in Guwahati, while Ms. Vadra will spend another day in Assam and visit the birthplace of 15th century Vaishnavite saint Srimanta Sankardev, as the Congress tries to wrest back the State that was once its bastion. But the top party campaigners have carefully avoided campaigning in neighbouring West Bengal. Party insiders say Mr. Gandhi, a Lok Sabha member from Kerala, is likely to campaign for the Left Front-Congress alliance in Bengal only after Kerala voting is over on April 6 as the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) is the Congress’s main rival in Kerala. A source said that if the Gandhis campaign alongside Left party leaders in Bengal ahead of the Kerala voting, it will send “confusing signals” to workers and voters. In Kerala, where the Congress’s own assessment is of a close fight, it does not want to be seen as having any “soft spot” for the Left and will welcome some extra aggression from the Gandhi siblings. On Monday, Mr. Gandhi has a series of programmes in Kochi and Alappuzha districts. In Bengal, where the high-pitched battle seems focused on the ruling Trinamool Congress and the BJP, the Left Front-Congress alliance is fighting for its political relevance. Best scenario in Bengal A senior Congress leader told The Hindu that a hung Assembly in Bengal would be the best possible scenario for the alliance as it could play the kingmaker’s role. In Assam, where the party’s internal surveys have shown a gap between the ruling BJP and the Congress, the party is pushing Ms. Vadra and Mr. Gandhi besides banking on the strength of its alliance with the All India United Democratic Front, led by Badruddin Ajmal, and the Bodo People’s Front. Though the emergence of regional parties such as the Asom Jatiya Parishad and the Raijor Dal out of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) movement had threatened to make it a three-cornered fight, the Congress has stepped up the campaign to make it a bipolar contest in most seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-priyanka-criss-cross-assam-but-skip-west-bengal/article34127385.ece
22 March 2021||Ghaziabad,||High Court to consider transfer of Hathras case||Responding to an affidavit filed by the elder brother of the Hathras gang-rape and murder victim to stay the trial proceedings as he and his counsel were allegedly threatened in the courtroom of the special judge (SC/ST), Hathras, on March 5, the Allahabad High Court has asked the district judge, Hathras, and the Inspector-General, Central Reserve Police Force, to submit a report within 15 days. Later, on Friday, the two-judge Bench of Justices Rajan Roy and Jaspreet Singh said, “It would consider whether trial in question before the special judge (SC/ST), Hathras, is required to be stayed and is to be transferred elsewhere in the exercise of powers under Section 407 of CrPc.” The affidavit submitted by the victim’s brother on March 18 said that on March 5, when he, accompanied by his wife, and counsel Seema Kushwaha, went to the Special Court of B.D. Bharti to record prosecution evidence, an advocate named Tarun Hari Sharma stormed into the courtroom and charged towards him and his counsel, shouting and issuing threats. Mr. Sharma seemed to be under the influence of alcohol and he said that Ms. Kushwaha could not represent the victim’s family. The affidavit further said a large mob, including lawyers, gathered to threaten and intimidate the complainant and his counsel. Anurag Singh, CBI counsel, informed the High Court that the investigating agency intended to file an application for transfer of trial. The High Court said that till the next date of listing, the trial court should conduct the proceedings in-camera in the letter and spirit of Section 327 of the CrPc. The affidavit has been filed after the Supreme Court on March 12 dismissed the petition to transfer the case out of Uttar Pradesh. Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal said he had no idea of the incident till the HC order came to light through media reports. The matter has been listed for April 7 in the Allahabad High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/high-court-to-consider-transfer-of-hathras-case/article34127390.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC walks a tightrope over vacancies||The Supreme Court Collegium is striving to reach a consensus on recommendations to fill the five vacancies in the top court. With barely a month left for Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde to retire, the Collegium is discussing diverse opinions from within on issues like proportionate representation from various High Courts and seniority among High Court judges before finalising the names to recommend to the government for appointment. Proportionate representation from High Courts and seniority, though only conventions and not constitutional or legal mandates, carry weight during the appointment process. Fading strength The last appointments to the Supreme Court were of Justices Krishna Murari, S. Ravindra Bhat, V. Ramasubramanian and Hrishikesh Roy in September 2019. The past several months have seen the Supreme Court function under a series of challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, even as its judicial strength faded to 29 with the recent retirement of Justice Indu Malhotra. The year 2021 will see four retirements in the top court, starting with Chief Justice Bobde, and Justices Ashok Bhushan, Rohinton Nariman and Naveen Sinha. The latter two judges retire in August. The names of several High Court judges are in the zone of consideration. Information published by the Law Ministry on March 1 shows that the s e nior-most among current Chief Justices of the 25 High Courts, as per their initial appointment in 2003 and 2004, are Karnataka Chief Justice A.S. Oka, Tripura Chief Justice Akil Abdulhamid Kureshi, Delhi Chief Justice D.N. Patel, Allahabad Chief Justice Govind Mathur, Gujarat Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Calcutta Chief Justice T.B. Radhakrishnan. Of this, Chief Justices Mathur and Radhakrishnan will retire during the course of 2021. Others retiring this year include Telangana Chief Justice Kumari Hima Kohli, Chhattisgarh Chief Justice P.R. Ramachandra Menon, Himachal Chief Justice L.N. Swamy and Uttarakhand Chief Justice R.S. Chauhan. Crowded space Of the remaining, however, most Chief Justices belong to parent High Courts which already have multiple representations in the Supreme Court judiciary. For instance, Justice Oka’s parent High Court is Bombay, which now has the largest representation in the Supreme Court with Chief Justice Bobde, followed by Justices A.M. Khanwilkar, D.Y. Chandrachud and B.R. Gavai. Justices Chandrachud and Gavai are in line to be CJIs as per the seniority norm. Justice Vikram Nath’s parent High Court is Allahabad. But this High Court already has three representations — Justices Bhushan, Vineet Saran and Murari. Justice Kohli’s parent High Court is Delhi, which has three representations in Justices S.K. Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna and S. Ravindra Bhat in the top court. Then again, Justice Swamy is from Karnataka. But this HC has three representations in the Supreme Court with Justices M.M. Shantanagoudar, S. Abdul Nazeer and A.S. Bopanna. However, the name of Justice B.V. Nagarathna from Karnataka High Court is under consideration in the Collegium to replace Justice Indu Malhotra’s vacancy. While Allahabad High Court Chief Justice Govind Mathur is from Rajasthan, the Supreme Court already has Justices Ajay Rastogi and Dinesh Maheshwari from that State. Lone representations There are in the Supreme Court, nevertheless, some State HCs which have lone representations. These include Justice N.V. Ramana, the next CJI as per the seniority norm, whose parent HC is Andhra; Justice Ramasubramanian whose is from the Madras HC; Justice K.M. Joseph whose parent HC is Kerala; Justice R.S. Reddy is the sole representation from Telangana HC; Justice Roy whose parent HC is Gauhati; Justices M.R. Shah and Sinha from Gujarat and Patna HCs, respectively. In fact, the number of direct appointees from the Supreme Court Bar to the Bench — Justices Nariman, U.U. Lalit and L. Nageswara Rao — exceeds representation from some State HCs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-walks-a-tightrope-over-vacancies/article34127399.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Varsity regrets events surrounding resignations’||The top functionaries of Ashoka University said in a joint statement with professors Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Arvind Subramanian on Sunday that they regretted the events surrounding the resignations of the two. The statement, by Chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee, Vice-Chancellor Malabika Sarkar, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Ashish Dhawan, Prof. Mehta and Prof. Subramanian, said: “We acknowledge that there have been some lapses in institutional processes which we will work to rectify in consultation with all stakeholders. This will reaffirm our commitment to academic autonomy and freedom which have always been at the core of the Ashoka University ideals.” The statement said Prof. Mehta and Prof. Subramanian were “sad to be leaving Ashoka” and that they continued to believe that the university “embodies a liberal vision and commitment to academic freedom and autonomy”. The joint statement comes after Prof. Mehta told Ashoka University students that he will not withdraw his resignation as “the underlying circumstances that led to [it] will not change for the foreseeable future”. ‘Closed chapter’ In a letter to his students on Sunday, Prof. Mehta insisted that his time with Ashoka was a closed chapter. “[It] is not an easy decision. But it is, for me, the only honourable thing to do, consistent with my values; values I think you share. I also believe it is in the best interests of the university,” he wrote. “The underlying circumstances that led to the resignation will not change for the foreseeable future, in my case, at any rate,” he said in the letter. Prof. Mehta resigned earlier this week after a meeting with the University’s founders made it clear that his association with the institution could be considered a “political liability”. Prof. Subramanian, fellow professor and former Chief Economic Adviser, resigned in solidarity two days later, saying the University could “no longer provide a space for academic expression and freedom.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/varsity-regrets-events-surrounding-resignations/article34127405.ece
22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||BJP rebel talks of regime change again||Amidst campaigning for the bypolls, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, BJP MLA, yet again forecast leadership change in Karnataka and said it was necessary if “the party has to survive in the State.” Speaking at Vijayapura, he predicted it would happen after the polls. “The party high command wants to change Chief Ministers in three States, Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Haryana, of which one has already been done and the other two will be changed post the Assembly polls in some States,” he claimed. The BJP serving a show-cause notice as to why disciplinary action must not be taken against him and being snubbed by party in charge Arun Singh publicly several times seems to have had little impact on Mr. Yatnal, a constant critic of Mr. Yediyurappa. “The high command knows that the leadership has to be changed if the party has to survive in the State. Even Mr. Singh knows this is imminent, but has been denying it on public forums,” he said. Mr. Singh publicly snubbed Mr. Yatnal last week saying he need not be taken seriously. The delay in high command taking disciplinary action against Mr. Yatnal has irked the Chief Minister’s camp no end, especially since the notice has done little to silence his public criticism. ‘Congress agent’ On Sunday, Chief Minister’s political secretary M.P. Renukacharya hit back at Mr. Yatnal calling him a “Congress agent” and said a group of MLAs are scheduled to meet on Monday to give Mr. Yatnal a fitting reply. “Mr. Yatnal is deliberately creating confusion amidst the bypoll campaign, even after the high command made it clear that there will be no change of leadership,” he said, demanding the party expel him for his “anti-party activities.” A senior BJP legislator said it was surprising how Mr. Yatnal seemed unaffected by the party’s notice on disciplinary action. “He replied to that notice with more damning allegations against the Chief Minister and his son. Since then he has identified himself with the Panchamasali agitation and embarrassed the party by criticising the government and the Chief Minister even on the floor of the House,” the leader said, wondering what the high command’s silence meant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-rebel-talks-of-regime-change-again/article34127363.ece
22 March 2021||KHAMMAM,||Ultra-modern Khammam bus station all set for inauguration||The much-awaited new bus station of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) built on sprawling little over seven-acre land here, touted to be the second biggest bus station after the MGBS in Hyderabad in the entire State, is ready for inauguration. The ultra-modern bus station spread over a plinth area of over 80,000 square feet and cellar parking area of over 30,000 square feet has a total of 30 platforms and all modern amenities for passengers and the TSRTC staff. Information Technology and Industries Minister K T Rama Rao will inaugurate the new bus station here on March 27, TSRTC sources said. The new bus station with state-of-the-art facilities is expected to provide hassle-free travel for the commuters and offer ample space for free movement of buses. The new bus station abutting the bypass road is poised to become a new landmark in Khammam, a major trade hub known for agri-business and considered as a gateway to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The new bus station was sanctioned with an estimated outlay of Rs. 25 crore by the State government in 2017 following persistent demands from denizens of the town for a spacious bus station in view of traffic congestion and space constraints at the existing old bus station near Mayuri Centre in the town. The old bus stand parirakshana committee comprising organisations representing farmers, labourers, petty vendors and others organised a string of programmes including a “Praja Ballot” in the past few weeks to press for continuation of the old bus stand as a “local bus stand” for the convenience of commuters from rural areas. Allaying the apprehensions over the fate of the old bus stand, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar made it clear that the old bus stand will be used as the TSRTC Kalyana Mandapam in public interest. Meanwhile, the members of the parirakshana committee staged a demonstration by holding placards here on Sunday opposing the move to convert the old bus stand into a Kalyana Mandapam. They insisted that the centrally located old bus station be retained for use as a local bus stand for public convenience even after the inauguration of the new bus station in view of the fast growing population of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ultra-modern-khammam-bus-station-all-set-for-inauguration/article34127749.ece
22 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Centre urged to complete restoration of temples||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has requested Union Minister of Tourism and Culture Prahlad Singh Patel to instruct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for the timely completion of the ancient Thousand Pillar and Ramappa temples in the erstwhile Warangal district as the two restoration works have been going on for long. In a letter addressed to the Union Minister on March 20, TRS MLC from Warangal Local Authorities’ Constituency, Pochampally Srinivas Reddy brought to the former’s notice that the restoration work on the Thousand Pillar temple taken up by ASI was going on for over decade now, although it was scheduled to be completed in 18 months when it was taken up in 2005. He explained that Warangal is the second largest and fastest growing city in Telangana and is also a historical city with several heritage assets and as the capital of the Kakatiya dynasty. It has several tourist attractions such as Thousand Pillar temple built by the Kakatiyas dedicated to Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu and Lord Surya, the Bhadrakali temple and the Warangal Fort, dating backing to the 13th century. Similarly, the Ramappa temple dedicated to Lord Shiva is located 77 km away from Warangal. The Ministry of Urban Development has included the city in the Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) scheme to maintain the heritage sites. The Thousand Pillar temple under ASI is among the tentative list of World Heritage sites of UNESCO. Located in the heart of Warangal, the erstwhile capital of the region during the Kakatiya rule, the Thousand Pillar temple was constructed between 1175 and 1324 AD following the orders of Kakatiya king Rudra Deva. It is considered a masterpiece and its foundation was constructed using the sandbox technique. It was desecrated by the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century after the it area was brought under its direct control. The temple was profaned by the rulers of the Tughlaq Dynasty during their invasion of the Deccan region and was destroyed partially. It was restored by ASI in 2004. The Natya Madapam in the south of the temple complex was dismantled by the ASI in 2005 for reconstruction for completing the work in 18 months, the discouragingly slow pace of work is keeping it incomplete even after 15 years, Mr. Srinivas Reddy noted in his letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-urged-to-complete-restoration-of-temples/article34127747.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||CPWD to lay three roads near China border in Ladakh||The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has floated tenders worth a total of Rs. 212.99 crore this month for laying and maintenance of three high-altitude roads near the India-China border in Ladakh. While the projects are titled as roads “to Indo-China Border” from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police bases at Shilung La, Nyakmikle and Hena, the three tender documents said: “The work is situated in Leh District of U.T. of Ladakh near International Border.” All the three roads would be single lane projects as per the relevant specifications of National Highways, according to the documents. The CPWD floated one tender on March 12 and two on March 19 and set the date for opening of bids as April 8 and April 15 respectively. The single-lane road project of 10.22 km length till the Shilung La base was estimated to take 42 months and cost Rs. 93.8 crore, according to the tender document. The Nyakmikle road project was estimated at Rs. 55.37 crore and take 30 months for construction of the 9.29- km stretch. The 7.64-km Hena project till the ITBP post was estimated to cost Rs. 63.82 crore and take up to 30 months to construct, the tender document showed. According to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs report presented on March 15, the Centre had informed the panel that a “standalone project” of constructing a critical road along the border in Ladakh was ongoing. The Ministry of Home Affairs told the panel, chaired by Congress MP Anand Sharma, that 57 roads along the India-China border were being constructed, as well as 47 outposts, 32 helipads and 18 foot tracks in Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpwd-to-lay-three-roads-near-china-border-in-ladakh/article34127379.ece
22 March 2021||Kolkata,||BJP’s Bengal manifesto offers CAA, job quota for women||The BJP on Sunday promised reservation of 33% for women in government jobs, implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and allocation of Rs. 18,000 pending to 75 lakh farmers under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi in its manifesto for West Bengal. Releasing the “Sonar Bangla Sonkolpo Potro 2021”, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the manifesto is a vision of realising the party’s slogan of Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal). The BJP also promised free education for girls from KG to PG, free rides for women in public transport and conditional cash transfer to school going girls in Class VI, IX, XI and XII. It promised nine women only police battalions and three battalions under the State Reserve Police force. The Trinamool Congress has a conditional cash transfer scheme for school going girls called Kanyashree Scheme, which has received international acclaim. Mr. Shah promised the implementation of the CAA in the first Cabinet meeting of the BJP government in West Bengal. The BJP had promised its implementation in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls too after the Bill was passed in Parliament. During the run up to the campaign, the BJP leadership including Mr. Shah have maintained that the rules for the CAA are being framed and the Act will be implemented after the vaccination for COVID-19 is completed. The CAA is an emotive issue for the Matuas, Hindu refugees who migrated from Bangladesh. They can influence electoral results in 40 of the 294 seats. Mr. Shah also promised the implementation of Ayushman Bharat in the first Cabinet meet. He said the BJP government will ensure that there is zero infiltration and promised fencing of the border. He blamed the “black period of misrule” of the Trinamool Congress government for the low development indicators. Accusing the Trinamool of indulging in politics of appeasement, Mr. Shah said citizens under the BJP rule will not have to approach the courts for holding Durga and Saraswati Puja. The BJP also promised Rs. 6,000 per annum for fishermen. The manifesto also promised Annapurna Canteens where subsided cooked meals at Rs. 5 a day will be served thrice a day. A similar announcement of “Maa canteens” was made by the Trinamool Congress. The Trinamool Congress said the manifesto was released in Hindi and not Bengali. “For the first time ever, a non-Bengali has released a manifesto meant for Bengal because @BJP4Bengal did not have a single ‘son of the soil’ to do the same. Bengal will never forget this insult. #BengalRejectsGujaratiManifesto,” it tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjps-bengal-manifesto-offers-caa-job-quota-for-women/article34127386.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Corrective voice from top court against stereotyping women||A judgment by the Supreme Court forbidding judges from making gender stereotypical comments came as a corrective voice from within the highest level of judiciary in India. The judgment, pronounced on March 18, came days after the court ran into a maelstrom of criticism after the Chief Justice of India (CJI), during a virtual hearing on March 1, reportedly asked an alleged rapist’s lawyer to enquire whether his client would marry the survivor. ‘Completely misquoted’ On March 8, Chief Justice Bobde said he was “completely misquoted”. The CJI said the court had the highest respect for womanhood. The top judge’s statement coincided with International Women’s Day. Ten days later, a Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and S. Ravindra Bhat, in its judgment, urged courts to avoid using reasoning or language which diminished a sexual offence and tended to trivialise the survivor. “Even a solitary instance of such order or utterance in court, reflects adversely on the entire judicial system of the country, undermining the guarantee to fair justice to all, and especially to victims of sexual violence (of any kind from the most aggravated to the so-called minor offences),” the judgment, authored by Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, said. Series of orders The judgment stopped courts from trying to mandate marriage or compromise between a sex offender and his victim. It was based on an appeal against a Madhya Pradesh High Court order directing an alleged molester to “allow” his victim to tie a rakhi on him. This judgment is one among a series of interventions with which the top court has clamped down on abuse and sex stereotyping of women. Some of the notable judgments which have lashed out at sex stereotyping include the framing of the Vishaka Guidelines on sexual harassment of women at workplaces, and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud’s historic judgment giving women Armed Forces officers equal access to Permanent Commission while debunking the establishment’s claim that women were physiologically weaker than men. Justice Chandrachud, in the Permanent Commission for women officers case, said, “women officers of the Indian Army have brought laurels to the force … Their track record of service to the nation is beyond reproach. To cast aspersion on their abilities on the ground of gender is an affront not only to their dignity as women but to the dignity of the members of the Indian Army — men and women — who serve as equal citizens in a common mission.” In the Anuj Garg case, the Supreme Court had rebuked “the notion of romantic paternalism”, which, “in practical effect, put women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/corrective-voice-from-top-court-against-stereotyping-women/article34127397.ece
22 March 2021||Kozhikode,||Nursing mothers assigned poll duty||Lactating mothers and pregnant women are exempted from COVID-19 vaccination. They are not to be deputed for Assembly election duty as well. But government orders in this regard are honoured more in the breach, claim some government staff. A woman employee in the Animal Husbandry Department in a southern district, whose child is only seven months old, said on Sunday that senior officials had declined her request for exemption from election duty. She alleged that they forced her to attend the training session for poll officials. Another woman employee in the Revenue Department, who has a nine-month-old child and hails from a Malabar district, said she had a similar experience. “We were told that the number of polling booths have gone up across the State in view of the pandemic. They said if government staff are exempted from poll duty on one pretext or the other, it would lead to a shortage of personnel. Since we have already attended the training session, we have no other way now than join election duty,” the women claimed. Work from home According to a government order on February 2, pregnant women, lactating mothers with children aged less than one, cancer patients, and those about to undergo organ transplant can opt for ‘work from home’. The Disaster Management Department had on October 8, 2020, issued an order saying that they are exempted from directly appearing in the office. The government has made COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for all those who will attend poll duty. “Lactating mothers and pregnant women cannot be vaccinated, but they are being chosen for election work. Isn’t there a contradiction? ” a senior official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nursing-mothers-assigned-poll-duty/article34127360.ece
22 March 2021||JAIPUR,||Research institution joins efforts to bring law on right to health||A Jaipur-based research institution has joined the efforts for bringing a “robust legislation” on right to health in Rajasthan with the emphasis on setting the standards for delivery of services, human resources and medical facilities. The 2021-22 State budget has made a provision for the law along with a new model of public health. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had announced the implementation of the Rajasthan Model of Public Health, while presenting the State Budget on February 24, and said that it would include a Right to Health Bill as well as measures for preventive, primary and curative care as envisioned by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Mukhya Mantri Chiranjeevi Yojana will also be launched on May 1 as a universal health care scheme with an allocation of Rs. 3,500 crore in the upcoming financial year as part of measures to reinforce health infrastructure and ensure accessibility to all citizens. The scheme stipulates cashless health services up to Rs. 5 lakh to every family in the State. The Indian Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR) has recommended setting of standards in accordance with the resources available in the State to match with the rights of patients as well as the service providers. The Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), set by the Union government, have also been revised keeping in view the changing protocols of the existing programmes.  ‘Dynamic process’ IIHMR president P.R. Sodani said here on Saturday that the quality of medical services could not be measured unless the standards were laid down as per the availability of resources at primary and tertiary levels. “It should be a dynamic process. The standards can further be enhanced when a satisfactory level of medical investigation, treatment and supply of drugs is achieved,” he said. Dr. Sodani highlighted the aspect of ensuring high quality of public health services at a State-level consultation on the Right to Health Act here. He said the State government should first set the norms and later allow flexibility to suit the diverse needs of different regions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/research-institution-joins-efforts-to-bring-law-on-right-to-health/article34127657.ece
22 March 2021||KHAMMAM,||Pedalling to give health, family income a leg-up||Following in the footsteps of her grandfather Manchikanti Ramkishan Rao, 58-year-old M. Sridevi has shown age-defying agility and perseverance apart from motivating others in the town to lead a healthy lifestyle. A resident of Naidupeta, Ms Sridevi pedals 4-5 km along the main thoroughfares of the town on her cycle almost daily to reach a retired bank employee’s house in the town, where she is working as a cook. With this, she is inspiring others to take to cycling to maintain good health and save money in these times of skyrocketing fuel prices. “My grandfather, who was a two-time CPI(M) MLA from Khammam in the 80s, led a simple life and earned wide admiration for his generosity. He also used to travel by cycle in the Kothagudem coal belt region to meet workers as a trade union leader,” she said, adding that she inherited the qualities of simple living and hard work from her grandfather. “My husband Muralikrishna, a retired employee, gets a meagre pension. I am working as a cook at a retired banker’s house to supplement our household income,” she explains. She takes pride in commuting by cycle which she purchased more than two decades ago and relying on hard work to augment income for her family, Ms Sridevi asserts with a sense of accomplishment. Cycling involves just one-time investment in a bicycle and offers independent mobility free of cost, she notes, calling upon youngsters to embrace cycling for the sake of personal health and that of the environment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pedalling-to-give-health-family-income-a-leg-up/article34127777.ece
22 March 2021||KOCHI,||Judge flags issue of absent prosecutors||With no ‘public prosecutor effectively appearing’ in the case of Thadiyantavide Nazeer, a terror-accused, in the Special Court of the National Investigation Agency, the court has sought the intervention of the Ernakulam District Collector to solve the impasse. The Special Judge, who shot off a letter to the District Collector, pointed out that no public prosecutor was effectively appearing in the cases against Nazeer for the last nine postings or more. The judge also asked the Collector to give effective instructions to the prosecutors in the case. The court further pointed out that if some prosecutor appeared in the case, he was not ready to argue the cases, which were principally posted for hearing on framing charges against the accused. The judge complained that the court was not even in a position to understand which prosecutor was appearing in the cases. Most of the cases were pretty old ones and the court may have to proceed as no prosecutor was appearing in the cases, he complained. Investigating agencies had alleged that Nazeer had links with some extremist organisations and was involved in some terrorist activities in the country. The agencies had also slapped the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act against Nazeer, who is currently confined in the Parappana Agrahara Jail, Bangalore, in some cases. He has also been arraigned as an accused and convicted in some terror cases. Pleader reacts Responding to the developments, District Government Pleader Manoj G. Krishnan said the issue had not come to his notice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/judge-flags-issue-of-absent-prosecutors/article34127831.ece
22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||CM will decide on Anil Deshmukh, says Pawar||“The allegations against the Maharashtra Home Minister are serious. Chief Minister has the full authority to take a decision regarding an inquiry on these allegations against the Home Minister,” Mr. Pawar said, adding, “I would suggest to Uddhav Thackeray to seek former IPS officer Julio Ribeiro’s help for looking into the claims made by Param Bir Singh.” The NCP chief told reporters at his official residence in Delhi that Mr. Param Bir Singh did meet him but it was only “when his transfer orders were about to be issued by the Maharashtra government”. Asked if there was an attempt to destabilise the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, the NCP chief said, “I don't know whether efforts are being made or not to topple the [MVA] government. All I can say is they will have no impact on the government.” The episode has led to tensions in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government as the Shiv Sena leadership is reported to be against Mr. Deshkmukh’s continuance as a Minister. Mr. Pawar is learnt to have convened a meeting of party leaders including Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and State NCP chief Jayant Patil to discuss the issue. The NCP supremo also said the party must hear out Mr. Deshmukh, who has categorically denied all the allegations, before taking a final decision. The central leadership of the Congress, the third partner in the MVA alliance, decided to adopt a ‘wait and watch approach’. Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) Maharashtra in-charge, H.K, Patil, will speak on the issue soon.

The letter comes after a series of exchanges between the State and the Centre over the handling of the refugees. Stating that whole of Myanmar is in turmoil and “innocent hapless citizens are being persecuted” by the military regime who are supposed to be their guardians and protectors, Mr. Zoramthanga said the “Myanmar area bordering Mizoram is inhibited by Chin communities who are ethnically our brethren with whom we have been having close contacts throughout all these years even before India became independent.” Following the February 1 coup when the Myanmar military overthrew the democratically elected government, around 300 Myanmarese nationals including many policemen have crossed into India and sought refuge. There is considerable support and sympathy among the people of Mizoram over the situation in Myanmar as many have relations across the border, a government official stated adding, it was a very emotive and sensitive issue in the State. India and Myanmar have an arrangement called Free Movement Regime (FMR) which allows locals on both sides to go upto 16 km across the other side and stay upto 14 days. Thousands of Myanmarese nationals visit regularly for work and to meet relatives. In March 2020, FMR was suspended due to COVID-2019 and no one has been being allowed since. The fallout of this, officials said, was that there has been an increase smuggling across the border as the livelihood of people has been disrupted due to the pandemic. On February 26, the State government had issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to Deputy Commissioners detailing how the refugees are to be handled. This was subsequently revoked after directions from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). After the MHA directive, no one is being allowed to enter India from Myanmar and the Assam Rifles, which is the border guarding force there, is keeping a close watch, said a second local official. However, the border is porous and unlike the Bangladesh border, over 60% of which is fenced, the Myanmar border is unfenced and completely blocking it not possible given the tough terrain. Mizoram shares a 510 km long border with Mizoram. All the refugees who have come in earlier have been housed in camps along the border by the local administration and security forces have no direct access. For central agencies and Assam Rifles on the ground, it is a tricky situation in maintaining a delicate balance in executing the MHA orders and maintaining the cordial relations with the States agencies and the locals, the official added. In a letter to the four States bordering Myanmar dated March 10, MHA said State governments have no powers to grant refugee status to any foreigner and India is not a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 and its 1967 Protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-refugee-crisis-myanmar-border-sealed/article34127358.ece

However, the Chief Minister, following a meeting of the State Cabinet last week, said while guidelines such as “masking and sanitising” would be followed, there would no obstructions to the ‘smooth’ movement of people. “We have increased the buses to transport people and seers to the various pilgrimage spots. This event happens once in 12 years and it would be wrong to discourage people from taking a holy dip,” he had said. The Health Ministry team, led by Sujeet Kumar Singh, Director, National Centre of Disease Control in Delhi, had visited Uttarakhand on March 16 and 17 to review the preparedness measures undertaken by the State for the Mela. ‘Follow guidelines’ Rajesh Bhushan, Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, wrote to Uttarakhand Chief Secretary Utpal Kumar Singh on Sunday, highlighting the concerns raised by the NCDC-led team. The government has been advised to “scrupulously follow” the Health Ministry’s guidelines including display signages, increasing awareness of self-reporting symptoms of cases suggestive of COVID-19, to increase testing, particularly in potential high transmission areas and after key auspicious days of the 30-day festival. Were the number of cases to surge, the State ought to “promptly” send samples for genome sequencing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kumbh-centre-warns-of-covid-19-upsurge/article34127377.ece
22 March 2021||Pune,||Fadnavis demands Deshmukh’s ouster||A day after a letter allegedly written by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh levelled charges of ‘extortion’ against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, the Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis demanded that Mr. Deshmukh resign immediately. Mr. Fadnavis further alleged that former Maharashtra Director-General of Police (DGP) Subodh Jaiswal, too, had submitted an extensive report to the Chief Minister in which he allegedly pointed to rampant corruption within the State Home Department. “Param Bir Singh’s letter is not the first one to expose irregularities within the State Home Department. Subodh Jaiswal, too, had submitted an extensive report on this to the Chief Minister raising issues regarding functioning of the Home Department in which he highlighted the racket of transfers within the Police Department and the exchange of money. He had submitted this report along with transcripts,” the BJP leader said in Nagpur on Sunday. Remarking that the series of incidents after the arrest of Assistant Police Inspector (API) Sachin Vaze in connection with the security scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence had cast aspersions on the functioning of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, Mr. Fadnavis said the BJP demanded a court-monitored inquiry and that it would keep on agitating until Mr. Deshmukh submitted his resignation. He said the matter could not be satisfactorily investigated if Mr. Deshmukh stayed on in his post and that the latter would first have to resign. “Param Bir Singh’s letter contains irrefutable evidence,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fadnavis-demands-deshmukhs-ouster/article34127387.ece

The victim, D. Mahadev, and his friend Gopanna, both residents of BC Colony in the town, went to a nearby ground where three school buses were deserted for a long time due to COVID-19 lockdown. They noticed a beehive inside a bus, and decided to extract the honey. In the process, the duo collected dried leaves and lit it. As the flames were high, Gopanna went to get some water to douse the flames. In the meantime, Mahadev entered the bus in an attempt to drive away the bees and extract the honey, District Superintendent of Police M. Chetana told The Hindu . “He threw leaves on the floor of the bus. However, the fire spread to the seats and soon the vehicle was engulfed in flames, and Mahadev could not escape. By the time Gopanna returned with a bucket full of water, he was burnt alive,” she said, adding that Gopanna fled after that. Locals, who noticed the flames, alerted police, and a fire tender was soon rushed to the spot to douse the flames.

Nobody (in State government) has contacted me. And in any case even if they contact me, I am unavailable,” Mr. Ribeiro said when asked about Mr. Pawar’s suggestion. “I am 92 years old. Nobody goes around doing this work at the age of 92. If the inquiry is against the Home Minister of Maharashtra, then Mr. Pawar should make it because he is the head of the (ruling) party,” Mr. Ribeiro said. Mr. Ribeiro is a former Mumbai police commissioner, who eventually became the chief of Gujarat and Punjab police and was later named India’s ambassador to Romania. “Why should a retired police officer be asked to do this,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unavailable-for-probe-ribeiro/article34127425.ece
22 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||‘Centre silent on Chinese dam projects’||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday slammed the BJP government for not objecting to China building a dam on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra in Tibet, which would affect the life and economy of the people in Assam. She said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attack on the Congress based on a conspiracy theory triggered by the tweet of a 22-year-old (green activist Disha Ravi) did not behove of his position. At election rallies in Jorhat, Nazira and Khumtai in eastern Assam, Ms. Vadra said the dam being built by China would damage the ecology associated with the Brahmaputra. “The Prime Minister has campaigned in Assam several times but said not a word on this vital issue,” she said. She said Mr. Modi was delivering poll speeches that a Prime Minister of a country was not expected to make. She said this in reference to Mr. Modi raking up the toolkit issue to claim that the Congress was colluding with foreign forces to finish off Assam’s tea industry. She said the BJP had “two CMs” in the State, an indirect reference to Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma who, rivals say, wields more power than Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-silent-on-chinese-dam-projects/article34127382.ece

We revised it to Rs. 217 but a few tea garden owners went to the High Court against the revision in connivance with the Congress.” “I am warning tea garden owners that they should straightaway pay the workers at a rate of Rs. 217. They will otherwise be made to pay Rs. 350 if they keep stalling the revised wage with support from the Congress,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pay-revised-wages-to-tea-workers/article34127383.ece

22 March 2021||BODINAYAKKANUR,TAMIL NADU||Will take up Plus Two ‘all pass’ demand: OPS||AIADMK leader and Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam on Sunday said that he would positively take up the demand from a section of Plus Two students that they be declared ‘all pass’ with Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and do his best “in the prevailing circumstances.” At an election rally at Seeliyampatti in Bodinayakkanur Assembly constituency from where he is contesting, Mr. Panneerselvam said that with the election model code of conduct in force, the government would examine the modalities of the demands of Plus Two students. On hearing about his announcement, the students who had come there cheered him. Challenging the opposition, Mr. Panneerselvam said that nobody can dare destroy the AIADMK. It has the blessings of late leaders MGR and Jayalalithaa. ‘Tamil Nadu is the fort of the AIADMK. I promise the people that the party would complete all the remaining projects.’ At many points, he appealed to the public to cast their votes for the two-leaves symbol from the specially made vehicle. The AIADMK government, under the leadership of Mr. Palaniswami, had on a single order waived Rs. 12,000 crore. He said that the same government would deliver washing machines free of cost to the eligible persons and also give them six LPG refills every year. Out of frustration and unable to stomach the popularity of the AIADMK, the opposition were trying to mislead by stating that it would not be possible. He said the Amma’s (Jayalalithaa) government, which had delivered its promises, would continue to do so. On DMK president M K Stalin’s claim that no work had moved on the AIIMS site in Thoppur near Madurai, Mr Panneerselvam said that Mr Stalin should visit the site for himself and speak. The entire 200 acre complex is being fenced and levelling works were under way. ‘I happened to pass through the point this morning. Hence, I am making a statement here,’ he added. Repeating more than once, he said that ‘I stand before you as one among your family. People elected me and my leader gave me positions such as Chief Minister and Minister..I will always be thankful, he said and at a village, where a large number of minorities flanked his vehicle, he said that the AIADMK would always stand by the minorities irrespective of whether it was in power or not.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-take-up-plus-two-all-pass-demand/article34127587.ece

Stalin. Speaking at an election rally in Mullai Nagar, Aranmanaipudur and other pockets in the constituency from where he is contesting from the DMK’s ‘Rising Sun’ symbol, he said that in the last 10 years, Mr Panneerselvam, as Minister, Deputy CM and CM, could have transformed the constituency like Singapore. After failing to even provide basic needs such as underground drainage, drinking water and bus stop shelters, the AIADMK candidate (OPS) claimed to have fulfilled his promises. The DMK candidate said that soon after Mr. Stalin took over the reins of the State, people would get relief from the corrupt AIADMK. Womenfolk (housewives) would get Rs. 1,000 per month, education loans would be waived and jewel loans of farmers would be redeemed, among others. The Deputy Chief Minister, who was an ordinary person some two decades ago, had risen up to a millionaire or even wealthier. The beginning of the end had come for the AIADMK and its leaders. The DMK, when it comes to power, would book all corrupt politicians in the AIADMK and recover their ill-gotten wealth, Mr. Thanga Tamilselvan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beginning-of-end-for-aiadmk-thanga-tamilselvan/article34127717.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Wait for better traffic control, flood mitigation continues||Every election, voters of Virugambakkam constituency pin their hopes on the candidates, wishing that there will come a time when they can travel without getting caught in traffic snarls or ride home safely on non-waterlogged streets during the monsoon. Till now, they have been disappointed. With an electorate of 2.91 lakh, Virugambakkam, comprising areas like Virugambakkam, Saligramam, parts of Arumbakkam and Koyambedu and K.K. Nagar, was formed after the delimitation exercise. The electorate is a combination of middle class and lower-middle class voters, and many are irked by their continuous struggle with traffic congestion and flooding. S. Arumainathan, president, Virugambakkam Residents’ Welfare Association, said while roads in most areas are in good shape, places like Sai Nagar, Tarachand Nagar, Rajaji Colony and Sanjay Gandhi Nagar suffer from overflow of sewage often. “Also, there are quite a few areas which grapple with flooding during monsoon. We need a few more mini-pumping stations for handling this problem. We want these issues to be resolved at the earliest,” he demanded. Ekambaram, who runs a small shop, said, “We are tired of hearing the promises of freebies from the major parties. No one wants anything for free here. If they set right the civic issues, generate more jobs and control inflation that ruins our business, we will be happy.” AIADMK’s V.N. Virugai Ravi, who represents the constituency, said the widening of Kaliamman Koil Street was under way and nearly 1.5 km of the work had been finished so far. “Even the flooding has substantially reduced in many areas and the minute residents call me, I go to the spot with a team to pump out water. Also, we extensively carry out desilting of stormwater drains and the Virugambakkam canal too,” he said. But some of the infrastructural development in recent years can be attributed to the IAS officers quarters that has come up in Nerkundram. This election, DMK has fielded A.M.V. Prabhakar Raja against Mr. Ravi. Mr. Prabhakar Raja is a youth wing organiser and son of Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangam Peramaippu leader Vikrama Raja. The day his candidature was announced former councillor K. Thanasekaran protested along with his supporters for denying him the ticket. The DMK candidate is, however, upbeat. “The stormwater drains continue to be in a bad shape, which results in flooding. They will be my first priority if given a chance,” he said. “The MLA office will function through the day to redress public grievances,” he added. While lyricist Snehan is seeking votes on the Makkal Needhi Maiam ticket, K. Vidhubalan is contesting from the AMMK camp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wait-for-better-traffic-control-flood-mitigation-continues/article34127560.ece

Campaigning in Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni for PMK candidate A.V.A. Kassali, he said the DMK was a “company”. “In the AIADMK, a farmer can become a Chief Minister. Another farmer can become a Deputy Chief Minister. In the DMK, there is a monarchy. The father, his son and his son. This is the case not only with the leadership [at the State level] but also in every district,” he said. Dr. Anbumani pointed to the fact that all three Members of Parliament in the city — North, Central and South Chennai — were dynasts. ‘Nobody else?’ “Is nobody else there in the party? Has nobody worked? All those who worked hard have been sidelined. DMK president M.K. Stalin doesn’t trust people, he doesn’t trust the voters, minorities, youngsters, workers or students. He only trusts Prashant Kishor [political strategist], who has come from Bihar. He decides everything in the party. In contrast, we trust in the working class people like you,” Dr. Anbumani said. He said a farmer had become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu after 70 years. “This should continue,” he said. It was up to the people to choose between family rule and democracy. Dr. Anbumani said he envisioned a Chennai city with a modern transport system with 8,000 buses and recommended that the system be made free. “This would reduce the number of road accidents and help people save money.” He claimed that while the AIADMK government made special concessions to women and maintained law and order, DMK rule would result in serious law and order issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-rule-a-democracy-dmks-a-monarchy/article34127583.ece
22 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘Party can’t be held responsible for unaccounted money of individuals’||Former IAS officer Santhosh Babu , who quit as a bureaucrat to join Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), insists that the party is transparent in its dealings. In a telephonic interview, the Velachery candidate, who is down with COVID-19, says the party cannot be held responsible for the unaccounted money of individual members. Edited excerpts:  Why did you join the MNM when there were other alternatives? The MNM was the only party and Kamal Haasan the only person that openly talked about honesty and integrity in politics. The other parties are submerged in corruption. The MNM was a party with fresh thoughts and was looking for good people to join it. I know that Mr. Haasan does what he says; he is not two-faced like [other] politicians. You say honesty attracted you to the party. But last week, the Income Tax Department seized a huge amount of unaccounted cash from the premises of your party’s treasurer. How do you see this? Mr. Haasan has answered this. But within the party, no one takes cash at any level — it is either a demand draft or a cheque, and the accounts are maintained. The party cannot be held responsible for the unaccounted cash of individuals. Have you done a SWOT analysis on the key problems in your constituency? On the day my constituency was changed from Villivakkam to Velachery, we had three meetings. Every ward was discussed in detail. We put the problems on one side and the solutions on the other and based on that, we formulated our manifesto. Unfortunately, after I contracted COVID-19, I could not visit these places. Drainage is a big issue here, and we have to sit down together and solve this problem. Flooding is another concern. In our manifesto, we have said that we will find a permanent solution to flooding. A majority of the roads are bad; footpaths have been encroached upon; and electricity keeps fluctuating. These are all concerns as there are several IT firms here, and they impact the common man, too. Post-hospitalisation, you tweeted that you will go ahead with a digital campaign. Do you think this will work? Digital campaigning can’t dominate physical campaigning. People smile and wave when they see you; you can see their reaction. In digital campaigning, connectivity is sometimes an issue – I am sitting with two power banks. Since the doctors have advised rest, I am lying down. I do campaign work for up to nine hours a day [online]. But my volunteers are on the field, distributing pamphlets and helping me reach voters through videos. I hope some day the government will stop physical campaigns and embrace digital campaigns. In doing so, one could save a lot of money. How do you view your party’s prospects? We are a three-year-old party and people know us well. We have an outstanding manifesto that was prepared by our own teams — not outsourced to strategists — after consultations with experts and the public. Our manifesto has a transformational agenda and we have doable ideas. Tamil Nadu is not for sale, and people should not sell their votes for cash.  The MNM was a party with fresh thoughts and was looking for good people to join it||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/party-cant-be-held-responsible-for-unaccounted-money-of-individuals/article34127570.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Palaniswami betrayed Sasikala who made him CM, says Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday accused Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami of remaining ungrateful to V.K. Sasikala, “even though it was she who made him the Chief Minister”. “He is a betrayer who has kicked away the ladder [Sasikala],” he said while campaigning for K. Sundar, the party’s Uthiramerur constituency candidate. “He became the Chief Minister because his party leader, Jayalalithaa, passed away and Sasikala was lodged in prison. The revolt of Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who created a separate faction, also helped him become the Chief Minister,” he said. Alleging that Mr. Palaniswami had spoken against the three farm laws in the manifesto released by his party only to “cheat” the farmers, Mr. Stalin said the Chief Minister had earlier ridiculed the farmers who were protesting against the legislation in Delhi. Claiming that even (some) Chief Ministers of the BJP-ruled States were opposing the farm laws, he said Mr. Palaniswami was the only Chief Minister who called the farmers “brokers”. “Does he have the guts to meet the protesting farmers in Delhi?” Mr. Stalin asked. According to him, Mr. Palaniswami had “shamelessly” entered into an alliance with the BJP, even though the Centre had failed to release the funds sought by Tamil Nadu to overcome the losses incurred due to Cyclones Ockhi, Gaja and Burevi, and the GST share due to the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palaniswami-betrayed-sasikala-who-made-him-cm-says-stalin/article34127581.ece
22 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||When politicians break down in public during poll season||There have been quite a few instances of political leaders and elected representatives breaking down in closed-door meetings and in front of the public in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Such public display of emotion is rather uncommon. “Why was the seat denied to me? What mistake have I committed? I have been a true loyalist of the party all along,” lamented former Minister and Perundurai AIADMK MLA Thoppu N. Venkatachalam as he broke down before the media recently. However, he went on to file his nomination as an Independent, hoping to enter the Assembly for a third consecutive term. He was subsequently expelled from the party. Manchanallur MLA Parameshwari Murugan, also from the AIADMK, did not rebel against her party for not renominating her. Instead, when Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was en route to a campaign stop, she approached his car, held his hand and wept profusely over being denied a ticket, as scores of cadre looked on. She swore that she would remain loyal to the AIADMK, while Mr. Palaniswami consoled her. Not just ticket aspirants, even leaders have got emotional. When the DMK was playing hardball during the seat-sharing talks, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri’s voice choked with emotion at a closed-door meeting as he narrated to party functionaries the manner in which the negotiations were being handled. Some candidates turned emotional while campaigning for votes. Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister Sevvoor Ramachandran recently broke down while canvassing votes in a Vanniyar-dominated village, and was consoled by PMK cadre, who assured him of support from the community. Then there were those who grew sentimental while recalling personal memories, like Khushbu, the BJP’s Thousand Lights candidate, did while reminiscing about her mother. Commenting on those who were denied party ticket turning emotional, G. Palanithurai, retired professor of the Gandhigram Rural Institute, said, “It has become a new trend for [some] political aspirants to turn sentimental when they are denied a chance [to contest an election] as they are unduly attached to power and position.” Professor Sandeep Shastri, a political analyst, said turning emotional could be one way to sway the party leadership with the aim of getting it to change its decision. “The emotional outburst could also happen because the aspirant may have invested a lot in getting a party ticket. It is also a direct consequence of the absence of democracy within a party. There must be transparency in the selection of candidates so that such incidents do not recur,” he said. Puducherry, too, witnessed such incidents. Former Public Works Department Minister A. Namassivayam, who crossed over to the BJP and had to give up his home constituency of Villianur to the AINRC, broke down before his supporters over being shifted to Mannadipet, and was consoled by them.  The emotional outburst could happen as the aspirant may have invested a lot in getting a party ticket.

22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||As T.N. election heat rises, choppers and special flights see more takers||As the Assembly elections approach, the Chennai airport has been buzzing with helicopters and special flights flying in and out, carrying politicians who travel to campaigns in various districts. Preferred choice Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said there were 161 helicopters and special flights with 77 arrival flights and 84 departure flights at Chennai airport in the last 15 days. In total, over the past two weeks, as many as 228 passengers have travelled through special flights, officials said. A few politicians took helicopters or special flights to places ike Coimbatore, Tiruchi and Madurai for election campaign. “While a few still continue to travel by regular flights, some prefer special flights to save time. They can arrive or depart according to their convenience, depending on the timing of their campaigns. This is definitely more expensive than travelling by regular flights. It could cost anywhere between a minimum of Rs. 1.5 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh, depending on what aircraft is chosen and the facilities,” an official said. Officials said that after COVID-19 and the lockdown, the number of chartered flights arriving in the city had gone up with many passengers coming in from West Asia through such flights. “Usually, whenever elections are approaching, we see a significant increase in the number of helicopter or special flight movements in the airport. This is what has happened this time too. In the coming two weeks, we may see more movements,” another official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/as-tn-election-heat-rises-choppers-and-special-flights-see-more-takers/article34127627.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||University of Madras, CEC will prepare e-learning programmes||The University of Madras has proposed to launch online educational programmes in an effort to integrate digital learning with conventional learning. The university will sign a memorandum with the Consortium for Educational Communication (CEC), an autonomous body in the University Grants Commission, to develop the programmes. The agreement will make the university an affiliate member of the CEC, a nodal agency that uses various communication media for educational programmes. University officials said CEC was one of the largest repositories of digitised educational content in the country and was also the national coordinator for massive open online courses (MOOC) for the Swayam platform. CEC oversees Swayam Prabha DTH channels, offering 11 educational channels in various disciplines. Under the agreement, the university will develop credit-based courses to be offered through MOOCs. It will fast-track the process of developing e-learning programmes and encourage academicians and teachers to prepare digital content for the CEC platform. The university will also use the open educational resources with the CEC to develop in-demand courses. CEC, New Delhi, and the university will jointly offer grouped MOOCs, certifying diploma courses in emerging areas in humanities, social sciences, management and computer science. The University of Madras will co-host the digital content and the e-learning programmes will be delivered through its own learning management systems. Students will be awarded joint certificates and the credits are transferable to the students’ parent institutions. On Monday, University of Madras’ Vice-Chancellor S. Gowri and CEC director Jagat Bhushan Nadda will sign the agreement in the presence of senior officials from both the organisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/university-of-madras-cec-will-prepare-e-learning-programmes/article34127564.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Burglary probe leads to double murder case||The police solved a double murder case in Velachery while investigating a robbery case in Nandanam on Saturday. Six persons have been arrested in connection with the case. The police were interrogating seven persons in connection with a case pertaining to a burglary in a private hospital in Nandanam extension when they came to know about the murders. On March 13, around 10.30 p.m., two men entered a private hospital posing as patients, and robbed 72-year-old doctor Ramakrishnan and four nurses at knifepoint. They fled with 21 sovereigns and Dr. Ramakrishnan’s car. Adyar Deputy Commissioner V. Vikraman formed a special team to investigate the case. They found that the bike used by the burglars belonged to Annadurai, a real estate broker and murder accused. However, his house was locked. Meanwhile, the police traced the doctor’s car to Sivaganga district. Based on information that one of the suspects Rakkappan alias Ravikumar, 42, of Sivaganga, was involved in the crime, the team nabbed him and his five accomplices. During investigation about Annadurai’s vehicle, Rakappan reportedly told the police that they had murdered him and his accomplice Thangapandi and dumped their bodies in a well on Velachery Main Road in Guindy. Based on the information, the police retrieved the bodies. The police said Rakkapan was a contract killer and Annadurai had approached him to murder Murugan, who had defeated his relative in the councillor election. Though Annadurai promised to bail him out, he allegedly did not fulfil the promise. To take revenge, Rakkappan invited Annadurai under the pretext of seeing a plot of land on March 9 but his friend Thangapandi tagged along. Rakkappan and his gang murdered the two and dumped their bodies in the well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/burglary-probe-leads-to-double-murder-case/article34127553.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Restrictions are back in temples||With the sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in the State, the State government has reintroduced restrictions in temples for the safety of devotees and employees. Devotees will be allowed only up to a certain point inside the temple, in queues while maintaining adequate physical distancing. No archanais will be performed and prasadam and theertham (holy water) will not be distributed. The HR and CE Department issued a circular to this effect on Friday to all temples asking them to ensure enforcement of standard operatring procedures, including wearing of masks, frequent use of hand sanitisers, restricting entry of children aged below 10, elders above 60 and pregnant women. “Temple officials have been instructed to consult with health officials of respective local bodies and take necessary precautions. This is pertinent, especially in temples where the Panguni festival is under way,” said an official. Major temples have made arrangements for mobile vaccination points where devotees can use their Aadhaar cards and get free vaccination. Meanwhile, at the Kapaleeswarar Temple in Mylapore, where the annual Panguni festival is on, officials have put in place all these protocols. “We are arranging for masks to be distributed to those not wearing them. The temple is being disinfected at least thrice a day. We are checking temperature of devotees and have arranged to send those with fever to the nearby Corporation dispensary. We have a mobile vaccination van stationed near the Eastern Gopuram,” said a temple source. The temple has urged the various trusts and organisations not to distribute food or buttermilk on streets, including the four Mada streets, Kutcheri Road and Ramakrishna Mutt Road since it could lead to crowding. On March 25, devotees will not be allowed to clamber up the temple car to have a darshan of the deities. Webcast on YouTube Kapaleeswarar temple authorities have made arrangements for live telecast of important events on the temple YouTube channel, including Adhikara Nandhi on Sunday morning, Rishaba Vahanam on March 23, car festival on March 25, Arubathi Moovar festival on March 26 and Tirukalyanam on March 28. Last year due to lockdown restrictions, the rituals related to the festival were held inside the temple with devotees not being allowed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restrictions-are-back-in-temples/article34127629.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Post-merger, bank customers irked by lack of communication||Post-completion of mergers, public sector banks have been making announcements about the change in IFSC codes and other services. However, some customers are complaining about a lack of clear information. Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank were merged with the Union Bank of India. Union Bank recently announced that the IT integration is complete without changing the account numbers, but IFSC codes have been changed. The old IFSC codes will not be valid from April 1, the bank said, and instructed customers to get new cheque books with updated IFSC and MICR codes. The Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) and the United Bank of India were merged with the Punjab National Bank. The PNB said the existing cheque books of the merged banks would be discontinued from April 1 and asked customers to get a new cheque book with new IFSC code and MICR codes. Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank were merged with the Bank of Baroda. On its website, the Bank of Baroda said rumours were being circulated on social media stating that cheques from the merged banks would not be accepted from April 1 and clarified that they would be valid and warned customers not to fall prey to such rumours. It also said customers could obtain new cheque books with updated codes online or via their base branch. The bank also said the debit card of the erstwhile banks could be used till expiry. “I have an account with Dena Bank. We were told that our debit card will be valid till their expiry date even post-merger. But, while I tried making a payment it did not go through. When I called the bank, I was informed that I have to go there and get the card linked to my account, which was changed due to the merger,” Raji Muthukrishnan, an account holder, said. “The banks do not share such information like I have to link the debit card with my updated account number,” she added. Likewise Syndicate Bank was merged with Canara Bank. Based on the information circulated that old cheque books of merged banks would become invalid from April 1, 76-year old K.T. Rajan went to his Syndicate Bank branch for a new cheque book. “I was told that the old cheque book would be valid till June 30. There is complete lack of information and clarity. My concern is that the old cheques should not bounce, which would be a major embarrassment,” he said. The website of Canara Bank says the existing account will not change and already issued cheque books/unused cheque leaves can be continued till further communication. T. Sadagopan, a consumer activist said lack of proper information from banks regarding services and procedures was resulting in a lot of confusion, mainly among senior citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/post-merger-bank-customers-irked-by-lack-of-communication/article34127566.ece

The decision was taken in view of the increase in cases. The Tamil Nadu Medical Students Association opposed the decision and asked the government, the Health Secretary and the Director of Medical Education to grant the internship completion certificate without delay. In a release, it said the internship was coming to an end on March 27. Extending it until May would affect their preparations for post-graduation and competitive examinations. In the past year, house surgeons had taken up all work, including COVID-19 duties. Nearly 30% of them contracted the infection but the government did not grant them any relief. Many were re-infected, it said. It said the government did not consider their contribution during the pandemic and did not grant them any special pay.

22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Will create district with Arani as headquarters’||Chief Minister and AIADMK leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday said a new district, after bifurcating Tiruvannamalai and with Arani as its headquarters, will be created. Campaigning in the Arani Assembly constituency in Tiruvannamalai district, he said the sitting MLA and the AIADMK’s candidate in the constituency, Sevoor S. Ramachandran, had placed the request. ‘Hereditary occupation’ Earlier in the day, Mr. Palaniswami attacked DMK president M.K. Stalin for labelling him a “fake farmer”. The Chief Minister said farming was his “hereditary occupation”. Mr. Stalin spent his time inside an air-conditioned room and had no clue about farming, he added. Campaigning in the Vandavasi Assembly constituency for Paattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) candidate Murali Shankar, Mr. Palaniswami said while political parties had been stating that they would waive off farm loans as an election promise, the State government had already waived off the loans. Listing out a number of measures, Mr. Palaniswami said his government had implemented farm loan waivers benefiting 16.43 lakh farmers; spent Rs. 1,300 crore under the ‘Kudimaramathu’ scheme for better water management; regularly desilted over 40,000 lakes, ponds and other water resources under the PWD Ministry and other local bodies; provided Rs. 2,247 crore as relief to farmers affected by droughts and other natural disasters; and disbursed Rs. 9,300 crore through the crop insurance scheme to farmers. “Though I have done so much, Mr. Stalin calls me a fake farmer... Mr. Stalin wore pants, shirts and shoes to plough farmland... He is the fake farmer. I would remove my shirt and work in the farm. Farming is my hereditary occupation. You are demeaning the farmers with a purpose. Stalin has lived his life in an air-conditioned room. He doesn’t know farming,” he said. The Chief Minister further said the State government would provide land and concrete houses to poor and landless farmers. “Scheduled Caste families will also receive concrete houses,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-create-new-district-with-arani-as-headquarters-cm/article34127578.ece

This time, doctors of the IMH have identified 97 voters on the campus. “Many of them are enthusiastic about voting and are looking forward to polling day. Being in an institute, we made history in 2019. Voting will make them feel empowered. This is because they will understand that their vote will make a difference. Being able to vote in itself is a big boost for many of them,” said P. Poorna Chandrika, director of the IMH, said. A total of 63 men and 34 women, who had voter’s identity cards, were identified. In 2019, doctors of the institute assessed the residents, particularly those who had improved with treatment, to enrol them in the voters list. The Greater Chennai Corporation held a special drive and enrolled some of the residents. Some of the residents, who voted in 2019, were discharged from the institute, she said. In the meantime, the institute plans to hold awareness programmes for these residents. “There will be at least two programmes. One will be held now and the second event closer to polling day. We, along with the Corporation, a college and an NGO, will create awareness among patients on the democratic right to vote, the voting process and the candidates contesting in this constituency — Villivakkam. Like the last time, there will be a demonstration using an electronic voting machine. By creating an environment for all of them, they will be able to understand it better,” she added. A polling booth would be set up at the conference hall in the IMH to enable the residents to cast their votes, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/97-imh-residents-all-set-to-vote-in-assembly-election/article34127562.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||5 students of Madras University suspended||Five students, who had been protesting for the past three days in front of the centenary building, University of Madras, demanding action against the head of the Department of Archaeology, have been suspended. The fourth semester students had alleged that a professor had given them low scores in the internal assessment due to which they had failed in the exams. Re-evaluation demand The students had demanded that their papers be re-evaluated by an external examiner. On March 18, the students staged a sit-in alleging that the HoD had misbehaved with a girl student when she asked the professor about her poor scores. The university has set up a committee to investigate the issue. “The disciplinary committee of the university said the students not only created a nuisance but also misused the premises,” an official said. A senior official said the activities of the students and their behaviour with the university officials had forced them to take the decision. “The students were assessed by another professor in the department but the HoD was being targeted. Besides, the students were behaving rudely with the professor, which the committee found unacceptable. There was no truth in the students’ allegation,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/5-students-of-madras-university-suspended/article34127636.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Why smaller allies release manifestos||Manifestos have come to play a central role in elections. But many voters wonder about the purpose of the manifestos released by smaller parties that make up a political front in Tamil Nadu where coalition governments are unlikely. In recent days, several constituents of the coalitions led by the AIADMK and the DMK have released manifestos, setting forth promises that the alliance leaders have not made. “We need not follow what the leader of the alliance has promised just because we are in the alliance. We have to proclaim our fundamental ideas. When our alliance partner forms the government, we will urge it in the Assembly and in public forums to implement our promises,” says Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri. In fact, the DMK’s allies have advocated prohibition, while the party’s manifesto is silent on the issue. “We have promised total prohibition. When the issue is taken up in the Assembly, we will bring pressure on the government to implement it...,” Mr. Alagiri says.  CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan says every party has to inform the voters of its stand on issues, and the manifesto is a policy statement. He says his party’s manifesto is only talking about persuading the government to implement the promises. In Tamil Nadu, the PMK is probably the first party to have opened a debate on vital issues by presenting shadow budgets. The governments at the Centre and in the State have implemented the PMK’s policies, says K. Balu, PMK candidate for Jayankondam. “We were the first to demand prohibition. If Samacheer Kalvi is being followed in the State, it is because of the PMK. Today, all parties promise a separate budget for agriculture. The PMK presented a shadow budget for agriculture when it was unthinkable,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/why-smaller-allies-release-manifestos/article34127537.ece
22 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP releases booklet on ‘reasons to reject DMK’||The BJP on Sunday released a booklet on “100 reasons to reject the DMK” in the April 6 Assembly election. The booklet includes the DMK’s stand on various issues, including the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, its opposition to the farm laws, the National Education Policy, 2020, and the Sri Lankan Tamils issue. Former DMK deputy general secretary V.P. Duraisamy, who joined the BJP last year, headed the event. The booklet was released by C.T. Ravi, the BJP’s national general secretary in charge of Tamil Nadu. Accusing the DMK of “anti-national activities”, the BJP said DMK president M.K. Stalin in 2018 had said he would support the creation of a “ Dravida Nadu ” if the other southern States were ready for it. The party claimed that Mr. Stalin had floated secessionist ideas. It also accused the DMK and its allies of opposing the abrogation of Article 370 and 35(A). The party said Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) was not present in the Indian map in a video released by DMK youth wing leader Udhayanidhi Stalin. The DMK was against any developmental project in the country, it said, adding that while every political party wanted roads to be built, the DMK was the only one that did not want roads in the State. The BJP cited the DMK’s opposition to the Chennai-Salem expressway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-releases-booklet-on-reasons-to-reject-dmk/article34127576.ece

Stalin on Sunday said India should vote in favour of the United Nations’ resolution against Sri Lanka for its war crimes and human rights violations on March 22. In a statement in Chennai, Mr. Stalin sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to gather the support of other member states and ensure the adoption of the resolution with adequate amendments. “I urge the Prime Minister not to take a stand against the resolution of the United Nations,” he added. Recalling the interviews of Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Jayanath Colombage that India has assured support to his country, Mr. Stalin said Mr. Modi’s silence and his failure to clarify his position had shocked the Sri Lankan Tamils. “Even though External Affairs Minister Jaishankar visited Sri Lanka and Mr. Modi held a telephonic conversation with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, it is not clear whether the UN resolution figured during the discussions. “It is a matter of great concern and pain that the BJP government has allowed the Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary to decide India’s stand. Nine crore Tamils living across the globe will not forgive any attempt to betray the interests of Sri Lankan Tamils,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/support-un-resolution-against-sri-lanka-stalin/article34127591.ece

22 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Manifestos silent on urban local body polls||The promise to hold urban local body (ULB) election finds little mention in manifestos of political parties and one hardly hears about it in campaigns. While the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee makes a promise to hold ULB election in its manifesto, the DMK president M.K. Stalin has promised to hold urban local body election, at least in his campaign and that seems to be the end of it. With the term of last ULB coming to an end in 2016, the AIADMK government has not conducted election. After the DMK approached the judiciary over the State Government’s delimitation and reservation and after the Supreme Court ruling on the issue, the Government conducted election in two phases for rural local bodies in December 2019. The people’s expectation was that the State Government would follow it up with election to ULBs but that did not happen, COVID-19 pandemic being cited as one of the reasons for the delay. Now with the Assembly election only a fortnight away, the people’s expectation was that the political parties would come out in the open and talk about it. The DMK manifesto, while making several promises like not increasing property tax, is silent on the conduct of ULB election. DMK leaders in Coimbatore said, on condition of anonymity, that though the party had not mentioned it in its manifesto, party president M.K. Stalin had spoken about it in his campaigns and the party would conduct election on returning to power. AIADMK sources, too, made similar assurances. The AIADMK government was ready to conduct election but the COVID-19 pandemic came in the way. If the party were to return to power, it would hold the election. A senior politician, however, said the AIADMK or DMK conducting ULB election depended on how much they got. If one of the two got a brute majority in the Assembly, it would become confident on holding the election as the calculation would be that it could ride on the victory wave to win local bodies as well. If one of the two had a wafer-thin majority or was forced to seek the support of allies to secure a majority in the Assembly, then it would be doubtful, the politician added. That the State Government had failed to conduct the ULB election had impacted people in that they found it difficult to have their day-to-day grievances related to civic amenities redressed, said consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon. Besides, the Government giving special officer (elected council) powers to the commissioners had placed the officers in a position that they had both, the power of executive as well as legislature. And, this had led to an opaque administration, particularly in Coimbatore, where the people were in dark about council resolutions, he pointed out and added that political parties should come out in the open and promise to hold ULB election within a specific time-frame.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manifestos-silent-on-urban-local-body-polls/article34127608.ece
22 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Industries plan vaccination camps||On Friday, as many as 365 staff and workers of Pricol took the vaccination against COVID -19 at a special camp organised on the factory’s premises, by the company jointly with the Directorate of Health Services. Vanitha Mohan, Executive Director of Pricol, told The Hindu the vaccination option was given to the workers and staff, and those who came forward to take it were ensured that their underlying health conditions were under control. The company organised the camp on a weekend and those who took the vaccination had the weekend to take rest. This did not affect the production schedule at the plant, she said. “We spoke to the union leaders and they engaged with the workers. Those who are involved in field work have the risk of exposure to the virus,” she said. The company is looking at more such camps to cover more workers. The Block Medical Officer of Dhaliyur and a team of doctors and para medical personnel participated and “it was a well organised drive,” she said. Deputy Director of Health Services G. Ramesh Kumar said 200 vaccine doses were allotted to employees of a private firm in Coimbatore district after it approached for mass vaccination. The doses were given through a primary health centre. He said the vaccine was given to employees who came under the age category for the ongoing phase II vaccination drive – people between 45-59 years with 20 specific comorbidities and those aged above 60. According to him, the firm was allotted vaccine doses as it employs a large number of workers. The Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association had also requested the Health Department to arrange mass vaccination for hotel workers, he said. “Vaccination drives were conducted for employees in treasury and in some banks too. These are places where a large number of people visit every day and vaccinating the staff can reduce chances of disease spread. Health officials have also been asked to identify key market areas for similar drives,” he said. Some of the large-scale industries and industrial clusters here are exploring the possibility for such mass vaccination drives. “One challenge in textile mills is that the workers stay in hostels inside the mill and if a number of them are unable to return to work after the vaccination, it will affect production. If such a camp is organised, it has to be well-planned,” said a senior executive of a textile mill here. “We had given the Codissai Trade Fair complex for CIVID-19 centre. It can be used to organise camps for MSME owners and their family members and workers too,” said MV Ramesh Babu, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-plan-vaccination-camps/article34127604.ece

In a memorandum to the Chief Electoral Officer, chairman of the council A. Sakthivel said that if the vehicle has e-way bill, shipping bill, foreign invoice, exporter identity etc., the authorities should not detain the vehicle.  Time-bound Exports are time-bound and once the goods are moved from the factory warehouses, they should reach the port on time to connect the vessels as scheduled, he said. Also, the export goods once inspected and sealed from the factory should not be opened en route to the port as per export norms. Recently one of the garment exporters had an issue in Chennai as the goods moving to Thoothukudi port were detained by the flying squad for a few hours despite showing all the export documents.

Rather than addressing the needs of specific Assembly constituencies, the parties should look at needs of the entire district.

The Forest Department arranged an awareness session for residents of tribal settlement and visitors at Baralikadu eco-tourism centre on Sunday. Karamadai Forest Range Officer E.N. Manoharan said residents of the tribal settlement were acknowledged for their service in preventing forest fire, the main destructor of protected forest patches. “Illegal felling of trees is not happening in protected forest areas nowadays. Trees and shrubs which are crucial in a forest ecosystem are mainly lost in forest fires. Tribal people continue to be guardians of these forests along with the Forest Department. They were further sensitised to the need to protect the forests,” he said. Rangan, chief of tribal settlement, planted a sapling at the eco-tourism centre in the presence of forest staff and 150 people who visited the place on Sunday. Saplings The ENVIS Centre on Forest Genetic Resources and Tree Improvement at the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, Coimbatore (IFGTB ENVIS), observed the International Day of Forests by planting over 300 tree saplings at the Panampully field research station of IFGTB near Palakkad.

22 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Monitoring helps understand behavioural patterns of jumbos||The profiling and monitoring of wild elephants in Coimbatore Forest Division has helped the Forest Department identify crucial behavioural patterns of the pachyderms. The Department has been monitoring the elephant population and incidents of them straying from forest boundaries in seven forest ranges of the division. It was found that the division witnessed more incidents of elephants entering farmlands and human habitations during the seasonal migration. I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle, said the elephants come to Coimbatore division from larger landscapes including Nilambur elephant population in Kerala. It was found that some male elephants were recruiting female elephants and younger males for crop raids. Number of crop raids in places such as Anaikatti reduced after some of the long-standing crop raider males, including those nicknamed Vinayagan and Chinna Thambi, were captured and translocated. The male elephant which was killed after being hit by a train near Walayar recently was also identified as an individual which used to recruit other elephants for crop raids. Its profile was done based on movement and behavioural patterns several months ago. However, male population in the division was assessed to be healthy and increasing as more numbers of tuskers and calves were seen during monitoring in all forest ranges. According to Mr. Anwardeen, incidents of crop raiding were present in the past too. However, these incidents did not raise concern due to low density of human habitations near forest boundaries, he said. “Elephants are believed to have this bio-geographical understanding and they move towards good grazing areas and places where water is available. Population from the western side of the Western Ghats will move towards the eastern side and rain shallow areas like Coimbatore forest division from September to December ahead of the Northeast monsoon,” he said. The officer added that the forest division would soon come out with crucial findings of the elephant population based on the daily monitoring and profiling of male elephants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/monitoring-helps-understand-behavioural-patterns-of-jumbos/article34127622.ece

Speaking at a public meeting in support of party candidate Pandi at Begumpur late on Saturday, he said the inefficiency of the AIADMK government had been exposed in every department. The State administration was engaged in corruption. Under his leadership, Mr. Palaniswami had permitted a blanket order for his Ministers and others to loot. The COVID-19 management was a classic example where the government and its administrators had been exposed for their inefficiency, Mr. Balakrishnan alleged. The Ministers indulged in sand mining and had amassed several thousand crores. Considering these aspects, people should defeat them in such a way that the DMK-led combine swept the polls by winning all 234 seats, the CPI(M) leader told voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ruling-aiadmk-dancing-to-bjps-tune-cpim/article34127631.ece
22 March 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||‘People believe govt. as it has delivered on its promises’||Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) leader G.K. Vasan, in an interview, rejected opinion polls predicting a win for the DMK-led alliance in the Assembly election. An ally of the AIADMK, he insisted that people believe the government has delivered on its promises. Edited excerpts:  In the 2016 Assembly election and the last Parliamentary election, you were firm that the TMC must contest on an independent symbol. Now you have compromised on it and agreed to contest on the AIADMK’s ‘two leaves’ symbol. Why? The TMC’s preferred symbol has been the ‘cycle’ [which it first got in 1996]. We have been trying very hard to get this symbol from the Election Commission of India and the court, but did not succeed. We had to fight till the last minute for getting the symbol. Candidates should not encounter difficulties because of this, and we don’t want to waste our seats and potential, [for which] we have had to move to the prominent symbol of the alliance partner so that we [can] enter the Assembly. During seat sharing talks, you were insisting till the last minute that you want 12 seats. Why did you settle for six? All parties don’t get the seats they want. Ultimately, in an alliance, we have to settle for a number that is favourable for both parties so that the alliance starts moving in the right direction towards the election. Did you explore the possibility of the TMC being part of an alternative front? That was not needed this time as we were clearly in the AIADMK alliance from 2019. The TMC was the first party to support the Chief Ministerial candidate [Edappadi K. Palaniswami] when his name was announced by the Deputy Chief Minister. What role do you think the MNM, the AMMK and the Naam Tamizhar Katchi will play this election? In previous elections, these parties have registered a percentage of votes. I am not underestimating them. Their vote share may go up or down a little. Hence, a big impact may not be possible. What gives you the confidence that the AIADMK-led NDA will win this election? The alliance today seems to be a popular winning alliance. In 10 years of governance, its welfare schemes and development projects have reached the people, from cities to villages. People believe the government as it has done what it promised. All opinion polls have predicted a win for the DMK-led alliance... Opinion polls are not the final poll, as public opinion keeps changing till people cast their votes. Opposition parties are accusing the AIADMK of being subservient to the BJP. Is there a basis to that? Any ruling party has the responsibility, which the Opposition does not — it is answerable to the people for welfare schemes, law and order and receiving funds from the Central government for various initiatives. Hence, maintaining a striking balance with the Centre is essential, which the AIADMK has been doing. Unfortunately, this responsibility is not there for the DMK, and hence, it opposes the ruling government and makes such accusations. What is your primary charge against the DMK? They have not been in power for 10 years. Before that too, they never got enough numbers. I don’t want to accuse them personally. Let the people judge as I am not an AIADMK member, but only an alliance partner. Prices of fuel and LPG have gone up significantly. But BJP leaders say that this will not have an impact on the election... Price rise is a concern and I know the sentiments of the people. People will also understand that price rise is a temporary issue, and the government will bring it back to normalcy. Unfortunately, it is happening during the election, and [we hope] the people will believe us and vote for us. In the TMC’s manifesto, you have promised full prohibition. But the AIADMK government failed to take steps towards this... Every party has its own goal and being in an alliance, we cannot leave out our goals in our manifesto. After coming to power, full prohibition may not be possible immediately. But we want it to be done in a phased manner. How do you see the State government’s administration after the demise of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa? After her death, the State government, under the leadership of Mr. Palaniswami, did extremely well in the last four years, particularly in handling the pandemic, its consequent economic crisis and cyclone rehabilitation. How do you see the overall scenario in the State? After 10 years of the AIADMK government, I see a lot of enthusiasm among the people in greeting the alliance parties. It shows that anti-incumbency, which the DMK talks about after 10 years, is considerably low.  Price rise is a concern and I know the sentiments of the people. People will also understand that it is a temporary issue||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-believe-govt-as-it-has-delivered-on-its-promises/article34127550.ece

Murugan of Mannadimangalam says water release gets delayed due to ‘pressure’ from few political leaders. “Public Works Department (PWD) officials release water for irrigation in favour of powerful politicians,” he says. For long, farmers of Alanganallur have been demanding to desilt the Sathaiyar dam which will help fill tanks in 10 villages. With good rainfall in catchment areas this year, the storage was good but not sufficient to fill all the tanks and the water level receded too soon, says K. Palani of Alanganallur. “No elected representative has taken any initiative to desilt the dam. We’ve been demanding that a pipeline must be laid near Andipatti bungalow to bring the Vaigai waters to the dam,” he says. Cane procurement Sugarcane cultivation, which is considered to be relatively profitable, has declined over the years. The National Cooperative Sugar Mills in Alanganallur has not procured cane for crushing from farmers this year, resulting in severe distress for the farmers. Since Alanganallur-Palamedu belt is awash with mango orchards, there is a demand to set up a mango processing unit here. With agriculture being the main vocation, people here also look for other job opportunities. The textile park at Vadipatti predominantly employs women on a contract basis. M. Britto, Chairman of the Textile Park, says local bodies must dispose waste generated from the textile park in a proper manner, and must also ensure regular supply of water. The incomplete overbridge near Sholavandan railway station is another main issue. “The delay in completion of the bridge work results in vehicle pile-up and chaos on either side of the raailway gate on Vadipatti road whenever a train crosses,” says M. Sainithii of Sholavandan. Palamedu and Alanganallur, the two prominent places where jallikattu events are held, falls under this Assembly segment. With jallikattu being a major influencing factor among voters, leaders of major political parties express their support in conducting the event. This was evident during the jallikattu this year amid COVID-19 pandemic when various political leaders attended the event. The constituency has a good number of Scheduled Caste voters. While All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has fielded sitting MLA K. Manickam, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has fielded A. Venkatesan. Makkal Needhi Maiam has fielded S. Yoganathan and Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam has fielded M. Jayalakshmi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/this-green-expanse-has-some-thorny-issues/article34127908.ece

22 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Prove graft charges or tender apology’||Former Chief Minister and senior Congress leader V. Narayanasamy on Sunday reiterated his challenge to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to either prove corruption charges levelled against him at an election rally in Karaikal or tender a public apology. Addressing a press conference at the Puducherry PCC office, Mr. Narayanasamy said Mr. Shah had levelled wholly baseless accusations that he had given “cut money” to the Gandhi family from the Rs. 15,000 crore Central funds allocated for the Union Territory while addressing a rally on February 28. “I am ready to face any probe into this as the allegation is unfounded,” he said. Mr. Narayanasamy said it was ironical that the BJP, “which came to power on a pack of lies” and believed that “a lie repeated constantly would become truth” had the other day brought out what they called a chargesheet against him and the government he had headed. V. Vaithilingam, MP, said as the former Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi with the aid of the Centre had reduced the Congress Government to a powerless entity, the blame for any financial wrong-doing as was being alleged, would squarely rest on the Lt. Governor and top officials. Mr. Narayanasamy added that voters in Puducherry are well aware that the BJP would implement anti-people and anti-development programmes if voted to power in Puducherry. People in Puducherry would never elect a party that exploits communal sentiments, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prove-graft-charges-or-apologise-says-former-puducherry-cm/article34127590.ece

22 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Status of nominations corrected on CEO site||Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Shurbir Singh on Sunday said the CEO website had shown some nominations of candidates as both “rejected” and “accepted”. This was because of the erroneous classification of the secondary application of the same candidate, he said. Of the two incidents that drew widespread confusion and consternation during the scrutiny of nominations on Saturday, the nomination of Congress candidate Ramesan Parambath in Mahe was shown as rejected though his primary nomination affidavit had been accepted. In another instance, BJP candidate in Kalapet P.M.L. Kalyanasundaram’s nomination was displayed as rejected in one uploaded entry and accepted in another. As it stands, the nomination of both candidates have been accepted. ‘Erroneously displayed’ “As candidates submit more than one set of papers as back up, once the party symbol is allotted in the prescribed form, only one nomination is counted as accepted. The secondary nomination paper of the same candidate was erroneously displayed as rejected. We are scrubbing the error on the site,” Mr. Singh said. Meanwhile, Mahe Returning Officer Shivraj Meena issued a press note stating that Mr. Parambath, a Congress candidate, had filed two nomination papers and both the nomination papers were found in order and accepted after scrutiny.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/status-of-nominations-corrected-on-ceo-site/article34127715.ece

22 March 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Fresh faces battle for Veerapandi seat||Veerapandi, a Vanniyar dominated constituency, is set to see a stiff battle between the major Dravidian parties that have fielded fresh faces. While the DMK has fielded A.K. Tharun, son-in-law of former DMK leader Veerapandi S. Arumugam’s son Chezhiyan, the AIADMK has fielded M.Raja, an M.G.R. Mandram functionary. Giving tough fight to both the parties is the AMMK-led alliance candidate S.K.Selvam, who has tasted success in 2011 elections in the AIADMK ticket. The Indhiya Jananayaka Katchi has fielded Amutha Rajeshwaran. Agriculture, weaving and silver jewellery manufacturing are the major occupations in the region. Rejuvenation of Panamarathupatti Lake is one of the long-pending demands of the farmers, who have also expressed stiff opposition to the Salem-Chennai green corridor project. The lake spread over 2,000 acres was once a major water source in the district and an attractive shooting spot during the M.G.R era. Encroachments on the water channels to the Panamarathupatti Lake and overgrowth of Seemai Karuvelam trees are the major problems. River Thirumanimutharu, which flows through the constituency, is heavily polluted due to discharge of sewage and untreated effluents from dyeing units. A road was recently laid in Jaragumalai, and the villagers have now demanded basic amenities including a ration shop. Weavers are hoping that the next government would offer them incentives to improve and support their trade, as they were severely affected due to COVID-19 pandemic. While DMK has promised a textile park in the region, the AIADMK has assured weavers that loans up to Rs. 1 lakh would be waived and steps would be taken to control yarn price.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fresh-faces-battle-for-veerapandi-seat/article34127734.ece
22 March 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||A battle of Dravidian parties in Salem West||Salem West constituency is set to witness a tough fight between the Dravidian fronts during the upcoming Assembly elections. While Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) candidate R. Arul will be contesting in the constituency, representing the AIADMK-front, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has fielded party functionary Selathampatti A.Rajendran. Former DMDK legislator Alagapuram R.Mohanraj is contesting in DMDK ticket, throwing up a strong fight to both the fronts. Vanniyars form the major vote base in the constituency, eyeing which PMK is hoping a major victory in Salem West. The incumbent legislator G.Venkatachalam is contesting from Salem North constituency this elections. The constituency includes parts of Salem Corporation. The major complaints of the residents are traffic congestion in arterial roads and lack of waste management measures at the Chettichavadi dump yard. The Salem Steel Plant located in the constituency is another deciding factor of winning here. Staff of the Plant reside in its vicinity and all Trade Unions here have strongly opposed the move to privatise the Steel Plant and demanded that it should be retained as a PSU. The Unions have also been demanding better use of the excess land of the Plant. Silver anklet manufacturing is another major industry in the region. Manufacturers complain that the introduction of Goods and Services Tax has severely affected the prospects of the industry and have been demanding a welfare board for the workers.  The IT Park set up during the DMK regime has not seen any major development under the present regime. Coir industry has been severely affected due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Coir rope manufacturers lamented that though the price of coir pith has increased, they get only Rs. 30 to Rs. 32 for a kilo of rope. They have demanded subsidies in power charges, incentives and subsidised loans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-battle-of-dravidian-parties-in-salem-west/article34127732.ece

However, when the officials demanded documentary proof, she could not submit it. Unconfirmed reports said Income Tax department officials from Madurai also visited the premises.

22 March 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||Black flag protest against AIADMK candidate||A large number of villagers from Vallaramapuram in Sankarankoil Assembly constituency staged a black flag demonstration here on Sunday. When the villagers came to know that the sitting MLA and minister V M Rajalakshmi of the AIADMK was about to come there for campaign, they gathered there. As the information reached the police also, they rushed to the spot. When the AIADMK functionaries led by Ms. Rajalakshmi arrived at Vallaramapuram, the villagers showed black flags under the banner of ‘Anaithu Maravar Nala Kootamaipu.’ Though she volunteered to listen to their grievances, the villagers insisted that she should immediately leave their village. When some of them blocked the vehicles from proceeding further, the police intervened and ensured that there was no hindrance to smooth flow of traffic. When the police warned the agitators of tough action, they dispersed. The minister and her supporters moved to the next village. The presence of police ensured that there was no untoward incident. Speaking to reporters, the kootamaipu representatives said that the State government had meted out in injustice to their community by giving 10.5 % reservation to the Vanniyars. They said that they had been demanding inclusion in the Most Backward Classes category but the government or the Chief Minister or the Minister representing them had not taken it up seriously. The State government was accommodating the demands of Vanniyars with an eye on their vote bank, they said. The AIADMK functionaries said that they had taken up the representation with Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami. It will be done when the government comes back to power, they said and added that the minister had promised to meet a delegation of the Kootamaipu on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/black-flag-protest-against-aiadmk-candidate/article34128050.ece

22 March 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Intense contest on the cards in dry Kovilpatti||The Kovilpatti Assembly segment is all set to witness an intense electoral battle, with Information Minister Kadambur C. Raju facing off against AMMK founder T.T.V. Dhinakaran and K. Srinivasan of the CPI(M), who is the candidate of the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance. As the soil of this rain-shadow region is suitable for groundnut cultivation, Kovilpatti, the second largest town in Thoothukudi district, is known for manufacturing kadalai mittai and has even earned a geographical indication (GI) tag for the superior quality of the product. Besides, the match industry provides livelihood to many families, even as the sector has been undergoing automation. Spinning mills get their raw material — cotton — from this region, and the firecracker manufacturing units also ensure regular income for the locals. Though agriculture is the predominant occupation here, the residents cultivate only rain-fed crops like groundnut, maize, green gram and black gram due to scanty rainfall. With a broad base of labourers from these sectors, the Kovilpatti constituency is naturally close to the heart of the CPI, which has won this segment in seven out of 15 elections. While the AIADMK has reposed its faith in Mr. Raju for the third consecutive time since 2011, though he won the 2016 poll by just 428 votes, the DMK shied away from challenging the Minister directly and has given the seat to it ally. What has surprised many is Mr. Dhinakaran throwing his hat into the ring. While the presence of a large number of voters from the Mukkulathor community in Kovilpatti after delimitation is being seen as his strength, there is a school of thought that it may be a disadvantage for him. “If the Mukkulathor voters come to be seen as backing Mr. Dhinakaranen masse, it will lead to the polarisation of voters from other communities. This could favour Mr. Raju or Mr. Srinivasan, both of whom belong to the Naicker community. My presumption is that Mr. Srinivasan could get the support of voters from other communities,” says Surya Xavier, a political analyst. He says that three murders with caste overtones, which rocked this otherwise peaceful town in recent years, have disturbed peace-loving voters. “So, they will vote against any caste polarisation,” he says. Unlike the high-profile candidates of the AIADMK and the AMMK, Mr. Srinivasan is regarded as a commoner. When the 2016 Assembly poll witnessed a three-cornered fight between the AIADMK, the DMK and the DMDK-led People’s Welfare Front, the contest was close. Since the Left has a sizeable presence and the MDMK, which polled 28,512 votes in 2016, are now in the DMK-led front, Mr. Srinivasan’s supporters hope this will work to his advantage. However, Mr. Raju believes it will be a “hat-trick victory” for him. Those backing Mr. Dhinakaran believe he will be able to spring a surprise just like he did in the 2017 bypoll in R.K. Nagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/intense-contest-on-the-cards-in-dry-kovilpatti/article34127544.ece
22 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Fear of COVID-19 spread far from over a year later||On March 22, 2020, a young foreign traveller landed at the Tiruchi International Airport days before the COVID-19 lockdown was announced by the Central government. The traveller turned out to be the district's first COVID-19 positive patient. A year after the first case was detected, health officials have again stepped up their appeals to the public to continue to follow COVID-19 protocol as the pandemic is far from over. For K. Vanitha, Dean, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, the year was one of resilience. Healthcare workers went from knowing very little about COVID-19 to becoming experts on how to detect and treat the infection, she said. "Many of us had only read about RT-PCR tests in textbooks as students. For the first few weeks, we were fully dependent upon King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research, Chennai," she said. In three months, a team of doctors and nurses were able to understand the pattern of the infection, and how to effectively treat it. "At the Department of Microbiology, K.A.P Viswanatham Government Medical College, approval was given by the Indian Council of Medical Research to conduct RT-PCR tests from March 24. With just one machine and a few technicians, the Department of Microbiology could do just 100 tests a day, now at least 3,000 samples are processed every day. "Within a year, we have become specialists," said K. Lakshmi, Associate Professor, Department of Microbiology. S.N. Jayabharathi, Nursing Superintendent, MGMGH and joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Nurses Association, is of the opinion that the pandemic helped highlight the quality of government healthcare facilities. With the slight increase in COVID-19 over the last few weeks, Dr. Vanitha issued cautions to the public to remain alert.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fear-of-covid-19-spread-far-from-over-a-year-later/article34127708.ece

22 March 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Forest Dept. readying kraal to capture, treat Rivaldo||The Forest Department is readying a kraal in Vazhaithottam village in The Nilgiris to capture an injured wild elephant named Rivaldo, inhabiting the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. The Madras High Court had recently said: “As far as Rivaldo is concerned…the only purpose [for assisting the animal] is to provide healing to his chopped trunk which impedes his food intake and to take care of the impaired vision in one eye. The State reports that Rivaldo is now doing well and the State does not intend to keep Rivaldo in captivity for any great length of time.” The order pointed out that the government had agreed to release Rivaldo after treatment. “We are building the kraal (a structure made of wood to restrict the movement of an elephant and used to tame captured wild elephants) in full view of Rivaldo, who has been with our team of forest staff for the last five days,” said L.C.S. Srikanth, Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone). According to him, Rivaldo was finding it difficult to eat and had impaired vision for which he would be treated inside the kraal. When asked to confirm if Rivaldo would be released following treatment, Mr. Srikanth said that it was a distinct possibility that Rivaldo could become acclimatised to a life in captivity if he is treated for a prolonged period of time within the kraal. Mr. Srikanth refused to categorically state that Rivaldo would be released into the wild. He said he was yet to receive the court order. The Nilgiris-based conservationist, N. Mohanraj, claimed there was nothing wrong with the physical health of Rivaldo. “An elephant can be rehabilitated. It only requires the dedication of the Forest Department to ensure that people stop feeding it,” said Mr. Mohanraj. If Rivaldo is removed from the wild, “a unique Asian elephant, noted for his size and capable of emerging as one of the dominant males in the region, would be removed from the genetic pool of wild elephants.” “Even if the elephant is unwell, it is unnecessary to intervene in what is a natural process. In the past, it was standard practice to not even take care of elephant calves that were abandoned. This sets a very bad precedent,” added another conservationist. He wondered whether all elephants which get injured in the wild would now be considered for capture. When contacted, Field Director of MTR K.K. Kaushal, said that the department would take a call on whether or not to capture Rivaldo once they received and interpreted the order of the Madras High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-dept-readying-kraal-to-capture-treat-rivaldo/article34127626.ece

22 March 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Water scarcity a major issue in Virudhunagar||Fulfillment of a long-felt need for a government medical college in Virudhunagar district is one of the biggest achievements of the ruling party. The college, hospital and hostel buildings are coming up at a faster pace on the premises of the Collectorate. However, the state of infrastructure in the district headquarters, which falls under Virudhunagar Assembly constituency, leaves much to be desired. Daily drinking water supply is a distant dream what with water being distributed once in five days. Lack of proper distribution lines has affected implementation of the Tamirabharani combined drinking water scheme. Two overhead tanks, constructed as part of centenary celebrations of Virudhunagar municipality, are yet to be put to use as distribution pipelines have not been laid by the local body for nearly three years. As a result, tail-end areas of the town get little or inadequate supply. Despite good rainfall this year, Anaikuttam dam, which has been the main source of drinking water for the town, remains dry, thanks to inordinate delay in setting right its defunct shutters. As against its storage capacity of 125.75 mcft, the dam has no water. A proposal to renovate the nine shutters and construct three new spillways at a cost of Rs. 23.5 crore has not taken shape Another major need of the town, the road over bridge on Ramamurthy Road has been completed after prolonged legal tussle. “I took special interest in completing the bridge,” said sitting MLA A.R.R. Seenivasan of DMK. Similarly, he took credit for completion of a railway underpass on Allampatti. He claims that a second combined drinking water project with Tamirabharani as source has been sanctioned after his repeated demands to the government. Mr. Seenivasan, who is a two-time MLA from the constituency, has been fielded again by DMK and he is pitted against a new comer from BJP, G. Panduragan. Mr. Pandurangan, an industrialist, says he was attracted by several good schemes initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and he will strive to implement those that have not reached the people. “Being in construction industry, I have seen many remote areas in the constituency lacking proper road connectivity. I have received a number complaints on drinking water and drainage issues.” Mr. Seenivasan says that he will strive to bring a government arts and science college and a law college to Virudhunagar. Long distance buses avoiding the town and bad roads are major complaints. Lack of bus connectivity to railway station is putting passengers to a lot of inconvenience. Adding to the intense competition is Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam candidate G. Thangaraj. He believes that his hard work during the COVID-19 pandemic by way of distribution of welfare assistance to over 68,000 families will make him a strong contender. Other candidates in the fray are N. Manimaran of All India Samathuva Makkal Katchi and V.R. Selvakumar of Naam Tamilar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-scarcity-a-major-issue-in-virudhunagar/article34127721.ece
22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK hopes to continue its winning streak||Having tasted victory in all the four Assembly elections held from 2001, the AIADMK hopes to continue its winning streak at Udumalpet Assembly constituency with the renomination of Minister of Animal Husbandry Udumalai K. Radhakrishnan. Mr. Radhakrishnan won in Udumalpet constituency in 2016 with a margin of 5,687 votes. However, his victory margin was lower when compared to that of incumbent Assembly Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman, who won with a margin of 44,560 votes from Udumalpet in 2011. Former AIADMK Minister C. Shanmugavelu won in 2006 and 2001 from Udumalpet Assembly constituency. The incumbent Animal Husbandry Minister will face K. Thennarasu from Congress, who has been fielded from the DMK front for Udumalpet constituency that has an electorate of nearly 2.7 lakh voters. A verdant constituency situated close to the Western Ghats, Udumalpet is also one of the oldest constituencies in Tiruppur district which has seen 15 Assembly elections since 1952. The constituency has a Government Arts College established in 1971 and the construction works for Veterinary College and Research Institute at Pannaikinaru village in Udumalpet taluk are under way. CPI(M)’s urban secretary for Udumalpet K. Dhandapani alleged that many promises made during 2016 Assembly elections were not kept, such as expansion of Udumalpet Bus Terminus and improvement of facilities at Udumalpet Government Hospital. He also alleged poor maintenance of underground drainage and roads in the municipality limits. In November 2020, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced during his visit to Tiruppur that the State government will allocate Rs. 50 crore for Udumalpet Municipality to improve the infrastructure of the historically important town. According to the municipal officials, the municipality received funds totalling Rs. 48.81 crore from the State government and the works to provide additional infrastructural facilities began on February 24. According to the tribal rights activist S. Thanraj, about 15 tribal settlements are present in Udumalpet within the Anamalai Tiger Reserve. However, basic facilities such as roads, electricity, drinking water, education and healthcare have not been accessible to the tribal people. He gave the example of C. Sreedevi, a girl from Poochukottamparai tribal settlement who goes to Thrissur in Kerala for her education and scored an ‘A-plus’ in the Kerala SSLC examinations held in 2020. “The educational aspirations of other girls like her are being lost,” Mr. Thanraj said, owing to the lack of access to schools for tribal children in Udumalpet. The residents of tribal settlements such as Kurumalai, Kattupatti, Mavaduppu and Kulipatti are still not allowed to vote for local body elections despite multiple representations made to the district administration in the past, Mr. Thanraj said. Even for Assembly elections, while the settlements are located near Udumalpet taluk, their Assembly constituency would be Kinathukadavu in Coimbatore district, for which adequate transport facilities are not available to them to reach their polling stations, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-hopes-to-continue-its-winning-streak/article34127607.ece

Last year, doctors who were diverted to the city when the cases peaked worked there for three months, he said. The TNGDA said in the letter that only doctors — of any cadre, health directorate and post-graduate course — who were willing should be diverted. Such doctors could accept the diversion through the proper channel and the TNGDA office-bearers. Dr. Senthil said promotion and transfer counselling was held but orders were not issued on account of the election. “Counselling is a routine activity, and the government should have sought permission from the Election Commission of India to issue the orders. If the government can divert doctors, why can’t it issue the orders?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/association-opposes-diversion-of-doctors/article34127585.ece

Ashok said in Chabbi village in Dharwad district on Sunday. He was speaking to journalists after spending the night in the village as part of the programme. “Usually, the common man feels hesitant to meet and talk to senior officers such as Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner or even the Tahsildar. We want to facilitate communication between the people and the government by making the government more sensitive and by taking administration to the doorsteps of the people,’’ he said. Grama Vastavya happens on the third Saturday of every month. The programme is on in 270 places across the State and senior officers will be participating. On those days, only clerks will be manning the offices, he said. He asked officers to involve all legislators, including those from the Opposition parties, in the programme. The Minister had breakfast in the home of farm worker Shekavva Kale and visited houses in the Dalit colony where he had tea. He went for a walk in the morning and spoke to youth and women. He received several applications and asked officers to dispose them of on the spot. Deputy Commissioner Nitesh Patil and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/village-stay-programme-creating-communication-channels-ashok/article34127752.ece
22 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Bypoll: Will the two Jarkiholis campaign?||The sex CD scandal allegedly involving Ramesh Jarkiholi, BJP MLA, seems to have created confusion among BJP workers about the involvement of the brothers in the Belagavi Lok Sabha bypolls on April 17. It seems the Jarkiholi brothers, Mr. Ramesh who has been directly implicated and his brother Balachandra Jarkiholi, are busy in damage control post the break out of the scandal. “They may not find enough time and resources for the bypoll campaign. This vacancy at the top is worrying the party,” said a leader. Though Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced in Maski, Raichur, on Saturday that Mr. Ramesh will be among the “star campaigners” for the Belagavi bypoll, party workers in are unsure if it will work on ground. Party insiders say that nominating a family member of the late Suresh Angadi, whose death necessitated the bypoll, might help in this context, as it would reduce some burden on the party and help it benefit from the sympathy factor, though there are reservations about “dynasty politics”. ‘Will affect chances’ However, supporters of Mr. Ramesh say moving the brothers out of the campaign team would affect the party’s chances. “If Mr. Ramesh and Mr. Balachandra are not be in the frontlines during the campaign, it will hit us badly,” said Bhimshi Bharamannanavar, BJP yuva morcha leader, closely associated with Mr. Ramesh. “The Jarkiholi brothers have a strong network of supporters across the district, who know that the CD case is a conspiracy against the family,” Mr. Bharamannanavar insisted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bypoll-will-the-two-jarkiholis-campaign/article34127511.ece

22 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No PPE kits, sanitisers for PHC staff||When Shravan Subbaiah (name changed) went to a primary health centre (PHC) near J.P. Nagar to get an RT-PCR test done, he was shocked to see that not a single healthcare worker there was wearing a PPE (personal protective equipment) kit. Equally worrying was the lack of social distancing at the clinic. “Those who had reported to the centre to get tested were standing close to each other, and were huddled around a healthcare worker, who was noting down their details. It is no surprise then that the city’s case load is seeing an increase,” he said. With the surge in the number of positive cases, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has increased the target for testing in the city. By Monday, the civic body hopes to increase the number of tests to 50,000 a day. The target for vaccinations has also been enhanced. However, a visit to a few PHCs in different zones of the city revealed that healthcare workers in these facilities do not have proper safety gear. Many staff members who were recruited for COVID-19 duty said they had not received their salaries for two months. Mallikarjuna N. (name changed), a swab collector at a PHC in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone, had only a face shield and an N95 mask that he has already washed several times. Along with a pair of gloves, this was the only protection he had on while he took swabs from people who could potentially be infected. “We have not even been given sanitisers. We buy that ourselves. We have not received PPE kits for nearly two months now,” he said. His colleagues, too, were working under similar conditions. The COVID-19 duty doctor at the PHC, for instance, had not been given a surgical mask. Reusing kits At another PHC in the West zone, Akshay Devaraj (name changed) said that they sometimes reused the PPE kits. “When the cases crossed 3,000 a day, the BBMP used to send PPE kits, masks, sanitisers and gloves regularly. When the cases dropped, so did the regular supply. Though we send indents for these materials, it is never fulfilled,” he said. Every day, around 200 RT-PCR tests are performed by the healthcare workers in this PHC coming under Dasarahalli zone. Though the staff there claimed they had the requisite materials, when The Hindu visited the facility, the staff were only wearing surgical masks, and some had lowered these masks as well.  Delayed salaries Many health workers also complained of delayed payments. “Salaries for November and December were disbursed in February. I am struggling to pay rent,” said Mallikarjuna, the swab collector at a PHC in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone. Data entry operators and Group D workers also said that they have not been paid for the past two months. Jayanthi Babu (name changed), a Group D worker in a PHC in Bengaluru’s West zone, said she was the sole bread winner and had borrowed money to buy provisions to feed her family of four. When contacted, BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, however, claimed that there was no shortage of either PPE kits or other safety gear. He maintained that the civic body has been distributing the safety gear to all 141 PHCs coming under it. “These must be isolated cases. I will check and look into it,” he said.  “We have not even been given sanitisers. We buy that ourselves. We have not received PPE kits for nearly two months now.

22 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Second wave of COVID-19 infections threatens tourism prospects again||Summer holidays, the longest for school and college students and their families, command peak time tariffs due to the high demand. But last year, March-end ushered in a lifestyle unknown to many - locked up at home with nowhere to go. Big travel plans are still a mile away, but domestic tourism surely and slowly started picking up as lockdown norms were eased. Now, a second wave of infections poses a threat to yet another summer vacation period. According to M. Ravi, joint secretary of Karnataka Tourism Society, hotel bookings have fallen by more than 50%. “Tourist transport has also been hit badly. If this continues, travel, tourism and hospitality will be in deep trouble,” he said. One of the reasons is the lack of uniformity in precautions and protocol among different States. “They have to remove the requirement of an RT-PCR for certain States or make it mandatory for all. Each State has its own rules now,” he added. Sanjar Imam, president, Karnataka Tourism Forum, admitted there is concern with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. “Several have put travel plans on hold, but we haven’t seen cancellations for travel in the summer yet,” they said. Representatives of the sector from popular destinations in Karnataka echoed similar views. Jimmi Chengappa, general manager, Coorghomestays.com, said enquiries have become fewer. “To Kodagu, 90% of the traffic is usually from Bengaluru, which is still coming in. But in peak season during April-May, we also get tourists from Delhi, Mumbai, etc. Now tourists from Maharashtra are not coming because of the COVID-19 regulations there,” he said. Adding that the market did recover post the lockdown, he said some homestays were doing very well. “But like last time, if there is a ban on tourism by the district administration or if there is a lockdown-like situation in Bengaluru, it will be detrimental for another peak season,” he said. Gurudev. S.H., founder of Chikkamagalurustays.in and Sakleshpurstays.in, said till last Sunday, there were a good number of enquiries, but since the slew of meetings under the Chief Minister’s leadership about the second wave, enquiries have plummeted. “There are no cancellations, but no fresh bookings either. For April, we had started getting enquiries from Chennai and Mumbai, but now many people have put their plans on hold. With the panic around COVID-19 now, they are being cautious,” he said. Mr. Gurudev admitted that the situation looks bleak because of the uncertainty. “For many, tourism is their bread and butter, and for others, it was a compensatory income especially when they have suffered losses in plantations due to unseasonal rains,” he said. Officials with the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) said the Tirupati package, a popular offering from the corporation, was continuing to see a good response. However, enquiries for other packages are beginning to see an impact from the increasing number of COVID-19 cases being reported, officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/second-wave-of-covid-19-infections-threatens-tourism-prospects-again/article34127500.ece
22 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Democracy belongs to the dissenters’||Marxist political theorist and philosopher Prof. Aijaz Ahmad expressed concern that the surge in ‘spectacular resistance movements’ emerging across the country might peter out if there is no political centre around which they can coalesce. He was delivering a talk, ‘Making Sense of Our times: Democracy, Debate, Dissent’, organised by Bengaluru Collective and moderated by N. Ram, Director, The Hindu Publishing Group, on Sunday. Drawing a parallel to the Arab Spring movements that were eventually defeated, he said, “How do you bring these various resistance movements by farmers, minorities, students, Dalits among others, in relation to each other in such a way that it doesn’t remain fragmented?” The real question in India is whether there can be a political centre around which these forces can coalesce. “The powers that be will try to suppress them, with structures of liberal state increasingly acting in illiberal ways,” he cautioned. Charting out the crises and failures of liberal democracies, he said that while democracy had failed as a system of governance, democracy itself truly belonged to dissenters. “I feel, to truly have democracy, we need to have socialism. There is something deeply incompatible between democracy and capitalism that only produces oligarchic power,” he said. Describing the ongoing farmers’ agitation as ‘the first really big movement on the question of neo-liberalism’ in India, he said this was also why the government has dug in its heels. “When farmers say Narendra Modi dare not withdraw the farm bills as ‘Ambani and Adani’ won’t allow him to do so, there is truth to it. Benito Mussolini once defined fascism as the state and corporations becoming one, which is exactly what we are seeing today. It's a global trend and India is no different,” he said. However, he said the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was not in the traditional mode of fascist takeovers, but a takeover of institutions from within. “They filled the bureaucracy, military and judiciary with their sympathisers as much as possible. When they eventually came [to power], there was widespread acceptance and consent to their ideology and politics. Now, these institutions, including the judiciary, are ensuring that this government lasts in the foreseeable future,” he said. According to Prof. Ahmad, the roots of the democratic crisis in the country run far deeper. He spoke of the failure of the Indian state in the first decades, when it did not create a popular base for democracy to take root above race, caste and classes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/democracy-belongs-to-the-dissenters/article34127491.ece
22 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Artist stitches up ‘Montage of Memories’||No matter how long a person has been a ‘subject matter expert’, they are constantly evolving, constantly learning and constantly experimenting with new forms. Such has been the experience of Bengaluru-based artist S.G. Vasudev whose latest series, ‘Montage of Memories’, is currently on display. “Around five months ago, I was drawing as is my regular practice when an invite caught my eye. I wondered how its gold and silver lines would look inside a drawing. It worked very well, and I continued incorporating drawings and collage,” said Mr. Vasudev, recounting the idea that sparked his current series. Looking back at some collages he had created in 1978, the artist said, “I realised there were no lines on those pieces, except where the paper was cut and pasted. I found this fascinating. I began sourcing images from glossy magazines and newspapers, experimenting with textures and form, by both tearing and cutting out pieces of paper I wanted to use.” It was a defining moment when Mr. Vasudev began using images from Vriksha , his biography in a coffee table book format. “I took out my own images from the book — a face here, some hands there — and began recreating stories, pasting the scraps in unusual ways. I found the result interesting and unique.” Apart from paper, canvases in the ‘Montage’ series feature elements such as cloth, cardboard and other material. Mr. Vasudev derived inspiration for the series from various sources. ‘Montage of Memories’ can be viewed at Gallery Sumukha from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. till March 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/artist-stitches-up-montage-of-memories/article34127495.ece

After 12 years long gap, from now onwards, every police recruitment will have 2% quota for outstanding sportspersons,” he said in the tweet. ‘Culture of fitness’ Sources in the Police Department said that quota for sportspersons existed till 2009, but was removed later for various reasons. “This will usher in a culture of fitness in the department,” said the officer. For the past few years, the Karnataka Olympic Association had been urging the government to reintroduce reservation. It had argued that such a step would encourage and inspire youth to take up sports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/2-quota-in-police-force-for-meritorious-sportspersons/article34127504.ece
22 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Denotification case: Congress demands CM’s resignation||The Congress on Sunday demanded the resignation of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in the light of the March 17 judgment of the Karnataka High Court. They contended that he continuing in office could influence the probe into denotification of 24.6 acres on the outskirts of Bengaluru. Former Minister Krishna Byre Gowda told presspersons that Mr. Yediyurappa had denotified the land for personal gains. “The chargesheet has been filed and there is no B report filed by the Lokayukta police. With the High Court order, the Chief Minister has to face a probe. There are chances that he may misuse his position to influence the probe,” he said. Mr. Gowda said the public probity demands that Mr. Yediyurappa should not interfere and he has to step down till investigation is completed. “He has to stay away from power till he gets a clean chit,” he said. Land value Estimating the land value of 24 acres that had been denotified to be about Rs. 25 crore, former legislator V.S. Ugrappa said that if BJP is committed in eradicating corruption, it has to seek resignation of the Chief Minister. “The High Court has said that there is substance in the chargesheet. It has also directed the judge of the special court to take cognisance of the chargesheet and conduct trial,” he said. “Will he not misuse his position to influence the police as a Chief Minister? Will the BJP and RSS that speak against corruption ask for his resignation?” Mr. Ugrappa asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/denotification-case-congress-demands-cms-resignation/article34127514.ece

While 96% of those surveyed reported a reduction in household income since lockdown restrictions were eased last year, its most serious impact was on nutrition and education. “A major reduction in expenses had come in the form of expenditure on food. Workers reported primarily cutting down on meat, vegetables, fruits, snacks and beverages such as tea and coffee; in some cases, the number of meals was cut from thrice to twice or even once a day,” the report said. It noted that families were shifting their children from private to government schools either in the city or in their village to reduce expenditure. “In some cases, workers reported enrolling one child in school while leaving the other out of school or college for this academic year.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/impact-on-nutrition-and-education/article34127490.ece

22 March 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||District administration shielding owner of illegal function hall, says Kanta||The former Labour Minister S.K. Kanta has accused the Kalaburagi district administration of shielding the former corporator Aleemuddin Patel who, according to him, has violated an order of the High Court of Karnataka by completing the construction of a function hall (QP Palace) without conversion of land and permission from the competent authorities. Mr. Kanta has written to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa stating that the district administration has failed in containing illegal land development activities. He further said that Deputy Commissioner V.V. Jyothsna and Additional Deputy Commissioner Shankarappa Vanikyal have been acting as agents of land grabbers. Providing what he called evidence [photos of the opening ceremony of the function hall on January 10 and other functions organised at QP Palace], Mr. Kanta said that even though Mr. Patel had deliberately violated the court order thereby committing contempt of court, the government machinery, including the Deputy Commissioner and the Additional Deputy Commissioner, are supporting Mr. Patel by refusing to take action in complaints filed with them. “Complaints were filed by Sharfoddin Baba on November 30, 2020 with the Deputy Commissioner giving details about the violation of court order by Mr. Patel. Regional Commissioner N.V. Prasad, had on January 6, 2021 also asked the Deputy Commissioner to submit a report within three days of his directive on action taken against Mr. Patel who has constructed a function hall on 2.20 acres of agricultural land at Zaffarabad village on the outskirts of the city without land conversion,” he said. “Further, the Kalaburagi City Corporation Commissioner has in February written to the district administration seeking permission to keep the function hall under seal until the case is disposed of in court, for which no reply has been given,” Mr. Kanta said. The district authorities are hand in glove with the accused, which is clear from their actions and inordinate delay in taking any steps against Mr. Patel, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/district-administration-shielding-owner-of-illegal-function-hall-says-kanta/article34127751.ece

22 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Govt. is acquiring 200 acres for industries, says Shettar||The State government is in the process of acquiring 200 acres of land in Dakshina Kannada for industrial needs, Minister for Medium and Large Scale Industries Jagadish Shettar said here on Sunday. Delivering his inaugural address at the Karnataka Coastline Business Conclave 2021 organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FCCI), the Minister said that of the 200 acres, 100 acres each are in Puttur and Belthangady taluks. The new industrial policy (2020-25) of the State government focused on promoting industries outside Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts by providing them incentives. Those incentives will not be given to industrialists if they invested in the jurisdiction of Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural. This is to reduce the concentration of industries in Bengaluru area. The policy has categorised districts into three zones to develop areas considered to be industrially backward. The industrially backward districts come under Zone I and Zone II, while the industrially developed ones have been classified under Zone III and Zone IV. The State amended the Karnataka Industrial (Facilitation) Act in 2020 and launched an affidavit-based approval system on December 21, 2020 which will allow eligible private sector investors to set up a business in the State without requiring multiple clearances for the first three years of establishment. The government also amended the Section 109 of Karnataka Land Reforms Act to enable easier acquisition of agricultural land for industrial purposes. Development The Minister said that a detailed project report (DPR) is being prepared to develop the Belekeri Port in Uttara Kannada. In addition, the government has sanctioned Rs. 200 crore for building a civilian airport in Karwar. Mr. Shettar said that if tourism is to be promoted on a big scale in the coastal belt, there is a need to relax some rules that have become a hindrance for the promoters to invest and take up tourism-related activities. Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel said that automobile, food processing and petroleum industries can be set up in the coastal belt. Land is being identified in the district to have a bank of 2,000 acres. Chairman, Karnataka chapter of FICCI, Ullas Kamath said that there is a need to create jobs for generation next. Industries should grow beyond Bengaluru, he added. Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Commerce and Industry, Gaurav Gupta said that private investors can also set up industrial parks in the coastal belt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-is-acquiring-200-acres-for-industries-says-shettar/article34127933.ece

Senthil Vel said here on Sunday. Speaking on “Emerging opportunities in the coastal region of Karnataka, harnessing the potential” at the Karnataka Coastline Business Conclave 2021 organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FCCI), Prof. Vel said that such a centre is required for studies related to oceanography, coastal and marine conservation, climate change, sea level rise and salinity intrusion. The centre can also take up studies related to disaster, waste and water management and Western Ghats conservation and management. Other States Prof. Vel said that the State is dependent on other institutions outside Karnataka for any information and data related to oceanography, climate change, sea level rise and salinity intrusion. Studies related to marine sector mattered the most in coastal development, he said and added that Goa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have such centres. Desalination plant Managing Director of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL) M. Venkatesh said that the de-salination plant of the MRPL, work on which is on the verge of completion at Panambur, “will be commissioned to an extent of 20 % to 30 %” in another one month. He said that but for the COVID-19 situation, the plant would have been fully commissioned by now. Mr. Venkatesh said that the pandemic has hit the oil refinery sector globally. It might take at least another six months for the sector to recover fully. MRPL is not an exception. “The company is witnessing huge financial loss. The situation is grim and needs urgent support and a policy decision from the government to sustain operations. It needs the intervention of both the State and Union governments,” the managing director said and added that the company is also taking up for Phase IV expansion. Chairman of New Mangalore Port Trust Venkata Ramana Akkaraju said that Karnataka needed a cruise port with yacht, seaplane, helipad and other required facilities. It might require an investment of Rs. 3,500 crore. But if [it is] set up, it would give a boost to tourism activities. Deputy General Manager, State Bank of India, Mangaluru, Rajesh Gupta, Vice-President (Operations), Delightful Gourmet Pvt.

22 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Ambedkar Circle’ stickers now on city bus destination boards||A long pending demand of Dalit activists was realised recently with private city and suburban buses sporting B.R. Ambedkar Circle instead of Jyothi Circle on their destination boards. After “Jyothi Circle” was renamed as “B.R. Ambedkar Circle,” Dalit activists had been demanding action by authorities to make city buses mention the same on destination boards. Apart from raising it in the District level SC/ST grievances meet, activists had raised it in the district Road Safety meeting. It was raised in several SC/ST grievances meetings held at the office of Police Commissioner, including the one chaired by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar on February 28. “Few days ago, Mr. Shankar told us about the demand. We came out with stickers of B.R. Ambedkar Circle and it was pasted on most of the buses passing through the circle on Tuesday,” said Dilraj Alva, president of the Dakshina Kannada Bus Owners Association. The association got as many as 400 stickers of B.R. Ambedkar Circle. In the presence of a few Dalit activists and traffic police, Association members stopped some city buses on Tuesday morning at the circle and pasted the stickers. Later, they went to city bus terminus in State Bank and pasted the stickers on the buses. “We are happy of the way the city police took up the issue with city bus operators and pave way for realising our long standing demand,” said Vishwanath Chintimar, a Dalit Sangarsha Samiti activist from Bantwal. Despite directions by the then Deputy Commissioner K.G. Jagadeesha, city bus operators had failed to mention B.R. Ambedkar Circle on the route boards, he said. Another activist Vishukumar said there was a postive reaction to the recent letter by Mr. Shankar to Chief Managers of some prominent banks in the city about problems faced by SC/ST applicants in getting loan. “The official’s letter has led to banks processing our applications without placing any hassle,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ambedkar-circle-stickers-now-on-city-bus-destination-boards/article34127941.ece

22 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Four-lane work on 45 km of NH 75 likely to be ready by March next||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has fixed March 2022 deadline for completing four-laning work on the 45-km stretch of National Highway 75 between Hassan and Maranahalli in Hassan district. From km 189.7 to km 237, NH 75 was proposed to be widened to four lanes with concrete pavement and the contract was initially awarded to Isolux Corsan India Engineering and Construction Pvt. Ltd. in 2017. Following the contractor going insolvent, the authority asked sub contractor Rajkamal Builders Pvt. Ltd. to continue the work. The project was being executed under Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode at an estimated cost of Rs. 537.92 crore. With 23.5% progress at present, work on building the four-lane highway was under progress on the stretch even as the contractor was constructing extended culverts at many places. The four-lane highway would have one vehicular underpass at Kollahalli on Sakleshpur Bypass and a grade separator at Byrapura-Alur Road Junction. In all, there would be three bypasses — Palya Bypass (1.22 km); Ballupet Bypass (1.55 km) and Sakleshpur Bypass (5.43 km). The bypasses would avoid the highway going through thickly populated residential and commercial areas en route , particularly the narrow stretch inside Sakleshpur Town. Easing congestion While the four-lane stretch between Hassan and Maranahalli would considerably ease the congestion on this stretch of NH 75 upon its completion, the stretch of the highway between Adda Hole and BC Road in Dakshina Kannada district was yet to be made a four-lane road. The 25-km stretch on Shiradi Ghat between Maranahalli and Adda Hole would continue to remain two-lane. The NHAI was yet to award contract for four-laning the Adda Hole-BC Road stretch of NH 75 and at least, another two years were required to complete the work after the contract is awarded. Larsen and Toubro, the contractor chosen earlier to execute the work, foreclosed the contract as NHAI had to change the scope of work to accommodate animal corridors between the Adda Hole-Periyashanthi stretch. Now, the authority has divided this 63-km stretch into two packages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-lane-work-on-45-km-of-nh-75-likely-to-be-ready-by-march-next/article34127925.ece

22 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||No funds for urban greenery this year||Urban greening in Mysuru will take a hit this year as the State government has not earmarked funds to enable the Forest Department to take up tree plantation on a large scale. This has been attributed to resource constraints owing to COVID-19 as a result of which the State government could not mobilise enough resources due to the slowdown in the economy and the lockdown. Sources in the department told The Hindu that urban greening entailed planting new saplings in the residential areas and roadside trees which over the years led to cumulative increase in the number of trees and helped improve the green cover of Mysuru. Urban forestry scheme The authorities had also launched the urban forestry scheme two years ago for high-density tree plantation in open areas belonging to the government institutions, parks, and gardens. But this will also take a hit as the Budget for 2021-22 has no provision for it. As a consequence, the existing trees planted could also wither away and the net green cover of Mysuru could significantly erode. The depleting green cover of Mysuru was already a matter of concern for city-based environmentalists and activists who had questioned the department’s move to permit tree felling. Recently, about 30 activists and NGOs had mourned the felling of a 30 year-old banyan tree in Srirampura and had questioned the authorities for permitting felling of giant trees at a time when issues like climate change and environmental degradation were global issues. Sources said they have written to the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) and the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) but are yet to hear from them. Though the MUDA itself has announced funds for increasing the green cover this year, the net impact will be neutralised as the department is unlikely to take up any such programme. Tree plantation However, 200 hectares of land will come under tree plantation in the district and the department has a tree plantation scheme of which 50 hectares will be in Chamundi Hills, Chikkadevammanabetta in Sargur, Malleshwara Gudda in H.D. Kote, and at Chikkanahalli. It will be taken up during the monsoon and the saplings have been grown in the nurseries of the department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-funds-for-urban-greenery-this-year/article34127965.ece
22 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Yoga demonstration against trafficking held in Mysuru||About 100 people participated in the ‘Yoga Stops Traffick’, a yoga demonstration organised by the Odanadi Seva Samsthe in front of Mysuru palace early on Sunday. It is an annual campaign to unite yoga practitioners across the world to take a stand against human trafficking. Similar yoga demonstrations were also held in 170 destinations across 40 countries on the same day. “The demonstration will be held at 7 a.m. in their respective countries. We will get a feedback from the other destinations later,” said Parashuram, one of the joint founders of the samsthe.  All the participants in Mysuru were given a T-shirt with the message ‘Yoga stops Traffick’ and Odanadi’s tagline Samanategagi Odanadi . “We had sent about 8,000 such T-shirts to all the organisations worldwide,” he said. As the programme is also a fundraiser, the T-shirts are sold for Rs. 400 a piece, but donors are welcome to contribute even more, he said. Mayor Rukmini Madegowda also participated in the event along with Odanadi founders Stanley and Mr. Parashuram. Though Yoga teacher Pranesh was also present, a group of children from Odanadi led the yoga demonstration. About 28 suryanamaskars were performed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yoga-demonstration-against-trafficking-held-in-mysuru/article34127960.ece
22 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MUDA to improve amenities in layouts before transfer to MCC||The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) plans to ramp up civic amenities and infrastructure in the areas coming under the newly constituted town panchayats and city municipal council under its jurisdiction. The government recently upgraded some of the gram panchayats, including Bogadi, Srirampura, Kadakola, and Ramanahalli, which are now town panchayats, while Hinkal, Koorgalli, Belavadi, and Koorgalli have been clubbed and upgraded as a city municipal council. There are scores of residential layouts in these areas, some of which have acquired semi-urban and urban characteristics as at Srirampura, Bogadi, and Hinkal. But owing to financial constraints of the gram panchayats, there was no planned development which affected the local residents. Earlier, these residential areas came under the broad jurisdiction of the MUDA and are now considered part of Mysuru city in all respects though they are still outside the purview of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC). In addition to development in the upgraded gram panchayats under MUDA limits, the authority also plans to overhaul infrastructure in some of the localities developed by it within the city limits but are awaiting transfer to the MCC. However, as per a government notification issued on March 1, 2019, the MUDA cannot take up civic works and has to restrict itself to plot development. But the MCC does not want to be saddled with additional financial burden of providing and maintaining civic amenities in the new layouts. This is affecting the process of transferring the MUDA layouts to MCC. Hence, the MUDA has sought to resolve the issue by seeking government approval as a one-time measure and take up civic works. H.V. Rajeev, chairman, MUDA, told The Hindu that there was reluctance on the part of the MCC to take over the MUDA developed layouts as some of the infrastructure works are incomplete or are beginning to crumble and need to be shored up. The MCC is also apprehensive of the quality of works executed in some of the layouts already transferred from the MUDA to MCC. The corporation in 2019 also sought cancellation of the transfer of nearly 12 layouts from MUDA as the civic works were not scrutinised and in some cases were found to be shoddy. MUDA proposal But a solution may be in the offing in case the State government accepts a MUDA’s proposal of a one-time measure for which it has set aside Rs. 379.85 crore in the Budget tabled on Saturday. If approved, it will enable the MUDA to take up 105 packages comprising 220 civil works and projects. The works include provision of drinking water connection, extending UGD network and connection, road construction, providing electricity and streetlights, and their upgrade in places where these facilities are already in place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/muda-to-improve-amenities-in-layouts-before-transfer-to-mcc/article34127963.ece
22 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Unease among a section of Congress workers||The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) decision to suspend three supporters of former Minister Tanveer Sait from the party for their reported role in the anti-party protest after the Mayoral polls in Mysuru has sparked unease among a section of the partymen in the Narasimharaja Assembly segment. The KPCC, last week, suspended president of Azeez Sait Block Congress Committee Abdul Khader alias Shahid, KPCC member P. Raju, and vice-president of Mysuru City District Congress Committee Anwar Pasha alias Annu Bhai. Many workers turned up at the Congress office on Saturday and handed over their resignations to Mysuru city Congress committee president R. Murthy. Leader Nisar Ahmed told reporters that the presidents of nine wards and about 100 booths of Azeez Sait Block Congress Committee had submitted their resignations. However, the Congress leaders clarified that they will continue to remain in the party and they had submitted resignations in protest against the suspension of Mr. Abdul Khader. The KPCC had suspended them for allegedly shouting slogans against former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and former Assembly Speaker Ramesh Kumar. But, Mr. Ahmed said Mr. Khader was neither there nor did he have any role in the protest. Mr. Khader and Mr. Sait tried to stop the protest and sloganeering, he claimed. Mr. Sait’s supporters alleged that the party leadership had taken action against Mr. Khader even though he had no role in the protest and accused former Mayors Arif Hussain and Ayub Khan of influencing the party leadership. Some of the workers said the party should have taken action against the former Mayors for holding a press conference against the sitting MLA despite a warning by KPCC working president R. Dhruvanarayan. Meanwhile, KPCC member P. Raju, who was also suspended by the party, said he will remain in the Congress till his death. He sought to remind his services to the party that included his role in stopping the Janata Dal (S) from distributing freebies during the byelections to the Chamundeshwari Assembly segment in 2006. “I was booked by the police for my role during the byelections and was made to make multiple visits to the court in the connection,” he said. “I have not been given anything from the party for my services except this suspension order,” he remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/unease-among-a-section-of-congress-workers/article34127958.ece

Delivering the keynote address at the annual conference on Finance and Taxation on ‘Role of Finance in recovering from volatile economy’ by CII Mysuru that was held virtually, Mr. Muthoot also pointed out that the real estate sector is back on the growth path, thanks to the drop in interest rates. A statement issued by CII, Mysuru, also said that Mr. Muthoot had observed that consumer spending has started going up and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) had a large role to play in the revival of the economy. Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of CEAT Limited Kumar Subbaiah said the volatility in the market is going to stay and called upon the industry to consider it as an opportunity. “Managing volatility and uncertainty is important in the post COVID-19 economy,” he said while emphasising the need for organisations to bring in structural changes. Chairman of CII, Mysuru, Pavan G. Ranga said a CFO’s role had become crucial in the volatile economy and said there was a higher responsibility on every finance professional to shape up the growth path in the industry. Former chairman of CII, Mysuru, Amit Kumar said the fast revival of the industry was taking place despite some bottlenecks. He emphasised the need for strengthening “ease of doing business” initiatives by the government to help the industry grow further. Executive Director of IDBI Bank Nagaraj Garla said India’s GDP in the third quarter had become positive and the credit growth had remained stable while all the key indicators of the economy were showing signs of revival. Government initiatives had also helped, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/there-is-excess-liquidity-in-the-market/article34127961.ece
22 March 2021||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||Help develop indigenous culture, people urged||Chairman of Kannada Development Authority and film director T.S. Nagabharana has expressed serious concern over the harm that western culture may cause to Indian heritage and appealed to people to grow indigenous culture. He was addressing a gathering after participating as chief guest at the inauguration of a new building for the Kannada Sahitya Parishat in Yadgir on Sunday. Mr. Nagabharana said that “we are comparing our heritage with Western culture and suffering a certain complex which should not be allowed to develop in us”. “To overcome such mindset, we should love our language, culture and heritage honestly and spread them. Kannada is among the oldest languages and it will never die. Therefore, we have to follow in the footsteps of our elders who worked for the development of language and literature,” he said. Calling everyone to join hands to build a healthy society, the film director said that if culture is strengthened, then society will automatically become healthy . “Poet Pampa in the eighth century followed by Basaveshwara in the 12th century and later, Kuvempu have propagated ‘Manuja Matha Vishwa Patha’ principle among all,” he recalled. MLC Shashil G. Namoshi said that the government should provide adequate grants for Kannada University in Hampi to take up research works as research was not being taken up due to shortage of grants. “The government has merely declared setting up a new university in Raichur, which will also cover Yadgir, as it released only Rs. 54 lakh for the work. How such a small grant can be sufficient to build a new university? he asked and urged the State government to establish a study centre at Khanapur in Yadgir district with full-fledged facilities to ensure education for all in the educationally backward district. President of Kannada Sahitya Parishat Siddappa Hotti said that the new parishat building has come up at a cost of Rs. 54 lakh of which, Rs. 50 lakh was donated jointly by the Border Development Authority, the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Bengaluru, and under the MP, the MLA and MLC funds. MLA Venkatreddy Mudnal spoke. The former MLC Channareddy Patil Tunnur, president of Zilla Panchayat Basanagowda Patil Yadiyapur, Chairman of City Municipal Council Vilas Patil, Chief Executive Officer Shilpa Sharma, Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Sonawane, Subhashchandra Koulagi, S.

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||‘Garment units forcing workers to resign’||A survey of 25 garment factories in the city has revealed a disturbing trend of ‘forced resignations’ leading to more job losses in the sector, than the Karnataka government had recently admitted to in the Assembly, owing to ‘non re-opening of several factories post lockdown’. Labour Minister says... Labour Minister A. Shivaram Hebbar had recently said in the Assembly that 2.86 lakh workers, mostly women, were employed in 983 garment factories in Karnataka before the lockdown, of which over one lakh haven’t been able to rejoin work yet as many factories have not reopened yet. However, a survey conducted by Garment and Textiles Workers’ Union (GATWU) and Alternative Law Forum (ALF) revealed that even in the factories that have reopened, workers are being forced to resign. “Workers at 17 of 25 factories surveyed reported that they had been asked to resign by the company due to ‘losses’ suffered by the latter. Eighty-one percent of workers we spoke to said they had resigned. The rest were protesting the closure or were yet to resign,” stated the survey report, which was released on Sunday. Workers were allegedly threatened that if they did not resign voluntarily, their dues would not be settled. According to the report, factories have also employed other coercive measures, such as stopping transport facilities and transferring workers to far-off factories within the company but refusing to provide transport, workers said. Hope of re-employment Some factories also reportedly promised workers that they will be re-employed when the situation stabilises, but that they should resign now. “Workers resigned also because they had little to no money during the months of the lockdown, and which had left them destitute. Faced with loss of employment, workers ‘chose’ the only alternative of resignation because it would mean receiving some income immediately,” the report noted. Of the 25 factories surveyed, three have shut down completely. While the Labour Minister said several factories “were yet to reopen”, there is no clarity as to whether these factories have been “closed” or will reopen. The survey found that several factories were “closed” without due legal process, denying workers rightful retrenchment/closure compensation. It recommended that the Labour Department conduct a large-scale inspection of garment factories, examine resignations to assess whether they were voluntary or forced, and ensure that retrenchment or closure compensation was provided to workers at the time of ‘resignation’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/garment-units-forcing-workers-to-resign/article34127493.ece

The previous year, in 2019, the death toll was even higher at 688. In an attempt to address this problem and reduce the number of fatalities, the traffic police have launched a drive to instil road safety culture among motorists and pedestrians, B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) told The Hindu . The initiative, which was launched on Saturday, will involve civic agencies associated with road engineering, maintenance and management. Underscoring the importance of the need to improve the city’s track record, Mr. Gowda pointed out that more people died of fatal accidents than the COVID-19 pandemic. “The entire country and its medical infrastructure has geared up towards fighting the pandemic. We need to address accidents with the same urgency. Little has been done to reduce deaths due to road accidents, which are avoidable and can be prevented successfully,” he added. For this, motorists and pedestrians, too, have a part to play. “We have chalked out a series of programmes, including inculcating a road safety culture among road users. The other important aspect includes awareness of the Golden Hour rule; the Good Samaritan law that encourages people to help accident victims; and most importantly, safety measures to be taken while using roads.” Catch them young To spread awareness among school children and educate them on traffic rules, the police have prepared 28 short animated videos that will be played in theatres, public places and schools. This apart, dedicated staff will be deployed at the children’s traffic park near Bowring Institute to teach them how to ride bicycles safely while reading road signage and using traffic signals. “This will give children practical experience on road usage,” said a senior officer who is part of the enforcement drive. He added that this project will commence after once COVID-19 rules are relaxed Youth film stars and celebrities have been roped in to share messages on road safety. State of roads One of the main problems raised by citizens during their interactions with the police is the sorry state of roads. “Civic agencies associated with road engineering will also be roped in to maintain the roads as this can also bring down the number of accidents,” Mr. Gowda said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/road-safety-initiative-by-traffic-police/article34127496.ece

Work had been stalled after BMRCL terminated the contract earlier this year. BMRCL Managing Director Ajay Seth said that the corporation has approached the financial institution funding the project seeking clearance to float the tender. Recently, the BMRCL terminated the contract awarded to Simplex Infrastructure Limited for poor execution of work on the elevated corridor project. Under Phase II of the Namma Metro project , the BMRCL is building an elevated corridor from Kalena Agrahara to Swagath Cross Road as part of the 21-km Pink Line. The plan includes an underground stretch of 14 km. Due to financial problems, the previous contractor couldn’t execute the project as per the tender conditions. The BMRCL data showed that in December 2019, the contractor had made 22% progress in civil work, but in February 2021, only 37% was completed. The BMRCL had served notices to the contractor for poor performance before terminating the contract. Mr. Seth said that the elevated section of the Pink Line will be completed by December 2023. This means that motorists and pedestrians using the busy stretch on Bannerghatta Road will have to wait for nearly three years for some relief. For more than two-and-a-half years, during construction of piers for the metro project, congestion and traffic jams were the norm. Motorists had hoped for timely completion of the project, which seems unlikely with the cancellation of the tender.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmrcl-to-invite-bids-for-pending-metro-work-on-bannerghatta-road/article34127489.ece

He further said: “When such a single-window system exists in Karnataka, which is being willingly promoted, Mr. Modi criticising Ms. Mamata is self-deception.

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah(in picture)purchasing dhotis recently, which was discussed last week in the Legislative Assembly in a lighter vein, is refusing to die down. In fact, it took a serious turn on Sunday. It all began with a discussion in the House on inflation and Mr. Siddaramaiah’s observation that hardly anyone buys clothes these days because people have no money to shop. That was when Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai interjected to say that a little bird had informed him of Mr. Siddaramaiah’s recent shopping spree and purchase of 90 sets of dhotis. Without going into whether he had indeed bought 90 sets, Mr. Siddaramaiah instead took off on the merits of a dhoti. “I buy dhotis because there are no fitting problems with the garment. Though I have put on weight these days, I don’t have to worry.” When Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri asked whom he had purchased so many clothes for, Mr. Siddaramaiah replied: “I buy only for myself since my son has grown up and he buys his clothes.” As the conversation continued, former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar interjected to say it was okay to talk about wearing clothes as long people in positions of power keep them on. The banter rather abruptly stopped there, considering it was a subtle reference to the sex CD scandal. But that was not the end of it. With BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel again invoking the dhoti purchase episode, Mr. Siddaramaiah on Sunday tweeted, “I bought 90 pairs of clothes to donate to BJP leaders who are losing respect in public.” He went on to say: “Apparently there are 19 more CDs. Everything should be under control, including the tongue.”   A compliment paid to Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri seemed to make him a tad uncomfortable in the Assembly last week. Amidst a conversation on how the attitude of a Speaker matters in conduct of the House, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said that Opposition leaders seem to have better coordination with the Speaker in conducting the Assembly. The Speaker was quick to intervene and say that he also has a great understanding with the Leader of the House and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. While Mr. Siddaramaiah was keen to continue on the theme, Mr. Kageri appeared in a hurry to stop the discussion, lest the media begins to speculate on implications of this so-called bonhomie.   Should the long arm of law stop short of reaching industrialists for the fear that it may discourage them from investing in our State? Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh Nirani came under criticism in the Council after he said that action against industrialists or owners of firms that report accidents would not inspire them to continue in our State. During a debate on illegal quarrying, the Minister asked what would inspire an industrialist to continue if he is arrested for an accident on premises owned by him “for no fault of his”. This angered Opposition leader S.R. Patil who sought to know if the State has to treat industrialists above law, even when lives are lost on their premises, fearing loss of investment. JD(S) member K.A. Thippeswamy warned that the Minister’s statements should not end up influencing investigators in the probe. Nagesh Prabhu Sharath S.

Around 500 kg of African catfish was fished out, according to a PTR official. The drive was launched after it was found that the catfish posed a threat to the local fish species in the lake. Periyar Lake hosts the largest number of endemic fish species, including Periyar trout, in the district. The lake is home to 47 fish species and seven of them are endemic. According to an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification in 2016, seven of the 36 species in the lake are critically endangered, six engendered, and eight vulnerable. Reasons The major factors that led to the depletion of the local fish in the lake are the proliferation of the catfish, which feeds on local fish, and the introduction of tilapia, a hybrid variety that has the tendency to monopolise the area where it is introduced. The eco-development committees (EDCs) having fishing rights in the lake were entrusted with the task of catching the catfish. A group of Mannans and Paliyans engaged in catching the fish and the drive concluded on Sunday, International Day of Forests. From fish farms It is believed that African catfish reached the lake from nearby fish farms when they were flooded and it proliferated in the congenial conditions. Though banned by the Union government, African catfish is grown in a number of farms in the district. When the farms are flooded during the monsoon, catfish spreads to nearby paddy fields, streams, and lakes. It has high survival rate too. Almost all reservoirs in the State are facing the threat of African catfish.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ptrs-drive-against-african-catfish/article34127816.ece

The fear birthed anger against all the authorities whom people in the area have approached for help to construct a sea wall and groynes that can hold back the sea ingress. “Parts of the sea wall were weakened or destroyed after Cyclone Ockhi in 2017, and no long-lasting steps have been taken so far to address the issue of sea ingress that begins in June every year,” said Mariamma George, the 73-year-old chairperson of the Chellanam-Kochi Janakeeya Vedi, a protest group which, on Saturday, marked its 510th day of a relay hunger strike to draw attention to the matter. The group, which has over 20 units spanning the length of the coastline in the district, plans on boycotting the upcoming polls, said Ms. George, a resident of Companypady. For 59-year-old Joseph Babu, a resident of Kannamaly, the floor of his home remains buried beneath the heaps of sand that the waves deposited last year. “We removed some of it, but it just isn’t possible to clear it all up,” said Mr. Babu, who was a fish worker till a few years ago. They have abandoned the rooms where sand was deposited, and the walls have developed cracks, and the nine-member family now sleeps in a single room, he said, adding that there was not enough money to rent another house. But fleeing to homes of relatives and burdening them is not feasible for several weeks of the year, said Philomena, a resident of Kannamaly. “We had seawater in the house twice in July and once in August last year. We moved to a family member’s home in Kumbalangi in July, but in August we decided to stay, wading in waist-high water to get to the kitchen,” she said. Residents like Baby Stanly have attempted to keep the water away by constructing a barrier made of concrete at their door. Though they did not want to move from the area they have lived in all their lives, Philomena’s family has applied for the State government’s rehabilitation package for people living along parts of the coast prone to erosion. “We get Rs. 10 lakh to purchase land and construct a home, or buy a house. The amount is hardly sufficient, but we were left with no choice,” she said. Others like Francis, a fish worker in Kannamaly, say they will not apply for the rehabilitation package considering the low amount that is being offered. The Janakeeya Vedi is demanding measures to protect the coastline rather than rehabilitate coastal residents. While no political front has done anything worthwhile for residents along the coastline, Mr. Babu says he is duty-bound to cast his vote. Mr. Francis is inclined towards Twenty20, to give another front a chance instead of the two regulars who failed to do much, he says. Matilda Cleetus, a resident of Saudi and a part of the Janakeeya Vedi, says that both the LDF and the UDF have had the opportunity to address the issue of sea ingress, but have chosen to ignore it, leaving people with no choice but to contemplate the idea of boycotting the polls. A 52-year-old member of the protest group who did not want to be identified, said, “Residents of the area might have voted for Chellanam Twenty20 at the panchayat level. But these formations have no concrete ideas or solutions and cannot make much of a change.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/coastal-residents-live-in-fear-of-sea-ingress/article34127837.ece
22 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Rejection of nomination: HC seeks EC’s response||The Kerala High Court at a special sitting held on Sunday asked the Election Commission (EC) to respond to the pleas of BJP candidates in Thalassery and Guruvayur Assembly constituencies against the rejection of their nomination papers by the Returning Officers of the respective constituencies. Adjourned Justice N. Nagaresh also adjourned to March 22 the petitions for further hearing. The petitions were filed by N. Haridas, NDA candidate in Thalassery assembly constituency, and Mahila Morcha State president and NDA candidate in Guruvayur Assembly, Nivedida Subramanian. The nomination papers of Mr. Haridas were rejected on the ground that Form A submitted along with the papers did not have the signature of BJP president J.P. Nadda while the nomination papers of Ms Nivedida were rejected as the Form B submitted by her did not contain the signature of the BJP president. In their petition, the BJP candidates contended that the rejection of their nomination papers were unauthorised and arbitrary. They pointed out that the nomination papers could not be rejected solely on account of minor defects in Form No.A or B as per Rule 4 of the Conduct of Election Rules. It was true that when the nomination papers were submitted some minor errors were noticed. While Form B submitted by the Guruvayur candidate contained the seal of the State Committee BJP, Form No. A had the authorisation issued by the national president in favour of the State president with the printing of his specimen signature. Though the significance of the party president was omitted in Form No. B it was provided in Form No. A. She alleged that that the Returning Officer had abused his powers with a view to helping the CPI(M) candidate. The Guruvayur candidate also pointed out that time had been granted to the LDF candidates in Konni and Piravom constituencies to correct the defects in the nomination papers. Besides, the scrutiny of the nomination papers in the constituencies had been postponed. But no such time was granted to the petitioner to rectify the mistakes in her nomination papers. Mr.Haridas pointed out that the only defect noted in Form A was that it did not have the signature of the national president. In fact, the petitioner had submitted revised Form No.A with the signature of the BJP national president. Therefore, the rejection of his nomination was illegal. EC submission Opposing the pleas, Counsel for the Election Commission submitted that Article 329 (b) of the Constitution mandated that no election either to the Parliament or to the Assembly election in a State shall be called into question except by an election petition. Therefore, the petitioners were now left with the only option of filing election petitions after the declaration of the election results Meanwhile, the UDF candidate in Thalassery constituency moved a petition seeking to implead in the petition filed by Mr. Haridas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rejection-of-nomination-hc-seeks-ecs-response/article34127854.ece
22 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Choir from State joins global Syrian musical concert||Around 300-strong choir from the Sruti School of Liturgical Music in Kottayam under the Orthodox Theological Seminary is part of a global Syrian musical concert, being held in Geneva, that has participation from the U.S., Syria, Lebanon and India. The Sruti school is among those invited to join the online concert, said Father Mathew Varghese. The choir from Kerala joined the concert on Sunday, which is also the last day of the five-day concert series, he said. The Sruti school is engaged in popularising and imparting knowledge on Syrian musicology. Father Varghese said that the Syrian music was gaining popularity in the world and the concert series would be a positive step towards making it more popular in the future. Eastern heritage The Syriac musical tradition is an eastern heritage that is a symbol of historical exchanges and influences. The musical series is being organised by the High School of Music of Geneva (Haute Ecole de Musique – HEM) in coordination with the Laus Plena Foundation, Lugano, Switzerland. The Sruti school has been invited to represent the Indian Syriac musical tradition, said the invitation extended to the Indian team addressed to Dr. Zacharia Mar Aprem (metropolitan), director of the Sruti School of Liturgical Music in Kottayam. The programme is focussed on a section with ancient Syriac melodies and texts, a section with mixed Syriac-Indian melodies and texts as well as a section with pure Indian Syriac melodies and Indian texts. One of the hymns is a combination of Syriac and Carnatic traditions composed by Father M.P. George. The other concert participants include those from Qaraqosh, Iraq; Mardin and Mor Gabriel, Turkey, Byblos, Lebanon, and from the diaspora in Europe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/choir-from-state-joins-syrian-music-fest/article34127824.ece
22 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Industry status is the prime demand||Malayalam cinema is peeved with successive governments for not according ‘industry’ status to it despite remaining a major contributor towards the exchequer. “Successive governments had all promised that we will get industry status, but to no avail,” laments K. Vijayakumar, former president of the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce and current president of the Film Exhibitors’ United Organisation of Kerala (FEUOK). “The recognition of government would have extended several benefits to the thousands who are part of this industry. This will be our major demand other than the spiralling tax slabs and other burdens staring at us today,” he says. Explaining that the sector continues to reel under the burden of ‘double taxation’, M.C. Bobby, former general secretary of FEUOK, says the government had imposed 5% entertainment tax on tickets up to Rs. 100 while the corresponding figure for tickets above Rs. 100 is 8.5%. Besides entertainment tax, we have to pay Goods and Services Tax (GST) for tickets up to Rs. 100 and above Rs. 100 at 12% and 18% respectively,” he says. “We have been pointing out that double-taxation is discriminatory and it had increased the burden on the sector that is yet to come out of the financial crisis induced by the pandemic. Let the government do away with entertainment tax as it is making a serious dent in our overall earnings,” he said. Siyad Kokker, president of the Kerala Film Distributors Association, says the responsibility of managing the online ticket booking facility should be handed over to the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce and the Kerala Film Producers Association. “Efforts by the government to implement it through its agencies have not taken off, as expected. The online platform for ticket booking will be of help for both the government, producers, and distributors as it will enhance revenue and streamline tax collection,” he says. Entertainment tax G. Suresh Kumar, the new president of Film Chamber of Commerce, says the cinema industry had not received any major help from successive governments. “This should change. Kerala is among the only two States in the country that had imposed entertainment tax over and above GST on film tickets. The new government should also give a subsidy push by enhancing the present Rs. 5 lakh for movies shot in Chitranjali Studio in Thiruvananthapuram to at least Rs. 10 lakh,” he says.  Successive governments had promised us industry status, but nothing happened. K.

22 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Candidates’ promises||Catering to persistent demands from residents of the densely populated coastal region, candidates contesting from the Kochi constituency are all promising strengthening of the sea wall to protect the eroding coastline. On complaints residents have been raising about coastal protection measures remaining incomplete so far, sitting MLA K.J. Maxi, who is the LDF candidate from the area, said that completion of the sea wall and setting up groynes would be taken up on priority, since an allocation was also made for it in the current financial year’s budget. The tender process is under way for a Rs. 15 crore worth sea wall, and once the election is over, work will begin, he said. Since he was elected, work on geotextile tubes has been taken up, he added. If work was left undone during his predecessor’s time, he is unaware of that, he claimed. Tony Chammany, the UDF candidate from the area, said that the coastal area would be his topmost priority on his ‘development’ agenda. This includes raising the sea wall and groynes, as well as addressing the livelihood needs of women in the area. The Twenty20 candidate from the constituency, Shiny Antony, suggested a ‘scientific study’ to determine the needs of the area and plan ahead for the next few decades, rather than merely promising completion of the sea wall which has remained unfulfilled for years. “The solution to the sea wall issue is simple. INS Dronacharya has a sea wall protection system that can be extended along the 18-km long coast of Kochi. Both ruling coalitions have not gone into the technical details,” said Nipun Cherian, V4 Kerala candidate from Kochi. “The attempt is to pressurise people to leave the Chellanam coastline and evict them. We will oppose the eviction plan of the State government. The existing sea wall needs to be repaired as an initial measure,” he said. C.G. Rajagopal, BJP candidate from Kochi, also promised groynes, after setting up an expert committee to address the issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/candidates-promises/article34127832.ece

Swaraj, MLA; K. Babu; and K.S. Radhakrishnan have a host of criminal cases pending against them. While most of the cases against them pertain to unlawful assembly, Mr. Babu, the UDF candidate, has against him a case regarding amassing of disproportionate assets and another one in connection with bar licence corruption. In all, the Congress candidate has 12 criminal cases pending against him.  Bar bribery case In his election affidavit, Mr. Babu has submitted that a criminal revision petition was filed before the Kerala High Court in March 2018 against the order of the Vigilance Special Court, Muvattupuzha, in the disproportionate assets case. In the bar corruption case, the former Excise Minister submitted that the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau has submitted a ‘negative report’ before the Vigilance court. Majority of the cases booked against the Congress leader were for unlawful assembly during the lockdown period and protest marches organised against ‘misappropriation of flood relief fund.’  211 cases Mr. Radhakrishnan, the NDA candidate, has the most number of cases among the three. As many as 211 police cases, all related to the protest organised by the Hindu organisations in connection with the Supreme Court order permitting women’s entry in the Sabarimala temple, have been booked against him. He has been booked for destruction of public property under the provisions of the Prevention of Destruction to Public Property Act, unlawful assembly, joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon, rioting, causing obstruction to public way, attempt to commit culpable homicide, and involuntarily causing hurt. Cases have also been booked against him for voluntarily causing hurt to prevent a public servant from discharging his duty, house trespass to commit criminal offence, and criminal intimidation.

22 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Now, teqball comes to city to enthral football fans||A curious-looking curved table bisected by a net in the middle, which may pass off as a table tennis table at first glance has become the centre of attraction at an artificial football turf at Kadavanthra. And in a way, the sport that goes by the name teqball, for which the table is meant, has indeed elements of table tennis though a football is used to play it. The rules governing the sport is also mostly drawn from football in that any part of the body except arms and hands can be used to play it back and forth. Tracing its origin to Hungary back in 2012, teqball, though still largely alien in this part of the world, has had gained immense popularity since then and has become the favourite pastime of professional footballers showcasing their skills. It is governed by the International Federation of Teqball (FITEQ) and Teqball India. “We are the first to introduce it anywhere in Kerala. The sport is best for honing football skills like ball control and can grow on those who find their groove. We plan to offer training sessions in the sport as part of our larger objective to develop football and giving youngsters a chance to play in the district, State and even national-level teqball contests,” said Duleep Menon, co-founder & CEO of Gamma Football, which has introduced the sport at their turf and sports centre at Kadavanthra. It can be played both as singles and doubles game. The ball will have to be sent to the other side of the table in three touches and when it comes to doubles, both players should have at least one touch though the same body part cannot be used for those three touches. It is played in three sets of 12 points each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/now-teqball-comes-to-city-to-enthral-football-fans/article34127835.ece
22 March 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Statistics leaves both fronts hopeful||As electioneering moves to its most intense phase, Kollam constituency, the city centre of the district, has come under spotlight. With all three fronts going full throttle to woo the voters, the segment is all poised to witness a keen contest. While sitting MLA and actor-turned politician M. Mukesh is seeking people’s mandate for a second time as the Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate, the United Democratic Front (UDF) has fielded District Congress Committee (DCC) president Bindu Krishna. Joining the two in the fray is National Democratic Alliance (NDA)’s M. Sunil, former district president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The segment includes 25 divisions of the Kollam Corporation and the nearby panchayats of Panayam and Thrikkaruva. While the candidature of M. Mukesh created quite a clamour within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] local units, Ms. Krishna’s name was announced in the last round after much ado. Mr. Mukesh, who has been tagged as the ‘absentee MLA’ by his political opponents, was the first to hit the campaign trail in the constituency. Headway As of now he has a clear headway on campaign front and the candidate lists out the development works worth Rs. 1,330 crore to challenge the ‘guest representative’ taunt. Ms. Krishna had to face severe criticism from a faction of the Congress after the party’s poor performance during the local body elections and the DCC president was in for a shock when the Congress leadership offered her Kundara instead of Kollam. But everything played out in her favour in the next stage and Ms. Krishna lost no time in launching an aggressive campaign. Mr. Sunil, who had contested as the BJP candidate in Chavara in 2016, is keeping his fingers crossed as the front could make a notable leap in the local body polls. Since the segment has a coastal area that includes Vaddy, Port Kollam, Thangassery and Thirumullavaram along with backwaters in Panayam, Kureepuzha and Thrikkaruva, fishers form a sizeable part of voters. Though Kollam used to favour Congress or Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) in the earlier elections, CPI(M) snatched the seat in 2006 for the first time. P.K. Gurudasan won the seat in 2006 and 2011 while M. Mukesh retained it in 2016.While Mr. Mukesh is riding high on development and welfare measures, Ms. Krishna is banking on her popularity in the segment, especially among fishers and cashew workers. LS, local body polls Though UDF’s N.K. Premachandran gained a margin of 24,545 votes in the constituency during the last Lok Sabha polls, LDF was able to retain Kollam Corporation with a brute majority for the fifth consecutive term and the statistics leaves both the fronts hopeful.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/statistics-leaves-both-fronts-hopeful/article34127881.ece

22 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||No easy choice in Kanjirappally||The Kanjirappally constituency, mostly carved out of the remnants of the erstwhile Vazhoor segment post-delimitation, is bracing for a close, three-cornered fight with no single candidate standing out as a clear favourite. While it was the United Democratic Front that won in the previous Assembly elections, sitting legislator N. Jayaraj, a Kerala Congress (M) leader, now seeks re-election as a candidate of the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Adding to this heady flow of adventurous political undercurrents is the high-intensity campaign by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which commands a significant presence here. Keen on affirming its dominance over the seat, the UDF has brought in former legislator and senior Congress leader Joseph Vazhakkan. Not to be left behind, the NDA too has opted for a BJP heavyweight — former Union Minister K.J. Alphons, who had represented the old Kanjirappally seat as an LDF Independent for five years from 2006. Mr. Jayaraj, a three-time legislator, has been representing Kanjirappally since 2011. Apart from the development projects implemented during his reign, the sitting MLA is also betting heavily on the stellar performance of the LDF during the recent local body elections. For the UDF, however, retaining Kanjirappally is more a matter of prestige as it seeks to give a fitting reply to the KC(M), which recently crossed over to the rival group. It hopes to highlight the anti-incumbency factor against the LDF government, the ‘inability’ of the sitting MLA to bring in major development projects, and the Sabarimala issue to gain votes. The NDA too is focussing on the development of the region as the key poll plank and calculates on the presence of Mr. Alphons, who is regarded as an able administrator, to help woo Christian votes. The coalition made significant inroads into the segment during the Sabarimala protests of 2018 and also counts on maintaining its dominance among the Hindu upper castes. Scene in local bodies The constituency is spread over the taluks of Kanjirappally, Changanassery, and Kottayam. Of the nine local bodies in the segment, which forms part of the Pathanamthitta Lok Sabha constituency, seven are ruled by the Left coalition while one each are governed by the UDF and the NDA. During the recent local body elections, the LDF won from 77 wards and the UDF, in 35 wards. The NDA had its representatives elected from 20 wards across the region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/no-easy-choice-in-kanjirappally/article34127822.ece
22 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Dissidents pose a challenge to poll campaigns||The passive electioneering by a few disgruntled local leaders who are unhappy with the official candidates has emerged as an unexpected challenge for leading election campaigners in some of the rural Assembly constituencies in Kozhikode district. Even after several rounds of conciliatory talks by the official leadership, the dissidents within the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) continue to pose a threat to poll campaigns, and may even silently campaign for rival fronts. For the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), the threat is serious in the Koduvally Assembly constituency, where a senior party leader is reportedly unhappy with the official candidate. The withdrawal of the leader from active campaigning has upset many active IUML workers and the district leadership of the party. “The main concern for the district leadership is the big local support for such disgruntled leaders, who are mighty enough to influence the vibrancy of united electioneering,” said an IUML campaigner from Koduvally. Afraid of open protests and demonstrations, the official leadership was reluctant to take disciplinary action against such leaders or to keep them out of campaign activities, he added. Poster wars In Thiruvambady, disagreements over selected candidates have become a headache for both the UDF and the LDF. Several posters echoing local sentiments continue to be a concern for senior leaders. The disgruntled leaders have remained silent about the protests by their supporters against the official leadership. In Balussery, many local UDF leaders are keeping out of active electioneering due to their disagreement over the official candidate. Though the district leadership has claimed that there are no threats to upset the smooth campaign, the absence of influential local leaders in electioneering points to internal rows. The case is not any different in Elathur, where senior Congress leaders are part of the local protests against the official candidate. As a quick solution, both LDF and UDF campaigners are planning to introduce some star campaigners to patch things up. According to sources, prominent national leaders are likely to take part in several constituency-level campaigns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dissidents-pose-a-challenge-to-poll-campaigns/article34127808.ece
22 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Not a cakewalk for the prime contenders||Caste and community factors may not matter much for Vadakara’s deeply political voters. Their electoral choice in this Assembly polls is mainly between a splinter group of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] backed by the United Democratic Front (UDF), and a splinter group of the Janata Parivar that recently returned to the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Manayath Chandran, district president, Loktantrik Janata Dal, had a head start in the campaign as the LDF candidate. The UDF support for and the candidature of Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader K.K. Rema, however, came after a lot of confusion. By the time Ms. Rema began her campaign by the end of last week, Mr. Chandran was already into his second leg of the process. By endorsing her candidature, the UDF hopes to rekindle the debate around political violence and the murder of T.P. Chandrasekharan, Ms. Rema’s husband and RMP founder. The Congress-led coalition also hopes to get votes in return for its candidates in adjacent Assembly seats in Vadakara taluk. But, the LDF is focussing only on the development works of its government. CPI(M) leaders claim that political violence is no longer a relevant issue in the constituency. Pluses and minuses Mr. Chandran, who was the UDF candidate as a Janata Dal (United) nominee, had lost to C.K. Nanu of the Janata Dal (Secular) in the 2016 Assembly polls. The rechristening of the JD(U) and its entry to the LDF seem to have given it a numerical advantage. In the recent local body polls, the RMP-UDF coalition had come to power in some grama panchayats. But the total number of votes of LDF candidates was higher than the RMP-UDF combine. The victory of LDF nominees in block panchayat and district panchayat divisions also gives the ruling front some hope. Ms. Rema had managed to get over 20,000 votes as a candidate not aligned to any of the fronts last time. The UDF hopes these votes along with Ms. Rema’s appeal to women voters and a section sympathetic to her within the CPI(M) will help her win. However, it is not going to be a cakewalk for both. There seems to be some heartburn within the JD(S) when its sitting seat was snatched away. A section of pro-Left voters are not reportedly sure about Mr. Chandran’s popular appeal. How these will reflect in the voting for the LDF candidate remains to be seen. Also, a section within the RMP was not happy about the UDF declaring Ms. Rema’s candidature much before that party made a formal announcement. Their differences with the Congress leadership is not a secret. New voters The choice of around 10,000 new voters will be key in determining the fate of both the candidates. The National Democratic Alliance has fielded M. Rajesh Kumar, who secured 13,937 votes last time. This heartland of North Malabar is among the few seats that has never elected a non-Left candidate as its MLA so far. That record will stay safe whoever wins this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/not-a-cakewalk-for-the-prime-contenders/article34127839.ece
22 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Namesakes abound in Kozhikode this time too||The usual spectacle of namesake candidates trying their luck continues in this Assembly election too in many segments in Kozhikode district. Their presence could pose a headache to rival fronts in seats where the contest is going to be close. In Vadakara K.K. Rema, the UDF-supported candidate put up by the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) in Vadakara, will have to face three namesakes — Rema, Rema K.K., and K.T.K. Rema. The RMP leader had two namesake rivals in 2016. In the Kuttiyadi segment, which witnessed a spate of protests by local CPI(M) leaders over the choice of the LDF candidate, there is a namesake pitted against the party candidate K.P. Kunhammed Kutty. His name is K.K. Kunhammed Kutty. M.K. Muneer, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader and UDF candidate from Koduvally, will have to face another M.K. Muneer and an Abdul Muneer. K. Praveen Kumar, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) secretary and UDF candidate in Nadapuram, has another Praveen Kumar to fight against. One Dharmendran has filed nomination against actor Dharmajan Bolgatty, who is contesting from Balussery. Noorbina Rasheed, the IUML’s lone woman nominee, who is contesting from Kozhikode South, is facing another Noorbina. Her rival from the Indian National League, Ahmed Devarkovil, has an Ahmed Koya against him. In Koyilandy, UDF candidate and Congress leader N. Subrahmanian and LDF candidate and CPI(M) leader Kanathil Jameela have namesakes against them. They are Subrahmanian and P.P. Jameela respectively. M.T. Ramesh, senior BJP leader and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate from Kozhikode, has two rivals named Ramesh. His UDF rival and Kerala Students Union (KSU) president K.M. Abhijith has to fight N. Abhijith. LDF’s Thottathil Raveendran too is facing another Raveendran as his rival. P.A.

22 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||‘NOC must for construction near West Hill barracks’||The Ministry of Defence has objected to the Kozhikode Corporation’s decision not to seek a No-Objection Certificate from the Ministry for construction activities beyond 10 metres from the defence compound (barracks) in West Hill in Kozhikode. The decision was taken at a meeting convened by Mayor Beena Philip following repeated complaints from local residents that the Defence Ministry was not permitting construction work near the barracks. It was noted at the meeting that NOC from the Ministry was not required in the case of the West Hill barracks, as it was applicable only to the Defence land in Kannur as per the Defence Ministry guidelines issued in 2016. Hence, the corporation decided to follow the Kerala Municipality Building Rules (KMBR) in which Defence NOC is sought if the construction activity is within 10 metres of the Defence land perimeter. Training activities District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao had also noted that only training activities were held in the West Hill barracks, and hence there was no threat to national security if buildings came up near the facility. However, in the reply to the Mayor’s letter to the Defence Secretary demanding explanation, it was specified that Defence NOC was required for any construction within 500 metres of the barracks as well as the Captain Vikram Maidan at West Hill. It also questioned the corporation’s decision to provide building permits beyond 10 metres from the Defence land perimeter. Meeting planned The corporation is planning to hold another meeting involving Defence authorities and people’s representatives soon to sort out the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/noc-must-for-construction-near-west-hill-barracks/article34127819.ece
22 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Bring puppetry out of shadow of obscurity, say artistes||Puppetry has played a major role in the social development of the State, but the art form and its practitioners rarely get any recognition or encouragement from the authorities, master puppeteers have said. Artistes representing around 30 puppetry groups in the State gathered in Kozhikode on Sunday to observe World Puppetry Day, when the foundation for a puppetry academy was laid. The academy is aimed at bringing different streams of puppetry prevalent in Kerala on a single platform. “There are less than 100 puppeteers in the State. The traditional forms of puppetry are getting endangered due to lack of new practitioners,” said P.N. Parameshwaran, Secretary of Kerala Educational Puppet Theatre. The puppeteers urged the government to establish a puppetry training centre in Palakkad, the centre of traditional puppetry in the State, on the lines of the Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT) in New Delhi, and to set up a museum to introduce the younger generation to the art form. “Modern puppetry is widely used these days for educational purposes and social campaigns. However, the traditional one still depends on the four months of temple festivals when it is often performed as a ritualistic art form,” they said. Five streams Tholpavakkoothu (leather puppetry), nokkuvidya pavakali, charadu pavakali (string puppetry), pavakathakali (puppet Kathakali), and Yakshagana puppetry are the five streams of puppetry practised in the State. Most of the existing puppetry groups are from Palakkad, while a few are from Kozhikode, Pathanamthitta and Kasaragod districts. The get-together was opened by T.P. Kunjiraman, a proponent of the modern stream of puppetry from Vadakara, Kozhikode. A seminar on ‘Possibilities of puppetry in the State’ was held. Five teams from different parts of the State presented their respective streams of puppetry on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bring-puppetry-out-of-shadow-of-obscurity-say-artistes/article34127895.ece
22 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||A platform for those with Down Syndrome||The ‘Sargasheshi’ showroom near YWCA on Kannur Road in Kozhikode is a symbol of endurance in the face of hardships. The handicraft products featured here are mostly the result of months-long effort put in by 15 individuals with Down Syndrome and their parents. Mayor Beena Philip opened the store on International Down Syndrome Day on Sunday. Sargasheshi is a joint venture of Down Syndrome Trust (DoST), a Kozhikode-based NGO providing support to individuals affected by Down Syndrome and ULCCS Foundation, the social responsibility wing of Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS). It is supported by the Sargaalaya Arts and Crafts Village at Iringal, where 15 teams were trained in various crafts. A salient feature of the store is that it is managed by three women affected by Down Syndrome. They have been trained at the UL Care-Nayanar Sadanam-Institute of Vocational Training and Placement for Adults with Intellectual Challenges. Sargasheshi also featured products made by differently abled people and a few other artisans from Sargaalaya and the Kerala Arts and Crafts Village at Vellar, Thiruvananthapuram. Later, Calicut University Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj honoured the actors of the movie Thirike based on the life of individuals with Down Syndrome. ULCCS Foundation director M.K. Jayaraj said, “Sargasheshi is the first of its kind in the country giving girls with Down Syndrome a big responsibility.” DoST founder and chairman Shaji Thomas John and DoST support group president T.J. Nasser Babu were present. World Down Syndrome Day is observed on March 21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-platform-for-those-with-down-syndrome/article34127818.ece
22 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Steps to be taken to prevent COVID spread||The Kozhikode district administration on Sunday said it would take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during the Assembly elections even as 241 more tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 here. Sectoral magistrates have been asked to take action against violation of pandemic protocol during public events such as election meetings, campaign conferences, and weddings. Secretaries of grama panchayats should disclose details of public events and weddings in grama panchayats to the sectoral magistrates. The District Collector will take direct action against those who disrupt the work of sectoral magistrates who have the powers of executive magistrates. Earlier, the district administration had said that the number of COVID tests would be increased in view of the steady rate of daily test positivity rate (TPR) from the district and the apparent reluctance on the part of people to undergo tests. The administration believes that COVID cases might see a surge after the elections. Mobile testing units would cover various institutions and offices from March 22 to 27. Of the fresh cases on Sunday, 229 were locally acquired infections and the source of 12 others was not known. As many as 4,436 samples were tested and the daily TPR was 5.43%. A total of 350 people recovered and the active caseload dropped to 3,018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-to-be-taken-to-prevent-covid-spread/article34127806.ece
22 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Excise registers 100 cases of illegal liquor trade||The special squads deployed by the Excise Department as part of election vigil have so far registered 100 cases pertaining to smuggling of Indian Made Foreign Liquor and narcotic substances. The cases were registered in the last three weeks under various Excise range offices in Kozhikode district. Officials said eight persons involved in major drug trafficking and illicit liquor sale cases were arrested during surprise inspections by the squads. Liquor samples were collected from several toddy shops and bar hotels to check adulteration. Of the 100 cases, 90 were registered under various sections of the Abkari Act. The remaining were related to smuggling of ganja and brown sugar. Excise inspectors who are part of the special drive said the support of three striking squads would be sought to conduct surprise checks based on confidential information. To cover district borders and interior roads, there will be separate teams of motorcycle squads, they added. Joint inspections with the support of other uniformed staff will also be conducted to comply with the Election Commission’s guidelines. Similar drives during the previous Assembly and local body elections had been found very effective. “As part of the heightened vigil, a district-level control room [0495-2372927] is functional for the public to pass on confidential information. Suspected instances of wooing voters with liquor or drugs can be reported through the control room number,” said an officer attached to the striking squad. He added that the department was getting many confidential complaints through the 24x7 control room.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/excise-registers-100-cases-of-illegal-liquor-trade/article34127809.ece

22 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||BJP sets sights on CPI(M) stronghold||One of the strongholds of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] in the State, Malampuzha remains a sure bet for the Left Democratic Front (LDF). But what throws this giant constituency into limelight this time is the hope the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reposes in Malampuzha. The BJP is pumping in a lot of resources to improve its position there. It appears that BJP State general secretary C. Krishnakumar might better his vote share in Malampuzha. He has been focusing on Malampuzha in the past five years since he lost to CPI(M) veteran and former Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan by 27,142 votes in 2016. Mr. Krishnakumar, who polled 28.9% votes, had pushed Congress’s V.S. Joy to the third position. Considering the vote share the BJP received in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and in the local civic body elections held last year, Mr. Krishnakumar is hopeful of noticeably improving his tally. What the BJP wants to cash in on is the lethargy visible in the Congress and the lack of freshness in the LDF. Trade union background LDF’s A. Prabhakaran and the UDF’s S.K. Ananthakrishnan have both come from different trade union backgrounds. When they follow the conventional methods of campaigning, Mr. Krishnakumar has been a tad aggressive in his electioneering. Formerly part of the Elappully constituency, Malampuzha favoured only the CPI(M) since the constituency came into being in 1965. Malampuzha started getting attention when former Chief Minister E.K. Nayanar successfully contested from there in 1980 and 1982. T. Sivadasa Menon held Malampuzha for the CPI(M) three terms from 1987. The incumbent V.S. Achuthanandan was elected from there in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. In the past five years, CPI(M)’s Mr. Prabhakaran was almost like a de facto representative as Mr. Achuthanandan’s failing health kept him away from Malampuzha. Solid network The LDF is banking on the solid CPI(M) network spread across the panchayats of Akathethara, Elappully, Kodumbu, Malampuzha, Marutharoad, Mundur, Puthupariyaram and Pudussery that constitute the Malampuzha constituency. The attrition suffered by the Congress was evident from the fact that it got reduced to zero seats in the Akathethara panchayat in the last local body polls, making the BJP the opposition party in the panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-sets-sights-on-cpim-stronghold/article34128047.ece
22 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Pushing for green politics||With big-ticket development projects and welfare schemes becoming prime poll planks for political parties for the upcoming Assembly elections, environmentalists have come together to drum up support for sustainable development and environmental conservation. The Kerala Paristhithi Aikya Vedi, a forum founded by late environmentalist-poet B. Sugathakumari, will organise a town hall meeting on environment, climate change, and the future of Kerala at the YMCA hall at Statue on Monday at 4 p.m. Organisers said political parties had ignored the need for a paradigm shift towards green development strategies and green politics, particularly in the context of the climate crisis post COVID-19. Bemoaning the glaring silence around climate change and the dire need for resilience strategies that are critical for a thriving future for the State, the vedi questioned why the Western Ghats, forests, encroachments, rivers and wetlands, hills and mountains, and the coast and its sustainability had never become an agenda for political fronts, media, and the public at large. Consultations While the floods of 2018 prompted consultations on climate change at various levels on how to handle such disasters in future, holistic action was still pending. While comprehensive action plans were still lacking, the issue had been sidelined during the COVID-19 outbreak, even while many subject experts pointed towards the possible role of climate change in the pandemic. The event will feature representatives of various political parties. Former Agriculture Minister and chairman of Legislative Committee on Environment Mullakkara Ratnakaran, MLA; Haritha Keralam Mission vice chairperson T.N. Seema; senior BJP leader Kummanam Rajasekharan; Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee public policy chairman John Samuel, former Deputy Speaker Palode Ravi, and A. Bijukumar, Head of the Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, Kerala University, will participate in the discussions. The discussions will be moderated by journalist Dhanya Rajendran.

22 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KWA comes out with meter policy||The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has for the first time come out with a meter policy which will govern all aspects of the metering of water use through KWA connections. Broadly, the policy is intended to promote efficient water use and reduce ‘non-revenue water’ (NRW) or water that gets ‘lost’ in supply due to reasons such as pilferage and leakage. Applicable to both domestic and non-domestic connections, it spells out best practices and guidelines to be followed in the selection, testing, installation, maintenance, and replacement of water meters. For guaranteeing efficient metering of water use, the policy requires consumers to replace the equipment every seven years, even if it is in working condition. At present, meters are replaced by consumers as and when they are reported as non-functional by the KWA staff. Over the years, the KWA has been plagued by inconsistencies in measuring water use. The problems have been further aggravated by the presence of defective and non-functional meters in the network. The policy lays out stringent quality norms for meters. “Only those meters that have been approved by the Fluid Control Research Institute (FCRI) either through the Model Approval Program (meter supplied by qualified suppliers published by FCRI ) or having FCRI type test and life cycle test certificate not older than 1.5 years can be used in all house connections,” it notes. The policy also stresses the importance of proper training to meter readers for adequately addressing the issue of inconsistent and inaccurate readings. Meter readers should also be trained to spot problems, including tampering, the policy notes. The policy is based on the provisions in the Kerala Water Supply and Sewerage Act and the Kerala Water Authority (Water Supply) Regulations. The State-run water utility had constituted a committee in July, 2020 to formulate strategies to overcome inconsistent and inaccurate water meter readings and also draft a water meter policy. The draft has now been cleared for implementation by the KWA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kwa-comes-out-with-meter-policy/article34127896.ece
22 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||IT land hosts a fierce fight||With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) finally ending the suspense over its candidate in Kazhakuttam, the battle lines are clear in the State Assembly constituency best known as the home of IT hub Technopark. The LDF candidate, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, and his UDF rival, the public health expert S. S. Lal, are several days into their campaigns. Sobha Surendran, whose candidature was declared by the BJP on March 17, is a late entrant on the scene. Nonetheless, Ms. Surendran’s presence adds intriguing dimensions to the fight for the constituency where the BJP had stood second in 2016. Mr. Surendran is seeking a second consecutive term from Kazhakuttam, having won in 2016 by over 7,300 votes. The Congress’s choice of Mr. Lal did not sit well with a section in the party, but the leadership calculates that his record as an globally known public health expert would carry the day for the front. The BJP draws confidence from the 2016 verdict when V. Muraleedharan, Minister of State for External Affairs, had finished second behind Mr. Surendran. That year, Congress’s M. A. Vahid, who had won in 2001, 2006 and 2011, was pushed to third spot. Kazhakuttam favoured Shashi Tharoor of the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. But senior BJP leader Kummanam Rajasekharan had finished a close second while the LDF’s C. Divakaran trailed third. A fast-evolving satellite township of the State capital, the Kazhakuttam segment boasts 18 wards of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. Its growth as one of India’s largest IT hubs, employing approximately 65,000 people, has also influenced the political dynamics of the region. First in 1965 The constituency first saw electoral battle in 1965, when N. Lakshmanan of the Congress defeated K.P. Alikunju of the CPI(M). It was from Kazhakuttam that A.K. Antony successfully fought the by-election in October 1977. In the 1987 Assembly polls, Kazhakuttam elected Nabeesa Ummal, the Left-backed Independent, as its representative. In the 1991 elections, it was Communist Marxist Party (CMP) leader M.V. Raghavan’s turn to represent the constituency. Hat-trick for Vahid Mr. Surendran regained the seat for the LDF in 1996. M.A. Vahid won the next three elections. In 2001, he won as a UDF ‘rebel,’ defeating Bindu Ummar of the CPI(M). Mr. Vahid repeated the feat as the official Congress candidate in 2006 and 2011. The constituency fell once again to the LDF in 2016, with Mr. Surendran scripting victory. The Sabarimala issue is sure to find top billing in the campaigns, especially since Mr. Surendran also holds the Devaswom portfolio. His recent remark that the incident had saddened everyone had drawn flak from both the UDF and the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/it-land-hosts-a-fierce-fight/article34127843.ece

The candidates of the three fronts spent Sunday touring the constituency, attending weddings, speaking at junctions and meeting key voters. From Monday onwards, the pace of their respective campaigns is expected to go up by several notches. V. Joy, the incumbent MLA and candidate of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), toured Navayikulam on the day. He started off his campaign on Sunday morning from the 28th mile junction and met voters at the Kallambalam market and the Navayikulam temple. Later in the day, Mr. Joy also interacted with sportspersons at Vadakkevayal. B.R.M. Shafeer, the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate, attended several weddings in the constituency and visited various religious institutions as part of the day’s tour. The campaign managers of Mr. Shafeer, who is a former Youth Congress spokesperson, said the first round of his campaign would end on Sunday. The NDA candidate in Varkala, Aji S.R.M. of the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), started his day’s tour of the segment from Punnamoodu market. After attending two temple festivals and a couple of weddings, he also participated in a ‘Mahasambarkam’ event as part of his campaign. Mr. Joy had defeated Mr. Varkala Kahar of the UDF in 2016 by a margin of 2,386 votes. Mr. Aji had been in third place that year, pocketing 19,872 votes.

22 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Pollsters trying to eclipse support for UDF: Chennithala||Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Sunday said pollsters had fraudulently placed the Left Democratic Front (LDF) ahead in electoral surveys to eclipse the groundswell of support for the United Democratic Front (UDF). At least two recent poll surveys had placed the UDF second to the LDF in the electoral race. Mr. Chennithala said the pollsters had also attempted to target him. Placed third Some surveys had placed Mr. Chennithala third in the choice between him, Oommen Chandy and Pinarayi Vijayan for the post of Chief Minister. The pollsters had behaved as the cat’s paw of powers he had exposed through his campaign against corruption. He said the surveys were no barometer of public opinion. They were limited in scope. The sampling barely skimmed the surface. Not even 15 of voters had participated in the surveys. Not people’s will The same set of people had conducted surveys for different media houses. Their findings did not reflect the will of the people. They merely provided a fig leaf to temporarily mask the looming defeat staring at the face of the LDF. In the previous Lok Sabha (LS) elections, pollsters had predicted that the LDF would win 12 to 15 seats. The UDF bagged 19 out of the 20. It trumped poll predictions. In Thiruvananthapuram LS segment, surveys predicted a win for Kummanam Rajasekharan of the BJP. However, Sashi Tharoor won by a margin of 1 lakh votes. In Palakkad, pollsters placed K. Sreekantan third in the surveys. He carried the battle. The trend would reflect again in the Assembly polls. Some sections of the mainstream media displayed a bias against the UDF. They seemed swayed by the glut of advertisements placed by the LDF. The BJP and LDF vied each other in spending power. Both fronts have spend astonishing amounts of money on election propaganda. Dares CM He dared Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to be candid about the government’s stance on Sabarimala. “Will you file an affidavit preventing the entry of women of childbearing age into the Ayyappa temple?” he asked.

A team of artists led by Ajith Kumar G. has adapted Rousseau’s work ‘The Repast of the Lion’ to create a mural for the election campaign of Minister and Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate Kadakampally Surendran in the Kazhakuttam Assembly segment here. Lion replaced Rousseau’s early 20th century work depicts a feeding lion against the backdrop of exotic vegetation. The eye-catching mural near Sreekaryam junction retains the lush, jungle backdrop, but the lion has been replaced by Mr. Surendran. A great hornbill, the State bird, perches on his left arm. A computer image of the ‘poll mural’ was projected on to the wall using an LCD projector and traced. In this manner, even large art works can be completed in a short time, according to Ajith Kumar. Promoting artists Another, 180-sq.ft mural has been created near the mini civil station at Kadakampally, also as part of Mr. Surendran’s campaign. Adding colour to the campaign aside, such works help to promote artists, Mr. Surendran says. Moreover, they stand out from your run-of-the-mill poll graffiti. Kazhakuttam is witnessing a pitched battle this time with Mr. Surendran, the sitting MLA, facing S.S.

22 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||State excluded from MGNREGS wage hike||Kerala and Lakshadweep have been excluded from the latest wage revisions of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers, issued by the Union Ministry of Rural Development on March 17. While all other States and Union Territories have witnessed at least a small increase in the existing wages, the MGNREGS wages for unskilled labourers in Kerala will remain at last year’s rate of Rs. 291 and Lakshadweep's at Rs. 266. According to officials of the MGNREGS State mission, it is not clear what parameters have been considered in the wage revision process to exclude a State like Kerala which has also faced the effects of spiralling consumer prices due to a constant increase in fuel and cooking gas prices. “We are unaware of the reasons for excluding Kerala. The wage rate revision is usually done based on the consumer price index for agricultural labourers and unskilled wage rate in the agricultural sector. There has been an upward shift in the consumer price index in the State this year. The minimum wage rate in Kerala in the agricultural sector is Rs. 490 now, but the MGNREGS wage rate fixed by the centre still remains at Rs. 291. We also have to consider the fact that the minimum wages in Kerala are much higher than in many other States, which is now not getting reflected in the MGNREGS wages,” says the official. Last year, there was an increase of Rs. 20 for the MGNREGS labourers in Kerala, along with an increase in other States. Among the States which have an increase this year, Meghalaya has the highest with Rs. 23 increase, while the lowest is Rajasthan with Rs. 1 increase. In the poll-bound States and Union Territories, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have a considerable increase of Rs. 17 each, while Assam has Rs. 11 and West Bengal Rs. 9. Many of the States have much lesser wages compared to Kerala, despite the increase. As per the notification on wage revision issued by the Union Ministry of Rural Development, the Election Commission has conveyed its ‘no objection’ from the mode of conduct angle to the wage hike, considering that elections are upcoming in some States. But the government is not supposed to carry out any publicity regarding the hikes and no political functionary should make any reference regarding this in public speeches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-excluded-from-mgnregs-wage-hike/article34127893.ece

22 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Journeying in the exotic company of colours||Swathes of verdant lands, marshes with hints of lost worlds, mountains with secrets in their caves, may all be a traveller’s delight but for an artist these are heady designs reflecting the essence of life. Sriraj Thanyam’s travels are to seek such designs or to understand that the world he traverses is an alluring part of a mesmerising whole. The seeking helps him merge science, philosophy and art effortlessly, recreating lively shades that tell vivid stories. Twenty-seven of such works are being exhibited at the Thiruvananthapuram Press Club on March 22 and 23. Artist Kanayi Kunhiraman will inaugurate the exhibition. “I celebrate colours in my paintings. Even in the deepest agony, there are hues of joy,” he said, explaining the work on Ammayambalam pacha where summer uniquely blends aridity and forest cover. Revealing this trait further is the series on COVID-19 lockdown. “The colours of being free with one’s inner self fills these paintings,” Sriraj says. This series was mostly done during his retirement phase, after having served The Hindu as a Deputy Editor. A grove with reptiles In another, he uses wavy shades to replicate the memories of his native village. “I lived in a place where there was a thick grove infested with reptiles. It was a life in harmony with the ecosystem,” he says. Not just the natural frames of his travels, each of his life experiences is also a mix of colours. The work of Christ holding a child is an example. “I drew this when I became a grandfather. Subdued colours with bright ones shows how much I enjoyed the phase,” he says. Colours dominate his art work in its technique too. “It is my journey so far, which I plan to undertake as far as I can,” says Sriraj, who would also be exhibiting his works in Thrissur from March 28 to 31 and in Kozhikode from April 10 to 13 at the respective Kerala Lalithakala Akademi centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/journeying-in-the-exotic-company-of-colours/article34127857.ece
22 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||‘Sabarimala a scar in the mind of devotees’||Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has been in an almost permanent state of agitation against the LDF government since 2016. Now, Mr. Chennithala perhaps also has to make the delicate case that he could lead a future UDF government as well if mandated by the Congress high command. The political significance of former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy contesting the Assembly election seemed not lost on the Chennithala camp. Moreover, the Congress has not projected any one as its Chief Minister candidate. In contrast, the LDF has named Pinarayi Vijayan as its Chief Minister if voted to power for a second consecutive term. Taking time off a hectic campaign schedule, Mr. Chennithala told The Hindu that a UDF win was inevitable. Sabarimala was a scar in the mind of Ayyappa devotees. Their pain would reflect in the Assembly election. The government appeared belatedly apologetic about its ham-fisted attempt to enact the 2018 Supreme Court verdict allowing women's entry. However, the LDF was patently unwilling to revoke the dubious affidavit that prompted the Supreme Court's majority decision in the first place. RSS ideologue R. Balashankar had spotlighted the CPI(M)-BJP axis. The covert alliance extended across the State. The issues Mr. Chennithala had raised as the Opposition Leader still resonated among voters. On corruption It had also made him a target of big business. The LDF had sensed an opportunity in every calamity to indulge in corruption. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it allowed a U.S.-based big data analytics firm to mine the personal medical information of Keralites. At the fag of its tenure, the LDF sought to allow a foreign fishing firm to exploit the State's marine wealth at an industrial scale. Fishers rose in revolt against the scheme. The UDF led the protests from the front. The government backtracked. Mr. Chennithala said nearly two lakh LDF sympathisers were primed to double or triple vote in the Assembly election. Nefarious actors in the government had accorded multiple voter identities to LDF workers and their kin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sabarimala-a-scar-in-the-mind-of-devotees/article34127841.ece

Speaking to media persons here on Sunday, Mr. Namgyal alleged a complete breakdown of law and order in the State with CPI(M) cadres “running amok”. “Crime against women is on the rise. While the LDF scuttled the probe in the Walayar case (pertaining to the death of two minors), as many as 32 political murders have taken place during the last five years,” he said. Gold smuggling case The BJP leader said gold smuggling case had brought shame to the people of the Kerala. For the first time in the country, a Chief Minister’s office was hand-in-glove with smugglers, he said. He also accused the government of ignoring youth welfare and failing to address the problem of unemployment. Several deserving people were being denied jobs, despite there being a State Public Service Commission. The situation even prompted a 28-year old rank-holder to commit suicide recently, he said. He added that while Ladakh that had witnessed stagnant growth for several decades was currently on the path of development, Kerala had not been able to achieve satisfactory growth levels during the last seven decades.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-govt-harbouring-religious-fundamentalists-ladakh-mp/article34128037.ece

He was addressing ‘Youth for new Kerala’, a youth town hall organised by the BJYM here on Sunday evening. Mr. Surya alleged that every department under the LDF government was associated with a scam. Alluding to the row over Public Service Commission recruitment, he said only the kith and kin of LDF ministers were getting jobs. It was time to put an end to such blatant nepotism, he said. The MP said the State was predominantly a remittances-based economy. People had to go outside Kerala to get good education and employment. The reason was that successive governments had not created adequate employment opportunities for the educated Malayali youth. Progress was being hindered in the name of communism and socialism. He alleged that in the name of women empowerment, the LDF government tried to destroy the temple traditions of Sabarimala. However, its commitment to women empowerment was questionable. How many seats had the LDF allotted to women candidates in the Assembly elections or the Congress for that matter, he asked. “I can say that it is the BJP that has given the highest number of tickets to women in Kerala,” he said. The Congress and the Communists were in competition to prove who would support Islamic radicals more. The SPDP, PFI, the Welfare Party all were being encouraged by them. The MP alleged that major Central scheme were not being implemented in the State. Yet the Union government had managed to do quite a bit in areas such as Jan Dhan Yojana, PMAY, Ujjwala scheme, Kisan Samman Nidhi, and so on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-govt-most-corrupt-in-states-history-bjp-mp/article34128036.ece

Surendran Pillai, who contested as the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate in the Nemom constituency in 2016, has accused the Congress of trading votes with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) paving the way for his defeat. Speaking to The Hindu here on Sunday, he said that some in the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leadership were aware of this vote trading. Info on vote trade He said he had got information regarding the vote trade two days before the polling, by when it was too late to make amends. “The Congress has a tradition of awarding seats to its allies and then trading votes to the opposite party. This happened at Nemom in 2011 too, when Charupara Ravi contested. Former KPCC President V.M. Sudheeran was the only leader who dealt honestly with this issue. After I lost, we raised the demand for an enquiry. The enquiry report recommended action against five Congress leaders, but it never saw the light of the day. Now BJP leader O. Rajagopal, who won from Nemom, has also confirmed this understanding,” says Mr. Pillai, who is with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) now. Nemom seat in 2016 The UDF that won the Nemom seat in 2006 with 60,884 votes, found its vote share reduced to 20,248 in 2011 and 13,860 in 2016, when Mr. Pillai contested. He rejected the claim by some UDF leaders that the constituency was lost because he was a weak candidate. “For a candidate to be weak, there should either be some serious allegation against the person or there should be some failings in the campaigning or there should be a shortage of funds. We had no issues on these three counts. I have won twice before, in Punalur and Thiruvananthapuram West, and became a Minister. How could I have achieved all this if I were weak? All of them were with me for the campaigning, but they were with the UDF only during the day time,” says Mr. Pillai. Mr. Pillai said that with Congress leader K. Muraleedharan in the fray this time in Nemom, the flow of votes to BJP could cease, giving an advantage to the LDF candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ljd-leader-accuses-cong-of-vote-trading/article34127885.ece

Addressing ‘Mahila Town Hall,’ a get-together of women professionals organised by the BJP Mahila Morcha here on Sunday, she said the BJP was the only real game changer. Mocking the both the fronts, she said it was not the LDF and the UDF, but it was the LUDF. “The NDA was fighting against the LUDF in the State. Both were corrupt. Corruption, policies and scandals, everything is the same. Only some faces are changing.” Women’s role Congratulating the BJP’s women brigade, who stood against the LDF government in the Sabarimala issue, she said women know what was good for society. “Both the LDF and the UDF are talking about women’s liberation. But it does not reflect on their list of candidates. The LDF claims they are secular and the BJP is communal. But the LDF government is partial towards the Muslims and discriminating against Christians and other minorities.” Criticising the arrest of people involved in rooster sacrifice at Kodungalloor, Ms. Lekhi said thousands of poultry birds, cows, buffaloes and goats were killed everyday and eaten. “Why there is no case against them. They only want to hurt Hindu sentiments,” she said. When Kerala boasts about high literacy rates, people had to leave their home and parents for higher studies. This was due to bad governance. Trade unionism had ruined the industries. There was no development in the State. She called upon the women to campaign actively for the BJP to bring a change in the State. “If women work for a change, it will definitely happen,” she said. She urged the people to vote for Suresh Gopi, National Democratic Alliance candidate for Thrissur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-udf-engaging-in-mock-fights/article34127811.ece

22 March 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pre-historic era postholes found at Neelakantapuram||The State Archaeology Department, assisted by the Cultural Centre of Vijayawada and Amaravati (CCVA), unearthed some articles and postholes on large stones of the Megalithic / Neolithic period at Neelakantapuram village of Madakasira mandal in Anantapur district on Sunday. On credible information provided by former APCC president N. Raghuveera Reddy that some remnants of the pre-historic period existed close to his agriculture fields, a team visited the village and found ‘slots’ and ‘postholes’ on a large rock surface close to the fields that were probably used for pitching tents during 3,700 BCE and 3,200 BCE. State Archaeology Department’s Anantapur Assistant Director Rajitha too accompanied the team and assured people of protecting the sites. Pottery unearthed “It was during this period that agriculture had been taken up. Sling balls were used for driving away birds from the crops. The slots close to the pitched tents were used to store the sling balls,” CCVA Chief Executive Officer Emani Sivanagi Reddy told The Hindu . The team also got several shreds of pottery, which were identical and typical of that era. “That this site existed during the ‘Iron Age’ was further confirmed from the deposits of iron slag (porous in nature) found there. All this points to the existence of human habitation in the region during the period,” Mr. Sivanagi Reddy added. A medieval period idol of Mahishasura Mardini (8th century) in black stone, probably by the early Chalukyas, was also found close to the site. The Mahishasura depicted as a buffalo was distinct of that period. During the later period of the Vijayanagara kings, the depiction was different with a human head attached to it, he explained. Other idols of 12th century were also found along with a ‘Sivalinga’ and ‘Kalyani’. Dean, School of History, Culture & Archaeology, Srisailam, P. Chenna Reddy, and CCVA assistant Manjunath were present along with Mr. Raghuveera Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pre-historic-era-postholes-found-at-neelakantapuram/article34127748.ece
22 March 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Masks compulsory at schools and public places in Chittoor||The COVID-19 task force officials on Sunday instructed the managements of all private and government schools in the district to compulsorily enforce the facemask rule among students, in addition to ensuring that there was no congregation of students on the premises either during assembly or lunch breaks. A team of task force officials, who conducted a series of inspections at schools, welfare hostels, cinema theatres and shopping malls in Puttur and Nagari municipalities from Friday till Sunday, said that after three teachers of a government school under Nagari limits tested positive, instructions were issued for closure of the school for three days from Monday. Fines Meanwhile, Deputy Superintendent of Police (Chittoor) N. Sudhakar Reddy said that in view of the sudden spike of the cases in the district, the facemask rule had been enforced at all public places from Sunday and the defaulters would be fined heavily. Task Force special officer P. Ravi Raju said that mandal educational officers in areas bordering Tamil Nadu were asked to see to it that the COVID-appropriate behaviour was followed strictly in schools, as the neighbouring State is registering high number of cases every day. “It is the responsibility of teachers and parents to ensure that students are not lax towards the protocols. Teachers have been asked to monitor distribution of midday meals and ensure that physical distancing was not given a go-by. It is also under contemplation to allow only morning session in the schools,” he said. Vigil at check-posts The special officer said that officials from various departments, including police, revenue, medical and health, gathered for a meeting and took a decision to mount vigil at the border check-posts to ensure that people entering the district have worn masks. “The RTC officials also have been sought to discourage passengers from embarking the buses without masks. In case of a passenger not having a mask, the conductor could provide him one. The police officials said that they would impose fine on the defaulters,” Dr. Ravi Raju said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/masks-compulsory-at-schools-and-public-places-in-chittoor/article34127984.ece
22 March 2021||EDUGURALLAPALLI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Barter continues in this East Godavari hamlet||The Edugurallapalli tribal shandy that gathers on Fridays is reminiscent of the ancient barter system, where tribals exchange forest produce for rice, iodised salt and other commodities. The shandy is in Chintoor Agency in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district. The majority of those engaged in exchanging the forest produce are Muria tribal women from Banda and Muriagudem areas in the Naxal-hit Sukma region in Chhattisgarh. In the ‘exchange trade practice’, middlemen have the privilege of deciding the worth of the forest produce, exploiting tribals who have to deal with them for various commodities. Communication in the tribal language enables non-tribal middlemen to convince the Muria to sell their products at a throwaway cost. On March 19, this correspondent had documented the thriving sales at the shandy, where tribals traded sesame seeds, dry mahua flowers, tamarind seeds and tamarind fruit primarily in exchange for two commodities — rice and iodised salt. Very few tribals were accepting money to buy other commodities they needed, which are not offered by the middlemen in the barter system. Presently, a kg of dried mahua flowers (used to brew liquor) and sesame are being traded for two kg of rice or a few packets of iodised salt. The rice being traded by the middlemen is arguably supplied under the Public Distribution System (PDS). At Rs. 16 per kg, the middlemen are offering 2 kg of rice for the equal quantity of sesame seed and mahua flower. For tamarind and soapnuts, the tribals are offered either rice or salt as per their preference. A group of Muria tribal women from the Banda area in Sukma district told The Hindu : “Edugurallapalli is the nearest shandy, where we exchange mahua flower, tamarind and other minor products for rice and other commodities.” The women sell other products including orange for cash to purchase something as per their need. A majority of them are women who trade the forest products in the shandy. The number of products traded here changes every season, according to some traders. Land of Mahua Mahua is traded in the shandy round the year as the Muria tribe arrives here from India’s Mahua Bowl - Chhattisgarh. Another trader from Sukma said, “A majority of the mahua dry flower, bought from the Muria tribe in the goods exchange mode, will be purchased by the local tribes of Andhra Pradesh. The local tribes brew liquor from the flower for their family and community rituals.” Once a bastion for the Left Wing Extremists until Operation Green hunt, the shandy is run under the watch of the CRPFand AP Special Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/barter-continues-in-this-andhra-hamlet/article34127368.ece

Earlier, we visited Perupalem and Manginapudi beaches. But, at Hamsaladeevi, the mada forests on either sides of the road en-route the beach were scenic,” said a tourist Swarna Latha. “We came to Mopidevi temple and after darshan proceeded to Koduru beach. The APSRTC is operating buses to the nearby villages and the officials arranged changing rooms and security at the beach. The creeks, mudflats, play areas for children and the temples are enchanting,” said another visitor Ranga Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/koduru-beach-sees-a-swell-in-picnickers/article34127450.ece
22 March 2021||Kurnool,ANDHRA PRADESH||Water recedes at Lord Siva temple after eight months||The Sri Sangameswaram Temple, that was submerged last year following heavy inflows into Srisailam reservoir from Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers, has re-surfaced as the water has receded after 248 days. The temple, situated in the backwaters of the reservoir, remains submerged for four-five months every year. But this year, it was under waters for eight months. While the cleaning process of the sanctum sanctorum began on Sunday, the temple archaka Telakapalli Raghurama Sarma said that the darshan of Lord Siva can be had from Monday. The archaka, along with other staff, inspected the temple on Sunday. The Sivalinga, he said, was still under one-and-a-half feet of water which is expected to recede by Monday afternoon. Note of caution However, he sounded a word of caution for some days as the approach road was not fully dry and was still filled with water at several places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/water-recedes-at-lord-siva-temple-after-eight-months/article34127442.ece

Addressing the media at Pellakur in Nellore district, he said YSRCP supremo Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy sought the people’s mandate in 2019 by promising to secure Special Category Status and other assurances made by the Centre at the time of united Andhra Pradesh’s bifurcation on the floor of Parliament if the party was provided a maximum number of MP seats. “With 22 MP seats in its kitty it has remained a mute spectator at a time when the Union government meted out a raw deal to the State,” he charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-mps-failed-to-protect-states-interests/article34127443.ece

Handing over the vehicles to the personnel, Prakasam Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal said the step taken by the State government would go a long way towards improving the efficiency of the police force and ensure visible policing so that women feel more secure. Later, women police took out an impressive rally from the APSRTC bus station across the city to instill confidence among women and send a message that they are available for help round the clock. “The women police staff chairing the help desks set up across the district would rush to the spot on receipt of distress calls and curb incidents of crime in no time.

22 March 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Prakasam district steps up testing as cases spike||In a twin-pronged strategy, health authorities in Prakasam district have stepped up testing as well as giving more thrust to the vaccination programme after coronavirus cases began rising again after showing a declining trend in the last couple of months. “The number of persons tested was of the order of 3,000 per day till recently. Now, we have doubled the number of people subjected to testing after isolating primary and secondary contacts of the infected persons,” Prakasam District Medical and Health Officer P. Ratnavalli told The Hindu . “In addition to this, we are focusing on the vaccination drive to cover each and every person above 60 years of age by conducting a door-to-door survey after finding that voluntary registration of senior citizens is not up to the mark,” she said. “We are reaching out to old-age pensioners, who number over four lakh in the district, by collecting data from the District Rural Development Agency and District Water Management Agency so that we can give them the vaccines,” she added. Noting that a majority of persons in the targeted group, especially in rural areas, did not know how to register themselves online for the vaccine, a Digital Assistant and Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) have been posted in each of the 1,058 village secretariats. Senior citizens can walk into these offices at any time and register themselves for the vaccine. They can also visit any of the session sites set up at public and private hospitals for on-the-spot registration to take the vaccine, Dr. Ratnavalli said. As many as 74,380 persons, including 17,416 healthcare workers and 21,982 frontline warriors, had been administered the first dose of vaccine and 18,193 of them the second dose of vaccine in the district. As many as 34, 982 senior citizens have also taken the vaccine so far.

22 March 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘YSRCP misused volunteer system to score poll victories’||BJP State president Somu Veerraju has flayed the YSRCP government for “misusing the volunteer system” to score a huge victory in the recent panchayat and municipal elections. Addressing the media here on Sunday, Mr. Veerraju accused the ruling party of having resorted to large-scale misuse of official machinery, while the “unofficial volunteer set-up” had given it an additional edge over the rivals. Branding the volunteer system as a rehabilitation centre for party sympathisers and workers, he rubbished the claim that the system was being lauded across the country for its outreach. “It is nothing but the ‘Page Pramukh’ set-up already in vogue in the BJP, where registered volunteers render service to the people,” he said. He also dared the government to appoint BJP workers in the same posts if the volunteer set-up in the State was indeed apolitical. Mr. Veerraju sought to know on what basis the volunteers could threaten the beneficiaries of social security schemes that the same would be withdrawn if they did not vote for the ruling party. “Is it a laudable act? No, this is mockery of democracy that leaves the State exchequer bleeding by Rs. 35,000 crore every year,” he sneered. He accused the ruling party of not winning the recent elections with public support, but through “deceitful means.” He also criticised the manner in which unanimous wins were declared in several divisions and wards, and announced to lodge a complaint with the relevant authorities against the set-up being misused by the ruling party. The party announced a list of in-charge and co in-charge leaders for the Assembly segments forming part of the Tirupati (SC) Lok Sabha constituency. State spokesperson Samanchi Srinivas, general secretaries Suryanarayana Raju and Lokula Gandhi, parliamentary constituency in-charge S. Dayakar Reddy were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-misused-volunteer-system-to-score-poll-victories/article34128005.ece

22 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||E-auction of red sanders logs from April 9||The Forest Department has prepared a schedule for the global e-auction of the seized red sanders logs. The red sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus) is among the endangered tree species found in Chittoor, Kadapa, Kurnool and Nellore districts of Andhra Pradesh. There have been no auctions for the last one-and-a-half years for various reasons, primary among them being the outbreak of COVID-19. According to information, the government will issue a single notification for the three-phase auctions on April 9, 16 and 23. About 318 tonnes of ‘A’ grade red sanders logs will go under the hammer this time. The seized logs have been stocked at the central godown in Tirupati. The government could sell 1,251 tonnes of ‘A’ logs in 13 phases between 2014-15 and 2018-19, and earn Rs. 505 crore at an average price of Rs. 40.3 lakh per tonne. Logs weighing 8,179 tonnes, which include A, B, and C grades, have been sold till date, fetching more than Rs. 1,666 crore. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests N. Prateep Kumar says that the auction is expected to fetch up to Rs. 120 crore. The process for the sale of other grades too is under way. “The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) has given an in-principle approval for the auction,” says Mr. Kumar. In fact, the deadline to sell the red sanders logs seized from the smugglers ended in December 2019. It was later extended up to December 2020. However, the government, due to the pandemic, could not conduct the auction as the global players demand physical verification of the stock. The department sought extension of the licence, which was approved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/e-auction-of-red-sanders-logs-from-april-9/article34127369.ece

22 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Meagre’ rise in MGNREGA wages decried||The “measly wage hike” under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has come under attack by the activists. “In 2021-22, the average hike in wages of the unskilled workers is mere 4%, and such low rise is unfair,” said D. Rama Devi, State general secretary of All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA). In a statement on Sunday, she said the nominal raise in the wages of the daily workers would not serve any purpose, especially in view of the sky-rocketing prices of essential commodities. A majority of these workers comprised Dalits, adivasis, or single women. The works provided under the Central scheme were the only source of living for them, she said. Ms. Rama Devi said the BJP-led government at the Centre was pro-rich and anti-poor. She said these daily wage workers, who had returned to their homes during the lockdown, had started returning for work in large numbers. The government, instead of increasing their wages as they were still reeling under the pandemic impact, had slashed the budget under the scheme. ‘Wide disparity’ Ms. Rama Devi said there was no rationale behind the wage determination as there were wide disparities between the wages fixed for different States. The highest rise of Rs. 23 was given to workers in Meghalaya. It was Rs. 7 in AP and Telangana and Rs. 3 in M.P. and Chhattisgarh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/meagre-rise-in-mgnrega-wages-decried/article34128006.ece
22 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Efforts on to control salinity in Godavari||Bhimavaram MLA Grandhi Srinivas on Sunday invited suggestions from experts for construction of two more barrages downstream of Dowleswaram Barrage to prevent the impact of the saline water of the sea in the delta region. He said he would then submit a proposal to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. The MLA, who visited the Water and Environment Testing (WET) Centre established at SRKR Engineering College, said there has to be a way to overcome the problem. He said there was also a need to tap the flood water that goes into the sea every year. Referring to the government’s proposal to construct two barrages downstream of Prakasam Barrage to save flood water, the MLA said similar structures at Dowleswaram across the Godavari would help this region. Responding to MLA’s observation that WET Centre should not be confined to research projects but also develop scientific mechanisms to solve the problems of the farmers in the region, college principal M. Jagapathi Raju said they would make efforts in that direction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/efforts-on-to-control-salinity-in-godavari/article34127447.ece

Satyanarayana Murthy has condemned the reported statement of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal in Parliament that Waltair Division would soon be a thing of the past. In a statement here on Sunday, Mr. Murthy recalled that the BJP government had hastily declared the South Coast Railway Zone (S Co R), with headquarters in Visakhapatnam, just before the general elections in 2019. He warned that the BJP would have to pay a heavy price, if it went ahead with its decision to do away with Waltair Division altogether. A fresh agitation would be launched to seek retaining of Waltair Division apart from demanding early commencement of new zone works. He noted that the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) of S Co R had submitted a Detailed Project Report (DPR) to the Railway Board saying that Rs. 175 crore would be required for the new zone. But in the last budget, a mere Rs. 3 crore was allotted to S Co R, thereby cheating the people of the State, he alleged. Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy also demanded that the State government convene an all-party meeting to exert pressure on the Centre for retaining of Waltair Division and early operationalisation of the new zone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-criticises-ministers-statement-on-waltair-division/article34128072.ece

Raju has alleged. A padayatra was organised by the party Jagadamba zone committee here on Sunday to solicit the support of people on the proposed Bharat bandh on March 26. Mr. Raju said that the steep hike in the prices of essential commodities like diesel and petrol had resulted in the prices of other commodities going up. Though there was no hope on rise in income levels, the State government was contemplating a hike in water tax and drainage tax with effect from April 1, he alleged. The amendment of agriculture laws would cause untold hardship to farmers, he said.

22 March 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Soldier arrested for trying to ‘extort’ Rs. 5 cr. from gold trader||The police on Sunday arrested a soldier of the Indian Army on the charge of trying to extort Rs. 5 crore from a gold merchant by posing himself as a Maoist and threatening to eliminate him if the amount was not paid. Superintendent of Police B. Rajakumari said the accused, Chandanapalli Rajeswara Rao (27), had allegedly threatened Indupuru China Gumpa Swamy, a merchant at Parvatipuram in the district, with a country-made pistol and insisted on immediate payment of the amount. Later, the accused had made several phone calls between March 11 and 17, following which the trader had agreed to pay Rs. 1.5 crore. Mr. Swamy later lodged a complaint with the Parvatipuram police, who nabbed the accused at a secluded place between Vikrapuram and Dangabhadra villages when he had come there to receive the money. The accused told the police that he had lost Rs. 22 lakh in a land deal and tried to earn it back by hook or by crook. Rajeswara Rao said he had joined the Army in 2012 and was working in U.P. “The accused hatched the plan three months ago and targeted the merchant. We have arrested him after thorough investigation,” Ms. Rajakumari told the media. The SP said that Rajeswara Rao, a native of Bantuvanivalasa village of Parvatipuram mandal, resorted to the crime after reportedly drawing inspiration from ‘Mirzapur’, a television web series.

22 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Early signs of COVID ‘spike’ from March 9||In the past few days, discussions about rising COVID-19 cases seem to be dominating living rooms, office spaces and educational institutions. The spike has been observed since March 9, and the State has logged more than 300 cases for three days in a row. It was not too long ago that the Health department held felicitation programmes for healthcare workers (HCWs) to mark one year of COVID-19 pandemic in the State. Gandhi Hospital administration presented awards to the HCWs on March 2, the anniversary of the first COVID case to be detected here, and to those who have been at the forefront of managing the pandemic. The cases, which peaked till October last year, started to drop from November 2020. From 1,400 to 2,000 cases a day throughout October, daily cases dropped to less than 1,000 by November-end. The gradual slide continued. From January 23 of this year, less than 200 cases a day were recorded and that continued throughout February. According to the details presented in the daily media bulletin issued by the Health department, a maximum of 170 people were detected with the virus in a day from March 1 to 8 this year. Thereafter, the cases started to spike again in Telangana. On March 9 and 10, the cases detected stood at 189 and 194 respectively. Since these were early signs, and not an alarming number, discussions about the ‘spike’ had not begun then. People started to take notice when 216 cases were detected on March 12. It was after 48 days that over 200 cases had been recorded in the State. Health minister Eatala Rajender held a meeting with district officials where surge in cases in neighbouring States was discussed and directions issued to test over 50,000 samples a day. The State’s caseload increased to 228 the following day. From March 16, the surge picked up again. Clusters of cases Apart from the spike, another factor that caught people’s attention was the detection of COVID-19 clusters in schools and hostels. Among the first clusters was one in Mancherial. After a teacher from the Zilla Parishad High School, Mancherial, was detected with the virus, 55 people from the school were tested on March 15. Health teams found 12 more teachers, one cook and a student to have the infection. The following day, the cluster size increased to 50, including six parents of students. Health teams in most districts started to conduct routine tests at schools and hostels. As testing increased, more clusters started to emerge. Another cluster of 34 cases was detected among students at Telangana Minority Residential School located in Nagole on March 16. Next, 32 COVID cases were detected among students of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, Tekrial, in Kamareddy district. In Rangareddy, 22 students at ST Boys Hostel, Rajendranagar, were detected with COVID-19. ICU admissions increase As cases increased, admission of COVID-19 patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) also went up. From around 630-720 ICU admissions per day in December 2020, it had dropped to 340-370 a day between March 1 and 14. On March 15 and 16, there were over 400 ICU admissions of COVID patients. On March 19 and 20, the numbers stood at 513 and 515.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/early-signs-of-covid-spike-from-march-9/article34127770.ece
22 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Traffic rules given a go-by at U-turns||More than a year since the new Motor Vehicle Act penalties were notified by the Central government, Telangana remains a standout by not implementing the stiff fines. “Motorists are afraid of drunken driving penalties, but they don’t care about wrong-side driving or helmet-less driving. We catch people with seven or nine challans and they are not bothered,” says a traffic police officer who stood with his posse of colleagues to catch traffic rule violators near Mughal ka Naka. The location is one of the U-turns created by the Hyderabad Traffic Police to speed up flow of traffic. It is also one of the sites for blatant violations of traffic rules as motorists cross the road and drive on the other side to drive towards Karwan when the police officials disappear. “If there is a signal at this site, people will have to wait for at two to three minutes. Now they just drive continuously. They spend about 30 or 40 seconds more,” says the traffic official explaining the logic of the U-turns. At similar U-turns in the city where motorists have to drive long distances to go to the other side, traffic has become chaotic due to persistent rule-breaking. Under the Tarnaka flyover, among the first sites where the U-turn experiment was tried, motorists now use a small space to walk with their vehicles and then zip on the road. At the Rythu Bazaar junction in Mehdipatnam, where two U-turns blend into traffic coming from two roads, it is sheer providence that there have been no major accidents. Adding to the chaos are the flower sellers sitting along the pavement and fruit vendors who occupy the narrow road. Motorists from Gudimalkapur drive on the wrong side and against the flow of traffic to drive towards Masab Tank risking their lives. The result? Police officials have to man the junction for a few hours to manage the traffic. But once the police officials disappear, the traffic becomes a mayhem. “They stand here everyday between 10 a.m and 1.30 p.m. and strike terror among motorists. Our business goes down during the time the traffic policemen are here as people are scared to stop or slow down,” says Ateeq, a businessman in the Jyotinagar area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/traffic-rules-given-a-go-by-at-u-turns/article34127782.ece
22 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||MMTS Phase II project faces an uncertain future||Hope floated for the next phase of metro rail construction, but for patrons of MMTS, hopes of the second phase reaching fruition at least this year are dashed. The government has not provided a single penny to the joint venture suburban rail project in this year’s budget despite appeals by commuters and Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, who is also the Secunderabad MP. “It is very unfortunate with political differences being the main reason. I have been seeing this for so many years. The work, too, has slowed down with the government not releasing more than Rs. 500 crore payments due to South Central Railway (SCR). People living in the suburbs are suffering,” bemoans Noor Ahmed Ali, secretary of the Suburban Train Travellers’ Association. He and several others have been knocking on the doors of the railways and government departments seeking early completion of the project, scheduled to have been commissioned in 2018. Phase two project for about 85 km and more was conceived at an initial cost of about Rs. 641 crore more than a decade ago with the then government signing a pact to fund two-thirds of the cost, following the successful launch of MMTS Phase 1. The first phase was taken up on 50% cost-sharing basis. The services have not resumed since the pandemic-induced lockdown last year. The cost ballooned to Rs. 817 crore over time as initially, the railways sat on the proposal because suburban train systems were considered to be ‘loss making’ and the lines were not said to be “not sufficient to accommodate running more local trains”. By the time realisation dawned that railways need the infrastructure network — suburban services or not, the priorities got changed along with the governments here. ‘Seeking funds’ “We are constantly in touch with the government seeking release of funds as the project in the final stage. We have spent more already to commission the lines expeditiously. We will make use of upcoming infrastructure to run existing freight and passenger trains more efficiently once prevailing construction ‘gaps’ are bridged,” said senior railway officials, seeking anonymity. In other words, the local rail network linking the suburbs will not happen even if the railways finishes the remaining works. SCR is already putting to use the first phase of MMTS Phase-II 5.75-km Ramachandrapuram to Tellapur route to use for the past two years. ‘Construction gaps’ are between Sanathnagar-Moula Ali 19 km, Falaknuma-Umdanagar 13 km, Kacheguda-Sitaphalmandi-Moula Ali 10 km, Moula Ali-Ghatkesar 12.2 km and Secunderabad-Malkajgiri-Medchal 25 km electrification, doubling, signalling, stations construction, level crossings etc., are on. “Once completed, we can be in a position to run more trains towards Mumbai and Bengaluru besides bypassing the freight trains away from Secunderabad station,” explained senior officials. MMTS patrons, like Mr. Noor, request the railways to focus on the tracks, electrification and level crossings rather than buildings on suburban routes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mmts-phase-ii-project-faces-an-uncertain-future/article34127773.ece
22 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Not enough funds for upkeep of heritage records||The Telangana State Archives and Research Institute (TSARI), which is the custodian of around 43 million documents of several types, has received a paltry allocation of approximately Rs. 4.30 crore in the budget presented on March 18. A major chunk of the amount will go to salaries and administrative expenses. Sources said since several thousands of these documents are brittle and are in dire need of preservation, more funds are required. The TSARI, spread over nearly four acres in Tarnaka, contains historical records from the Mughal period, 1626 CE onwards. These include documents from the reign of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. The records from the Mughal period alone number approximately 1.55 million. Manuscripts dating to the 15th century, too, are stored here. A majority of these documents are from 1724 CE to 1948 CE, which is the Asaf Jahi period. According to those familiar with the functioning of TSARI, the institute is in dire need of funds. Experts in cataloguing, and preserving records, are also required. Since a large number of documents, especially those from the Mughal period, are in cursive Shikasta style of calligraphy and ‘ornamental Persian’, there is a need for those who can decipher and translate the language of the court. However, sources said requirement of funds for digitisation of records is priority. “There are thousands of records which are brittle, so much so that one feels afraid to touch them. Around 10% of records were digitised before 2012. But a lot many remain. The records which need to be digitised are not just the records from the medieval period, but also from the modern period, and include government orders issued by successive governments of Andhra Pradesh. Despite whatever digitisation has been done, documents are not accessible to researchers as there is no retrieval mechanism,” a source explained. The institute also requires that documents to be catalogued. Cataloguing entails a descriptive summary of the records contained in the TSARI. At the moment, the institute has a researcher whose services have been engaged on outsourcing basis for cataloguing. Those in the know pointed out that since cataloguing is a slow process and the documents are many, there is a need for more such experts. “Researchers can view the catalogue and retrieve records which they require. It is important for any library or research institute. Only one person cannot get the job done,” the source said. While TSARI’s journal ‘Etihas’ is being published, inadequate allocations have led to the institute seeking grants from other institutions to keep its afloat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/not-enough-funds-for-upkeep-of-heritage-records/article34127779.ece
22 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Teenmaar Mallanna proves a point||From a presenter of a satirical news bulletin “Teenmaar News” on V6 news channel during the Telangana agitation, Naveen, popularly known as Teenmaar Mallanna has emerged as the focal point of anti-TRS voters in the Graduate MLC elections given his stupendous performance. Not many expected him to put up such a stellar performance as he was an Independent without the support of any major political party and more so given the poor votes he secured a year back in the Huzurnagar by-elections. But his constant attack on the government, and more so on Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao through his Youtube channel seem to have given him the opportunity to expand his support base. A senior TRS leader, on condition of anonymity, expressed the view that Mallanna’s only strength has been attacking the government without any compromise and the party needs to seriously introspect on how an individual is making a difference where the major opposition parties could not. Representative of college managements association, who was actively involved in the MLC elections in support of the TRS too was surprised by the support to Teenmaar Mallanna at the ground level. “Despite the government revealing with data on the 1.30 lakh jobs given by the TRS, youngsters are not willing to believe that figure. This group had more belief in Mallanna than the government despite the authentic data,” he said. “TRS needs to work hard to change this negative perception.” What made Mallanna extremely popular in a section of people is his bold style of reporting laced with satire, though many may not approve his personal attack on the Chief Minister and his family. Yet, they all identify with the issues he raise. “This voice needs to be kept alive and we decided to support him to keep a check on the government,” says Venkatraju, an alumnus of OU and a traditional Congress party supporter. Mallanna’s success in making it to the second place in the Warangal-Nalgonda-Khammam Graduates constituency was because he could break into the ranks of all political parties purely on issues. As he himself declared after the result that people seem to have lost the confidence in political parties and forces like him will fill up the gap. “So people across party lines voted for me and there will be an end to traditional politics.” The journalist-politician also exploited the anger among the downtrodden communities about the political power confining to a few sections, and also fewer sections among the downtrodden. The Non-Resident Telugus had been a huge support base of him and they quite openly campaigned in his support on the social media apart from contributing to his campaign costs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/teenmaar-mallanna-proves-a-point/article34127796.ece
22 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Vegetable cultivation to be promoted in TS||Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy stated that vegetable crops were being cultivated in an area of 2.73 lakh acres and producing 24.99 lakh tonnes annually.

22 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS won due to money power, blackmail: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has claimed ‘moral victory’ in the two MLC constituencies won by the Telangana Rastra Samithi (TRS) and accused the ruling party of bagging both the seats using “money power, blackmail and pressure tactics” mainly against the employees. “We congratulate the winners. But, did (former Prime Minister) P.V. (Narasimha Rao) win or KCR? TRS had used the face of another party with the Chief Minister not even coming out. It means they have accepted the party’s decline because our voting share has actually increased when compared to last time. TRS won because of split in Opposition vote and they should know 70% voters have voted against it,” claimed party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar here on Sunday. “Voters supported TRS out of fear because the employees and their union leaders were threatened with transfers and anti-corruption raids. All the ill-gotten wealth in crores has been distributed during this election. Other parties too have supported TRS directly or indirectly to defeat the BJP,” charged the Karimnagar MP. The party will continue to keep up the pressure on the government to commit to its promises of implementing the Pay Revision Committee (PRC), issue job notifications and provide stipend to the unemployed youth. “The Chief Minister assured to give more than 43% hike in salaries and he better fulfil it or we will not keep quiet. We will continue to stand by the employees,” he affirmed. The party president said the BJP would continue to focus on the objective of capturing power in the next Assembly elections of 2023 unwaveringly. “This is just a speedbreaker and we feel we have succeeded in waking the Chief Minister from his slumber. But our aim is to win the next polls and we will be working towards it as people have accepted that we are the only party which can take on the TRS. They have given us the responsibility to put an end to this dictatorial rule,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-won-due-to-money-power-bjp/article34127485.ece

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Strange mix of winners and losers||There was a strange mix of winners and losers in the results of election to graduates constituencies of Legislative Council. Both the winners from TRS -- S. Vani Devi and Palla Rajeswara Reddy -- are educationalists running institutions in the city. Their rivals were two professors K. Nageswar and M. Kodandaram respectively. Incidentally, both of them stood third in the race. While Prof. Nageswar had been an MLC earlier, this was the first electoral battle for Prof. Kodandaram. The former polled 53,000 first preference votes and Prof. Kodandaram 70,000 votes.      There is a lesson from the results of the elections to Legislative Council. It is about the power of social media in tilting the fortunes of candidates in any election. In the instant case, Teenmaar Mallanna has given a new direction to efforts of candidates to reach out to masses when it came to seeking votes. As a person who runs a Youtube channel, Mallanna, whose real name is Chintapandu Naveen Kumar, attracted viewers with his analysis of newspaper reports and debates on his channel every day. It paid off because as an independent candidate, he polled over one lakh first preference votes and nearly upset the apple cart of the ruling TRS. His was a silent revolution using a channel and a padayatra by himself to good effect. He undertook a walkathon over 1,600 kms in the undivided Warangal district in two phases where he received good response from public.     A few days before the nomination of MLC candidates the TRS leaders were unsure of what was coming from the Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekhar Rao on the candidate for Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar MLC graduate constituency, and many believed it was a lost cause already. Not even senior leaders and Ministers were aware of the master stroke that the Chief Minister was about to play with the selection of S. Vani Devi, daughter of late PV Narasimha Rao. Some leaders were bit apprehensive of her candidature as she was new to politics and her opponents were strong contenders. But her clean image gave some respect for the political battle and PV’s legacy sharpened her chances. And the final result proved that CM’s political gamble stumped the opposition. Its all smiles in the TRS now.   Confirming worst fears, there was a high rate of invalid votes in the elections to graduates constituencies. There were nearly 48,000 invalid votes which impacted the final outcome itself! In the run up to elections, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, who campaigned for BJP candidates, cautioned the electors not to let even a single vote go waste as they were all well-educated and aware of the voting system. The Election Commission and candidates of major political parties also appealed to voters to follow procedures in registering their preference. But, all this went for a toss.  “Several voters who turned up to cast their vote were practically unaware of the voting system and were asking the polling officers on how to register their preference of vote in the large ballot paper. We knew then itself that the number of invalid votes would be high this time too,” a polling officer said. (N. Rahul, R. Ravikanth Reddy & B.

22 March 2021||FARIDABAD,||Dushyant assures farmers on mandis, MSP||Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala on Sunday said neither would the mandis be closed in Haryana nor the procurement system on Minimum Support Price be scrapped. He added that mandis were the backbone of the crop procurement system. Mr. Chautala was addressing a gathering during “Holi Milan” programme at Nariala here. In view of the ongoing farmers’ agitation and the boycott of ruling coalition leaders in many parts of the State, the district administration had appointed six duty magistrates to maintain law and order during the programme. Addressing the gathering, the Deputy Chief Minister claimed that during the wheat season last year, every single grain was procured in the State. Earlier, the farmers’ payment was deposited in the account of the arthiyas (commission agents), but direct payment was made to 23% farmers in the wheat season and 67% farmers in the paddy season last year. This time 78% farmers have uploaded their account details. He said this time the payment will be deposited directly to the accounts of the farmers within 48 hours after they submit Form-J. Procurement centres Mr. Chautala said some people were spreading rumours that mandis would be shut down, but mandis were the backbone of the State government’s procurement process. He said that there were 450 procurement centres in Haryana and in view of COVID-19 last year, the number was increased to 1,800. Considering the convenience of the farmers, procurement centres were set up close to their homes. He said the State government was fully committed to providing all kinds of facilities to the farmers and if required, the crop can be directly procured from the farmers’ fields as well. Talking about the development of roads in the State, Mr. Chautala said that under the Gramin Sadak Yojana, Rs. 2,000 crore was spent and roads connecting most of the mandis were built. He said that Kundli-Ghaziabad Palwal Expressway would prove to be boon for the people of the region. Along with other industries, big IT companies would also come here, he added. He said Jewar Airport would be connected to Faridabad with three flyovers and prove to be a milestone in its development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/dushyant-assures-farmers-on-mandis-msp/article34127701.ece

22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre punishing Delhi govt. for supporting farmers’ stir: Kejriwal||Addressing a kisan mahapanchayat in Moga in Punjab on Sunday, Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal said the Central government was punishing the Delhi government for supporting the farmers in their agitation against the three new agricultural laws but AAP was strongly against the laws. “I have been a part of this movement since the beginning and refused to sign the documents to convert the stadiums into jails where the agitating farmers would be held. Due to this, the Narendara Modi government is causing us great inconvenience,” said Mr. Kejriwal. He added that the Centre had brought a Bill last week in the Parliament which takes away the powers from the elected government and puts it in the hands of the Lieutenant-Governor. He assured the farmers that as long as he was the Chief Minister, he would not let the Central Government take any unruly action against those protesting in Delhi and that his government, along with the farmers, would overcome all obstacles that are being created for them. Making an electoral pitch for the Punjab Assembly election scheduled to be held next year, Mr. Kejriwal said four years ago Chief Minster Amrinder Singh also made many promises to the people and farmers of the State but all his promises have remained unfulfilled. “The Aam Aadmi Party is the only party that can make 24-hour electricity possible for the people of Punjab. If the people of Punjab vote for AAP, the State can have free education and good health services like we promised and delivered in Delhi,” Mr Kejriwal said. Promises jobs Mr. Kejriwal also promised to provide employment to all 20 lakh youths in Punjab who were issued unemployment cards by the State government in the name of votes. He also said that AAP will give unemployment allowances to the people till the time they get jobs and requested them not to throw the card away since it will make them realise how they have been deceived by a party in the name of votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centre-punishing-delhi-govt-for-supporting-farmers-stir-kejriwal/article34127697.ece

22 March 2021||Mumbai,||BJP holds protests for resignation of Anil Deshmukh||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and workers on Sunday staged protests in various cities demanding resignation of Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in view of the allegations of corruption levelled against him by ex-Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh. Days after he was shunted out as Mumbai police chief, Mr. Singh wrote a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray claiming that Mr. Deshmukh, a senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, had asked Sachin Vaze, the suspended Assistant Police Inspector currently in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), and other police officers to collect Rs. 100 crore monthly from bars and hotels in Mumbai. Mr. Deshmukh had dismissed the allegations as baseless and termed them a bid by Mr. Singh to save himself from inquiry. Fadnavis leads protests The protests were led by State BJP president Chandrakant Patil in Pune and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis in Nagpur. Altogether, demonstrations were held at more than 200 locations including in all district headquarters such as Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Amravati, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Aurangabad. At many places, BJP activists courted arrest. MLAs of the BJP, senior functionaries and workers participated in these demonstrations. Leading a protest in Pune, Mr. Patil said the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had no moral ground to remain in power. In Nagpur, demonstrations were led by former State energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule at Sanvidhan square, where slogans were raised against the State government. A demonstration was also organised by workers of the BJP Yuva Morcha outside the residence of Mr. Deshmukh in the city. “The MVA government is creating atamashaof our beloved Maharashtra. We have launched a strong protest demanding that the State Home Minister step down immediately,” Mr. Patil said in a statement. Mr. Patil said the “unnatural alliance” of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress, has criminalisd the politics of Maharashtra. They do not have any moral right to remain in power when a senior bureaucrat alleged that a minister is involved in an extortion racket. If the Chief Minister has some sense of shame and responsibility left towards the people of Maharashtra, he should fire Mr. Deshmukh immediately from his Cabinet, he said. “Had the Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis not raised the Antilia bomb scare issue in the Vidhan Sabha, the government would have buried the entire episode,” the BJP leader alleged. He said Mr. Vaze was reinstated against legal opinion so as to make him an “official collection agent for powers in the government”. ‘More skeletons in closet’ “Sachin Vaze, Param Bir Singh and Anil Deshmukh perhaps are only pawns in the entire game. Real powers behind them need to be investigated along with their motives. Once Vaze starts speaking in the NIA interrogation, more skeletons will tumble out from the government’s closet,” the statement quoted Mr. Patil as saying. Mr. Singh was transferred as the Commandant General of Home Guards a year after taking over as the Mumbai police chief in the midst of NIA investigation into the Antila bomb scare case. The IPS officer claimed that he had been “made a scapegoat to divert attention from the actual wrongdoers”.  Sachin Vaze, Param Bir Singh and Anil Deshmukh perhaps are only pawns in the entire game.

22 March 2021||Mumbai,||Hiren murder case: ATS arrests policeman, bookie||In a “major breakthrough”, the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has arrested a policeman and a bookie in connection with the alleged murder of businessman Mansukh Hiren, an official said on Sunday, adding that police officer Sachin Vaze had played a key role in the crime and emerged as the prime accused. The accused duo, identified as policeman Vinayak Shinde and bookie Naresh Gaur, were arrested on Saturday late night, he said. Earlier in the day, the official had given the name of the bookie as Naresh Dhare, but later said it was Naresh Gaur. Shinde is a convict in the 2006 Lakhan Bhaiya fake encounter case and he came out from jail on furlough last year, he said, adding that Shinde had been in touch with Mr. Vaze since then. Mr. Vaze is currently in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which is probing the recovery of an explosives-laden vehicle which was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s multi-storey residence ‘Antilia’ in south Mumbai on February 25. The vehicle was in possession of Mr. Hiren before his body was found in a creek near Thane on March 5. The Union Home Ministry on Saturday handed over the Hiren murder case to the NIA. “Sachin Vaze is a prime accused in the Hiren murder case. He had played a key role. During the probe, the ATS found that Gaur had provided five SIM cards to API Vaze and Shinde for the crime. Shinde used to help Vaze in his illegal activities,” the official said. He said the ATS was investigating if more people were involved in the case and what role they had played. ‘Finding main conspirator’ “The ATS is probing who was the main conspirator,” he added. “Both the accused were on Saturday called to the ATS headquarters for questioning in connection with the case and later placed under arrest,” he added. “The State ATS has so far interrogated several people, including police officials and the family members of the deceased. The arrest of these two persons is a major breakthrough in the case,” the official said. The ATS had earlier registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) against unidentified persons in connection with Hiren’s death. Earlier in the day, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray sought the Centre’s intervention in unearthing the truth behind the explosives-laden car that was found near Mr. Ambani’s residence. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Thackeray alleged that the Maharashtra government failed to shed light on several basic points in the case. “The explosives case doesn’t revolve only around Param Bir Singh and Sachin Vaze. Police placing the explosives or being asked to do so is not a small thing,” he said. The Centre should help in finding out the truth in the case. The basic issue of who placed the explosives-laden vehicle and on whose instructions it was done needs to be found out, the MNS chief said. “The basic issue should not be forgotten, otherwise this case will go the same way as actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s (death) case,” he said. Mr. Thackeray said it seems very unlikely that the vehicle with explosives was parked near Mr. Ambani’s house by Mr. Vaze without being asked to do so. Mr. Thackeray asked why there is no clarity yet from the State government as to why Param Bir Singh was shunted out. “Was it because he is linked to the placing of the vehicle? And if Singh is involved, why didn’t the State government take action against him instead of just a transfer?” he asked. Mr. Thackeray said the source of the gelatin sticks in the vehicle has also not been revealed yet. He said Mr. Ambani and Uddhav Thackeray share an extremely warm relationship. ‘Threat letter in question’ Mr. Raj Thackeray also raised question marks over the threat letter found in the vehicle, saying, “Is it so easy to extort money from Ambani? Will the police on their owndare to try to extort money from an industrialist, who shares very warm relations with the chief minister,” he asked. He reiterated his demand for resignation of Anil Deshmukh for ensuring free and fair probe over the allegations against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hiren-murder-case-ats-arrests-policeman-bookie/article34127644.ece
22 March 2021||Mumbai,||Top NCP leaders, Sanjay Raut meet Sharad Pawar||Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, State unit NCP chief Jayant Patil, and Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut separately met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar in Delhi on Sunday evening in view of former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s allegations of corruption against State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. However, what transpired during the meetings at Mr. Pawar’s residence could not be known. Earlier in the day, Mr. Raut told reporters in Mumbai that allegations of Mr. Singh against Mr. Deshmukh and the Sachin Waze episode have dented the image of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the State. Mr. Raut said all allies — the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress — need to introspect if their “feet are on the ground”. “Anil Deshmukh’s side also needs to be heard before taking any decision on him. We will take a decision on Deshmukh by tomorrow,” Mr. Pawar told reporters. Jayant Patil, who is also the State Water Resources Minister, had said that the Delhi visit was planned three days ago. “The Pandharpur Assembly bypoll is scheduled next month. Ajit Pawar and I decided to meet party workers in Solapur district to know their views over the selection of candidate and the party strategy, and then meet Pawar saheb in Delhi with the feedback before returning to Mumbai,” he said. “Accordingly, both of us are in Pandharpur to discuss issues related to the bypoll with party workers,” he said. The bypoll is scheduled to be held on April 17. It was necessitated due to the death of NCP MLA Bharat Bhalke last year. ‘Minister will not resign’ Meanwhile, Congress sources said Central leaders of the party are in touch with leaders in Maharashtra on the developments regarding Deshmukh. A Congress leader said on Sunday night that the Chief Minister was in touch with all prominent leaders of the MVA alliance in view of Mr. Singh’s letter. “I don’t think Anil Deshmukh will be asked to resign, as it will amount to accepting the allegations made against him,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/top-ncp-leaders-sanjay-raut-meet-sharad-pawar/article34127645.ece
22 March 2021||Mumbai,||Central agencies may be pressuring Singh: Cong.||Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of trying to destabilise the Maharashtra government, the State unit of the Congress on Sunday said former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh, who levelled allegations of corruption against State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, might be under pressure of Central agencies. Addressing a press conference, Maharashtra Congress spokesman Sachin Sawant said it was not for the first time in India that a serving officer raised allegations against those in power.  Questioning Mr. Singh’s claims, Mr. Sawant said, “Deshmukh was in hospital after he tested positive for the novel coronavirus in February. I had had online interactions with Deshmukh on two occasions when he was indisposed. If Singh’s allegations are believed to be true then why did he wait till March and till he was transferred, to raise them.” Mr. Sawant said Mr. Singh could be under pressure of the Central agencies since his close aide Sachin Vaze is in the NIA custody. “Mr. Singh’s allegations raise several questions. All this is scripted. How did leaders of the BJP gave sound bytes to news channels minutes after Mr. Singh’s letter became public?” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/central-agencies-may-be-pressuring-singh-cong/article34127647.ece

Talking to reporters, Mr. Rane demanded the resignation of Mr. Thackeray for the poor law and order situation in Maharashtra. He said, “Uddhav Thackeray should quit. For the last few months, Vaze lived in Varsha and sometimes in a five-star hotel in south Mumbai. What was he doing there? Wasn’t the CM aware that Vaze lived in his official residence?” Mr. Rane also alleged that Mr. Thackeray tried his best to ensure that Mr. Vaze was not arrested in connection with the investigation into the recovery of an explosives-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/vaze-lived-in-cms-official-house-rane/article34127649.ece
22 March 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Navi Mumbai reports highest COVID-19 cases since Sept. 2020||Navi Mumbai on Sunday reported its highest single-day surge in COVID-19 cases since September 30, 2020. With 416 new cases, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has till now reported a total of 59,616 cases since March 11, 2020, when the first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in the city The last time the city crossed 400 cases per day was on September 30, 2020, with 416 cases. On Sunday, Navi Mumbai also reported 150 recoveries, pushing the tally of total recoveries to 5,5674. With two more fatalities, the total death toll has risen to 1,152 since the first COVID-19 death was reported on March 13, 2020.

22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Over 1 lakh expected at Ghazipur border on March 23, say farmers||A large number of protesters from Western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Punjab on Sunday started gathering at the Ghazipur border ahead of the martyrdom anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh on March 23. The protesters came to the spot on vehicles that had the banners of martyrs — Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev — installed on them. The rally passed through various areas of both Uttarakhand and Punjab. The protesters were seen requesting more and more people to join them in their agitation against the new farm laws. Lakhveer Singh, who has come to the border from Rampur in U.P., said there will be a gathering of around one lakh protesters on March 23. “This government is functioning like East India Company and only benefitting corporate houses. Shaheed Bhagat Singh is an inspiration for every youth and teaches how to raise voice against a dumb and deaf government,” he said. Another protester Gurmeet Chaudhary said: “After the incident on January 26, many people thought that the farmers’ movement will fizzle out and we will be termed anti-India but we took control of the situation and instructed the youth not to fall into the trap of the government. We will keep fighting till our demands are met.” Women start foot march The protesters said that to make a huge impact on the day, a similar kind of mobilisation have been planned at the Tikri and Singhu borders. Kulwinder Kaur, a protester said: “A large group of women has started padyatra [foot march] from various cities of Punjab. Their march will culminate at Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu borders. On March 23, we will also honour the family members of the farmers, who sacrificed their lives for the movement.” The protesters asked more youth to join them. On Tikait’s absence After farmers’ leader Rakesh Tikait, who was leading the movement at Ghazipur protest site, went to poll-bound States for campaigning, the crowd was visibly thin. The protesters leading the movement in the absence of Mr. Tikait cited hot weather and harvesting season as reasons for thin crowd.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/over-1-lakh-expected-at-ghazipur-on-march-23/article34127664.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘CM should hold meet over rising virus cases’||The Delhi Congress on Sunday said that the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the city was a cause for concern. He appealed to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to convene an all-party meeting as well as a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to assess the situation and make plans to tackle the surge in cases. Fourth wave Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar alleged that the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was sweeping Delhi, as the Aam Aadmi Party government had lowered its guard when the COVID-19 positivity rate witnessed a slump. Mr. Kumar also demanded that more people should be brought under the free vaccination bracket, as the Rs. 50 crore earmarked in the Delhi budget for free COVID-19 jabs would cover only 5% of Delhi’s population, he alleged. “More funds should be allocated for free vaccination, to all Delhiites, as most people are not in a position to afford vaccination on payment in private hospitals,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-should-hold-meet-over-rising-virus-cases/article34127687.ece

22 March 2021||Yangon,||Protester shot dead in Myanmar, 2 Australians under house arrest||Security forces in Myanmar shot dead an anti-coup protester on Sunday, as the Australian government confirmed it is assisting two nationals who were detained after trying to leave Yangon. Myanmar has been in turmoil since soldiers ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month, triggering nationwide protests demanding a return to democracy. One man was killed on Sunday in the central city of Monywa and at least two people were injured in a clash with security forces at barricades, two witnesses said. “I saw people carrying a man who was shot and killed,” a local resident told AFP, adding the body was taken to a local hospital. “They used stun grenades and tear gas... later they started shooting. I don’t know if the man, who died on the spot after he was hit on his head, was killed from rubber bullets or live rounds.” Australia’s Foreign Ministry confirmed on Sunday it was providing consular assistance to two of its nationals in Myanmar. “Due to our privacy obligations we will not provide further detail,” a spokeswoman said. It is understood business consultants Matthew O’Kane and Christa Avery, a dual Canadian-Australian citizen, are under house arrest after trying to leave the country on a relief flight on Friday. The couple run a bespoke consultancy business in Yangon. A third Australian, economist Sean Turnell, an advisor to Ms. Suu Kyi, who was arrested a week after the putsch also remains in custody. Spate of violence Weekend violence failed to deter hundreds of doctors and nurses donning hard hats and brandishing posters of Suu Kyi as they marched at dawn through Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city and cultural capital. Later, other demonstrators placed protest signs in pot plants along a street. By afternoon there were barricades set on fire, gunfire in the streets and at least four people injured, a doctor in Mandalay said. Mandalay has been the scene of some of the worst violence from police and soldiers since the coup. The protests came a day after a monitoring group confirmed the killing of four protesters at the hands of security forces around the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/protester-shot-dead-in-myanmar-2-australians-under-house-arrest/article34127353.ece
22 March 2021||Rio de Janeiro,||Bolsonaro critics face ‘intimidation’||When the police knocked on Brazilian influencer Felipe Neto’s door to tell him he was being investigated for threatening national security, he says his heart skipped a beat. His crime, it turned out, was accusing far-right President Jair Bolsonaro of “genocide” for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has left over 290,000 people dead in Brazil. Brazilian police are also investigating former Cabinet Minister Ciro Gomes for calling Mr. Bolsonaro a “thief” over corruption allegations, sociologist Tiago Costa Rodrigues for calling him a “liar,” and even, according to news site Brasil 247, an otherwise unknown citizen named Roger Orsi who shared an anti-Bolsonaro meme on Facebook. Other critics of the President complain of less-official backlash, in the form of “online militias” of Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters, who launch coordinated attacks and smear campaigns against his perceived opponents on social media. Lawyers and human-rights activists warn Brazil is seeing a surge in legal and extra-legal moves to stifle dissent against Mr. Bolsonaro, in some cases with legislation and tactics dating back to the country’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship — for which the President is openly nostalgic. “The President, his family, his administration and his followers... are blatantly promoting an intimidation campaign against his political opponents, as if free thought and free speech did not exist in this country,” newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo said in an editorial on Saturday. Facing backlash Mr. Neto, a 33-year-old YouTube star, rose to international prominence last year with an opinion video for the New York Times, in which he called Mr. Bolsonaro the world’s worst President. In his latest jab, he called Mr. Bolsonaro “genocidal,” in reference to the President’s attacks on lockdowns, face masks, vaccines and other expert advice for containing COVID-19 deaths. That led Mr. Bolsonaro’s son Carlos, a Rio de Janeiro city councilman, to ask police to open an investigation against Mr. Neto. “How would he like me to refer to the President, who called the biggest pandemic we’ve seen in years a ‘little flu,’ who encourages crowds and tells people to go out like there’s nothing happening?” said Mr. Neto. Support for the influencer soon poured in on social media and beyond, making the phrase “Bolsonaro genocida” a top trending topic in Brazil. A judge blocked the investigation, ruling it was legally baseless.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bolsonaro-critics-face-intimidation/article34127343.ece
22 March 2021||KUALA LUMPUR,||Malaysia expels N. Korean diplomats||North Korean diplomats vacated their Embassy in Malaysia and were expelled on Sunday, after the two nations cut diplomatic relations in a spat over the extradition of a North Korean criminal suspect to the United States. The North Korean flag and Embassy signage were removed from the premise in a Kuala Lumpur suburb. Two buses ferried the diplomats and their families to the airport, where they boarded a flight to Shanghai. Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the expulsion was in response to Pyongyang’s “unilateral and utterly irresponsible decision” on Friday to sever diplomatic ties. “This action is a reminder that Malaysia shall never tolerate any attempt to meddle in our internal affairs and judiciary, disrespect our governance system and constantly create unnecessary tensions in defiance of the rules-based international order,” he said in a statement. Ties between both countries have been virtually frozen since the 2017 assassination of the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Two days after Kuala Lumpur extradited a North Korean man to the U.S. to face money laundering charges, a furious North Korea on Friday announced it was terminating ties with Malaysia. In a tit-for-tat response, Malaysia gave North Korean diplomats 48 hours to leave. Kim Yu Song, the Chargé d’Affaires and Councillor in Kuala Lumpur, said Malaysia had “committed an unpardonable crime.” Echoing Pyongyang’s statement, he accused Malaysia of being subservient to the U.S. and being part of a U.S. conspiracy aimed at “isolating and suffocating” his country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/malaysia-expels-n-korean-diplomats/article34127349.ece
22 March 2021||Manila,||Philippines accuses China of ‘incursion’ in disputed sea||The Philippines on Sunday accused China of “incursion” after more than 200 militia boats were spotted near a disputed reef in the South China Sea, in a rare rebuke of its superpower neighbour. The Philippine coast guard detected the boats “in line formation” at the boomerang-shaped Whitsun Reef, around 320 km (175 nautical miles) west of Palawan Island on March 7. “We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory,” Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said in a statement. “This is a clear provocative action of militarizing the area. These are territories well within Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone.” Mr. Lorenzana said the government was considering “appropriate action” to protect Filipino fishermen, the country’s marine resources and maintain peace and stability in the area. Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin said on Twitter he had lodged a diplomatic protest over the ships. The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not respond to a request for comment. A government task force charged with monitoring the contested waters announced Saturday the detection of around 220 “Chinese Maritime Militia Vessels” earlier this month. “Despite clear weather at the time, the vessels massed at the reef showed no fishing activities,” the agency said. The U.S. has previously accused China of using maritime militia to “intimidate, coerce and threaten other nations” over its claims to almost the entire South China Sea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/philippines-accuses-china-of-incursion-in-disputed-sea/article34127351.ece
22 March 2021||Jerusalem,||Thousands join anti-Netanyahu protest ahead of general polls||Thousands of Israelis rallied outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence on Saturday to protest his policies and premiership, days before a general election that could see the long-standing leader removed from power. Mr. Netanyahu, 71, in power for a record 12 consecutive years, is hoping to remain in office following Israel’s fourth election in less than two years on March 23. His detractors accuse him of corruption and say his management of the coronavirus pandemic, including protracted lockdowns, battered the economy and contributed to job losses. Waving flags, including the Israeli blue-and-white, protesters led by a young man with a bullhorn chanted “Bibi go home”, using the Prime Minister’s nickname. They also held up signs carrying a broad range of messages, from the need for a leadership “revolution” to mistrust in the police. “We came to protest against a dictator,” Anat Gourelle, a 60-year-old lawyer from Tel Aviv, said of Mr. Netanyahu. “It is outrageous what is going on in Israel. It is unthinkable that somebody is using his power to steal from his own people,” she said. Mr. Netanyahu was the first Israeli premier to be indicted in office for corruption when he was formally charged last year in three cases over claims he accepted improper gifts and sought to trade regulatory favour with media moguls in exchange for positive coverage. The combative premier denies wrongdoing. First launched in June last year, the vocal and colourful demonstrations against Mr. Netanyahu have gained momentum over the past 38 weeks, with Saturday night’s rally — the 39th — the largest in recent months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thousands-join-anti-netanyahu-protest-ahead-of-general-polls/article34127354.ece
22 March 2021||Kabul,||Pentagon chief makes surprise visit to Kabul||U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Sunday just weeks before Washington is due to withdraw the last of its troops under a deal struck with the Taliban last year. The visit comes at a crucial time when U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is reviewing the Afghan peace process. Mr. Biden said last week the May 1 deadline agreed by predecessor Donald Trump would be “tough” to meet — prompting outrage from the insurgents, who warned that Washington would be “responsible for the consequences”. The Afghan government is also keen to keep U.S. forces in the country for as long as possible for the vital air cover they provide. After talks with President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday, Mr. Austin would not be drawn for comment on the deadline. “That’s the domain of my boss,” he told reporters. “That’s the... decision that the President (Biden) will make at some point in time, in terms of how he wants to approach this going forward.” Under the deal thrashed out between the Taliban and Washington, the insurgents pledged also to engage in peace talks with Afghan government negotiators, but they have made almost no progress and fighting has only worsened — particularly in rural areas. Major urban centres are also in the grip of a bloody terror campaign in the form of attacks targeting politicians, civil servants, academics, rights activists and journalists. Kabul was the last stop on a whirlwind tour of Asia for the new Pentagon chief, a former career soldier who served in Afghanistan as a division commander from September 2003 until August 2005. Mr. Austin and his entourage flew into Afghanistan on a U.S.-liveried aircraft instead of a military plane that usually carries U.S. officials to the war-torn country. Taliban warning Asked about the Taliban warning that Washington would face consequences if the deadline wasn’t met, Mr. Austin said he was sure U.S. forces could cope. “I have great confidence and in his ability to protect our troops,” said Mr. Austin, referring to General Austin Miller, commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pentagon-chief-makes-surprise-visit-to-kabul/article34127346.ece
22 March 2021||Beirut,||Syria regime’s attack kills six civilians in hospital||Syrian regime artillery fire killed six civilians, including a child, when it hit a hospital in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib on Sunday, a war monitor said. The attack on the northwestern town of Atareb came despite a Russian-Turkish ceasefire since March 2020 supposed to protect the wider jihadist-held stronghold. It “hit the courtyard and main entrance of the hospital inside a cave,” killing six civilians, including a child and a hospital employee, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Eleven others were wounded, including healthcare staff, said the Britain-based monitoring group’s head Rami Abdel Rahman. Also on Sunday, artillery fire killed one civilian and wounded three others in the regime-held city of Aleppo, outside the rebel bastion, state news agency SANA said. The Idlib region, on the border with Turkey, is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is led by members of Syria’s former Al-Qaeda affiliate, but several rebel groups are also present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/syria-regimes-attack-kills-six-civilians-in-hospital/article34127347.ece
22 March 2021||London,||U.K. warns EU against vaccine export ban||Britain on Sunday warned the European Union against halting exports of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccines if the bloc did not receive promised deliveries first, saying the move would be “counter-productive”. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said “the world is watching” how the EU responds to a shortfall in deliveries of the inoculation from the Anglo-Swedish pharma giant, and that Brussels’ reputation was at stake. His comments follow EU chief Ursula von der Leyen again threatening on Saturday to impose an export ban on the AstraZeneca vaccine unless the company delivers more of the 90 million doses it agreed to supply in the first quarter of 2021. Appearing on several political talk shows, Mr. Wallace said trying to “balkanise or build walls” around vaccine production would damage both British and European citizens. “If contracts get broken, and undertakings, that is a very damaging thing to happen for a trading block that prides itself on the rule of law,” he told Sky News. “It is counterproductive because the one thing we know about vaccine production and manufacture is that it is collaborative. “They would undermine not only their own citizens’ chances of having a proper vaccine programme, but also many other countries around the world with the reputational damage for the EU which they would find very hard to change over the short-term.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-warns-eu-against-vaccine-export-ban/article34127356.ece

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||The ground report in the Assam duel||In the 2016 Assam Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s promise to implement the Assam Accord in letter and spirit helped it win the overwhelming support of a vast section of Assamese voters and enabled it to capture power at Dispur. In this election, (in three phases on March 27, April 1, April 6), the saffron party is looking at Assam as the springboard to further its political machinations of making subnational aspirations for distinctive linguistic and cultural identities submissive to the idea of nationalism based on its core Hindutva agenda. A multi-point narrative The election planks of unemployment, price rise of essential commodities and wages of tea garden workers laid by the Congress-led Mahajot (Grand Alliance) have prevented the dominant electoral discourse from being centred around a single polarising narrative. This is notwithstanding opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 being the cementing factor behind the formation of the grand Opposition alliance and also one of the common major election planks. The ruling alliance has also made development an election plank to counter the Opposition campaign. The Congress-led Mahajot, of 10 parties, has the three Left parties — the CPI(M), the CPI and the CPI-ML — the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM), the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), and now the Jimochayan (Deori) People’s Party (JDPP) and the Adivasi National Party (ANP). The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) have projected Maulana Badruddin Ajmal and the AIUDF led by him as “protectors of Bangladeshi infiltrators” in a bid to polarise the electoral narrative. The ruling alliance has also been trying to project the Opposition Grand Alliance as the mere ‘Congress-AIUDF alliance’ to suit its narrative. The BPF won 12 seats in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) and was, till recently, a constituent of the BJP-led coalition government headed by Sarbananda Sonowal. The BTR — being an autonomous region under the provisions of the Sixth Schedule — is excluded from the purview of the CAA. The BJP has dropped the BPF and chosen the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) as its new ally in the BTR. The BJP and the UPPL share power in the Bodoland Territorial Council which governs the BTR. In its quest to return to power in this election, the Congress hopes that its guarantee to pay daily wages of Rs. 365 to tea garden workers will help it regain some of its lost support base among garden workers and also turn the tide against the BJP which made a poll promise in 2016 (in its Vision Document) of increasing this amount to Rs. 351. Tea garden workers play a crucial role in about 25 of the total 126 seats; the BJP has made inroads in this region and consolidating itself here which has eroded the Congress’s base. Issue of migrants The BJP does not hide its ideological intentions in the language it is using in the run-up to the election. When it says “infiltrator”, it is referring to Muslim migrants from erstwhile East Pakistan and present Bangladesh; when it says “refugee”, it is referring to Hindu and other non-Muslim migrants from the same geographical landmass without any cut-off date. The core clause of the Assam Accord does not distinguish “illegal migrants” on basis of religion and stipulates March 24, 1971 as the cut-off date for detection, deletion of names from the voters’ list and expulsion of all migrants from Bangladesh who entered the State without valid travel documents after this date. This secular fundamental of the Assam Accord incorporated in the citizenship laws poses a stumbling block to the Hindutva dream of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar. Assamese and other language speakers are apprehensive of Bengali-speaking “illegal migrants” from Bangladesh posing an existential threat to them. This explains the resistance to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 in the State and why the BJP is wary of seeking votes on the CAA in Assam, especially in districts with an overwhelming population of Assamese and other ethnic communities. The AGP (which was formed at the culmination of the Assam Movement after the signing of the accord) choosing to ignore the manipulation of the cut-off date to determine Indian citizenship through the enactment of the CAA in the accord and continuing the electoral alliance with the BJP, is reflective of a core constituency of Assamese voters at the crossroads of the two binaries of the Hindu-Muslim and the Assamese-Bengali when it comes to distinguishing an infiltrator from a refugee. Path of subnationalism The formation of two new regional parties, the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and the Raijor Dal, borne out of the vigorous anti-CAA movement, has put Assamese sub-nationalism on a new trajectory which may not remain limited to electoral ambitions alone. The AJP has been formed under the aegis of the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) which strongly defend the secular character of the Assam Accord and oppose the CAA. Both the AASU and the AJYCP backed the BJP, the AGP, and their allies in 2016 to bring an end to 15 years of Congress rule but are subsequently mobilising people against the CAA. The AJP is led by former AASU General Secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi. The Raijor Dal, led by jailed peasants’ leader Akhil Gogoi, has been floated by the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and allied organisations, which have been at the forefront of a parallel stream of anti-CAA movement. Mr. Gogoi was arrested in December 2019 during the anti-CAA movement, jailed and later handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in an old case of 2009 of an alleged Maoist link. The two parties forged an electoral alliance and rejected an appeal by the Congress and other Mahajot constituents to join the grand alliance alleging that it has a “communal” AIUDF. The AJP and the Raijor Dal have also failed to reach a consensus on the proposal of Mr. Gogoi to push for all Opposition parties (it includes them) to field a common candidate to defeat the BJP and its allies. The AJP is firm on its position of opposing the national parties as well as defeating and resisting a “communal BJP and AIUDF”. This has resulted in the possibilities of the anti-CAA votes being split to the advantage of the ruling alliance. However, its election prospects could be affected in some constituencies if there are three cornered contests and rebel candidates of the ruling alliance. The BJP has refrained from making the CAA an issue in the first phase of polling for 47 seats in the Brahmaputra valley. The BJP-AGP combine won 35 of these seats that catapulted the saffron party to power and helped instal the first BJP-led government in the State in 2016. The Congress won nine and the AIUDF won two seats. For the ruling coalition, increasing or retaining its tally in the first phase is key to its retaining power. The split in votes among the constituents of the Mahajot has helped the ruling alliance win many seats in the 2016 Assembly elections and increase its tally in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Setting the narrative around Maulana Badruddin Ajmal and the AIUDF is easier for the BJP and the AGP as it was floated to protest the scrapping of the erstwhile Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983 by the Supreme Court in 2005. The spectacular success of the AIUDF in electoral politics and the expansion of its support base among a section of Muslim voters of erstwhile East Bengal origin did not spell an opportunity for it in getting a share of the power pie as former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi resisted it in his three consecutive tenures. Gogoi’s “who is Badruddin?” poll rhetoric was targeted to woo Assamese and indigenous voters, but the Congress ended up getting only 53 seats in the 2006 Assembly polls against the 71 seats it had won in 2001. ‘A conflict’ The BJP harps on the narrative that it is population growth among Muslim migrants of erstwhile East Bengal and East Pakistan origin and Muslim Bangladeshi migrants within the State — and not post-Partition Hindu-refugees who came to the State till December 2014 — that poses the greater demographic threat to Assamese Hindus and other indigenous communities. The BJP has dubbed this election as “a conflict of two civilisations” — civilisation represented by 35% population and the civilisation represented by the rest 65% population to strengthen the religion binary. (According to Census 2011, Muslims account for 34.22%, while Hindus and other religions account for the rest of the population in Assam.) The BJP has reiterated its promise to protect jati (nationality), mati (land), bheti (foundation) of the Assamese and other ethnic communities. The electoral narrative around the AIUDF and Maulana Badruddin Ajmal has been pushed to shape the perception that instead of language, religion should be the basis of identities of the majority Assamese and other ethnic nationalities.

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Iran deal could be rescued by the IAEA||Even as the chicken-and-egg game is being played between the U.S. and Iran on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as to whether Iranian compliance comes first or the lifting of sanctions by the U.S., the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is back on the stage to rescue the JCPOA. The U.S. tried to pressurise Iran by proposing a resolution in the IAEA Board of Governors (March 1-5) meeting criticising Iranian non-compliance with the JCPOA and its alleged IAEA safeguards violations amidst rumours that Iran might withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty  (NPT) and proceed to develop nuclear weapons. Iranian Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi had hinted at it in an interview with Iranian State television in February. Mr. Alavi’s widely reported remark — that “a cornered cat may behave differently from when the cat is free” — was interpreted as a warning that Iran might abandon the JCPOA and proceed with unbridled nuclear activities. The Indian model Having sat in the alphabetical order next to Iranian Ambassadors and top nuclear negotiators on the IAEA Board of Governors for about four years, I know they looked at India with admiration for the way India had handled the NPT. They often wished that they had not signed the NPT, developed a capability like India did, and then negotiated a deal. I did not have to remind them that such an option was not available and that the United Nations Security Council would not give them permission to leave the NPT even if they wished to do so. Even though the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s fatwa against nuclear weapons still stands, Foreign Policy recently noted: “Wide swaths of Iranian society, among the public and policymakers alike, seem to increasingly see the weapon not just as an ultimate deterrent but as a panacea for Iran’s chronic security problems and challenges to its sovereignty by foreign powers.” If the stalemate continues on JCPOA, because of the U.S. pressure, public opinion may shift towards the Indian model of creating a deterrent and then seeking a special dispensation to avoid severe sanctions. But the risks involved in such a policy will be grave, including the possibility of military action by Israel. The Iranian elections in June make it imperative for the country to have at least an initial breakthrough before the polls. If not, the new government, which might be more radical than the present one, would be tempted to adopt a policy of creating a de facto deterrent as the only option for survival. IAEA’S two service functions A technical ‘understanding’ reached on February 21 by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi allowing monitoring by the IAEA to continue in Iran for three months augured well for a possible IAEA effort in case the JCPOA talks broke down. Iranians had also agreed to an early April visit to Iran by an IAEA technical team to discuss outstanding safeguard matters. It was against this backdrop that Mr. Grossi persuaded the Americans not to move a resolution in the IAEA Board, so that the IAEA did not get entangled in the U.S. position on Iran. It was important for the IAEA to pursue its non-proliferation efforts with Iran outside the JCPOA.  Perhaps, Mr. Grossi expects that in the event of the present efforts to renew the JCPOA failing altogether, it should be possible to consider a fresh initiative by the IAEA to deal with the issue. The IAEA is neither the Secretariat of the NPT nor is it empowered to request States to adhere to it. It does, however, have formal responsibility in the context of implementing Article III of the Treaty. The IAEA’s mandate, expertise, and experience also equip it well to assist in the implementation of other Articles. At the broadest level, the IAEA provides two service functions under the NPT. It facilitates and provides a channel for endeavours aimed at the “further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the territories of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world.” Its other major function is to administer international nuclear safeguards, in accordance with Article III of the Treaty, to verify fulfilment of the non-proliferation commitment assumed by non-nuclear-weapon States party to the Treaty. The NPT assigns to the IAEA the responsibility for verifying, at the global level, through its safeguards system, that non-nuclear weapon States fulfil their obligations not to use their peaceful nuclear activities to develop any nuclear explosive devices of any kind. Accordingly, the Iranian file could go back to the IAEA to start fresh negotiations to restrain Iran to remain within the permissible level of enrichment of uranium. In effect, this may mean going back to the pre-six nation initiative, when the IAEA could not certify that Iran was not engaged in weapon activities. With the experience of the JCPOA, any new arrangement has to ensure that Iran must have sanctions relief, the stockpile of enriched uranium should not exceed the limits established, and there should be iron clad guarantees that Iran will not violate the safeguards agreement. The test is whether these can be accomplished within the framework of the IAEA. Discussions at a technical level Since the IAEA is a technical body, its deliberations may be kept at the technical level. At the same time, since it is open for the IAEA to report to the Security Council for necessary action, the IAEA will have the necessary clout to insist on the implementation of the NPT and its additional protocol. A new avenue may open for Iran to continue its peaceful nuclear activities as permitted in the NPT. Iran may have a certain comfort level in the IAEA as some members of the Board will be supportive of Iran’s aspirations to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes without unnecessary restraints. If the beginning of the new negotiations on the JCPOA drag on in the new circumstances in West Asia, particularly the interest of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to be part of any arrangement with Iran, which the U.S. supports, the IAEA may provide an alternative venue to open discussions on Iran’s obligations under the NPT, which do not have a time limit.

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Doubling down on a resilient India||Asia watchers observing China are, above all, missing the real economic shift at play — that this is India’s economic decade. Despite CEOs and investors alike having faced years, if not decades, of false starts in the subcontinent, it is undeniable that almost every major global company is either contemplating or operating on the assumption that India is a key part of their growth story. FDI inflows Google, Facebook, Walmart, Samsung, Foxconn, and Silver Lake have been just a handful of the firms that made big ticket bets on India in 2020. As a result, even as India experienced one of the world’s sharpest economic contractions, it also saw the fastest growth in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows among all the major economies last year. India’s $60 billion-plus tally for new annual FDI equity inflows was its largest-ever haul and a milestone in the agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in its second term. That India should emerge as a leading destination for FDI might strike some observers as an unexpected outcome. It is certainly one that deserves parsing. Indeed, a significant share of India’s FDI inflows arose from foreign investments directed solely at Reliance Jio. Meanwhile, India’s latest FDI totals still lags behind the highest tallies in other markets such as China and Brazil. Adapting to the Indian market Three decades after its economy was liberalised, India remains a complex and challenging place to do business. Frequent shifts in the policy landscape and persistent market access barriers are standard complaints levied against India by the business community. Meanwhile, the Modi government’s push to build a “self-reliant” India has also rattled skittish investors and smaller companies that lack the resources to navigate on-the-ground hurdles. Still, leading corporate investors see the Indian market differently. They recognise that doing business in India — or any emerging market for that matter — comes with inherent risks but that adaptation in approach is critical to success. Most importantly, they have the vision to understand that these are risks worth taking given the scale of the India Opportunity. Four core dynamics drive this calculus and explain why multinational companies are making India an essential part of their growth story. First, sheer demographics. What India offers through its nearly 1.4 billion people and their growing purchasing power is uniquely valuable for multinationals with global ambitions. No other country outside of China has a market that houses nearly one in six people on the planet and a rising middle class of 600 million. Failure to compete for a share of Indians’ wallets is not just a missed strategic opportunity; it’s borderline malpractice at the boardroom level. Second, shifting geopolitics. Rising U.S.-China competition is redefining the global landscape for investment and manufacturing, forcing multinationals to rethink their footprints and production hubs. Savvy countries such as Vietnam have capitalised on this opportunity to great effect, but India is finally getting serious about attracting large-scale production and exports. Major multinational companies such as Samsung have invested billions in the Indian market, and manufacturers such as Cisco, Nokia, Ericsson, and Flex are reportedly weighing new investments that take advantage of fresh incentive programs. Third, rising digital connectivity. Cheap mobile data have powered a revolution across India’s digital economy and connected an estimated 700 million Indians to the Internet. As Mr. Modi has said, more than 500 million Indians still remain offline, and the rise of these ‘next gen netizens’ is a key reason why leading global tech companies are investing in India and weathering acute policy pressure. Domestic Indian companies have also demonstrated their ability to innovate and deliver high quality services at scale. The partnerships and FDI flows linking multinationals and Indian tech firms will continue to unlock shared market opportunities for years to come. Fourth, national resilience. Despite facing the scourge of the novel coronavirus head on, India has managed the pandemic better than many of its western peers and restored economic activity even before implementing a mass vaccination programme. These are remarkable developments, and yet they speak to India’s underlying resilience even in the face of historic challenges. This ethos will serve India well as it navigates the complex challenges of the 21st century, and global investors are clearly taking note. Value creation Of course, unlocking opportunities in the Indian market cannot take the form of a one-way wealth transfer, and companies should not expect a warm welcome without continuously demonstrating their commitment to India. Successful companies do this by placing shared value creation at the heart of their business strategy. They tie corporate success to India’s growth and development. They forge enduring partnerships and lasting relationships, elevate and invest in Indian talent, align products with Indian tastes, and ultimately tackle the hardest problems facing India today. Charting a path forward in this dynamic growing market will require corporate executives to make new commitments and navigate choppy waters. But for leading companies with global ambitions and a willingness to make big bets, the rewards of investing in the Indian market are substantial and well worth pursuing.

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||No self-censorship||There were questions regarding the report, “State govt. suspends former Special DGP” (March 19, 2021). The senior IPS officer is facing sexual harassment charges made by a serving woman IPS officer. While the Tamil Nadu government did not issue a formal notification, the newspaper’s reporter gathered information from reliable sources that the officer has been suspended pending inquiry. Earlier, the government had suspended the Chengalpattu Superintendent of Police in the same case for acting in favour of the Special Director General of Police and trying to prevent the survivor from making a formal complaint. Rightly drawing from earlier court directives that prohibit the media from revealing only the names of the victims in sexual assault cases and not the offenders, readers asked why the newspaper did not publish the names of the two IPS officers involved in the case. Abiding by the court’s order There are several rules and codes that govern reporting on sexual violence, including Section 228A of the Indian Penal Code, which was brought in through an amendment in 1983 to Section 6(ii) of the Press Council of India’s ‘Norms of Journalistic Conduct’. It is true that there is neither a legal bar nor an ethical bar in naming offenders. In this particular case, the court had intervened and issued a binding order restraining the media from publishing not only the names of the survivor but also of the accused and witnesses. I would like to draw the attention of the readers to a report, “Madras HC to monitor probe against former Special DGP” (March 2), which read: “Passing an elaborate interim order, he [judge] restrained the media from publishing the names of the complainant, the accused and witnesses in the case as there was an express bar on such publications under Section 16 of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013.” While one can argue that the single judge’s order contradicts earlier judicial pronouncements, the fact remains that a newspaper has to abide by the present binding order. In another case, K. Balakesari, a contributor to this newspaper, asked: “Why has The Hindu not carried a single item of news these past few days about the resignation of Professor Pratap Bhanu Mehta from Ashoka University, apparently because of him being considered a political liability by the University’s Trustees? I thought in such matters, The Hindu would be in the forefront of publishing the facts about the case.” A detailed report On March 19, in the national news section on Page 11 (Chennai edition), the report “Arvind resigns from Ashoka University” dealt with all the developments in Ashoka University. The strapline for the report read: “Devastated by circumstances behind P.B. Mehta’s resignation, says former CEA”. Further, the opening paragraphs of the report dealt with Mr. Mehta’s case exclusively. They read: “Political scientist and commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta resigned from Ashoka University after a meeting with the university’s founders made it clear his association with the institution could be considered a ‘political liability’. In his resignation letter dated March 15 to Vice-Chancellor Malabika Sarkar sent on Tuesday, which The Hindu has seen, he said his writing was ‘perceived to carry risks for the university.’” The report also carried the operative portion of Mr. Mehta’s resignation letter: “After a meeting with Founders it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politics that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens, is perceived to carry risks for the university”.  The perception among some readers is that the newspaper had resorted to one form of self-censorship or the other in the two cases — one in not naming a senior police officer in a sexual harassment case and the other in not reporting about shrinking academic freedom. But a closer reading reveals the gap between this perception and the reality. In the sexual harassment case, The Hindu had reported as much information as possible in the light of a binding High Court order. Regarding the developments in Ashoka University, the newspaper looked at all issues arising from Mr. Mehta’s resignation. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/no-self-censorship/article34127336.ece
22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||How to treat unpaid work||Women everywhere carry a disproportionately higher burden of unpaid work, namely, unpaid domestic services as well as unpaid care of children, the old and the disabled for their respective households. Though this work contributes to overall well-being at the household level and collectively at the national level, it is invisible in the national database and particularly in national policies. This work is repetitive, boring and frequently drudgery — a 24-hour job without remuneration, promotions or retirement benefits. It restricts opportunities for women in the economy and in life. Women do this job not necessarily because they like it or are efficient in it, but because it is imposed on them by patriarchal norms, which are the roots of all pervasive gender inequalities. This unequal division of unpaid work between women and men is unfair and unjust and it deprives women of equal opportunities as men. For political parties to recognise this work is a positive development, and the demand for wages for housewives has emerged from this concern. However, its implementation may create problems such as affordability of the government and calculation of the amounts. Women may not be eager to enter the labour maket. More important, these wages may confirm unpaid work as women’s work only, which would deny opportunities to women in the wider world. Payment of pension to old women (60+ years) may be a better idea to compensate them for their unpaid work. What the government could do What governments could do is recognise this unpaid work in the national database by a sound time-use survey and use the data in national policies. Also, they could relieve women’s burden of unpaid work by improving technology (e.g. better fuel for cooking), better infrastructure (e.g. water at the doorstep), shifting some unpaid work to the mainstream economy (e.g. childcare, care of the disabled, and care of the chronically sick), and by making basic services (e.g. health and transportation) accessible to women. Also, they could redistribute the work between men and women by providing different incentives and disincentives to men (e.g. mandatory training of men in housework, childcare, etc.) and financial incentives for sharing housework. These measures will give free time to women and open up new opportunities to them. Unpaid work and the economy What is critical is to understand the linkages between unpaid work and the economy. The household produces goods and services for its members, and if GDP is a measure of the total production and consumption of the economy, it has to incorporate this work by accepting the household as a sector of the economy. At the macro level, unpaid work subsidises the private sector by providing it a generation of workers (human capital) and takes care of wear and tear of labour who are family members. The private sector would have paid much higher wages and earned lower profits in the absence of unpaid work. Unpaid work also subsidises the government by taking care of the old, sick and the disabled. The state would have spent huge amounts in the absence of unpaid work. Unpaid work is a privately produced public good which is critical for the sustenance of the mainstream economy. This work, therefore, needs to be integrated with the mainstream economy and policies. It will be up to public policies then to improve the productivity of unpaid workers, reduce their burden, and tap their potential in development, as the household could also be an important economic sector. By excluding this work from the economy, macroeconomics shows a clear male bias. It is not surprising that many economists call economics “a wrongly conceived discipline” that is narrow, partial and truncated. There is an urgent need to expand the purview of economics not only for gender justice but mainly for moving towards a realistic economics.

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Junk inefficiency||The much-awaited vehicle scrappage policy announced by the Transport Ministry, coming after the move for a green tax on ageing and polluting automobiles, promises economic benefits, a cleaner environment and thousands of jobs. Although it will take until April 1, 2022 for vehicles belonging to the government and the public sector to be scrapped, another year thereafter to identify junk heavy commercial vehicles through mandatory fitness checks, and finally other vehicles by 2024, it is a constructive road map. It will be no easy task, however, to put in place a credible system of automated fitness checking centres with help from States to assess whether commercial and private vehicles are roadworthy after 15 and 20 years, respectively, as the policy envisages. Equally important, enforcement will be key to get them scrapped once they are found unfit for use and to stop them from moving to smaller towns. States must also come on board to provide road tax and registration concessions, while the automobile industry is expected to sweeten the deal with genuine discounts on new vehicles. Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, who has had limited success with enforcement of the amended Motor Vehicles Act of 2019 because States are not entirely on board, has the difficult task of ensuring that the scrappage plan gets their support, and the backing of manufacturers who stand to benefit from a spurt in demand. Heavy commercial vehicles, which contribute disproportionately to pollution — 1.7 million lack fitness certificates — pose the biggest challenge. Many of these cannot be replaced quickly in the absence of financial arrangements for small operators, who have opposed the new measures. Vehicle scrappage and replacement is seen internationally as a route to rejuvenate COVID-19-affected economies by privileging green technologies, notably electric vehicles (EVs), and also as an initiative to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century under Paris Agreement commitments. India’s automobile ecosystem is complex, with dominant, legacy motors spanning fossil-fuel driven vehicles and a nascent EV segment. The industry’s share pre-COVID-19 was about 7.5% of GDP with significant downstream employment, but it also imposes a fuel import burden. The Centre has to arrive at a balance and have incentives that reward manufacturers of vehicles that are the most fuel-efficient. Failure to prioritise fuel efficiency and mandate even higher standards and enhance taxes on fuel guzzlers will only repeat the mistakes of vehicle exchange programmes abroad, where full environmental benefits could not be realised, and taxpayers ended up subsidising inefficiency. Ecological scrapping, as a concept, must lead to high rates of materials recovery, reduce air pollution, mining and pressure on the environment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/junk-inefficiency/article34127320.ece
22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Rising poverty||A new study by the Pew Research Center estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionately deleterious impact on living standards in India and China in 2020, with the sharp economic contraction in the former pushing as many as 7.5 crore people into the ranks of the poor (those who earn $2 or less a day). In contrast, the figure is about 10 lakh in China, whose economy slowed but continued to post growth. In absolute terms, the number of poor in India is posited to have swelled to 13.4 crore, reversing the gains made in the preceding nine years when the country cut the number of poor by more than three-fourths to an estimated 7.8 crore in 2019. In China, the population of the poor likely inched up to 40 lakh, matching the 2019 level. Similarly, the numbers of India’s middle class — those with a daily income of $10.01–$20 — are projected to have shrunk by 3.2 crore to about 6.6 crore, compared with the number this income cohort would have reached absent the pandemic. Here again, China likely experienced just one-third the level of contraction, with the population of those deemed as middle income set to have narrowed to 49.3 crore compared with the pre-pandemic projection of 50.4 crore. The Pew assessment, which is based on an analysis of the World Bank’s PovcalNet database, does, however, acknowledge the multiple assumptions that inform the study. These include varying base years for income/consumption figures — with India’s from 2011 and 2016 for China. Still, the study serves as a stark reminder of the economic disparities, both within India and at a comparative level with its northern neighbour. The latest report once again spotlights the widening inequality in India, exacerbated by the pandemic, as the lower income populations have disproportionately borne the brunt of job and income losses in the wake of the multiple lockdowns. The fiscal policy response to redress this massive increase in precarity has also been underwhelming, especially when viewed from the perspective of the pre-pandemic tax cuts that the government handed to corporates in an attempt to revive private investment and rekindle growth. That the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme has been seeing record levels of demand is testimony to the struggles those in the rural hinterland have been facing in finding gainful employment since the onset of the pandemic. With the number of COVID-19 cases once again rising disconcertingly across the country, there is a clear and present danger that not only could any nascent economic recovery be stymied even before it gains traction but that the number of those sliding into poverty could jump dramatically. The policy responses to the rising wave of infections could well test the government’s ‘lives versus livelihoods’ playbook to the hilt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rising-poverty/article34127321.ece

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||A ‘foreign’ investing t(r)ip!||When a stock rises 17 times in 15 days, what happens? You jump in after the 15th day, of course! That is the story of GME (the stock ticker for American electronics games retailer Gamestop) and that of hordes of Indian investors entering the U.S. market – kickstarting their equity journey with a ‘foreign stock’. And how? After reading about it in Reddit groups! No doubt investing in a foreign country can help diversify your portfolio. And specifically, when it comes to investing in the U.S., in stocks of companies you find value in everyday life (Google or Apple or Netflix). The question is, which route to investing in the U.S. is prudent and how much can you expose yourself to a market you know little about. So, here are things you need to know before investing internationally. First, choosing a foreign stock is no different from choosing an equity share locally. The company’s business and financial fundamentals, moat, quality of balance sheet and governance, all matter. If not, foreign stocks too can go down to being penny stocks and destroy your wealth. Next, you should know which markets to choose. A market that behaves like India may not offer any diversification. So, you need to choose markets that are less correlated or those that offer different opportunities. Your gains from international investing come from the local market returns plus the currency movement. For example: The annualised five-year return of the Nasdaq 100 index (as of March 12, 2021) was 25%, as opposed to the 26.5% return of an Indian fund that invests in the same index. Clearly, the additional returns came from the rupee depreciation. But the reverse can also be true in that you may have lower returns if the rupee appreciates. So, currency movements can benefit or harm you. Costs involved You need to be aware of the upfront costs, recurring costs, and taxation when it comes to investing internationally. First, the exchange rate spread when you buy foreign currency may not work in your favour as the currency exchange fee you are charged for this by your bank/broker may not be competitive at all. This is the upfront cost you incur — somewhat like an entry load as one fund manager put it. Second, know your tax laws. 2020 saw a new rule of tax collection at source for foreign remittances above Rs. 7 lakh, at 5%. While this can be claimed in your tax returns, you should be aware that it is a cash outflow for you if you are investing large sums. Third, you should be aware of the tax treatment including dividends or capital gains and inheritance tax in the country in which you are investing. In India, the gains from listed foreign stocks are taxed differently from local equity shares. If held for more than two years, it is considered long-term and taxed at 20%. Otherwise, it is called a short-term gain and taxed at your slab rate. In the fund route, they are treated like debt funds for tax purposes. Dividends too are taxed. You might need an auditor to help you with all these complexities and her/his fees is an additional charge too! Fourth, brokerage expenses on purchase or sale of foreign stocks is not as low as it is locally. This is because your local broker is typically associated with a foreign broker and that brings the cost of intermediary into your total cost. Apart from the cost, you also need to be aware of the pedigree of the international brokers, their registration with the foreign country’s regulator, apart from the local firm’s history (as there are many new start-ups in this field). How to? The above points notwithstanding, there is no denying that your portfolio will stand enriched if you add some international flavour to it. Instead of going the stock route, taking the ETF/passive fund route, especially in the U.S., can fulfil multiple needs. One, you need not burn your fingers choosing stocks that may go bust. Two, passive investing is known to beat active funds most of the time in the U.S., and the country has an enviable range of ETFs. Three, you can do this through the direct investing route (buy ETFs through brokers) or easier still, use Indian funds that invest in such indices in the U.S. The latter is hassle-free as you invest in rupees (there is no remittance involving you) and yet gain from any currency depreciation. The expense is quite low (less than 0.5%), and you don’t even need a broker account if you use the fund route. Instead of complying with FEMA, RBI’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) and the taxman’s law, isn’t this a simpler route? But some caveats apply. As with everything, excess of anything is bad. So, keep your exposure at 10-20% of your portfolio. Second, as is the rule with equities, don’t make a beeline seeing high returns. That’s poor timing. Third, you should invest only to diversify; not with the intent of earning higher returns than India. The GME rocket can come crashing down in flames too!

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||The multiple ‘risk’ personalities in you||Your spouse could be afraid of socialising because of the fear of contracting the COVID-19. But, you may be adventurous, arguing that wearing a mask and building herd immunity is a better way to counter the virus. Does your risk attitude towards socialising reflect your behaviour towards personal finance decisions? Here, we show that you have multiple risk attitudes and how that impacts your personal finance decisions. Stable traits? You may socialise with your friends despite the risk of contracting COVID-19, but you may be risk averse while taking investment decisions. Your spouse could be risk seeking while taking investment decisions, but may not engage in adventurous sports such as bungee jumping. Why? Risk is the possibility of an adverse outcome in the future. Your risk attitude is a function of perceived benefits and associated risks. So, if you prefer risky investments but not adventurous sports, it could be that you perceive less risk of a market crash and more benefit of higher returns, whereas you attach a high probability of an adverse outcome from bungee jumping. So, you can be risk-seeking while taking certain decisions and risk averse for others. This means your risk behaviour is not a stable personality trait. We can extend this argument further. Does your risk behaviour change for each investment decision you take? That is, is it possible that you prefer conservative investments for one life goal, but choose risky investments for another? Suppose you are pursuing two life goals — saving for your child’s college education in 10 years, and planning down payment for a house you want to buy in 8 years. Clearly, your child’s education fund is more important than the house. Why? On a philosophical note, you are responsible for accumulating money to fund your child’s education. From a personal finance perspective, the answer is simple — you cannot postpone this goal. So, it takes priority. Setting priorities for life goals is important because you have to use your income to fund your present lifestyle and also save for the future. So, investing only in stable income products such as bank deposits will not be possible for all life goals because the amount required will be large. You also have to invest in equity. But you will be unwilling to take high risk for a high-priority goal such as your child’s education, whereas you may accept high risk for the portfolio earmarked to fund the down payment for a house. This indicates that you have multiple risk personalities associated with your investment decisions. Your asset allocation is a function of your risk attitude. So, a conservative risk behaviour towards your child’s education goal means you should have more bonds and less equity in the portfolio earmarked for this goal. Whereas, your housing goal can have more equity and less bonds as you have higher risk tolerance for this goal. Note that your asset allocation is driven by your goal priority and not necessarily by the goal you want to achieve first. For instance, investments you make for a 15-year, high-priority goalcould have more bonds and less equity than those for a 10-year, low-priority goal. Your risk attitude towards life goals could be different from your spouse’s. You may consider buying a house as key while your spouse may want an exotic vacation on priority. You have to reconcile these differences before taking investment decisions. Remind your investment adviser that you have multiple risk personalities so that the asset allocation is aligned with your risk attitude for every goal.

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Rest in peace after taking this life cover||Are you looking to purchase a life insurance policy to financially secure your wife and children in case you are no more? But what if your wife and children don’t get even a rupee out of the proceeds when they need it the most? This can happen if you have an ongoing home loan or a business that has incurred debts. In such a situation, the sum assured can be claimed by your creditors or attached by the court for repayment of your debts. But there’s good news: you can avoid this by simply buying your life insurance policy under the Married Women’s Property Act, 1874. What is the MWP Act (Married Women’s Property Act, 1874)? Section 6 of this Act highlights its importance: “a policy of insurance effected by any married man on his own life and expressed on the face of it to be for the benefit of his wife, or of his wife and children, or any of them, shall ensure and be deemed to be a trust for the benefit of his wife, or of his wife and children, or any of them according to the interests so expressed, and shall not, so long as any object of the trust remains, be subject to the control of the husband, or to his creditors, or form part of his estate.” Who can opt for insurance under the MWPA? If you are a resident of India and a married man, you can take an insurance policy under the MWPA. You can also purchase the policy if you are a widower or a divorcee — in such a scenario, you may name your children as beneficiaries. However, the benefit can only be availed of while taking the policy, and that too if you buy the policy in your own name. Whom can you name as beneficiaries? The beneficiaries defined in a policy that is covered under the MWPA can be your wife alone, just your child or children, or your wife and children together. As a policyholder, you can assign specific percentages of the sum assured to each beneficiary or divide it in equal amounts. However, once the policy has been issued, you cannot change the beneficiaries. So, when you appoint your wife as the beneficiary and in case you go through a divorce later, your beneficiary (wife) will remain the same. What else does the MWPA do? As a policyholder, you cannot take a loan against the policies that are endorsed under MWPA. In case you’re surrendering a cash-value policy, the proceeds due upon surrendering will go to the beneficiaries. Also, if you survive the policy term, the maturity proceeds would still be paid to your beneficiaries. How to take an insurance policy under the MWPA? The process of getting an insurance plan endorsed under the MWPA is very simple. All you need to do is fill up an addendum along with your insurance application at the time of taking the policy.

22 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||South Africa clinches a thriller||It was not just a challenging target set by India that the South African women were chasing on Sunday night. They were chasing history too. And they did it – off the last ball. They won the second T20I by six wickets to claim their first ever series against India in the format. While poor fielding and catching made things easier for them, chasing 159 was indeed a creditable effort. Opener Lizelle Lee (70, 45b, 11x4, 1x6) and Laura Wolvaardt (53 not out, 39b, 7x4) were the architects. When the hard-hitting Lee, who was dropped twice, was dismissed by left-arm spinner Radha Yadav in the 16th over, India was back in it. But, Wolvaardt showed nerves of steel to take her side home. Nine was needed off the 20th over, and one off the final delivery. The 21-year-old scampered home for a single to trigger celebrations in the South Africa dugout. Earlier, two 17-year-olds — opener Shafali Verma and No. 5 Richa Ghosh — produced quality batting at either end of the Indian innings to ensure that the goodly, vocal crowd had something to cheer about. India had a poor start once again as skipper Smriti Mandhana edged a wide delivery from seamer Shabnim Ismail to the wicketkeeper. Harleen Deol, who had made her maiden International half-century just a day ago, was content to play second fiddle to the aggressive Shafali. On the attack The teenaged opener hit the experienced Shabnim for three fours in her second over. Shafali then smashed seamer Nadine de Klerk straight over her head for a four before hitting her for a six. Shafali (47, 31b, 6x4, 2x6) added 79 for the second wicket with Harleen (31, 31b, 4x4) before she was bowled by left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba after missing the line completely. However, Richa ensured that India finished with a flourish. Playing in only her fifth match, the Siliguri teenager’s superb timing and powerful shots saw her compile an unbeaten 26-ball 44 (8x4). Shafali and Richa’s knocks were, however, not enough for India on this night.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/south-africa-clinches-a-thriller/article34127421.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||A day to remember for Ganemat||It was a bronze, but a significant one for Indian women as Ganemat Sekhon won a skeet medal in the shooting World Cup at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Sunday. It was the first ever World Cup medal for India in women’s skeet. Ganemat, who was placed second in qualification with 117, behind eventual gold medallist Amber Hill of Great Britain, overcame a nervous start to perform with confidence in the final. “I am very excited and happy. I was hoping to enter the final and I am thrilled to come up with a medal,” said Ganemat. National coach Mansher Singh said it was a good sign that both Ganemat and Karttiki Singh Shaktawat did exceptionally well, both in qualification and the final. India on top There were many other medals for India that helped the team climb to the top with three gold, three silver and two bronze medals. USA was in second with three gold and two silver, followed by Denmark with two gold and Iran with one gold. Both the air pistol teams won the yellow metal for India with authority. Saurabh Chaudhary, Abhishek Verma and Shahzar Rizvi took time to settle down as Vietnam enjoyed the lead in the final, but were dominant thereafter to triumph 17-11.

22 March 2021||GURUGRAM,||Maiden National titles for Arjun Kadhe and Shrivalli||Arjun Kadhe prevailed over Prithvi Sekar 6-3, 6-4 to clinch the men’s title in the National hard court tennis championship at the Tennis Project, Baliawas, on Sunday. In the women’s final, second seed Shrivalli Bhamidipaty downed top seed Vaidehi Chaudhari 6-2, 7-6(2) for her maiden National title. Long wait ends It was the completion of a long wait for the National title for the 27-year-old Arjun who had lost three finals over the years to Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan, Mohit Mayur and Siddharth Vishwakarma. “I have been searching for this title for quite a while. I am very happy to get the tag, which will be with me for ever,” said Arjun, on his way to the Pune for the ITF tournament. “I will play the ITF events at home and then try to get into the Challengers,” he added. It was a welcome triumph for the 19-year-old Shrivalli. For coach Sajid Lodi, it was another milestone after Mahak Jain had won the title twice. Vaidehi had played the international events well in recent weeks, competing hard against some of the best players, but could not match Shrivalli this day. Overwhelmed “I am overwhelmed. It has been a dream for me. I am happy to win the National title. “It feels unbelievable that it has come this quick,” said Shrivalli. National coach Zeeshan Ali watched the finals and was particularly impressed with Shrivalli. “I was impressed with Shrivalli when I saw her in the National junior championship two years ago. She has a big game and one of the best serves among the new lot. “She has improved a lot and hopefully this is her first step towards doing well in the international circuit,” said Zeeshan.

22 March 2021||TURIN,||Benevento stuns Juventus||Benevento dented Juventus’s Serie A title hopes on Sunday when Adolfo Gaich’s second-half strike sealed a shock 1-0 victory here and ended the relegation battler’s 11-match winless run. The Argentine pounced on a careless pass from Juve midfielder Arthur Melo to fire in the decisive goal after 69 minutes, and the toothless host failed to find a way past goalkeeper Lorenzo Montipo. The defeat left champions Juve in third place, 10 points behind leader Inter Milan with 11 games remaining. Benevento’s survival hopes were boosted as they moved seven points clear of the relegation zone in 16th position. Elsewhere, Atalanta drew level with Juve on 55 points and strengthened its grip on fourth place with a 2-0 win at Hellas Verona. Double strike Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema twice combined with teammate Toni Kroos to continue his insatiable scoring run as his side earned a 3-1 win away to Celta Vigo on Saturday to move to second in the LaLiga behind Atletico Madrid. Benzema curled a shot into the bottom corner to give Real the lead in the 20th minute after being released by a fine piece of play from Kroos, who danced past a defender before taking out three more with a pass into the feet of his team mate. Kroos was again involved for the second goal arriving on the half-hour mark, winning the ball back on the edge of the box and allowing Benzema to dribble across the box and score his eighth goal in six matches in all competitions. Santi Mina headed Celta back into the game in the 40th minute following a free kick. It took a strong save from keeper Thibaut Courtois to prevent Iago Aspas levelling in the second period. Real found a third deep in stoppage time when Benzema crowned his exceptional display by sending in a cross to Marco Asensio, who walked the ball over the line. Real moved up to second in the standings and closed the gap with Atletico to three points, although the leaders host Alaves on Sunday. Celta are 11th on 34. Brighton & Hove Albion took a stride towards Premier League safety and left Newcastle United deep in the relegation mire after a 3-0 home victory in the basement battle on Saturday.  The results: Serie A: Juventus 0 lost to Benevento1 (Adolfo Gaich 69); Hellas Verona 0 lost to Atalanta 2 (Malinovskyi 33-pen, Zapata 42)   LaLiga: Getafe 1 (Unal 60) drew with Elche 1 (Milla 20) .   Bundesliga: Hoffenheim 1 (Bebou 39) lost to Mainz 2 (Glatzel 1, Kohr 41); Hertha Berlin 3 (Zeefuik 4, Cunha 26, Cordoba 33) bt Bayer Leverkusen 0.   Saturday: Premier League: Brighton 3 (Trossard 45+3, Welbeck 51, Maupay 68) bt Newcastle 0.

Serie A: Spezia 2 (Piccoli 49, Maggiore 80) bt Cagliari 1 (Pereiro 83).

22 March 2021||Ahmedabad,||India used the series to try out new talent||Right through the five-match T20I series against India, England captain Eoin Morgan insisted that his team viewed the outings as a great chance to prepare for the ICC T20 World Cup to be held in India later this year. True to form, England played a strong unchanged eleven in the majority of the matches, kept the batting order constant, and even stuck to its preferred route of opting to field when the toss went Morgan’s way. Better understanding The series may have been lost 2-3, but the visitor finished with a good understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. India, on the other hand, took a more fluid approach. This leg was used as a chance to test new talent, and a new ‘baggage-free’ aggressive batting style. Planning for the World Cup was not of utmost priority, a point underlined by vice-captain Rohit Sharma, who stated on Saturday that there was still a long way to go.  With the IPL, and perhaps a few T20Is slotted for the coming months, the Indian team management will adopt a wait-and-watch approach before focusing all energy on the mega event. Regardless, a few faces staked claim to long-term India spots. None more so than Suryakumar Yadav, whose two outings with the bat yielded 89 runs at a terrific strike-rate of 185.41. The Mumbai cricketer impressed one and all with his impetuous hitting — a quality that captain Virat Kohli demands from his batsmen. Fearless style Ishan Kishan enjoyed a remarkable debut in the second T20I, striking a match-winning 32-ball 56 as opener. Ishan, batting at one-drop in the next match, only made four, and then sat out due to a groin injury. Like Suryakumar, Ishan’s fearless style makes him a hot favourite to grab a World Cup berth. Among the bowlers, Shardul Thakur — the highest wicket-taker of the series — stood out. The pacer put the skids on England with crucial double strikes in the fourth and fifth T20Is. On both occasions, he showed great control over the slower deliveries, and turned the game in India’s favour. Bhuvi’s dream return Fellow speedster Bhuvneshwar Kumar enjoyed a dream return from injury. The England batsmen struggled to deal with his sharp swing with the new ball, and were all at sea when he used the cutters in his later spells. Bhuvneshwar’s two for 15 in the final T20I, where bowlers from both teams were under the pump, proved that he was a cut above the rest. The home side did have to deal with a couple of failures. K.L. Rahul’s wretched run, with scores of 1, 0, 0 and 14, led him to being dropped for the decider. Rahul started the series with Kohli’s backing as the first-choice opening partner alongside Rohit Sharma, but it ended with Kohli replacing the Karnataka lad at the top of the order. Shikhar Dhawan, another opener, was unceremoniously dropped after failing in the first T20I. Under Kohli’s impulsive captaincy, one can expect more changes in personnel and tactics before the World Cup begins. A lot can happen over the course of seven months.  India outplayed us in the big moments and deserved to win. We generally bat deep and try to take advantage of it, but couldn't do so in big moments Eoin Morgan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-used-the-series-to-try-out-new-talent/article34127417.ece
22 March 2021||Ahmedabad,||Kohli as opener was a tactical move: Rohit||After finding success as opener in the final T20I here on Saturday, India captain Virat Kohli stated he was keen to have a longer run at the top of the order. At a media interaction, Kohli's partner Rohit Sharma took a more measured stance, explaining that the batting order was open to change. Both Kohli and Rohit mentioned that India could play a few more T20Is before the ICC T20 World Cup begins in October. As per the current schedule, the recent five-match series against England is the last T20Is India play before the marquee event. Excerpts:   Opening with Kohli: There is still a long time to go for the World Cup. It’s early days to talk about what the batting line-up will be. We have to think about what suits the team. Today, it (Kohli opening) was a tactical move to fit in the extra bowler. Unfortunately, we had to leave K.L. Rahul out. There will be an IPL in between, and I hear there will be a few T20Is as well before the World Cup. There’s enough time to judge.  World Cup preparation: This series does not send any signals about our perfect eleven. There’s still a long way to go for the World Cup. We need to see the form of the players, and take a call on the ideal eleven based on the opposition and conditions.  On Shardul Thakur and Ishan Kishan: Shardul is a wicket-taking bowler. In the last two matches, he bowled to high quality batsmen, and reacted to pressure very well. He went for some runs, but as long as bowlers give us crucial breakthroughs in the middle overs, that is all we ask for. The change I’ve noticed in Ishan is that he understands the game a lot better now. He captains Jharkhand in limited-overs tournaments, so that helps him read the game better. Guys like Ishan and Suryakumar have to be given the freedom to express themselves.  On Bhuvneshwar Kumar: In this line-up, Bhuvneshwar is our leading bowler. We place responsibility on him during crucial overs, and he has accepted it pretty well. I hope he stays fit and in form.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-as-opener-was-a-tactical-move-rohit/article34127423.ece

It was KSEB’s first win after the loss to the young Mar Athanasius FA in its opener. For Kerala United, which had won its first two games rather impressively, it was its first defeat. Kerala United was without its midfield star, captain Arjun Jayaraj, and it had its effect on the match.

Sandeep and the next came with a smart diagonal shot from the left just before half-time.

22 March 2021||Los Angeles,||James limps off in Lakers’ loss to Hawks||LeBron James crashed out of Los Angeles Lakers' 99-94 loss to Atlanta Hawks on Saturday with a right ankle injury that will sideline the NBA superstar indefinitely. The Lakers superstar collapsed to the court in agony after a collision with Hawks’ Solomon Hill in the second quarter, crying out in pain and clutching his right ankle. The 36-year-old returned briefly to hit a three-pointer before limping back to the locker room, knocking over a chair in frustration. ESPN later reported that an MRI scan revealed a high ankle sprain and that James faced an "indefinite" injury layoff. Depending on the severity, recovery from high ankle sprains can take anywhere from a few weeks up to several months. Devastating blow A lengthy layoff for James would be a devastating blow to reigning champion Lakers, who are already without star Anthony Davis as he recovers from Achilles tendon trouble. The Lakers fell to 28-14 to remain in second place in the Western Conference behind Utah Jazz. Sixth straight victory Elsewhere, Milwaukee Bucks kept the accelerator down, notching up a sixth straight victory, a 120-113 win over San Antonio Spurs. In Memphis, the Grizzlies got the better of short-handed Golden State, turning the tables on the Warriors a night after losing to them with a 111-103 victory. Jonas Valanciunas scored 19 points and pulled down 15 rebounds.  The results: LA Lakers 94 lost to Atlanta Hawks 99; Memphis Grizzlies 111 bt Golden State Warriors 103.   LA Clippers 125 bt Charlotte Hornets 98; Milwaukee Bucks 120 bt San Antonio Spurs 113; Phildelphia 76ers 129 bt Sacramento Kings 105.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/james-limps-off-in-lakers-loss-to-hawks/article34127466.ece

22 March 2021||DHAKA,||Shakib slams BCB||All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has hit out at the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for suggesting that he does not want to play the longest format of the game. Shakib has clarified that he just doesn’t want to play the upcoming two-match Test series against Sri Lanka as he wants to play the Indian Premier League (IPL) for preparing himself for this year’s T20 World Cup which will be played in India. “These two Tests are our last matches in the World Test Championship so it is not as if we are going to play the final. We are at the bottom of the points table. I don’t think it makes much of a difference. The other major reason is that the World Cup T20 is in India later this year. “It is a very important tournament where we have much to achieve. There isn’t much to achieve in these two Tests. I think it is a better option that I prepare myself for something bigger,” Shakib said. “Those who keep saying that I don’t want to play Tests, I am sure they didn’t read my letter. I didn’t mention anywhere in my letter to the BCB that I don’t want to play Tests. I wrote that I want to play the IPL to prepare myself for the World Cup.” Shakib also said that he clarified in his letter why he wants to skip the Test series against Sri Lanka and the reason was to prepare himself for this year’s T20 World Cup. However, Akram Khan, BCB’s cricket operations chairman had said that Shakib doesn’t want to play the two Tests against Sri Lanka, to be held from April 21 to May 3. “Akram Bhai, especially, has repeatedly said that I don’t want to play Tests. I think he said it again in an interview yesterday. I guess he never read the letter. People should have a clear idea that I wanted to play the IPL even if ODIs were scheduled during this time,” said Shakib.

22 March 2021||March 22 2021 00:00 IST,||Mysterious power of grace||Till date, the stamp of Adi Sankara’s teachings is prominent in the various streams of philosophical discussions, theology, literature, devotion, etc, and it continues to guide mankind’s spiritual quest in very subtle ways, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. In explaining this quest of every individual which culminates in the realisation of Brahman, scriptures are also emphatic that Brahman is not to be known merely through the study of scriptures, or through subtlety of the intellect, or through much learning. The only pointer available in this regard is that Brahman is known by him who longs for Him. This can be seen as the mysterious power of grace epitomised in the statement, “Whom the self chooses, by him He is attained.” So, no one can be sure when an individual would reach the stage of enlightenment. They also state that at best one can listen to the instructions of preceptors, and think about what has been heard, and pursue it further with meditation and nidhidyasa. Adi Sankara established the six mathas to enable worship of the one Impersonal Brahman seen in different forms as Siva, Vishnu, Shakti, Kumara, Ganapati and Surya. He also composed many Stotra granthas on these deities that are powerful assets as they help to instill devotion which is a sure path to enlightenment. The patient seeking relief for some ailment does not need to know what is mentioned in the doctor’s handwritten prescription; it is for the dispensing chemist to interpret the writing and give the right medicine. The omniscient God invoked in these prayers is aware of the individual’s state. Being the ultimate karma phala data, He dispenses the course of each one’s life according to their karma meticulously and may choose to confer jnana at some point of time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/mysterious-power-of-grace/article34127409.ece

22 March 2021||New Delhi,||Much ado about one thing||Almost a year after a nationwide crackdown was launched on people who attended a religious congregation at the Tablighi Jamaat centre in Nizamuddin during the early stage of COVID-19 proliferation, many who gave shelter to the attendees continue to face legal cases. Four residents of the Old Delhi area who housed four female Tablighis from abroad in March last year have been slapped with Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (unlawfully or negligently doing an act likely to spread infection of any disease), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. On Rizwan, Abdul Wahid, Mohammad Nosad and Feroze Siddiqui’s plea seeking to quash the FIR registered at the Chandni Mahal police station, the Delhi High Court has on March 15 restrained the lower courts from passing any order in their case. Advocate Ashima Mandla, who represented all four before the High Court, told The Hindu that around 60 persons continue to face different charges in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat incident. The crackdown The crackdown on the Tabligh members began after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a notification on March 28 last year “to identify, isolate and quarantine” workers of the missionary movement who might be COVID-19-positive. The MHA had estimated that around 2,100 foreigners were in India for Tabligh activities at the time of announcement of the nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020. Many of them were already dispersed in different parts of the country while others stayed put at the Nizamuddin centre. A nationwide search operation was also carried out for Indians who had attended the religious congregation and left for different parts of the country. In Delhi, all the attendees including foreigners who were evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters between March 26 and April 1 were sent to different quarantine centres. On March 31, the first FIR was registered against the congregation organisers, including Maulana Saad, the head of Tablighi Jamaat. Later, 29 other FIRs were registered at different police stations in the Capital. On completion of the investigation, 48 chargesheets and 11 supplementary chargesheets were filed arraying 953 foreign nationals of 36 different countries as accused. They were charged with violating visa rules, government guidelines issued in the wake of the pandemic, Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act rules and prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. They were also booked for the offences under Sections 188, 269, 270 and 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act. All the foreigners were kept in institutional quarantine till the High Court on May 25 permitted their shifting to an alternative accommodation. Of the 953 foreigners, 911 entered plea bargains by accepting mild charges. They were let off on payment of fines ranging from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 10,000 and subsequently left the country. However, 42 of them decided not to plead guilty to the charge and claimed trial. All of them were subsequently discharged or acquitted in the case. On December 15, a Delhi court while acquitting 36 foreign nationals noted, “It is beyond comprehension of the court as to how the IO [investigating officer] could have identified 952 foreign nationals [sic] out of 2,343 persons, who, as per the SHO, were found flouting the guidelines, without any TIP [Test Identification Parade], but on the basis of the list provided by MHA.” Advocate Mandla, who represented all the 953 foreigners during the trials, said the last batch of eight foreigners left for their respective countries on March 8, 2021. Memories that haunt Apart from the foreign nationals, most of the Indians who attended the religious congregation had to face extended periods of institutional quarantine. The Hindu spoke to two who recalled their time in centres and how the period impacted their life, including one who lost his job. Mohammed Hanif, a 64-year-old from West Bengal, is now at peace but he shudders at the thought of the time he spent at a quarantine centre in east Delhi’s Mandoli area. “I remember falling so sick that I couldn’t get up. I was bleeding from my nose twice every day but was locked up in a room without even a window and treated badly even after I had recovered,” he said. Mr. Hanif had come to the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters on March 21, 2020 after completing his religious tour of four months and was to leave in a day or two but the lockdown forced him to stay inside the building for the next nine days. “We were taken to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital for 14 days and then to a centre in Mandoli for the next 35 days. I’ll never forget those 35 days,” he said. He remembered being thrown medicines at him. “We were treated worse than animals.” Mr. Hanif and others from West Bengal left for their home in a bus thereafter. He got better in about a week and there was no looking back. “I just want to forget that time,” he said. Back in Port Blair, Sharfuddin, 49, lost his job because he was forced to stay in Delhi till May-end last year. “I was supposed to come back in April but even after I recovered, I was forced to stay in the quarantine centre. When I came back, I had already lost the job,” he said. Mr. Sharfuddin had come to the Nizamuddin centre on February 15, 2020 to offer his services for two months. He was sent to the Sultanpuri quarantine centre from hospital and stayed there till he took a flight back on May 28. Now, he cooks occasionally to earn some money. His wife runs a small-time tailoring business from home and his children go to school. “I had donated plasma and have a certificate for it. For no fault of ours, we were defamed and now I am jobless,” he said. While in the Capital, the Delhi police had categorically stated that they neither arrested nor detained any of the 953 foreign nationals in the case, other States took different routes. In Mumbai, 10 Indonesian nationals were arrested on April 23 and charged with Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 304 (ii) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 269, 270 and 188 of the IPC. The Indonesians were part of a group of 12 that had come to India on February 29, 2020 and after attending the congregation in Delhi, came to Mumbai on March 7. They were remanded in judicial custody on April 28 and granted bail on May 9. In another case, a sessions court at Dindoshi on May 5, 2020 granted anticipatory bail to 20 foreign nationals who had visited the Nizamuddin centre but had not volunteered information to the Mumbai police. On September 21, the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court quashed an FIR filed against eight Myanmar nationals, members of the Tablighi Jamaat, who had attended the Nizamuddin event. The court said “compelling them to undergo trial would cause grave injustice” as there was “no evidence to show that they indulged in any act that was likely to spread the virus”. Eleven Bangladeshi Tablighi Jamaat members, who were arrested from Bhadohi in U.P. for flouting visa norms and put on a government travel blacklist, left the country on March 20, 2021 after a Lucknow court allowed them go on completing their punishment. They were arrested on March 31 last year from a private guest house where they had been staying after coming from the Delhi congregation. Centre still locked The first FIR registered on March 31, 2020 named Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad and six others on a complaint of the SHO of Nizamuddin under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and other relevant sections of the IPC. The Tabligh chief is yet to join the investigation despite being served several notices, said a senior Delhi police officer. “We have recorded statements of Maulana Saad’s sons and office-bearers of the centre in connection with the case. Most of the forensic reports of documents and electronic devices seized from the organisation’s offices have come and only a few are awaited. The chargesheet is in its last phase of finalisation and will be submitted in court at the earliest,” the officer said. Almost a year since it was shut after several people contracted COVID-19 there, the Nizamuddin centre — comprising the Banglewali Masjid, Madrasa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel – continues to be locked up. The continued closure of the premises, according to the Delhi Waqf Board’s plea before the High Court, is leading to “growing discontent” among members of the Muslim community. The Board has contended that even after Unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the centre has remained locked. The High Court has sought response from the Delhi government and the police on the plea.

22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nizamuddin streets await the throng of yore||Next to the Hazrat Nizamuddin police station, on a street with a tricolour divider, Mohammed Iqbal exhorts passers-by to buy a plateful of roses to offer at the dargah up ahead. A lot has changed in a year since the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz (centre) grabbed national headlines after the initial proliferation of COVID-19 cases. Mr. Iqbal, whose income has dropped drastically since the event, takes solace in the fact that he can at least come to the area and sell flowers. Last year in March, this street was cordoned off with multiple layers of barricading and security personnel standing guard – initially wearing PPE kits. The congregation at the centre, popularly known as Banglewali Masjid where thousands of people from across the country and the world come to stay from time to time for religious reasons, was being tagged as a “super spreader event” after several COVID-19 cases were detected at the centre. All those staying at the centre were shifted to various quarantine centres across the Capital and criminal cases were registered in the matter. The centre was shut down in the last week of March 2020 and has not been reopened yet. The street is still waiting to come back to its full glory. Local businesses have been severely affected and those running the shops are praying for it to open again. The income of the vendors selling food, flowers, clothing, perfumes, books and souvenirs has reduced by more than half No visitors, no footfall Mohammed Nadeem, 34, runs Mahir Zaki Hotel, which was opened 60 years ago by his grandfather and was one of the go-to places for breakfast, lunch and dinner for those visiting the Nizamuddin centre. “Our income has remained at 20% of what it was. During peak meal hours, there used to be no space to walk or even enter the hotel but now look at this,” he says, pointing to the empty chairs and tables. Mr. Nadeem used to make 20 kg portions but now it has come down to about 8 kg. He used to employ 18 workers till March last year; their number has now come down to four. Most businesses started picking up after the lockdown restrictions were eased but Mr. Nadeem is yet to start making money. “Business was flourishing here, especially in this street, because of the markaz. Even though the centre provided food, people coming here at odd hours and wanting to eat something different used to come to our hotel,” says Mr. Nadeem. Mohammed Hasan, a 70-year-old resident of the area, switched from selling tea near the Tablighi Jamaat centre to selling ‘datun’ (teeth-cleaning twigs) on the street. Mr. Hasan has six children – four sons and two daughters, none of them earning yet – and a wife to feed. He was making a decent income until the Tabligh headquarters were sealed. “The dargah [of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya] also shuts at 6.30 p.m. after which this street feels as if the lockdown is on here. Thousands of people used to come here and have tea but now I am barely making ends meet,” he says. “There have been days when we ate our first meal in the afternoon and had no idea how we would manage the next.” ‘Lifestyle changes’ Mohammed Khalid, 49, who sells books in a small shop, says sales have dropped 50-60% since the centre shut down. People visiting the centre used to buy religious and other books from his shop. “We have made lifestyle changes – especially in our meals – because of low income. A lot of books were bought by foreign tourists and we have no idea when that is going to happen again,” he says, adding that Muslims staying abroad might think twice about visiting the centre again after last year’s controversy. Locals believe the area is more of a tourist place and if not for the dargah and the Tabligh centre, “this place has no meaning”. Mr. Hasan says there’s still a sense of hesitation among people to come here and blames the media and the authorities for “showing the Markaz and Nizamuddin in a negative light”. Mohammed Hussain alias Babu Bhai, a 50-year-old resident, recalls how he used to sit at home and watch Nizamuddin being shown “as a highly infected area where even breathing could infect one with COVID-19”. “We were sitting inside our houses and managing things peacefully, buying vegetables and necessary things from the local stores, but on TV we used to see a completely different picture,” he says. The only good thing that came out of the incident was that people who did not know about the Nizamuddin centre became aware of it, adds Mr. Hussain. Recalling the time when people residing inside the Tablighi Jamaat building were asked to leave, he says, “Thousands of people used to stay here on a daily basis. It’s not like they had come here particularly around that time. When the lockdown was announced, people were asked to stay where they were and that’s what people here also did. When the police and the government ordered them to leave, they left. Why turn them into villains?” Negative publicity Nizamuddin Dargah committee member Altamash Nizami says the shrine – which was instrumental in bringing back the cheer in the area – opened after nearly six months and thanks to that the shops close to it were able to make some money. He says there was a lot of negative publicity for the area last year. “This disease [COVID-19] was not related to any religion but one religion was blamed for the spread, which was wrong. A wrong message was sent to society,” says Mr. Nizami. He is glad that the impact of the negative publicity has not lingered and people are back to the dargah and the streets of Nizamuddin, even if in relatively lesser numbers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nizamuddin-streets-await-the-throng-of-yore/article34127677.ece
22 March 2021||New Delhi,||Mob attacks man’s house over interfaith marriage||Security personnel have been deployed in south-east Delhi’s Harijan Basti in Sarai Kale Khan after a mob allegedly attacked the house of a 22-year-old man for marrying a woman from another community, the police said on Sunday. The incident took place on Saturday night when around 15-20 men entered the locality and created a ruckus, they said. Four persons have been arrested in connection with the case, an officer said. In the CCTV footage of the incident, shared on a social media platform, the mob could be seen entering the lane and breaking pots, pelting stones, damaging vehicles and banging on the doors in an attempt to break it. Three to four people were injured in the incident. The police said the woman’s family was against their relationship. DCP (South-East) R.P. Meena said: “The spot was visited by senior officers and it was revealed that Sumit and Khushi, both adults, of the same locality got married against the will of the woman’s parents. The mob comprised woman’s relatives and acquaintances.” The residents of the locality, however, alleged that they feel unsafe as the accused men are still “roaming free”. The couple got married on March 17 and a missing person report was filed by the woman’s family at Sunlight Colony police station on Saturday. When the couple was called to the police station, the woman said the wedding was conducted with her consent. Since the two were adults, they were sent back home, an officer said. At the time of the incident, Sumit’s family was not present in the locality. The couple was in Ghaziabad. Sumit’s mother Rajni said the woman’s family has threatened them of dire consequences. “My son married a Muslim girl. They [woman’s family] were against it. They abused us and said they will not allow us to stay here. We were called to the police station on Saturday. Khushi had even said she was happy with the marriage but after we returned from the police station, they created ruckus here. We are all scared,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mob-attacks-mans-house-over-interfaith-marriage/article34127665.ece
22 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||BJP banks on neighbourhood namghars in Assam||Mandate 2021 has made the ‘namghar’, a common feature across Assamese villages and urban localities, quite special. Five centuries ago, saint-reformer Srimanta Sankaradeva and his disciples introduced the namghars as a place of congregation for local-level spiritual, cultural and educational events. Over time, the ubiquitous structures yielded space for political discussions. A grant appears to have made these namghars more electorally relevant than ever before. The importance of the grant was not lost when the BJP-led coalition government released Rs. 2.5 lakh each to 8,756 namghars in August 2020 along with Rs. 10 lakh each to 377 temples, mosques and churches. The State’s Cultural Affairs Department had estimated about 1.10 lakh standalone neighbourhood namghars — structures built by communities or villages and not within a satras or Vaishnav monastery.  ‘Overestimation’ “Going by the number of Hindu villages — and not all of them sport a namghar — this seems to be an overestimation. A more realistic estimation may be 40,000,” said Pulin Deka, who wrote a book on the namghar institution. The Congress government had also “overestimated” the number of satras — they have considerable influence among adherents of Eksarana sect of Hinduism specific to Assam — for grants. The BJP-led government went beyond the satras to splurge on the standalone namghars. “When you look at the number of voters associated with a beneficiary namghar, the move could be a mathematical masterstroke,” said Sandhya Goswami, retired professor of political science at Gauhati University. An average of 70 households are associated with a namghar. The community ownership of some namghars range from 150 to 400 families. A village or urban locality manages its namghar. Some are run by organisations such as Srimanta Sankaradeva Sangha, headquartered in central Assam’s Nagaon.  ‘Hope it’s made annual’ “We have more than 6,000 units but about 5,000 of them have namghars. Most of our namghars have received the grant, which we hope will cover all the namghars and be made annual if the BJP returns to power,” the Sangha’s secretary general Babul Bora told The Hindu . “People are happy that Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma responded to our proposal and provided the grant. We cannot but be grateful on the day of election,” he added.  Urban areas not left out Many of the namghars that have received the grant are in the rural areas. The urban pockets cultivated by the BJP have been on the government’s radar too. “We have received the allotment letter against which we submitted the estimate. We hope to get the grant after the elections,” said Bhaskar Goswami of Guwahati’s Silpukhuri Rajahuwa Namghar. “Money for the namghars could translate into votes. But we are not sure if such a strategy in the name of religion can be sustained,” Ms. Goswami said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-banks-on-neighbourhood-namghars-in-assam/article34127689.ece
22 March 2021||New Delhi,||Court refuses bail to man who killed couple in Paschim Vihar||The Delhi High Court has refused bail to a man, who has been arrested for killing an old couple in Paschim Vihar here, after he was tipped off by the conspirator of the crime. The court noted that Raghvender Singh alias Rinku was in constant touch with the prime accused at the time of committing the crime. “There have been recoveries at the instance of the petitioner [Rinku]. The item recovered from his instance belonged to the deceased and this has been confirmed by their son,” the court added. It also said: “The petitioner [Rinku] is accused of a crime of double murder. The case is at initial stage, the charges are yet to be framed. The possibility of the accused fleeing from justice or from tampering evidence cannot be ruled out”. Two years ago  The case came to the fore on March 8, 2019, when a woman’s body was found lying near a sewer in Sayed village, Nangloi. Next day, another body, this time of a man, was found near the drain. The bodies were found in suitcases. Investigation revealed that the bodies were of Jagir Singh and Gurmeet Kaur, husband and wife. The cause of death in both cases was “asphyxia as a result of ante-mortem smothering”. The couple’s children leveled allegation against their sister Davinder Kaur and her paramour Prince Dixit for the murder. They were arrested on March 10, 2019. The police said the duo told they had hatched the conspiracy to kill the couple as they wanted the property of the victims. The duo also said they had roped in Rinku, who committed the crime. Rinku was then arrested on March 12, 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-refuses-bail-to-man-who-killed-couple-in-paschim-vihar/article34127658.ece
22 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Unable to conceive, woman kills neighbour’s toddler as ‘sacrifice’||A 25-year-old woman has been arrested for allegedly killing a three-year-old boy in Rohini’s Budh Vihar, the police said on Sunday. The accused has been identified as Neelam Gupta, they said. The matter came to the fore on Saturday when the boy’s parents approached the police with a missing complaint following which a search operation was launched. During this, an officer noticed a bag on the roof of the adjacent house. When the police opened the bag, they saw the body of the boy. He had injury marks on his neck. It was found that the toddler was strangulated, an officer said. A murder case was then registered. During probe, family members, relatives and neighbours were questioned. It was found that the boy was last seen with Neelam, he said. When questioned, Neelam initially tried to mislead the police but later confessed to the crime. DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said during the interrogation, Neelam said she got married in 2013 and could not conceive despite medical aid. She was under lot of pressure from her in-laws and others to conceive. Four years ago, she approached a tantric in her village in Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh. He suggested her to sacrifice a child if she wanted to conceive. So in desperation, she decided to kill the son of her neighbour, the police said. “She killed the toddler when he was playing alone on the roof,” said Mr. Tayal. Further probe is under way, the police added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/unable-to-conceive-woman-kills-neighbours-toddler-as-sacrifice/article34127661.ece
