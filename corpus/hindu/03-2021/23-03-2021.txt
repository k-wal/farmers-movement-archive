23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Increase interval between two doses of Covishield, says Centre||The Centre on Monday wrote to the States and the Union Territories to increase the interval between two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, from four to eight weeks instead of the earlier four to six weeks. “Keeping the existing scientific evidence in view, it appears that protection is enhanced if the second dose of Covishield is administered between 6-8 weeks, but not later than the stipulated period of eight weeks,” a Union Health Ministry statement said. The Ministry said the interval between the two doses of Covishield had been revisited by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and subsequently by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) at its 20th meeting. No change for Covaxin “During this meeting, the recommendation has been revised to provide second dose of Covishieldat 4-8weeks’ interval after the first dose, instead of earlier practised interval of 4-6 weeks. This decision of revised time interval between two doses is applicable only to Covishield and not to Covaxin,” the Ministry said. In a letter to the Chief Secretaries of the States and the Union Territories, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the Ministry had accepted the recommendations of NTAGI and NEGVAC. He advised them to ensure the administration of the second dose of the vaccine to beneficiaries within the stipulated time interval of four to eight weeks after the first dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/increase-interval-between-two-doses-of-covishield-says-centre/article34136779.ece
23 March 2021||KALABURAGI,||A little praise from the top to help commoners take it to next level||After launching the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain campaign, the Union Jal Shakti Ministry’s flagship campaign for water conservation, on the occasion of World Water Day on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, through video conferencing, interacted with the heads of five Gram Panchayats — one each from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand — who have made significant contributions to water conservation in their neighbourhoods, and commended their efforts. Srinivas Jonnakeri, president of Dhupadamahagaon Gram Panchayat in Aurad taluk, Bidar district, was one among them. Mr. Jonnakeri’s initiative and efforts in mobilising his villages under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and dredging a village lake — Goggavvana Kere — during the COVID-19 lockdown had caught the attention of the Jal Shakti Ministry. Mr. Jonnakeri has been a part of Team Yuva, a group of dedicated volunteers that has been working for water conservation in Bidar district ever since its formation in 2013. The group has dredged over 350 wells and Kalyanis and 30 lakes so far, giving a new lease of life to them. It played a key role in convincing the district administration of the need for cleaning and rejuvenating the historical Karez, a horizontal underground water body with vertical openings for water collection and recharging connecting different places across Bidar city, which was built by the Bahmani kings. “The Prime Minister spent more time, appropriately six minutes, with me than any other Sarpanchs who were selected for today’s interaction. As I was told by the administration a day before the interaction, I briefed the Prime Minister only on my recent activities in the field of water conservation. The Prime Minister inquired whether I was supported by villagers and I told him that all water conservation activities were taken up with the consent and the active support of the people as it was their requirement. The Prime Minister appreciated my initiative and asked me to continue it,” Mr. Jonnakeri told The Hindu after his interaction with the Prime Minister. A large screen was put up in the village to help villagers watch the interaction live. Mr. Jonnakeri told the Prime Minister that his villagers would, standing before the screen, pledge for water conservation. The Goggavvana Kere, a 1.5-acre lake that was named after a 12th Century Sharane [Goggavva] and a contemporary of reformer Basaveshwara, was almost full of silt and had lost its water holding capacity. After assuming power as president of Dhupada-mahagaon, Mr. Jonnakeri was contemplating taking up lake dredging. The COVID-19 lockdown gave him an opportunity to mobilise his village labour and employ them for the task under the job scheme as the workers were almost jobless at the time. Apart from dredging the lake, the workers cleaned and dredged smaller streams that carried rainwater to the lake. “Now, the lake has held a good amount of water and the entire village is using it. I am going to similarly focus on the other smaller tanks and wells in the village,” Mr. Jonnakeri said.  Prime Minister interacts with presidents of five gram panchayats in five Sates, including Dhupadamahagaon in Bidar district||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-little-praise-from-the-top-to-help-commoners-take-it-to-next-level/article34137065.ece
23 March 2021||New Delhi,||Dhanush, Manoj Bajpayee, Kangana bag top honours||In what could be seen as a thumbs up to nationalist narratives, Priyadarshan’s Marakar Arbikadalinte Simham was chosen as the best feature film and Sanjay Pooran Singh Chauhan won the best director award for Hindi film Bhattar Hoorain at the 67th National Film Awards announced on Monday in New Delhi. Manoj Bajpayee and Dhanush shared the best actor award, while Kangana Ranaut won the best actress award, announced by N. Chandra, chairman of the central panel. The announcement of the awards was delayed by almost a year because of the pandemic. Headlined by Mohanlal, Marakar Arbikadalinte Simham, or the Lion of Arabian Sea, is a period action drama about a 16th century Malayali naval chieftain who fought the Portuguese invasion. Chauhan’s film is a dark comedy about the consequences of violent extremism. It is his second film after Lahore that won him the Indira Gandhi Award for the best debutant director in 2010. Both the films are yet to make it to theatres because of the COVID-19 situation. While Bajpayee was awarded for his measured performance of a retired police constable in Bhonsle , Dhanush won it for depicting a range of emotions in Vetrimaaran’s multi-layered revenge drama Asuran . Ranaut bagged the award for her varied performances in Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi and Panga . Having been ignored for Aligarh and Gali Guleiyan , it has been a long wait for Bajpayee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dhanush-manoj-bajpayee-kangana-bag-top-honours/article34136777.ece
23 March 2021||MANGALURU,||One-hour COVID-19 awareness and enforcement drive from today||Dakshina Kannada district administration will launch on Tuesday a daily one-hour awareness drive across the district to sensitise people to wear masks and maintain social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “We will do it to prevent the surge of infections from the likely second wave of COVID-19. We want people to wear masks and maintain social distancing when they are in public areas,” Dr. Rajendra told reporters after symbolically launching the exercise on Monday by visiting a mall, a few other shops and boarding private city buses. Dr. Rajendra said that officials in 279 urban local bodies and 228 gram panchayats will participate in the exercise every day between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. Apart from creating awareness and enforcement of COVID-19 preventive measures, the teams will identify those with COVID-19 symptoms and send them for tests to the nearby health facilities. These teams will also intensify vaccination among senior citizens and those aged above 45 who have co-morbidities. The Deputy Commissioner said that the Regional Transport Officer has been asked to suspend the permits of autorickshaw drivers and private buses if their passengers are found not wearing masks. Measures have been taken to randomly check RT-PCR test reports of motorists coming from Kerala at Talapady on National Highway 66 and at 24 other check-posts, Dr. Rajendra said and added that checking will be intensified in April when government officials will be relieved from the financial year-end work. A letter has been written to the Health Commissioner expressing the need for screening persons coming from Kerala to the city on trains. Political parties have been told to ensure that those returning to the district from campaigning in Kerala should possess COVID-19 negative certificate. The district administration has written to the Fire and Emergency Services Department asking for the use of 23 State Disaster Response Force personnel as marshals for enforcement of COVID-19 preventive measures. “If we do not get clearance, then Home Guards will be used for this purpose,” he said. Dr. Rajendra said that the district administration is considering placing restrictions on festivals and religious programmes in temples in the next two months. Doctors in the district have been told to report to the Health Department all cases of Influenza Like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness. A round of RT-PCR tests of all students in schools and colleges has been completed and another round of testing will be started shortly. RT-PCR tests of personnel working in petrol bunks and those working with online food suppliers will also be carried out, Dr. Rajendra said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/one-hour-covid-19-awareness-and-enforcement-drive-from-today/article34137253.ece

23 March 2021||MYSURU,||Rise in COVID-19 cases: DC hints at area-specific ‘mini’ lockdown||Hinting at creating containment zones in case of any “super spreading” events in the district, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri on Monday said the possibility of demarcating containment areas and imposing area-specific “mini” lockdowns could not be ruled out and cautioned the public to take utmost precautions against the pandemic as the second wave could be even more threatening. Speaking to reporters here, Ms. Sindhuri, citing previous instances of “super spreader” events reported from Nanjangud and N.R. Mohalla in Mysuru, said the Minister for Health and Family Welfare had announced that the second wave in the State had begun and accordingly cases were on the rise in Mysuru too. Cases were also being reported in villages with infections spreading from urban to rural areas. As a result of the rising trend, people had to be very watchful and take precautions, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distance and avoiding crowded places to prevent the spread, she advised. However, it appeared that people were not realising the dangers, the Deputy Commissioner said, citing how people were found not wearing masks during her recent village stay in H.D. Kote taluk despite repeated appeals for keeping their masks on for avoiding infection. On the new norms issued by the government, Ms. Sindhuri said the guidelines had been defined on how many people could congregate and there was a clear instruction to reduce the number of people assembling at mass events amidst fears of the second peak. At the same time, there was a demand to increase the cap on people’s participation in functions such as weddings which is not possible at this stage, she replied, perhaps indicating that the district administration was gearing up for stricter rules in the days ahead for arresting the ascending trend. On her decision to allow a simple ‘rathotsava’ at the Nanjangud temple, she said 200 people would be allowed inside the temple and 500 outside the temple premises during the ‘Pancha Maharathotsava’ event as part of ‘Dodda Jatre’ at Srikanteshwaraswamy Temple. This decision had been taken in the light of the second wave scare. “It is not possible to allow lakhs of people to participate in the ‘rathotsava’ now. Moreover, it will be difficult to control the situation as I personally saw the large crowds gathered during Mahashivaratri at the temple. The ‘jatre’ can be celebrated next year but what is important at present is to save lives,” she replied to reporters’ queries on the demand from the locals for allowing the ‘Dodda Jatre’ without any curbs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mysuru-dc-hints-at-mini-lockdown/article34136856.ece

There will be round-the-clock patrolling of yatra routes by 360-degree camera fitted Mobile Bunker Vehicles (MBVs),” he said. The IGP described stone pelting “a larger issue than militancy”. “It creates a negative impact and keeps tourists away.

23 March 2021||New Delhi,||Bomb scare case stalls Parliament||Treasury benches in both Houses of Parliament raised the Mumbai bomb scare case, flagging the letter written by former City Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh accusing Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of running an extortion racket on Monday. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned for two hours due to the uproar, while the Shiv Sena staged a walkout in the Lok Sabha. The protests began at noon in the Rajya Sabha just when the Question Hour had started. BJP MPs stood up shouting slogans against the Maharashtra government. “So far, it was only the terrorists who planted bombs, but in Maharashtra it is the police who are doing this,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said. The Question Hour went on for a few minutes amid this din.  In the Lok Sabha, the Shiv Sena staged a walkout as the Maharashtra issue was raised by at least seven MPs of the Treasury benches (including one Independent MP Navneet Rana) during Zero Hour. BJP MP Manoj Kotak was the first to raise the issue demanding that Maharashtra Home Minister resign. He was followed by another BJP MP Rakesh Singh stating that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders who had been saying that this was a serious issue till the previous evening were “singing a different tune” this morning. “What has happened in the interregnum?” he asked. “Is it because the Maharashtra Home Minister has threatened to implicate other leaders of his party too,” he asked. In response, Vinayak Raut of the Shiv Sena said the background of the former Mumbai Police Commissioner needed to be known as well as who had appointed him. “These allegations are part of a design to destabilise the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra,” he said. Ravneet Singh Bittu of the Congress added that the running interference of Central agencies in the matter was clear and that the Centre wanted to destabilise the MVA government in Maharashtra just as it had destabilised the Madhya Pradesh government. The Shiv Sena walked out of the House at that point and the House took to debating the Insurance Bill. Speaking during the Bill, however, Supriya Sule of the NCP said it seemed to her that the Zero Hour had been rigged with multiple members of the Treasury benches being allowed to raise the issue without allowing for her party to respond.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uproar-in-house-over-bomb-scare-case/article34136713.ece

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Build strong mass movement against farm laws in Karnataka’||Concluding a three-day tour of Karnataka on Monday, a delegation of national farmers’ leaders, including Rakesh Tikait and Dr. Darshan Pal, who are leading the movement in Delhi, had one message for the State’s farmers: “Build a strong mass movement against farm laws in the State. The movement has to take root in south India if it has to become truly national.” Addressing a rally in the city on Monday, Mr. Tikait called upon farmers to block Bengaluru's borders with tractors like in Delhi. “It was in this State that Prof. M.D. Nanjundaswamy thought way ahead of his times – protested against GATT agreement and also rightly foresaw the threat of corporates, and protested against firms like KFC almost three decades ago. Today, we are living the reality he foresaw. The entire food sector is being corporatised. This is going to be the business of hunger,” he said. “The State government here has not only blindly implemented all the farm laws by the Centre, but also brought in more amendments to the Land Reforms Act, which is a conspiracy to snatch away our lands,” he added. Samyukta Horata – Karnataka, a coalition of farmers, Dalits and labour groups, has been consistently organising protests against the farm laws in the State, though it hasn't taken the shape of a mass movement. The Horata has now announced a Karnataka bandh on March 26. Farmers’ leader Badagalpura Nagendra said they have planned a Raita Mahapanchayat in north Karnataka in May for which the aim is to organise one lakh people. Another farmers’ leader Yuddhaveer Singh said the BJP-led Union government first tried to brand the movement as limited to Punjab and later Khalistani supporters, but later Haryana and U.P. joined. “Now, it is the turn of Karnataka,” he said. “The Union government may have not responded to the movement, but our support is only growing. Labour unions protesting the new labour codes and privatisation have joined us, the traders have also joined us. Geographically too, the movement is spreading. Karnataka has shown that it is truly a national movement,” he said. State Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil visited the rally site and accepted the memorandum of demands from farmers on behalf of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. The farmers demanded repeal of three farm laws by the Union government, apart from rollback of amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, Karnataka APMC Act and the recent cow slaughter bill, among a host of other issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/build-strong-mass-movement-against-farm-laws-in-karnataka/article34136831.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||LS nod for Bill to increase FDI in insurance||The Lok Sabha on Monday passed the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2021 which seeks to raise the limit for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in insurance companies from 49% to 74%. The Bill had earlier been cleared by the Rajya Sabha and now requires presidential assent to become law. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who piloted the Bill in both Houses, said the move was aimed at solving some of the long-term capital availability issues in the insurance sector which was a capital intensive industry. She added that stakeholders had been consulted by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) before going ahead with the move. In her response to the debate on the Bill in the House, Ms. Sitharaman said that apprehensions over the gradual taking over of public sector insurance companies was ill-founded, as the banking and insurance industry had been designated as strategic sectors and that the 74% cap is just a limit posed on the FDI. She pointed out that the high solvency fund ratio in the sector has led to liquidity stress in the sector and that the Bill will address that stress. “Government can help public sector firms but private companies will have to find ways of raising money,” she said. Responding to Congress member Manish Tewari’s apprehensions that the public sector undertakings were going to be disinvested and that it was “akin to selling the family silver”, the Minister said it was not, and the previous UPA government had also pushed for raising the FDI limit. “Nobody is taking the money outside India. The Bill has safeguards that some of the profit has to be invested within the country,” she said responding to the debate. She said the Bill was about right sizing the public sector and unlocking assets. Ms. Sitharaman asserted that public sector employees will be protected and the measure will also give a fillip to private employees. “There are 2.67 lakh employees in the private sector in insurance as against 1.54 lakhs in the public sector. Around 15 lakh insurance agents in the public sector as against 21 lakh in the private sector, there are seven public sector companies, while 61 exist in the private sector and money should be available to them to do business,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ls-nod-for-bill-to-increase-fdi-in-insurance/article34136705.ece
23 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Patriotism can’t be revealed by a gross physical act: HC||There is no doubt that nationalism in a democracy like India is very vital but hyper and surfeit adherence to it goes against the prosperity of our nation from all its past glory, the Madras High Court observed on Monday. The court set aside a Judicial Magistrate’s order to register a criminal case against certain persons in Coimbatore, who organised and participated in a Christmas celebration, where a cake containing an icing of the national flag was cut and consumed. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the High Court wrote: “A patriot is not one who only raises the flag, symbolises his national pride and wears it on his sleeve, but also a person who bats for good governance. The symbolisation of national pride is not synonymous with patriotism, just like how cutting a cake is not unpatriotic. Rig Veda asks us to let noble thoughts come to us from every side, which reflects the Indian ethos i.e., tolerance.” Allowing a State appeal preferred against the Magistrate’s 2017 order, the judge agreed with Additional Advocate General C. Emilias that the act of cutting a cake with an icing of the Indian flag on December 25, 2013 in Coimbatore would not amount to an offence under Section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act of 1971. Justice Venkatesh observed that patriotism could not be determined just by a gross physical act. The intention behind such act would be the true test though it could be possible that sometimes the very act itself manifests the intention behind it. In so far as the Coimbatore Christmas celebration was concerned, the intention did not appear to be to insult the national tricolour and instead the participants had felt proud to be a part of the nation, he added. Referring to the national flag which people pin to their clothes during Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations every year, the judge said those flags are not possessed forever. Instead, “they become a part of any other wastepaper after the participants leave the venue. Will this mean that each of the participants had insulted the flag and should be proceeded against?” the judge asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/patriotism-cant-be-revealed-by-a-gross-physical-act-hc/article34136696.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Gandhi Peace Prize for Mujib and Sultan Qaboos||The Culture Ministry on Monday announced that the father of the nation of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the former Sultan of Oman, the late Qaboos bin Said Al Said, will be awarded the Gandhi Peace Prize for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Ministry said the jury, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and comprising the Chief Justice of India, the leader of the single largest Opposition party in the Lok Sabha, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and founder of Sulabh International Bindeshwar Pathak, met on March 19 and decided on the awardees for the annual prize. The Ministry said Rahman was chosen in “recognition of his outstanding contributions towards social, economic and political transformation through non-violent and other Gandhian methods”. “PM Modi has said Bangabandhu [Rahman] was a champion of human rights and freedom, and is a hero to Indians as well. He also said the legacy and inspiration of Bangabandhu has made the heritage of both countries more comprehensive and deep-rooted, and that the path shown by Bangabandhu has laid a strong foundation for the partnership, progress and prosperity of both countries over the last decade.” It said the award recognised his unparalleled contribution towards inspiring the liberation of Bangladesh. Regarding the 2019 prize, the Ministry said, “His Majesty Sultan Qaboos was a visionary leader whose twin policy of moderation and mediation in addressing international issues won him praise and respect across the globe... H.M. Sultan Qaboos was the architect of the special ties between India and Oman. He had studied in India and always maintained a special relationship with India.” It said the award recognised his leadership in strengthening the ties between India and Oman and his efforts to promote peace in the Gulf region. The Ministry said the award carries Rs. 1 crore, a citation, a plaque and an item of traditional handicraft or handloom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gandhi-peace-prize-for-mujib-and-sultan-qaboos/article34136727.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Plea against challenge to Places of Worship Act||The trustee of a 350-year-old mosque in Lucknow has questioned a “mischievous” petition filed by a Supreme Court advocate which claims that “fundamentalist barbarians” invaded India and destroyed places of worship. The petition filed by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay had also challenged a special law — Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act of 1991 — which freezes the status of places of worship as it was on August 15, 1947. A Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde had decided to examine his petition and asked the government to respond. Wasif Hasan, the co-mutawalli of Teele Wali Masjid, said Mr. Upadhyay’s petition was not based on facts, and in fact, its contents were quite “shocking”. Mr. Hasan said he is already fighting a suit in Lucknow against parties who claim that a temple once stood where the Teele Wali Masjid was built. “This mischievous petition [of Mr. Upadhyay] intends to isolate the Muslim community from other religious communities in the country... The petition tries to create an allegedly factual case of fundamentalist barbarians coming to India and destroying places of worship,” Mr. Hasan’s application said. The mosque trustee urged the apex court to allow him to intervene and prove that Mr. Upadhyay’s petition “creates a false narrative that Muslims and Christians are invaders and less a part of India than other communities.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-against-challenge-to-places-of-worship-act/article34136731.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Why stop at quota, asks SC judge||Justice Ravindra Bhat, one of the judges on the Constitution Bench hearing the question of 50% ceiling limit on reservation, asked why welfare should be dependent on caste quota benefits alone. “Why stop at reservation? Why can’t other things also be done? Why not promote education, establish more institutes? Somewhere this matrix has to move beyond reservation. Affirmative action is not just reservation. There has to be something more,” Justice Bhat, part of the Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, asked. The court was hearing submissions by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jharkhand, on the circumstances which led to the 50% limit in the Indira Sawhney judgment of 1992. ‘Balancing act’ Mr. Sibal said the 1992 judgment was “a balancing act” done during a tumultuous time in the nation. On March 8, the Bench had framed several questions of law, including whether the Indira Sawhney verdict needed to be re-looked by a larger Bench of more than nine judges. SEBC Act examined The court is primarily examining whether the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act of 2018, which provides 12% to 13% quota benefits for the Maratha community, and thus, taking the reservation percentage in the State across the 50% mark, was enacted under “extraordinary circumstances”. Over the years, several States like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have crossed the Rubicon and passed laws which allow reservation to over 60%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-stop-at-quota-asks-sc-judge/article34136734.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||MEA silent on reports of UAE role in India-Pakistan détente||The Ministry of External Affairs refused to comment on the latest in a series of reports that the India-Pakistan détente, signalled by the ceasefire announcement by border commanders at the Line of Control (LoC) last month, was prompted by a back-channel dialogue between Indian and Pakistani officials, and facilitated by a third country. On Monday, the international news agency Bloomberg reported that the two governments had begun to work on a four-step “road map for peace” facilitated by the United Arab Emirates government. The report said the surprise joint statement announced by the Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs) on February 25, that agreed to end cross-LoC ceasefire violations (CFVs), was the outcome of talks “brokered by the UAE” months earlier and that the visit of UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed to Delhi on February 26 also discussed progress in the India-Pakistan “peace” process with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. At least two Indian national dailies and an international portal have previously reported on a possible back-channel initiative led by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and interlocutors in Pakistan, including Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Bajwa. In addition, the Bloomberg report said the ceasefire announcement was the first step agreed to and that more would follow. “The next step in the process, the official said, involves both sides reinstating envoys in New Delhi and Islamabad, who were pulled in 2019 after Pakistan protested against India’s move to revoke seven decades of autonomy for the Muslim-majority State of Jammu and Kashmir. Then comes the hard part: Talks on resuming trade and a lasting resolution on Kashmir,” the Bloomberg report said. No comments The Ministry of External Affairs, which has declined to comment on the previous reports, maintained its silence when asked by The Hindu for a response to the Bloomberg story. Both UAE diplomatic sources and Pakistani officials also refused to confirm or deny the reports. However, several developments in the past month have pointed to a broader peace process in play, not restricted only to the LoC ceasefire, which has held since February 25. To begin with, statements from officials in the past week, particularly from Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and General Bajwa as well as Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla have been shorn of the customary rhetoric. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also wished PM Khan a speedy recovery from COVID-19 after he was diagnosed last week, sidestepping previous hostility between the two leaders and India has allowed Pakistani sporting teams to visit for the first time in three years. Next week, Foreign Ministers S. Jaishankar and Shah Mehmood Qureshi will attend the Heart of Asia conference in Dushanbe on March 30, which is being seen as an opportunity for engagement. And the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation-Regional Anti-Terror Structure (SCO-RATS) secretariat has announced that Indian troops would be part of counter-terror joint exercises, due to be held by the eight-nation grouping in Pakistan later this year, which would be a first. Meanwhile, an eight-member Pakistani delegation headed by Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Meher Ali Shah travelled to Delhi for Indus treaty talks on Tuesday, with the Indian team led by Indian Commissioner Pradeep Saxena, to be held after more than two years. The UAE FM continues to guide the talks, said the Bloomberg report, which cited a recent telephone conversation Mr. Zayed had with PM Khan. While India has consistently and publicly rejected any chance of third-party mediation between India and Pakistan, there have been several offers, including one by former U.S. President Donald Trump, to facilitate talks. In February 2019, after the Balakot strikes and Pakistani action at the LoC , Mr. Trump had said he had spoken to both sides to ensure a pilot’s release from Pakistan. At the time, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan had also announced that he had telephoned Mr. Modi and Mr. Khan to de-escalate tensions and promote “peaceful dialogue” between the two.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mea-silent-on-reports-of-uae-role-in-india-pakistan-dtente/article34136717.ece
23 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Probe confirms double entries on poll roll in Kerala||Preliminary investigations by District Collectors have revealed that there is merit, to an extent, in the complaint lodged by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala regarding multiple entries of voter names in the electoral rolls, Chief Electoral Officer Teeka Ram Meena has said. The probes have revealed 590 double entries in the rolls in the Vaikom segment, 434 in Idukki district, 570 in Chalakudy segment, 800 in Palakkad, and 640 in Kasaragod, Mr. Meena said here on Monday. Mr. Chennithala had alleged 3,767 and 4,395 double entries respectively in Kozhikode and Tavanur. In Kozhikode, the probe confirmed 50% of the alleged double entries to be true and in Tavanur, 70%. “These are not the final figures. The investigation is in progress,” Mr. Meena said. The Assistant Electoral Registration Officer, Uduma, has been placed under suspension after it was found that approval was given for the issue of five cards to one voter. The four additional cards have been cancelled and an investigation is on, Mr. Meena said. “We have ordered investigation in all the 140 constituencies. Booth-level officers (BLOs) are carrying out physical inspection at the field level. They will prepare booth-wise lists and share them with the presiding officers,” he said. ‘Not a new issue’ Mr. Meena said the problem of double entries is not new. Across India, the number of Demographically Similar Entries (DSE) in the electoral rolls stands at over 26 lakh, he said. “It has been occurring from time to time,” he said. He cited several reasons for the presence of double entries. Between January 20, when the final voters’ list was published, and March 9, election officials had received 9.16 lakh applications for inclusion in rolls. However, 100% physical verification by BLOs could not be carried out due to COVID-19. “Before January 20, we had removed around 60,000 double entries,” he said. Multiple applications filed online by an individual are not automatically rejected, which could lead to multiple entries. Mr. Meena said that even if somebody’s name was present in the rolls in three or four places, the person would be allowed to vote only in one place. Mr. Chennithala had said that he had passed on information regarding 2,16,510 ‘bogus voters’ to the Election Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/probe-confirms-double-entries-on-poll-roll-in-kerala/article34136757.ece
23 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||BJP unveils chargesheet against LDF government||The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on Monday unveiled a chargesheet against the Pinarayi Vijayan government in Kerala, accusing it of corrupt governance, betraying Sabarimala devotees, and upsetting law and order in the State. Union Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda released the chargesheet at a function here. The Left Democratic Front (LDF), as well as the Congress, has now made Sabarimala a discussion point with an eye on votes. Temple administration should not remain a toy in the hands of non-believers, the chargesheet said. The LDF government has overtaken the previous Oommen Chandy-led United Democratic Front rule in corruption, misgovernance and extravagance. The chargesheet blames Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for acting like a dictator and politicising the police. ‘Fascist’ nature The ‘fascist’ nature of the rule has trickled down into the police force, the chargesheet alleged. The LDF rule has been marred by political killings, atrocities against women and Dalits, and a total unravelling of law and order. It has pushed the State into an economic crisis and the public debt has shot up to over Rs. 2 lakh crore. The chargesheet listed the gold-smuggling case and the controversies over the LIFE Mission housing project, Sprinkler issue and back-door appointments as examples of corruption during the LDF rule. The government also failed to effectively tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, it said. Further, the LDF government was unable to take development forward. Big projects, including Vizhinjam seaport, Kochi metro, and light metro for Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, are limping. Public sector units and the farm sector have plunged into crises, the NDA chargesheet said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-unveils-chargesheet-against-ldf-government/article34137150.ece
23 March 2021||Kochi,||Politics based on principles possible, says Rahul||Is Congress in a crisis is how bluntly a student of St. Teresa’s College chose to put it to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday. Mr. Gandhi, who was at the city college for an interaction with students during the course of his election campaign tour, was not flummoxed but put up a brave face while explaining what has gone wrong with his party without ever conceding it as a ‘crisis’. “The Congress is designed differently from other political parties. The party thrives on constant conversation with different castes, communities, religions, and ideas. It is in our DNA. That conversation has broken down nationally and everyone is looking after their own interests. We have to revive that conversation. It is difficult time but a hopeful time for rebuilding, repositioning, rethinking, and coming up with new ideas,” said Mr. Gandhi strolling across a red-carpeted ramp. When another student asked for a way to rein in fuel price, he had a rather simplistic solution, “vote out the government.” He said it was indeed possible to pursue politics based on principles. “I insist on politics based on principles and would not do it any other way. I know there will be cost to pay for it, which I am willing to bear,” Mr. Gandhi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/politics-based-on-principles-possible-says-rahul/article34136692.ece
23 March 2021||SURYAPET,||At least 100 injured in gallery collapse||At least 100 people were injured when a temporary gallery erected for the 47th Junior National Kabaddi Championship collapsed here at the SP office grounds on Monday.

Chandrasekhar Rao announced a 30% pay hike and a three-year extension of service by increasing their retirement age limit.

However, the impact of COVID pandemic on the State’s economy has not only tied up the government hands to some extent but also delayed implementation of PRC report”. He hoped that the employees would work with renewed vigour for the all round development of the State.  Promotions soon He stated that the process of promotions to 80% of the eligible employees was completed already and it would be completed for the remaining ones soon.

23 March 2021||Kolkata,||Cong. Bengal manifesto offers monthly support to the poor||The Congress on Monday released its manifesto for the West Bengal Assembly polls with a promise of social security for the most economically backward families and a promise for industry. In the manifesto released by State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the party assured a monthly support of Rs. 5,700 to 20% of the most economically backward families. The manifesto also promised Rs. 5,000 a month as interim relief to families of migrant workers till they get employment. The Congress, which is contesting 92 of the 294 Assembly seats, is part of the Samyukta Morcha. The Left parties and the Indian Secular Front are the other constituents of the Morcha. The other promises are an administration free from political interference and increasing the number of women police stations to ensure safety of women. Seven industrial centres The Congress promised seven industrial development centres in the State and electric vehicle manufacturing units in Asansol and Durgapur. On the agriculture front, the party has promised the repeal of the three new farm laws passed by the Union government. The manifesto had the photograph of Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, one of the most celebrated Chief Ministers of the State, and the slogan “ Ebar aar phool na, Ebar kono bhul na [No flower this time, no mistake this time].” The slogan targets the symbols of both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Trinamool Congress, which have flowers. “We want to bring back the glory of West Bengal envisaged by B.C. Roy,” the manifesto said. The manifesto, which had eight broad points, rejected dole politics and urged people to vote for the sustainable development of West Bengal. Mr. Chowdhury said the Congress manifesto was separate from the manifesto of the Samyukta Morcha and expressed hope that the people of Bengal would vote for the party’s candidates. Party still a key force The Congress’s vote share had declined to 4% in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but it still remains an important factor in some districts of the State such as Malda and Murshidabad.

23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mumbai ex-police chief seeks CBI inquiry against Minister||Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh on Monday informed the Supreme Court that his transfer order arrived “immediately after” he complained to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior leaders about the “corrupt malpractices” of State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. Mr. Singh alleged that Mr. Deshmukh held meetings with “officers of lower rank” such as Sachin Vaze, now in custody in connection with the Antilia bomb scare case, and Sanjay Patil, an ACP with the Social Service Branch, at his residence in February. This was done “bypassing their seniors”. ‘Interfered with probes’ The Home Minister had “instructed” the duo to “accumulate Rs. 100 crore every month”. He said the Minister, besides using police officers for his “malicious intent of extorting money”, interfered with investigations, ordering them to be conducted in a “particular manner”. He also indulged in corrupt practices in official postings and transfers of officers, the petition said. Mr. Singh said he had conveyed his apprehensions to senior leaders and the Maharashtra Chief Minister. “Immediately thereafter, on March 17, he (Singh) was transferred from the post of the Mumbai Police Commissioner to the Home Guard Department in an arbitrary and illegal manner without the completing of the minimum fixed tenure of two years,” the petition said. The 1988 IPS batch officer said his allegations against Mr. Deshmukh, which also form the content of an explosive letter, required an “unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation” by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Singh said the court has to act quickly before the evidence against Mr. Deshmukh is “destroyed”. ‘Officer shunted out’ He mentioned how another officer, Rashmi Shukla, who was Commissioner Intelligence, State Intelligence Department, was shunted out in August 2020 when she had endeavoured to expose the alleged can of worms about Mr. Deshmukh. Mr. Singh said Ms. Shukla had collected evidence on Mr. Deshmukh in the form of telephonic intercepts. She had notified the Maharashtra Director General of Police, who conveyed the information to the Additional Chief Secretary. “She was shunted out,” the petition said. Mr. Singh said his transfer was based on “conjectures, surmises and pure speculation”. He complained that the transfer coupled with the adverse media publicity triggered against him by Mr. Deshmukh has violated his right to equality and dignity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mumbai-ex-police-chief-seeks-cbi-inquiry-against-minister/article34136719.ece
23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Sagar Sarhadi passes away||When Amitabh Bachchan looks deep into the eyes of Rakhee in Yash Chopra’s Kabhi Kabhie and says, “have you ever looked at your eyes, wherever they look, they establish a relationship,” it is the magic of Sagar Sarhadi’s writing that is at work. The 87-year-old writer-director died on Monday at his Mumbai residence due to age-related problems. Starting with Kabhi Kabhie , followed by Noorie (that Chopra presented), Silsila and Chandni , it was Sarhadi’s writing that was at the heart of Yash Chopra’s romantic turn in the mid-70s and 80s. His nephew Ramesh Talwar was the chief assistant to Yash Chopra. One day, he invited Chopra to watch Sarhadi’s one-act Urdu play Mirza Sahiban . Impressed, Chopra offered him to write Kabhi Kabhie and thus started a decade-long relationship of mutual respect. Born as Ganga Sagar Talwar in Baffa village in North West Frontier Province, Sarhadi was uprooted by Partition and carried the pain and anguish of a refugee all through his life. He changed his name to carry an identity of his province with him. His last film Chausar , starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Amruta Subhash, a contemporary tale that draws from the Pandava’s losing Draupadi in a game of ludo in Mahabharat , remains unreleased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sagar-sarhadi-passes-away/article34136724.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.P., M.P. sign agreement on Ken-Betwa interlinking work||The governments of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have signed an agreement that nudges forward a long-stalled multi-crore, controversial project to link the Ken and the Betwa rivers and irrigate the water-deficient Bundelkhand region, spread over both States, and provide electricity. Several obstacles have dogged the project. For one, the project will partly submerge the Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh and affect the habitat of vultures and jackals. After years of protests, however, it was finally cleared by the apex wildlife regulator, the National Board for Wildlife, in 2016. Monsoon blues Then, the States were unable to come to an agreemment on how water would be shared, particularly in the non-monsoon months. The project involves transferring surplus water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in Uttar Pradesh and irrigating 3.64 lakh hectares in the Bundelkhand region of both States. The project involves building a 77-metre-tall and a 2-km-wide Dhaudhan dam and a 230-km canal. Originally, this phase envisaged irrigating 6,35,661 hectares annually (3,69,881 ha in M.P. and 2,65,780 ha in U.P.). In addition, the project was to provide 49 million cubic metres (MCM) for drinking water supply en route . The original project was conceived in two distinct phases but now they are learnt to be combined. This influences how the entire scheme is funded. The Centre was originally to fund 90% of the cost (Rs. 37,611 crore in 2018) but a final decision on this is still outstanding. However Uttar Pradesh, it is learnt, wanted a greater share of the water which Madhya Pradesh was unwilling. This prevented the signing of an agreement on water sharing that was ready in 2018. On Monday, the agreement was signed by both Chief Ministers in an event that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, attended online. “This is a historic moment that is much more than the mere signing on paper. This is to ensure that the water-starved Bundelkhand region will get water for irrigation as well as power. ” he said in his address. A statement from the Union Water Resources Ministry said the Daudhan dam would now irrigate nearly 6,00,000 hectares in four districts of Madhya Pradesh alone and 2,51,000 hectares in four districts of Uttar Pradesh. It will provide drinking water supply to 41 lakh people in Madhya Pradesh and 21 lakh in Uttar Pradesh. Sharing formula In a “normal” year, Madhya Pradesh would use 2,350 MCM of water and Uttar Pradesh, 1,700 MCM. From November-May, the non-monsoon period, Madhya Pradesh would get 1,834 MCM and Uttar Pradesh 750. A sticking point was that Uttar Pradesh had demanded nearly 900 MCM and Madhya Pradesh was prepared to release only 700 MCM. In steps ahead, the project needs approval on the share of Centre and State in funding, forming a new organisation — the Ken Betwa Link Project Authority — to execute the project and obtaining stage 2 forest clearance for the Daudhan dam. The project is expected to be ready in eight years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-mp-sign-deal-on-ken-betwa-link-work/article34136729.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Plea filed in SC on women abandoned by NRI husbands||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the government to respond to a plea for framing guidelines to provide speedy justice to women abandoned by their NRI husbands. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the government and scheduled a hearing in July. The petition filed by NGO, Pravasi Legal Cell, represented by advocate Jose Abraham, highlighted three instances of suffering for women in NRI marriages. These include women left behind in India by their husbands within days of the marriage. The woman hears no more from the man, and in some cases, she is pregnant by him. This would mean both the wife and child are abandoned with no recourse to trace the man or effectively begin legal proceedings against him. The second instance when the woman is taken abroad but only to be subject to harassment and abuse by her husband. In some cases, the petition said the man does not even come to pick her up at the airport on her arrival, leaving her stranded in an alien land. Finally, in some cases ex-parte divorce decrees have been passed by foreign courts. The petition said such women experience technical and legal obstacles concerning jurisdiction of courts, serving of notices or orders, enforcement of orders or even find themselves tangled in “simultaneous retaliatory legal proceedings” in a foreign country. “A women abandoned by her NRI husband in India has to face obstacles at every point, starting with the lodging of an FIR. Police are reluctant to take the crime seriously,” the petition said. The petition said the process of issuance of look-out circulars against errant NRI husbands takes months to clear the bureaucratic maze. The papers have to go through various offices like the Bureau of Immigration and the Foreign Regional Registration Office. At times, it is even difficult to trace the country to which the husband has gone. “India has the world’s largest diaspora, according to figures from the United Nations. It is imperative to frame guidelines to provide professional and speedy justice to women abandoned by their NRI husbands,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-filed-in-sc-on-women-abandoned-by-nri-husbands/article34136732.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Amid protests, LS passes GNCTD amendment Bill||The Lok Sabha on Monday passed a Bill that defines that the word “government” in Delhi means the Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) and makes it mandatory for the elected government in the national capital territory to take the opinion of the L-G before any executive action. Amid strong protests from Opposition parties, including the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Bill was passed by a voice vote. While Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill (GNCTD), 2021, was necessary to remove ambiguities and make governance in Delhi more accountable and efficient, the Oppositions members accused the Narendra Modi government of ‘usurping’ the power of the elected government in the national capital and trying to rule Delhi through the Lieutenant-Governor by making his office a ‘super Chief Minister’. ‘Poor loser’ The lone AAP member of Parliament from Punjab, Bhagwant Mann, accused the BJP of being a ‘poor loser’ and alleged that the Centre had become a specialist in taking away rights of the States. Echoing other Opposition members, Mr. Mann also wondered why Assembly elections in Delhi should be held if all the powers were to be given to the L-G. He also asked if the Centre plans to turn the national capital into a Union Territory like Jammu and Kashmir where there is an Assembly but is non-functional. Initiating the debate, Congress MP Manish Tewari said the legislation was ‘unconstitutional and mala fide’ that sought to take away the representative character of Delhi’s government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-protests-ls-passes-gnctd-amendment-bill/article34136735.ece

The militants turned down the offer and opened fire, in which a soldier sustained bullet injury,” J&K Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar said. Mr. Kumar said there were reports suggesting that the militants belonged to The Resistance Front and the Lashkar-e-Mustafa. LeT offshoots “These are off shoots of the LeT and the Jaish-e-Muhammad. All of them belonged to the LeT.” The police identified them as Rayees Ahmed, active since October; Amir Mir, active since February; Raqib Malik, active since December; and Aftab Wani, active since November. J&K has witnessed nine encounters this year, in which 19 militants have been killed. “So far 18 youth joined militancy this year. Five have been killed and three arrested,” the IGP said.  On the Amarnath yatra that will commence on June 28, Mr. Kumar said the security forces would ensure a peaceful pilgrimage. “Sticky bombs are of course a problem but the situation is not alarming. There will be round-the-clock patrolling of yatra routes by 360-degree camera fitted Mobile Bunker Vehicles,” he said. The IGP described stone-pelting as “a larger issue than militancy”. “It creates a negative impact and keeps tourists away. Anybody who indulges in stone pelting will be slapped with PSA [Public Safety Act],” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/4-let-militants-killed-in-encounter-with-security-forces-in-shopian/article34136966.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||MGNREGA: conservation structures start to pay off||Bhuban Bag is an MGNREGA worker from Bhuanpada village in Odisha’s Balangir district, a perennially drought-affected region. The district has one of India’s highest rates of distress migration, with lakhs of workers looking for jobs elsewhere every year. “Things have changed in our village because of MGNREGA. We have been creating ponds and tanks to catch water, and digging wells to harvest the recharged water,” he said in a webinar organised by the Centre for Science and Environment on the occasion of World Water Day. He held up an onion plant to the camera, showing off the fruits of his newly fertile land. During the pandemic, most of the returning workers found employment in the village itself, he said. Bhuanpada is not an isolated case. Across the country, the water harvesting and conservation structures that now make up 60% of all new MGNREGA assets are starting to pay off, according to CSE. “The MGNREGA is not simply a social security scheme to generate employment for the rural poor. It may also be the world’s largest climate change adaptation scheme,” said CSE director Sunita Narain. Over the last 15 years, three crore assets related to water-conservation have been created through the rural jobs scheme with the potential to conserve more than 2,800 crore cubic metres of water. On the ground, this has transformed the fate of some villages. However, challenges remain in obtaining timely payment of MGNREGA wages and ensuring village participation in the planning process. Bhuanpada’s sarpanch joined Mr. Bag on the screen. “The payment for MGNREGA workers still comes very late,” he said, adding that distress migration could not be reversed unless timely payment was made. In Palakkad district of Kerala, women workers have managed to revive streams and rivers in the water-scarce village of Pookkottukavu, which gets only 2300 mm of annual rainfall. With hundreds of water harvesting structures being built under the MGNREGA scheme, 200 wells are now planned to make the village water-surplus. “Earlier, people had to walk a long distance for drinking water. These projects have helped to reduce their difficulty to a certain extent and give them the hope that in the near future the village will be free of water scarcity. We can see the groundwater levels rising,” said Vismaya Sukumaran, who works with MGNREGA. In Vasna village of Gujarat’s Sabarkantha district, migration has reduced by 40% because of the extensive irrigation system created through small dams constructed under the programme. “Earlier, the village was completely rain-dependent, but now the ponds and tanks provide surface water for 10 months of the year. Farming is back as the main occupation, and annual family savings are up to Rs. 2 lakh, preventing the need for migration,” said Ms. Narain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mgnrega-conservation-structures-start-to-pay-off/article34137192.ece

23 March 2021||New Delhi,||Yechury seeks 100% VVPAT-EVM tallying||CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, in a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, has urged the panel to carry out a 100% tally of all EVM machines with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) for the coming Assembly elections. He red-flagged political financing via electoral bonds, and urged the commission to clarify the steps it is taking to eliminate the adverse effects of money power on the electoral outcome. Quoting the report by a civil society organisation, Citizens Commission on Elections (CCE), on the functioning of the Indian EVM and VVPAT system, Mr Yechury said it had raised many legitimate questions. He said that on both accounts of political funding and lack of transparency regarding EVMs the ECI’s response after the 2019 general elections had been far less than adequate. The VVPATs, he said, were introduced in 2013 as a response to address the doubts in the minds of the voters as to whether their intended choice is indeed recorded in the counting process. The CCE report, he said, pointed out that EVMs were not “sacrosanct”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yechury-seeks-100-vvpat-evm-tallying/article34136715.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Justice Ramana rues unequal access to justice||Supreme Court judge, Justice N.V. Ramana, said on Monday that the guarantee of equal justice to all is meaningless if the poor, illiterate, vulnerable and weak sections of society cannot enforce their rights. Justice Ramana, who is next in line to be the Chief Justice of India as per the seniority norm following incumbent Justice S.A. Bobde’s retirement on April 23, said India has been, since Independence, grappling with the twin problems of poverty and access to justice. Twin problems “Ever since we declared ourselves to be an independent nation, we found ourselves caught between the twin problems of ‘poverty’ and ‘access to justice’. The architects of modern India had debated this issue on several national and international platforms. Sadly, even after 74 years of independence, we are still discussing the same issue,” Justice Ramana said on the occasion of inauguration of Front offices and Legal aid Defense Counsel Office at Delhi. He said this is the gap in access to justice that legal aid tries to bridge. “When people cannot reach us, we should reach them...” Justice Ramana said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/justice-ramana-rues-unequal-access-to-justice/article34136765.ece

23 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Quota revision: Karnataka to give response to SC||The State government on Monday has decided to give its response to the Supreme Court suggesting upward revision of the 50% reservation limit fixed in 1992. Sources in the Secretariat said a Cabinet meeting presided by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has decided to send the government’s response to the Supreme Court for increasing the upper limit of 50% fixed in the landmark verdict in the Indira Sahwney case, also known as the Mandal verdict. A five judge-bench of the Supreme Court, hearing a challenge to a law passed by Maharashtra in 2018 providing quota to Marathas, had said that it will examine whether the 50% rule laid by the 1992 decision needs to be reconsidered. The apex court sought responses from all states on its verdict fixing the quota at 50%. A few days ago, Law and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai had made it clear in the Legislative Assembly that it was ‘inevitable’ to breach the 50% cap on quota if demands made by various castes are to be met in the State. Many sub-castes, including among the dominant Lingayat and Vokkaliga communities, are not only demanding reservation in government jobs and educational institutions in the State but also in Central services. Communities such as Kurubas have been demanding Scheduled Caste tag while SCs and STs have been demanding higher quota following increase in their population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/state-to-give-response-to-sc-seeking-upward-revision-of-quota-beyond-50/article34136875.ece

Judge D.E. Kothalikar said that Fr. Swamy was found in possession of objectionable material and there was sufficient evidence to connect him to the activities of the banned organisation. While rejecting his bail, the court relied upon letters allegedly written by co-accused Shoma Sen and Rona Wilson. Fr. Swamy (83), an activist, has been working with tribals for decades and is currently lodged at Taloja Central Jail after being arrested from Ranchi on October 9, 2020. He has Parkinson’s disease and has lost the ability to hear from both his ears, and suffers from intense pain from lumbar spondylosis. Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty had previously pointed out that during the investigation it was established that Fr. Swamy was a staunch supporter of the activities of organisations such as Vistapan Virodhi Jan Vikas Andolan and People’s Union for Civil Liberties which are working as frontal organisations of the CPI (Maoists). Advocate Sharif Shaikh, appearing for Fr. Swamy, had previously argued that the prosecution had not brought anything on record to suggest that Fr. Swamy was involved in any kind of terrorist activity. Therefore, Sections 16 (punishment for terrorist act), 20 (punishment for being member of terrorist gang or organisation), and 39 (offence relating to support given to a terrorist organisation) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act were not applicable to him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/court-rejects-stan-swamys-bail-petition/article34136762.ece

Jayakumar, contesting for the seventh consecutive time from Royapuram, run with an advantage or disadvantage because new candidates have entered the fray? This is the key question in the minds of voters. D. Jayakumar considers himself a son of the soil. He has been contesting in the constituency since 1991. He won in 1991 and then in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. He contested in 1996 too, but lost to the DMK candidate. The DMK has fielded iDream R. Murthy, an entrepreneur who hails from the area and owns a theatre there. Among the other candidates are S. Gunasekaran of Makkal Needhi Maiam and S. Kamali of Naam Tamilar Katchi.   Improvements to civic amenities and development top the residents’ wish-list. “The indiscriminate dumping of garbage and the mosquito menace need immediate attention in several areas near the seashore. Piped drinking water supply is still elusive for most residents, and we still have to depend on lorry supply,” says Ernest Paul, a septuagenarian resident of the locality and president of the Royapuram Residents Welfare Association. He stresses on the need to organise job fairs, create employment opportunities and provide skill-based training to youngsters. “Development seems to have been stagnant here for a while now,” he adds. The constituency is famous not just for its electoral battles. The first train in south India began operating from the Royapuram station in 1856, and over the last few years, residents have called for restoring some of the former glory. Their long-pending demands include establishment of a museum to highlight its historical significance and developing the area as a major train terminal. Highlighting the need for better connectivity, R. Boopalan, a social activist, wants the resumption of bus services from Royapuram to Triplicane and Thiruvanmiyur. “These routes were very helpful for several residents of the area, and we hope the services will be restored at the earliest.” While traffic congestion and the resulting pollution remain a concern, a long-time resident calls for more efforts at planting saplings and greening. “The constituency has a majority of working class population, and for us, it is enough if candidates carry out what they promise. We do not require anything extra,” he says. For residents who live in and around Cemetery Road, which is near the Old Washermenpet rail track, a long-pending demand is construction of an underpass or subway. “There are at least 1,000 people who get off at the station here and are forced to navigate their way around piles of garbage to go to other areas. For many residents here, we have been asking for a new drainage line,” says M. Rukmani, a resident. Mr. Murthy, the DMK candidate, says establishment of an arts and science college in the constituency, construction of at least one small community hall in each Corporation division and renovation of the Raja Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar (RSRM) Hospital are among his areas of focus. “While the area has parks and playgrounds, they need to be maintained better. Better drainage facilities are needed in areas such as Jeevarathnam Nagar and Indira Nagar,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/royapuram-residents-want-better-amenities-development/article34136919.ece

23 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ministers’ assets more than doubled in five years||The declared cumulative worth of assets owned by the Tamil Nadu Cabinet Ministers and their spouses and dependent family members grew by 111% from Rs. 154.69 crore in 2016 to Rs. 326.47 crore in 2021, according to an analysis of the affidavits filed by them for the Assembly election. The sharpest increase was in the worth of moveable assets, which nearly tripled, from Rs. 54.55 crore in 2016 to Rs. 162.15 crore in 2021. The worth of immovable assets grew by 64% from Rs. 100.14 crore to Rs. 164.32 crore. The cumulative annual income grew by 80% from Rs. 13.43 crore to Rs. 24.2 crore, while the cumulative liabilities grew by 74% from Rs. 29.7 crore to Rs. 51.76 crore. Sources of income While a majority of the Ministers declared their salary for serving as MLAs and farming and rental income as sources of income, a few like C. Vijayabaskar, M.R. Vijayabhaskar and Sevvoor S. Ramachandran have declared businesses, too, as sources. Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration K.C. Veeramani declared the highest worth of assets, both in 2016 and 2021. His assets grew by 148% from Rs. 27.7 crore in 2016 to Rs. 68.7 crore in 2021. While Mr. Vijayabaskar, Health and Family Welfare Minister, was in the fifth position in 2016 with total assets worth Rs. 9.08 crore, he has the second highest in 2021, with his assets increasing nearly seven fold to Rs. 61.5 crore. While four Ministers — Kadambur Raju, D. Jayakumar, V.M. Rajalakshmi and R.B. Udhayakumar — had declared assets worth less than Rs. 1 crore in 2016, all of them are crorepatis, according to their 2021 affidavits. Highest growth Minister for Higher Education K.P. Anbalagan showed the highest growth in assets from Rs. 2.4 crore to Rs. 19.27 crore, nearly an eight-fold increase. The only two persons to show a decline are Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Minister for Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture ‘Ma Foi’ K. Pandiarajan. While the decline in the Chief Minister’s assets from Rs. 7.8 crore to Rs. 6.7 crore could primarily be attributed to his mother, son and daughter-in-law missing as dependants in the 2021 affidavit, the decline in Mr. Pandiarajan’s assets is owing to the drop in his moveable assets. A noticeable difference is the declaration of significant worth of assets under the Hindu Undivided Family accounts by more number of Ministers in 2021. Noticeably high In the case of a few Ministers, the ratio of their annual income to their total assets is noticeably high. For instance, while Mr. Jayakumar has declared total assets worth Rs. 1.8 crore, his family’s income in 2021 is Rs. 1.2 crore, 66% of the assets. The liabilities of Ministers largely involve bank loans. In some cases, they include borrowing from family members or other individuals. The affidavits of a few Ministers have glaring tallying errors in their summary. For instance, Mr. Veeramani’s affidavit appears mistakenly copied from his 2016 affidavit at many places. In such cases, The Hindu looked at the detailed list of assets in the affidavit to arrive at the total. (Note: The analysis included 27 of the 30 Ministers in the Cabinet. Ministers Nilofer Kafeel, G. Baskaran and S. Valarmathi, who were denied renomination in the 2021 election, were excluded).  While a majority of the Ministers declared their salary for serving as MLAs, farming and rental income as sources of income, a few like C. Vijayabaskar and M.R. Vijayabhaskar have declared businesses as sources||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ministers-assets-more-than-doubled-in-five-years/article34136893.ece

23 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Gokula Indira confident of AIADMK win||At half past five, Panchaliamman Koil Street in Arumbakkam beams with bright lights and booming speakers blaring music and AIADMK promises. A bunch of drum beats welcomes AIADMK candidate for Anna Nagar S. Gokula Indira as she hit the campaign trail on Monday. Ms. Indira began her door-to-door campaign in Arumbakkam that forms a part of the Anna Nagar constituency. This time though, barring shopkeepers, the candidate had to look up to see many residents as they chose to remain indoors and get a glimpse of her from the balcony itself, perhaps fearing the crowd and the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the city. Speaking to The Hindu , she said she was confident that the AIADMK would get a third consecutive term. She said there was no anti-incumbency wave. “We hope to gain a major vote share, especially from women, for everything that we have promised them in this manifesto. From a monthly dole to washing machine and gas cylinders, we plan to provide various items to them,” she added. Price rise While a few residents were happy with the civic amenities provided, from roads to water supply, one thing that irked them was price rise. Gopala Krishnan S., who runs a small shop in the area, says his business has gone from bad to worse in the past year. “The price rise has been so steep that we cannot afford to buy anything. Today, I paid Rs. 850 to buy a gas cylinder. I don’t want any free gas cylinder, let them reduce the prices of essential commodities,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gokula-indira-confident-of-aiadmk-win/article34136911.ece

23 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Maldivian man undergoes valve replacement||Doctors at The Madras Medical Mission (MMM) hospital have performed a catheter-based pulmonary valve replacement procedure for a 51-year-old patient from the Maldives. This time, the procedure cost much less than it usually does because of a change in regulations. According to a release from the hospital, the patient, who previously had a leak in the aortic valve underwent the Ross procedure 19 years ago, which involved the replacement of the aortic valve with the patient’s own pulmonary valve and the pulmonary valve was in turn replaced with a cadaveric pulmonary homograft. In such cases, the pulmonary homograft progressively degenerates and constricts as it does not have any living tissue. The patient faced a similar situation and was referred by cardiologists in the Maldives to MMM Hospital. A team, led by K. Sivakumar, senior consultant and head of paediatric cardiology, suggested a percutaneous catheter-based approach to replace the homograft with a new valve instead of an open-heart surgery as it involved no fresh scar and minimal hospitalisation.

According to the survey, the DMK-led front is expected to win 151-158 seats, and the AIADMK-led alliance 76-83 seats. DMK president M.K. Stalin held about 10% lead over Edappadi K. Palaniswami among the respondents, who were asked who should be the next Chief Minister. The respondents also indicated that Mr. Stalin’s leadership would take his party to victory. The survey was conducted by APT survey agency in 200 locations across 20 representative constituencies between February 18 and March 15. (It was taken before the AMMK and the DMDK formed an alliance). Asked about which party they would vote for in a multi-cornered contest, the respondents gave the DMK-led front a 10% lead. The positives for the ruling AIADMK were the governance of the Chief Minister and the expected vote share and seats in the western districts. In Chennai, the AIADMK would lag behind, and there would be a close fight in the central districts. In the northern and southern districts, the DMK held an advantage, the survey said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pre-poll-survey-gives-dmk-led-front-a-clear-lead/article34136931.ece

23 March 2021||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK brought huge investments’||AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami on Monday said his government has accomplished a feat of sorts by attracting investments in the State to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees. Campaigning for the party candidate in the industrial hub of Hosur, Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK government had been instrumental in bringing investment worth rupees thousands of crores to the State. Citing the various MoUs signed with major groups that already have plants in Hosur, he said agreements worth Rs. 5,000 crore were signed with investors. In addition, investments to the tune of Rs. 15,000 crore, in a staggered manner, were being brought into the State. “All this will ensure employment for over 1.5 lakh people. The AIADMK government has accomplished a feat by paving the way for lakhs of educated youth to be employed,” he said. According to him, the “DMK’s misrule” was responsible for the power outages in the State during 2006-11 which had caused industrial slowdown. Blaming the erstwhile DMK government, he said former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa ensured uninterrupted power supply after coming to power, which reversed the slowdown. Today, the industries were thriving because of the infrastructure put in place by the AIADMK government, Mr. Palaniswami said. Earlier, campaigning in Krishnagiri for the AIADMK candidate K. Ashok Kumar, Mr. Palaniswami claimed, “Tamil Nadu has also been ranked high in law and order and has remained a peaceful State. There is harmony among communities and castes.” In Hosur, the Chief Minister campaigned for S.Jyothi Balakrishna Reddy of the AIADMK, and for C. Nagesh Kumar, the BJP candidate for Thally constituency. While campaigning in Dharmapuri, Mr. Palaniswami urged Palacodde voters to give Minister for Higher Education K.P. Anbalagan another term as legislator to ensure continuity for the schemes. Also campaigning for PMK candidate for Pennagaram G.K.Mani, the Chief Minister claimed that the AIADMK was the only government to have waived farm loans twice in a single term of five years. According to him, the reservation of 10.5% for Vanniyars, which his government had enabled, was a way forward for the community. Former DMK Minister V. Mullaivendan jointed the AIADMK in the presence of Mr.Palaniswami. Campaigning at Theevatipatti in Omalur in Salem district, Mr.Palaniswami said he had become the Chief Minister after Jayalalithaa’s death, the way M. Karunanidhi had following death of Annadurai. “Is the yardstick different for Karunanidhi and I,” he asked. Mr. Palaniswami accused DMK president M.K. Stalin of being a dictator and said people would hand the DMK the right punishment in the elections. Mr. Stalin had said that four years ago no one knew who Edappadi K. Palaniswami was, but he (Mr. Stalin) was unable to sleep today without uttering his name, Mr. Palaniswami said. Highlighting the promises in the AIADMK manifesto, he said weavers would be provided with a relief of Rs. 5,000 during rainy season and loans up to Rs. 1 lakh from cooperative banks would be waived.

23 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||EPS not loyal to anyone, says Udhayanidhi||In the last Assembly elections, people voted for All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) mainly because of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. However, the current Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami came to the position only by initially supporting Sasikala and then opposing her, charged Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin here on Monday. Canvassing for votes in Sellur, Mr. Udhayanidhi Stalin alleged that the CM was not loyal to anyone. The AIADMK submitted to the pressure of Bharatiya Janata Party and allowed to conduct NEET in Tamil Nadu. “But once DMK comes to power, NEET will not be conducted in the State,” he said. There was no progress in the investigation being conducted to identify the cause of death of Jayalalithaa. Prices of petrol and diesel would be reduced once the DMK comes to power. Education loans availed by students up to 30 years of age, who pursued school and higher education in Tamil Nadu, would be waived, he said. Mr. Udhayanidhi Stalin said AIADMK politicians were looting money smartly in the name of executing smart city projects in Madurai city. He campaigned with DMK Madurai North candidate G. Thalapathi, Madurai West candidate C. Chinammal, and Madurai Central candidate P. T .R .P. Thiagarajan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eps-not-loyal-to-anyone-says-udhayanidhi/article34137032.ece

Palaniswami of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) calls himself a farmer, he is supporting the agricultural laws which are against the interests of farmers, charged Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary K. Balakrishnan here on Monday. Speaking at a public meeting at Bethaniapuram, he said experts throughout the world were criticising the agricultural laws passed by the BJP. But AIADMK MPs supported the bill when it was passed in parliament. They also supported the passage of Citizenship Amendment Bill. But now the Chief Minister has announced that they would press the Centre to withdraw the Citizenship Amendment Act if voted to power. CAA would not have been passed had the AIADMK MPs not supported it in the parliament. The sudden change in its stand has exposed its true colours,” said Mr. Balakrishnan. Speaking at Madurai West constituency, he urged the public not to vote for Cooperation Minister and sitting MLA Sellur K. Raju. “The world will laugh at those who vote for him,” he said. “It is the AIADMK government which has also allowed NEET to be conducted in Tamil Nadu,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/change-in-stand-on-caa-exposed-aiadmks-true-colours-cpim/article34137240.ece

The political parties were also not following the guidelines and were allowing the supporters to gather in large numbers without ensuring that the SOPs were followed, he said. “There is a medical situation in the State,” he said and urged the State government to ensure that SOP was followed in bus stands, railway stations, airports, schools, multiplexes, parks, shopping malls, restaurants and other public places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sop-on-covid-19-not-followed-despite-spike/article34137242.ece
23 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC dismisses bail pleas of accused policemen||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday dismissed the bail petitions of four police personnel accused in the Sattankulam custodial deaths case of P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar dismissed the bail petitions of Ragu Ganesh, Murugan, Muthuraj and Thomas Francis. Their earlier bail petitions were dismissed by High Court on the ground that there were prima facie materials available against them in the case. The family members of the deceased had filed intervening petitions opposing the grant of bail to the accused. They apprehended that if the accused were granted bail, they could influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence in the case. The High Court last week had ordered the trial court in Madurai to complete the trial in the Sattankulam custodial deaths case in six months. The court directed that the trial should be conducted in a cautious manner given that it was a sensitive case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-dismisses-bail-pleas-of-accused-policemen/article34136955.ece

23 March 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Corrupt Ministers will go to jail after polls: Vaiko||Many of the Ministers in the present AIADMK government would be behind bars for corruption after the DMK came back to power in the State, said Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Vaiko. Campaigning for his party candidate Pudur K. Boominathan, who is contesting on DMK’s Rising Sun symbol from Madurai South Assembly constituency, Mr. Vaiko said that the DMK had submitted a list of corruption charges against Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his cabinet colleagues to Governor Banwarilal Purohit. The main complaint was that Rs. 6,000 crore-worth tenders in Public Works and Highways Departments were given by the Chief Minister to his relatives and benamis. Though there was no action on the corruption charges till now, Mr. Vaiko said, when DMK-led alliance formed the new government action would be taken against the corrupt. Stating that 90 lakh persons remained unemployed in the State, he flayed the AIADMK government for ‘having betrayed the unemployed by allowing people from other States to compete in recruitment examinations’ conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Services Commission. “The 1.33 crore voters in the age group of 18 to 29 years in the State would decide the outcome of the election,” he said. The State government had also betrayed the young doctor aspirants with a false promise of getting them exemption from NEET. As a result, 13 students with the unfulfilled dreams of becoming doctors had ended their lives. The AIADMK government should be held responsible for the loss of the lives, he added. Mr. Vaiko expressed concern over the lack of safety for women in the State. He said that a top police officer himself was indulging in wrong-doing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corrupt-ministers-will-be-behind-bars-after-polls-vaiko/article34137033.ece
23 March 2021||Namakkal,TAMIL NADU||This is an election to regain State’s self-respect, says Kanimozhi||DMK women’s wing leader Kanimozhi on Monday contended that the upcoming Assembly elections is to regain self-respect of Tamil Nadu and appealed to people to vote for her party’s alliance. Ms. Kanimozhi, campaigning at Tiruchengode for KMDK leader E.R. Eswaran, said that while the AIADMK accused the DMK of being a chameleon, “everyone is aware who the true chameleon is”. The AIADMK, which voted in favour of the CAA and the three contentious farm laws, was now saying that it would recommend to the Centre to revoke these laws in view of elections, she said. The farm laws, if implemented, would affect the public distribution system, she claimed. Ms. Kanimozhi accused the AIADMK government of having pledged Tamil identities and self-respect “at the feet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah” to stay in power. She said Tamil Nadu should be ruled by a Tamil from the State and power should not come from there (Delhi). According to her, the AIADMK has repeated its poll promises [made in 2016] like providing free smart phones and waiving off educational loans, which they did not fulfil yet. She added that the DMK would waive off education loans once it comes to power. ‘Poor quality goods’ She said that poor quality goods were being provided through the public distribution system and the Pongal gift was not distributed properly. When DMK comes to power, they would provide Rs. 4,000 as COVID-19 relief for each family. Campaigning at parts of Kumarapalayam constituency, she alleged that Electricity Minister P. Thangamani had committed corruption to the tune of Rs. 1 lakh crore in his department. Bills had been created to the tune of Rs. 9.17 crore in the name of procuring power from non-operating windmills. The biggest achievement of the Minister was having Tasmac liquor outlets open 24 hours, even during dry days, she claimed. There was no security for women under this regime, she said adding that justice had not been provided yet in Pollachi sexual harassment case. Referring to the sexual harassment case involving a senior IPS officer, Ms. Kanimozhi said the government waited until the Madras High Court questioned as to why the senior officer was not suspended. She alleged that not even 15% accused in crime against women had been convicted under this regime. Ms. Kanimozhi highlighting the various poll promises in DMK’s manifesto said that a rope car facility would be introduced in Ardhanaeshwarar temple in Tiruchengode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/this-is-an-election-to-regain-tamil-nadus-self-respect-kanimozhi/article34137046.ece
23 March 2021||New Delhi,TAMIL NADU||Devendrakula Velalars bill passed in Rajya Sabha||The Rajya Sabha on Monday passed the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021, that seeks to put seven castes in poll-bound Tamil Nadu under one nomenclature of ‘Devendrakula Velalars’. Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot said the sub-castes will be regrouped and no caste will be included or excluded from the reserved category. He said the proposal sent by the Tamil Nadu government was forwarded to the Registrar General of India and then the SC/ST Commission and after getting clearance, it was presented before the Cabinet. He said the process had been on since 2015 and was not linked to the upcoming election. The Bill was earlier passed in the Lok Sabha. Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, while welcoming the Bill, said the timing was suspect as the assembly election had been announced in Tamil Nadu. “A delegation met the Prime Minister in 2015. Now when the election is due, they have brought this amendment,” he said. Mr. Kharge accused the Centre of gradually doing away with reservation as it was privatising railways and other public institutions.  ‘Right direction’ A. Navaneethakrishnan of the AIADMK said the Bill was a step in the right direction. Devendrakula Velalars means descendants of Lord Indra (god of rain) and they are the best agriculturists, he added. Mr. Gehlot said the government had no intention to end reservation and it was the Congress government that turned Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University into minority institutions, thereby snatching away reservation rights in these two central universities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/devendrakula-velalars-bill-passed-in-rajya-sabha/article34136932.ece

Narayanasamy flayed the decision of the All India N.R. Congress and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to align with the Bharatiya Janata Party. “For the last five years, when the previous Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi, with support of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, was trying to stall the functioning of our government, the AINRC and AIADMK remained silent. Now, both the parties have joined hands with a communal party like BJP. The coming of the BJP will disturb the prevailing peace in the Union Territory,” he said while seeking votes for Kalapet’s DMK candidate S. Muthuvel. Catering to the presence of a large number of fishermen in the constituency, the former Chief Minister said it was the NDA government at the Centre that destroyed the livelihood of the community. The Congress-DMK-CPI combine, if given a chance to form the next government, would work for the creation of a separate Ministry for Fisheries. Listing out the schemes stalled by Ms. Bedi, the Congress leader said the elected government was not allowed to implement several schemes. Mr. Narayanasamy later campaigned for Congress candidate S. Senthil Kumaran from Muthialpet constituency. Member of Parliament V. Vaithilingam, CPI secretary A.M. Saleem and CPI leader Nara Kalainathan were also present. The leaders also held a door-to-door campaign in Kalapet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-led-alliance-launches-election-campaign-from-kalapet/article34137352.ece

Addressing a public meeting in support of BJP candidates for the April 6 Assembly election, Mr. Gadkari said the BJP government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would usher in socio-economic transformation in Puducherry, something the Congress failed to do in the many decades that it was in power at the Centre and in the Union Territory. “Compare the track record of the Congress and the BJP in its relatively short term in power and you will realise that the party that works for the people and will change their future is the BJP,” he said. Referring to an estimated Rs. 11,000 crore worth infrastructure projects already sanctioned for the region, Mr. Gadkari said work on several schemes would be initiated within six months and once completed they would change the road infrastructure of Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. This included grade separators at the Rajiv Gandhi Square and Indira Gandhi Square, he added. Moreover, the three-phase expansion of the port under the Sagarmala Scheme, once completed, would give a new lifeline to the people and fishermen of Puducherry by boosting its economy, trade and tourism, besides generating jobs. Seaplane connectivity in the region would also get a fillip while another project aimed at providing fishermen with high-power trawler vessels and enable them to increase the distance of fishing expeditions from 10 nautical miles to 100 nautical miles, he said.

23 March 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK-BJP alliance has a link with Sterlite’||DMK president M.K.Stalin on Monday claimed that the AIADMK and the BJP has a "clandestine relationship" with Sterlite Copper and therefore were instrumental in the police firing on 13 anti-Sterlite protesters in Thoothukudi in May 2018. He urged the electorate to deliver an "unforgettable and crushing defeat" to the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the upcoming Assembly polls. Mr Stalin also urged the people of Thoothukudi district to render justice to the Sattankulam family that lost two of its members – trader Jayaraj and his son Benicks – to police brutality. He was canvassing votes for the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance candidates fielded in six Assembly constituencies in the district. “The Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission, formed by the State Government to probe the killing of protesters in the police firing, has not submitted its report even after two-and-a-half years. This is because of the relationship the BJP and the AIADMK have with Sterlite Copper," the DMK leader alleged. “Even as the police had started the investigation, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami certified that Jayaraj and Benicks died of breathing problem due to the injuries they had sustained when they rolled on the ground to avert their arrest. And, the First Information Report filed by the police fabricated a story to match the Chief Minister’s theory. And, Minister Kadambur C. Raju said it was not a custodial death as they died only in the hospital,” said Mr. Stalin. “Without doing anything good for the people of Kovilpatti constituency, Mr. Raju is heaping encomiums on the Chief Minister. Minutes before the notification for Assembly polls, he laid foundation stone for the nursing college to hoodwink the people. The Kovilpatti voters should ensure that Mr. Raju loses his deposit in this election for having done nothing for them over the past 10 years despite getting their votes,” Mr. Stalin said. He appealed to them to vote for CPI (M) candidate K. Srinivasan Upgrading of government hospitals at Ottapidaaram, Kayathar, Kovilpatti, Tiruchendur and Kaayalpattinam, establishment of nursing college in Nazareth and government arts and science college at Kazhugumalai, supply of raw material for match industries through SIDCO, taking surplus water of Tamirabharani up to Puththan Tharuvai via Karumaeniyar, separate welfare board for salt pan workers, regularisation of services of contract labourers of Tuticorin Thermal Power Station, industrial estate at Ottapidaaram and Deivaseyalpuram through SIDCO etc. were some of the promises made by him during the electioneering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-bjp-alliance-has-a-link-with-sterlite/article34137041.ece
23 March 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin alleges AIADMK-BJP link to Sterlite Copper||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday claimed that the AIADMK and the BJP have a “clandestine relationship” with Sterlite Copper [Vedanta] and were instrumental in the policefiring on 13 anti-Sterlite protestersin Thoothukudi in May 2018. He, therefore, urged the electorate to deliver an “unforgettable and crushing defeat” to the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the upcoming Assembly poll. Mr. Stalin also urged the people of Thoothukudi district to render justiceto the Sattankulam family that lost two of its members— trader Jayaraj and his son Benicks — to police brutality. Canvassing votes for the DMK-led alliance candidates fielded in six Assembly constituencies in the district, Mr. Stalin said the anti-Sterlite protesters, who were staging a peaceful agitation against the “destructive copper smelter” unit, took out a march towards the Collectorate to submit a petition to the Collector on the 100th day of their agitation, seeking permanent closure of the unit. The Collector, who should have been in the Collectorate, moved to an inaccessible place even as the AIADMK’s State government and the BJP’s Central government “hunted down” the protesters like birds “as these parties had a secret relationship with Sterlite Copper,” he alleged. “While the relatives of these 13 victims were not given government employment commensurate with their educational qualification, the CBI, which is probing this gruesome incident, has not made any headway due to the BJP’s intervention. The Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission, formed by the State government to probe the killing of the protesters, has not submitted its report even after two-and-a-half years. This is because of the relationship the BJP and the AIADMK have with Sterlite Copper,” the DMK leader alleged. Hence, they should be taught a fitting lesson in the election, Mr. Stalin said. Custodial deaths On the deaths of trader Jayaraj and Benicks “due to police brutality”, the DMK leader alleged that the hair on the chest of Benicks had been plucked during police torture and the blood-soaked shirts and lungis of the father and the son had to be replaced. “Even as the police started their investigation, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami certified that Jayaraj and Benicks died of breathing problems due to the injuries they sustained when they rolled on the ground to avert their arrest. And the First Information Report filed by the police fabricated a story to match the Chief Minister’s theory. And Minister Kadambur C. Raju said it was not a custodial death as they died only in the hospital. Jayalalithaa too died in the hospital, but why did you institute a judicial commission?

Dhinakaran on Monday accused the ruling AIADMK of trying to “buy” voters by distributing money to them. The ruling government had hoarded crores of rupees in every Assembly constituency and planned to “buy” votes, Mr. Dhinakaran charged while campaigning at Srirangam for party candidate Sarubala Tondaiman. He appealed to the voters to teach a fitting lesson to the government. Alleging that the Edappadi Palaniswami government had looted natural resources, Mr. Dhinakaran said it had brought the State under a huge debt of Rs. 6 lakh crore. There were allegations that irregularities were committed in buying medical kits and items during the pandemic. Similarly, there were allegations that Highways Department tenders had been awarded to the relatives of the Chief Minister, Mr. Dhinakaran said. The poll manifesto released by the AIADMK contained promises which were impractical, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-trying-to-buy-voters-says-ammks-dhinakaran/article34136930.ece
23 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK trying to buy voters’||Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran on Monday accused the ruling AIADMK of trying to “buy” voters by distributing money to them in the run up to the Assembly election. The ruling government had hoarded crores of money in every Assembly constituency and planned to “buy” the votes, Mr. Dhinakaran charged while campaigning at Srirangam for the party candidate Sarubala Tondaiman. He appealed to the voters to teach a befitting lesson to the ruling government in the forthcoming poll. Alleging that the Edappadi Palaniswami government had looted natural resources, Mr. Dhinakaran said it had brought the State under a huge debt of Rs. 6 lakh crore. There were allegations that irregularities were committed in buying medical kits and items during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Similarly, allegations had been levelled with respect to irregularities committed in the Highways Department with tenders having been awarded to close relatives of the Chief Minister, Mr. Dhinakaran alleged. The poll manifesto released by the AIADMK contained promises which were impractical. “How will the AIADMK, which cannot even disburse old age pension, would be able to provide Rs. 1,500 per month to every homemaker at a time when the State coffer is empty,” the AMMK leader asked. The AIADMK was desperately trying to regain power by fooling the people and distributing the looted wealth and had not announced any schemes which were feasible, he claimed. Mr. Palaniswami’s government was trying to fool the people by assuring government jobs for one member of each family, he said. Targetting the DMK, he alleged that the Opposition party was known to commit corruption scientifically. The DMK was making an all-out bid to regain power after a gap of 10 years, he said alleging that the wealth of the people would be looted if the party were to emerge victorious. Land grabbing, kangaroo courts and loot of resources would resurface as was the case when the DMK ruled from 2006 to 2011, he claimed. Appealing to the electorate to provide a chance to the AMMK-front, Mr. Dhinakaran claimed that his party would provide a corrupt-free and transparent government besides creating employment opportunities for the youth and take the State on the path of development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-trying-to-buy-voters/article34137027.ece
23 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Kamal takes a dig at freebies||Freebies will only cause enslavement and accentuate economic hardships of the poor. Opportunity for economic productivity alone will eradicate poverty, Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan said during his campaign on Monday. The State is steeped in huge debts due to corruption by the rulers and through distributing freebies. Freebies are like fire that will cause gradual damage to poor people. The MNM will assert federalism and not capitulate to any force. Candidates of the MNM and allied parties will work for improving the economic lot of the poor through a focus on generating jobs, he said campaigning at Tiruverumbur for MNM candidate M. Muruganandham. “All candidates in MNM and allied parties have been chosen on the basis of achievements in respective fields. Our victory is not even in winning, but in implementing all our promises. Give us five years and you will vote us again for another term. Our candidates may not have exposure to politics, but they are adept in service-mindedness,” the MNM leader said. “We have devised effective schemes before coming to seek votes. The MNM is the only team playing for the State's welfare. Ignore the teams playing games of corruption,” he said. Soliciting votes for the MNM-alliance at Pattukottai earlier, Mr. Haasan said his real service to the people had just begun. He will not hesitate to show the door to any MNM candidate if they fail to serve the people after being elected as MLA, It was the duty of an elected government to serve the people and the MNM would fulfil this duty without fail, if elected. Requesting the electorate not to accept money for votes, the MNM founder pointed out that those who bribed voters were not spending their personal money but were only distributing the money stolen from the pockets of public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-takes-a-dig-at-freebies/article34137029.ece
23 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Demand for separate ministry for women in unorganised sector||Thozhi, an alliance of women workers of the unorganised sector, has demanded a separate ministry to handle issues faced by them on a daily basis. The ministry would help in providing resolution to all their demands not being met by the labour department, they contended. The women put forth a list of demands at a workshop on Sunday. The demands were also submitted to representatives of various political parties. Organised by the Centre for Education and Empowerment of the Marginalised (CEEMA), the workshop brought to notice various issues faced by women workers at anklet manufacturing units in Salem, spinning mills in Erode and Tiruppur, cashew factories in Pudukottai, Ariyalur and Perambalur, textile units in Karur, betel nut and tobacco units in Thanjavur, rice mills and sub-contract ventures in Tiruchi, leather factories in Vellore, Tiruppathur and Krishnagiri. According to the federation, the workers were not allowed to eat on time or urinate because of which they developed health complications. A government order could also be passed to ensure that sanitary napkins were provided to them for free. The women also demanded that a strong internal complaints committee be formed at workplaces, with regular checks from the labour department. The department must also create awareness of welfare schemes available to women workers. A request was also made to increase the number of Employees' State Insurance Hospitals for their benefit as there were only five in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/demand-for-separate-ministry-for-women-in-unorganised-sector/article34137009.ece
23 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. unit of Railway Act Apprentice Association to support DMK-led front||The Tamil Nadu unit of the All India Railway Act Apprentice Association has decided to extend its support to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led alliance in the upcoming elections and work hard for its resounding victory. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, association coordinator T. Raja said the DMK had in its manifesto stated that 75% of employment opportunities would be given to the youth of Tamil Nadu in government recruitment and in the private sector. Mr. Raja said the recruitment of Act Apprentices in the railways had stopped all over the country from 2013 till date since a case was pending in the Supreme Court. The State unit of the association had been staging demonstrations demanding that Act Apprentices of Tamil Nadu who had completed training should be recruited in Southern Railway using the powers of its General Manager. The demand was placed before the DMK Members of Parliament had raised their voice in Parliament for direct recruitment of Act Apprentices in the railway. However, it was not accepted by the railway administration citing a case pending in the Supreme Court, Mr. Raja said. The DMK extended support to the association when a majority of north Indians were selected for training for Act Apprenticeship in the Southern Railway in 2018. Mr. Raja claimed that the DMK had come forward to extend its help and assistance to the association in the case that was pending in the court. Manifesto The DMK had heeded the request of the association for providing 75% of employment opportunities in government and private sectors in the State for the educated youth of Tamil Nadu and mentioned it in the poll manifesto. The association, which had over 1,500 members in Tamil Nadu, would support the DMK-led alliance and work for its victory in the upcoming elections, Mr. Raja added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-unit-of-railway-act-apprentice-association-to-support-dmk-led-front/article34137010.ece
23 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||SIM cards distributed to college students||Colleges here have completed distribution of SIM cards with 2GB free data per day to students, as promised by the State government last month so that they can attend online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students enrolled in government colleges and aided programmes in private colleges have started using the SIM cards. Students enrolled in self-supporting programmes in aided colleges and those in self-financed colleges receiving government scholarships were also eligible for the 2GB free data, A. Megala, Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education, Tiruchi, said. Not all students of self-supporting programmes in government-aided colleges could get the SIM cards. Only those institutions who had applied for the scheme for this category of students received them, she said. The scheme covers more than nine lakh students in government arts and science colleges, polytechnic colleges, and engineering colleges till April 2021. The colleges are currently holding classes both in online and offline modes. The utility of the scheme will be fully realised in case there is another lockdown. The government has distributed the SIM cards of almost all the prominent players in the market. “The attendance of students will be higher henceforth,” a professor of a government arts and science college in Tiruchi said. There are indeed problems of connectivity for students in remote areas. But, at least they will be able to attend online classes from nearest spots where the signals are stronger, he said. Teachers perceive that 2GB data is sufficient for students to attend online classes, provided they do not keep the video mode always on. Teachers handling self-supporting programmes draw a paltry sum as salary. So they must also be covered under the scheme, they say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sim-cards-distributed-to-college-students/article34137013.ece
23 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Senthil Balaji booked for speech on sand mining||The police have registered a case against former Minister and DMK candidate for Karur constituency V. Senthil Balaji for his controversial speech on sand mining. Mr. Balaji reportedly told bullock cart operators that they could lift sand once the party came to power. Complaint Acting on a complaint filed by Babu Murugavel, joint secretary, advocates wing, AIADMK, the police booked Mr. Balaji under Sections 153 (provocation with an intent to cause riot), 89 (threatening public servant), 505 1 (b), (creating enmity), 506 (1) (criminal intimidation) and 353 (deterring public servants from discharging duty) of the Indian Penal Code.  In his complaint, Mr. Murugavel said that Mr. Balaji, in his speech delivered before filing nomination in Karur on March 15, had told bullock cart operators that they could have a free run once his party was voted to power. Mr. Balaji had said that the bullock cart operators could venture into the river to load sand as soon as M.K. Stalin, DMK president, was sworn in as Chief Minister. He reportedly told them they could call him if any official prevented them from lifting sand and the officer concerned would not continue there. Mr. Murugavel complained that the speech was aimed at threatening officials and creating unrest. Hence, suitable action should be taken against Mr. Balaji.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/senthil-balaji-booked-for-speech-on-sand-mining/article34136928.ece

23 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Radhapuram to have two ballot units as 25 candidates are in fray||Barring Radhapuram Assembly constituency in the district, where 25 candidates are in the fray that necessitates the use of two ballot units, remaining four segments of the district will have just a ballot unit since these constituencies have less than 16 candidates after the withdrawal of nominations on Monday. Since a ballot unit of the Electronic Voting Machine can accommodate the maximum of 16 candidates, Radhapuram Assembly constituency alone will be in need of two ballot units while all other segments will have only one ballot unit. In Tirunelveli constituency, 14 candidates are in the fray after 2 candidates withdrew their nominations on Monday. Ambasamudram will have 12 candidates following the withdrawal of a candidate from the electoral battle. In Palayamkottai, 10 candidates are in the fray as none withdrew the nomination on Monday. Nanguneri will have 15 candidates as 2 candidates withdrew from the race and 25 candidates are in the fray for Radhapuram Assembly segment after only one candidate withdrew the nomination. In Sankarankovil (Reserved) constituency, a candidate withdrew his nomination to leave 16 candidates in the fray while none withdrew their nomination in Vasudevanallur (Reserved) and Alangulam segments. Consequently, Vasudevanallur (Reserved) and Alangulam constituencies have 11 and 10 candidates respectively. Five candidates withdrew from the battle in Kadayanallur constituency which now has 21 candidates and Tenkasi had 18 candidates following the withdrawal of 3 candidates. For the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha by-poll, 12 candidates including V. Vijayakumar of the Congress, Pon. Radhakrishnan of the BJP, R. Anetter Alwyn of Naam Thamizhar Katchi and Shuba Charles of Makkal Needhi Maiam are in the battle after a candidate withdrew his nomination on Monday. In Kanniyakumari Assembly constituency, 13 candidates are in the fray after a candidate withdrew the nomination and Nagercoil has 15 candidates as two contestants withdrew their nominations. Padmanabhapuram Assembly segment has 12candidates after two candidates withdrew from the race and as many candidates opted to be out of the battle in the Vilavancode segment leaving 15 persons in the fray. In Colachel constituency, 12 candidates are in the fray after a contestant opted to be out of the race. No candidate withdrew the nomination in Killiyoor constituency and hence 14 candidates are in the electoral battle. In Ottapidaaram (Reserved) constituency, a candidate withdrew his nomination and hence 17 candidates are in the fray while each 3 nominations were withdrawn in Kovilpatti and Tiruchendur segments to leave 26 and 15 candidates respectively in the battle. Vilathikulam constituency saw the withdrawal of a candidate and 15 contestants are in the fray now. In Srivaikundam, 2 nominations were withdrawn to leave 21 candidates in the battle and Thoothukudi has 26 contestants as none withdrew the nomination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/radhapuram-to-have-two-ballot-units-as-25-candidates-are-in-fray/article34137043.ece

23 March 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Dravidian majors field fresh faces in Gudalur||Two first-time candidates from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagm (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam(AIADMK) will go head-to-head in the Gudalur constituency in the Nilgiris district. The DMK, which has won four of the last six elections in Gudalur, is fielding S. Kasilingam, while the AIADMK is fielding Pon Jeyaseelan. Both Mr. Kasilingam and Mr. Jeyaseelan are Sri Lankan repatriates, a group that makes up the largest voting bloc in the constituency. Land reform The Sri Lankan repatriates, along with the Adivasis in Gudalur, are primarily employed as labourers in the large tea, coffee and pepper estates, with very limited land ownership. State convenor of the Vivasayigal Thozhilalargal Munnetra Sangam (VTMS), M.S. Selvaraj said that land reform should be at the forefront of the candidates’ election manifesto. “For instance, TANTEA was formed to offer employment to Sri Lankan repatriates. Now there is talk that these estates will be closed down and returned to the forest department. One of our primary demands is for the land to be redistributed to the labourers, who are landless even after 50 years since returning to India,” he said. No pattas Sobha Madhan, a tribal rights activist and district co-ordinator of the Nilgiris Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (NPVTG) Federation, concurs. “Many people, including estate workers and Adivasis live on Section 17 lands under the Gudalur Janmam Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act of 1969. This means that they have no pattas to these lands and can’t even get basic services like electricity and water connections, while they are also not allowed to cultivate the lands that they are occupying,” said Ms. Madhan. Activists said that the large tea estates in the constituency, which are operating on forest land where the leases have expired, should be returned to the forest department. “A portion of these lands, once returned, should be distributed to the labourers and the Adivasis from whom it was taken,” said Ms. Madhan. Another key issue in Gudalur and Pandalur is the increasing number of problematic human-animal conflicts, caused by large tea estates occupying important corridors used by elephants to move between small patches of reserve forest. “Not only are these major estates located along important corridors, but also continue to encroach on remaining forests. There needs to be a comprehensive, scientific plan formulated to ensure that elephant corridors are restored,” said a conservationist living in Gudalur. Quality healthcare Gudalur also lacks in quality healthcare and education, said S. Sivasubramaniam, general secretary of the Gudalur Centre for Consumer Protection. He said that the Gudalur Government Hospital should be upgraded, as residents have to travel to neighbouring Kerala or to Udhagamandalam in case of medical emergencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dravidian-majors-field-fresh-faces-in-gudalur/article34136950.ece
23 March 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Forest Department to make a final effort to drive Rivaldo back into wild||The Forest Department will make a final effort to drive wild elephant, Rivaldo, back into the forest and prevent him from entering human habitations again. The elephant, a frequently seen animal in Vazhaithottan and Masinagudi, in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) buffer zone, was to be put inside a kraal and treated for his injuries, which, the department claimed, was preventing him from feeding out in the wild. However, conservationists have criticised the move stating that the department will be forced into making Rivaldo a captive elephant if the animal is made to spend a prolonged period of time inside the kraal (a shelter usually built of wood to restrict the animal’s movement and used to tame captured wild elephants). The animal is known for his gentle behaviour and has not injured or harmed human beings for the last 15 years that he has been seen in the area. Field Director of MTR, K.K. Kaushal, told The Hindu on Monday that the Forest Department would make a final attempt to drive Rivaldo back into the surrounding forest and prevent him from entering the human habitations. “We are looking out for the best interests of the elephant. We hope he can live his life in the wild, but we might be forced into putting him in a kraal and feed him if he ventures out again and goes in search of food in the surrounding villages,” said Mr. Kaushal. Treatment Mr. Kaushal said the effort to drive the elephant back into the forest would be done once he was given treatment for his injuries. The department is also holding discussions with local conservation biologists to be part of the effort to successfully rehabilitate Rivaldo. Welcoming the development, a local conservationist said, “It is indeed a very welcome shift in the department’s stance on the issue. We hope the efforts can be carried out in earnest as keeping the elephant away from the villages will take manpower and determination both from the Forest Department as well as the public,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-department-to-make-a-final-effort-to-drive-rivaldo-back-into-the-wild/article34136936.ece

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Industrial development eludes Lalgudi||When a cement manufacturing plant was set up by Jaidayal Dalmia, founder of Dalmia Cement, at Kallakudi on the outskirts of Lalgudi about 70 years ago, there was hardly any industry in Tiruchi district. By the time, Lalgudi got its first major industry, the area should have earned the tag of an industrial belt. But it remains to be one of the most backward regions in the district. The Lalgudi constituency has two panchayat unions, Lalgudi and Pullambadi, and four town panchayats, Lalgudi, Pullambadi, Kallakudi and Poovalur. Though the Dalmia cement plant and Kothari Sugars unit provide direct and indirect employment to about 2,000 people in the constituency, residents mainly depend on agriculture and allied agricultural activities for livelihood. While a part of the constituency situated along the banks of the Kollidam and Pullambadi canals have assured irrigation, the remaining area is dependent on seasonal rainfall for cultivation. Besides paddy, sugarcane and banana, cotton and maize are raised in the constituency. Though farmers who benefit from supply of water in Pullambadi canal and well irrigation cultivate paddy in kuruvai and samba seasons, there are concerns over obstruction of water in the canal that starts from Vathalai in Mukkombu and runs via Lalgudi and Pullambadi. Some lakes and ponds, including Palinganatham lake near Pullambadi, have been rejuvenated under the kudimaramathu scheme. Some volunteers and private firms too pitched in their support to rejuvenate some lakes. There are at least 200 small ponds and lakes. A majority of them are yet to see the light of rejuvenation. Establishment of a marketing centre for cotton and maize in Pullambadi or Lalgudi has been a main demand of farmers, who say that none of the elected representatives has fulfilled the promise till now. Also, there is demand for construction of check dams across the Kollidam for recharge of groundwater in villages around Pullambadi and Lalgudi. The area has a huge population of educated youth including engineering graduates. But, many of them have been unemployed or underemployed for very long. It has become a major election issue in the constituency. “The constituency has immense potential both for agriculture and industry as it is well connected by road and rail. It has good ground water sources too. But successive governments and elected representatives have failed to utilise the potential for industrial development,” says N. Jayaprakash, former Chairman, Pullambadi Panchayat Union. N. Chandramohan, another voter of the constituency, says the population of Lalgudi and Pullambadi has gone up to a great extent over the years. The government hospital in Lalgudi should have been upgraded to district headquarter status. But the demand has not been met for so long. The constituency has a sizeable population of Udaiyar and Mutharaiyar communities followed by Scheduled Castes. While DMK has fielded incumbent MLA A. Soundara Pandian for the fourth consecutive time, AIADMK has allotted the seat to Tamil Maanila Congress, which has fielded D.M. Dharmaraj, a transport operator. Out of 11 elections held since 1971, DMK has won seven times, AIADMK three times and the Congress two times. The constituency elected prominent DMK leaders Anbil P. Dharmalingam in 1980 and K.N. Nehru in 1989 and 1996. Though Indhiya Janayaga Katchi and Naam Tamizhar Katchi have fielded candidates, the main fight is between Mr. Soundara Pandian and Mr. Dharmaraj. Both of them belong to the Udayar community. While the DMK candidate hopes that the alliance arithmetic and anti-incumbency factor will fetch votes in his favour, Mr. Dharmaraj, who is seeking election on the two-leaves symbol, believes that the welfare schemes of the AIADMK and the promises made in the election manifesto will send him to the Assembly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industrial-development-eludes-lalgudi/article34137015.ece

Among the 83 fresh cases were students and staff of schools and colleges in the district where clusters were identified. However, Collector M. Govinda Rao said that no fresh clusters had surfaced in the district and added that those who tested positive were asymptomatic. Further, officials of civic bodies and block development offices in the district had been directed to make surprise visits to educational institutions in their jurisdiction to check whether the COVID-19 SOPs were adhered to or not at higher secondary and higher educational institutions. In addition to this, flying and static surveillance teams formed in connection with the Assembly polls have also been directed to keep watch on the students and ensure that they follow the SOPs while commuting between their place of residence to the institutions and back. Suspension of regular classes for students of 9th to 11th standards would help reduce chances of contraction of the infection by teenage population to some extent, he said and added that wearing masks would be the best way to prevent spread of the virus infection. Meanwhile, Tiruvarur reported a spike in cases with 35 patients reporting positive on Monday. Meanwhile, Tiruchi reported 20 fresh cases and Nagapattinam 15.

He said that he was among the three candidates chosen by his party leaders and forwarded to the central leadership. The party high command is yet to finalise the candidate. “If the high command asks me to contest, I will do so,’’ he told journalists. He would speak to the party leaders in New Delhi before the candidate is announced, he said. He would also consult his supporters in Belagavi district before beginning his campaign, he said. He said that the Congress would target the policies and actions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in its bypoll campaign. “The policies and actions of the Union and the State governments are anti-people and anti-farmer. We will highlight that,’’ he said. He said that the CD scandal allegedly involving his brother and BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi would neither have a positive nor a negative effect on the bypolls, he said. Mr. Yediyurappa announcing financial aid to temples, maths and other religious institutions would not affect the poll prospects of the ruling party. Successive governments have released money to these institutions. That is a routine act, not a political move, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-candidate-for-belagavi-bypolls-by-friday/article34137079.ece

23 March 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Congress demands filing rape case against Ramesh Jarkiholi||The Opposition Congress on Monday commenced a dharna in the Legislative Assembly demanding filing of rape case against former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. The members also demanded a Karnataka High Court Chief Justice-monitored probe into the CD scandal in which he is accused of sexually exploiting a woman by promising a government job. “Whatever has happened between Mr. Jarkiholi and the woman is not consensual as the woman in the CD has alleged that she was promised a government job. Hence, this is a rape case,” alleged Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, who commenced the discussion on the issue. He accused the government of being discriminatory with respect to the investigation into the scandal, since the Special Investigation Team was only looking into the “conspiracy” behind the episode as being alleged by Mr. Jarkiholi, ignoring the allegations by the victim. Referring to the court’s observations regarding the Nirbhaya case, Mr. Siddaramaiah said it was mandatory on the part of the police to file a case under section 376 of Indian Penal Code especially after the woman herself made a video statement on her being exploited by Mr. Jarkiholi. Taking exception to the police not registering such a case, he demanded that disciplinary action be initiated against them. He accused the government and investigation authorities of ignoring the injustice meted out to the woman. ‘Verifying authenticity’ However, in his reply, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai argued that it was mandatory on the part of the police as per norms to conduct a preliminary investigation to ascertain the authenticity of video before taking up the case. “We are now verifying the authenticity of video. The police will file a rape case after the authenticity of video is confirmed,” he maintained. Remarking that the woman in the video was “on the run”, he said SIT officials had visited six places, including Goa, Delhi, Bhopal, and Belagavi in search of her. She has to co-operate with the probe, he said, and alleged that there were contradictions in her version and that of her family. “She says she was exploited by Mr. Jarkiholi. But if it is true, why will he release the video (of their purported intimate moments) and tarnish his image?” Mr. Bommai wondered. This irritated the Congress members who trouped into the well of the House, demanding filing of rape case and conducting a court-monitored probe. Expressing dissatisfaction over the Minister’s reply, Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged that the government was meting out injustice to the victim and favouring Mr. Jarkiholi. Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri adjourned the House for the day as the protesting members shouted slogans and refused to heed repeated requests to return to their seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-demands-filing-rape-case-against-ramesh-jarkiholi/article34136864.ece
23 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Wild Karnataka wins national award in non-feature category||Wild Karnataka , a natural history documentary on the State’s wildlife, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, has won big at the 67th National Film Awards announced on Monday. While the film has bagged the best exploration film (non-feature), Sir Attenborough won an award for best narration. “We feel this is an award for the State as the film showcases the State’s rich biodiversity and conservation efforts,” said Amoghavarsha J.S., one of the producers of the film.  Second consecutive year Action director Vikram Mor’s work for Avane Srimannarayana has been adjudged the best stunt choreography for the year 2020. This is the second consecutive year that Mr. Mor bagged the national award for best stunt choreography. Last year, he won the award for his work in KGF Chapter 1.  “I am pleasantly surprised at winning the national award for a second consecutive year. Though I have been working as a stuntman in the industry from 2003, I started out as an action director only six years ago and to win two national awards is unbelievable,” said Mr. Mor, sharing his excitement with The Hindu.   Akshi , a film slated for release in the coming months, has been adjudged the best Kannada film. “The film is about eye donation. The film’s release was stalled last year due to the lockdown and we are preparing for a release very soon. The award has boosted our confidence,” said V. Srinivas, one of the producers and the music director of the film.  Tulu film, book Meanwhile, Pingara , the Tulu film that won the NETPAC International Jury award at Bengaluru International Film Festival - 2020, that portrays caste prejudices, was adjudged the best Tulu film. Filmmaker P.R.

23 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Vaccination: ‘Give preference to those in containment zones’||The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has recommended to the State government that senior citizens and people above the age of 45 years with co-morbidities who are in containment zones and test negative for COVID 19 should be given preference in getting the vaccination. M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the TAC said that people in this age bracket should be vaccinated within 24 hours after they are tested negative in micro containment zones and within 72 hours in regular containment zones. He said that the committee made this recommendation last week to the Department of Health and Family Welfare. “The civic body can mobilise ambulances and ensure that people who have tested negative and are above 60 years or are 45 years and above with co-morbidities are taken quickly to the hospitals or health centres and are vaccinated at the earliest,” he said. He added that this recommendation was made by the committee as this section of people were the most vulnerable and also because there was infection lurking nearby. Currently, a place is identified as a containment zone if there are five or more positive cases identified in a residential dwelling, and if there are between two to four cases, the place is marked as a micro containment zone. No demand While vaccine slots are booked in many of the top hospitals in the city, many smaller hospitals and government facilities are seeing no demand for the vaccine. A doctor who works in an urban health centre in the city said, “It is good that they are prioritising people in containment zones. Along with this, there is a need to spread awareness so that people in containment zones are willing to take the vaccination. There is a lot of reluctance for vaccination even among those who are educated,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-give-preference-to-those-in-containment-zones/article34136855.ece
23 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||House panel to probe scams in nursing colleges||The State government finally yielded to pressure from the Opposition by announcing a Joint House Committee to probe the condition of nursing and paramedical colleges across the State. The announcement in the Legislative Council was made by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa after JD(S) leaders on Monday continued to insist that a House Committee has to be formed to probe colleges offering nursing and allied health sciences courses. While the Chief Minister initially announced a three-member committee headed by a retired judge that was rejected by the Opposition, he finally announced the formation of the House Committee. Uproarious scenes The Council had witnessed uproarious scenes on Thursday and the full session on Friday was washed out after the government refused to accept the demand of the Opposition. Medical Education Minister K . Sudhakar had defended the fresh approval for 47 nursing and 45 allied health sciences colleges given during 2020-2021. On Monday, soon after the session commenced, JD(S) member K.T. Srikante Gowda urged the Chief Minister not to remain adamant and said it was an opportunity to ensure control over nursing and allied health science colleges that have mushroomed across the State. Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil also endorsed this. However, Dr. Sudhakar asked the Opposition to provide specific details of the loopholes that can be investigated. “Any decision that would affect the functioning of the colleges would harm the interests of students who have been admitted to these colleges,” he said. Technical experts can probe over 600 nursing colleges functioning across the State, he said. However, JD(S) member Marthibbe Gowda said: “Despite three levels of checks, many colleges do not have their own buildings or lease agreement for 30 years. Audit report of three years has not been submitted. As many as four colleges share one hospital, whereas as per rules, 45 students of one college should get a 150-bed hospital.” Files pending He alleged that a high-power committee that was set up to give approvals had kept files pending for seven months and it was cleared only after money exchanged hands. “At least half a dozen Syndicate members are from Chickballapur. There have been several reports by retired judges. It will not be surprising if the retired judge is booked as well,” he said. Supporting him, JD(S) member Bhoje Gowda said they had lost faith in probes done by retired judges. As the stalemate continued to affect proceedings, chairman Basavaraj Horatti adjourned the House, and invited Mr. Yediyurappa and Opposition leaders for mediation. Soon after the House resumed, Mr. Yediyurappa announced the Joint House Committee. While Mr. Patil urged that the committee be headed by a member from the Council since the matter arose from here, Mr. Horatti said the committee will be established as per rules.  JD(S) member K.T. Srikante Gowda said formation of the House Committee was an opportunity to ensure control over nursing and allied health science colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/house-panel-to-probe-scams-in-nursing-colleges/article34136867.ece
23 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bill on harvested rainwater||For making mandatory usage of harvested rainwater in large buildings, the Karnataka Cabinet on Monday is said to have approved the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Amendment Bill, 2021. This will ensure that large buildings constructed on 10,000 sq.ft. and above will have to compulsorily make use of harvested rainwater by installing a dual pipe system. Though the BWSSB has made rainwater harvesting mandatory for all buildings, owners of a majority of buildings allow the collected water to flow into drains leading to wastage of water. The Bill envisages implementation of a two-pipe system, one for regular water and another that can be used for toilets, car washing and gardening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bill-on-harvested-rainwater/article34136845.ece
23 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice on plea challenging amendment to KED Act||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition challenging a recent amendment to compound all criminal offences, registered under the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases (KED) Act, 2020, without leaving any discretion to the courts. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, passed the order on the petition filed by Letzkit Foundation, a city-based organisation. By incorporating a provision for compounding all offences committed under the KED Act, the government has only ensured that the “interest of political leaders of all the parties are not effected”, the petitioner said. The petitioner has pointed out that it was this political class of society, facing prosecution after the HC in another petition filed by the petitioner on failure to adhere to COVID-19 norms by political leaders, had questioned about non-prosecution of political leaders under the law. A judge of the trial court, before whom the offenders apply for compounding of the offences alleged, has no choice but to compound them as no discretion is left to them to compound the offences or not. On the contrary, the amended provisions give discretion to the alleged offenders to seek compounding of offence on paying penal fee even if they were instrumental in spreading COVID-19 in the present circumstances, the petitioner has claimed. “...to the knowledge of the petitioner no case is pending either filed or to be investigated for an offence punishable under the provisions of the Act against a common citizen....there are dozens of cases pending investigation against VIPs and Celebrities. Thus, the very fact of giving retrospective validity to the amended provision is only to ensure that none of such VIPs are punished by a court of law,” the petitioner has alleged. Meanwhile, the Bench asked the State government how it can allow organisers of rallies, in which thousands of people violate COVID-19 norms, get away by merely collecting meagre compounding fee from them. Why can the compounding fee not be be collected from every violators or compounding fee on behalf of every violators be collected from the organisers of the rallies, the Bench asked, while adjourning further hearing on both the petitions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-on-plea-challenging-amendment-to-ked-act/article34136849.ece
23 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Change in norms for travellers from Punjab, Chandigarh||With the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in Punjab and Chandigarh, the Karnataka government has made it mandatory for passengers travelling from these two places into Karnataka to have a negative RT-PCR certificate that is not older than 72 hours at the time of arrival. This will be enforced from March 25 6 p.m., according to a circular issued on Monday by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, which added that the matter has been examined in consultation with the Technical Advisory Committee. Having a negative RT-PCR test is already mandatory for passengers from Kerala and Maharashtra. “Negative RT-PCR certificate not older than 72 hours shall be compulsorily produced by the passengers coming to Karnataka by flight, bus, train, and personal transport. This will be applicable for all the flights originating in Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, and Chandigarh,” the order stated, and added that the airline staff should issue boarding passes only to passengers with the negative RT-PCR certificate not older than 72 hours. It also places the onus on railway authorities to ensure that all passengers travelling by trains carry the certificate. Meanwhile, the department has told Deputy Commissioners of the districts bordering Maharashtra and Kerala to make arrangements to ensure that all the vehicles entering Karnataka are checked for compliance. Bus conductors should ensure that all passengers from these states possess RT-PCR negative certificates. Those who are exempted from these certificates are constitutional functionaries and healthcare professionals, children below 2 years, and those who are in an emergency situation which may include a death in the family or medical treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/change-in-norms-for-travellers-from-punjab-chandigarh/article34136850.ece

The Cubbon Park rejuvenation project was unveiled by R. Shankar, Minister for Horticulture and Sericulture, on Monday on the occasion of World Water Day. Dedicating the water sustainability project to the city, he said similar efforts should be taken up in other parks and gardens of the Horticulture Department. Vishwanath Srikantaiah, water expert and founder of BIOME Environmental Trust, in a press release, said: “For long, Cubbon Park has been the connector of old city and Cantonment area, the Vrushabhavathy and the Dakshina Pinakini river systems… By reviving the open wells, digging recharge wells to put flood water into the aquifer and doing this with the assistance of the well-digging community, another bridge has been created between the historic supplier of water, the well and its modern avatar – the recharge well.” He also said the role of shallow, unconfined aquifer in augmenting the city’s water supply had been highlighted, as had been its role to accept stormwater in percolation ponds and recharge wells, hence, mitigating urban flooding. V. Ramaprasad, who was a part of the project, said that the ‘Million Recharge Wells’ project was launched in 2017. “We already have 3.5 lakh recharge wells in the city. Many more citizens and institutions should take this up, engage the Bhovi community (well-diggers). This way, we will not just be recharging groundwater, but the project will also become a livelihood programme for the well-digging community,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cubbon-park-project-helped-recharge-up-to-100-million-litres-annually/article34136838.ece

Yediyurappa on Monday launched ‘GetCETgo’, an initiative of the State government, which offers a comprehensive online crash course for KCET, NEET and JEE exams. The CM said the course, which was introduced last year, was meant to provide coaching for KCET and NEET exams. But this year it has been designed to coach JEE exam aspirants too. Last year with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several students were off track with their exam preparation and access to academic content was limited. The GetCETgo initiative was launched to help offset these challenges, he said. Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwatha Narayana, who also holds the Higher Education portfolio said the objective of the initiative was to increase the number of students from Karnataka in IITs. “This would facilitate the students of Karnataka to achieve ranks in JEE and NEET exams,” he added. The course facilitates learning, revision, and taking up tests. This is intended to benefit over 2 lakh students across the nation who have registered for this programme. Through this, the State government will be able to deliver quality crash course content at a cost of less than Rs. 40 per registered student, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/online-crash-course-for-competitive-exams/article34136874.ece

Addressing a large gathering of farmers who had gathered for the Raitha Mahapanchayat at the Municipal High School Grounds in Haveri on Sunday, Mr. Tikait said that there was a need for converting tractors of farmers into arms and ammunition for removing the barricades.

23 March 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||String of disappointments to KK region||Kalyana Karnataka, one of the most backward regions in the country, received two more jolts last week on the developmental front. The Centre withdrew its proposal on setting up a textile part in Kalaburagi and asked the State to refund Rs. 1.85 crore. It also ruled out the possibility of forming a new Railway Division headquartered in the same place. These are the two latest additions to the long list of broken promises and denied projects for the region. The denial of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) to Raichur in 2015 was the first of the disappointments to the region. Last month, the region suffered another setback when the Union government preferred Hubballi-Dharwad over Kalaburagi for establishing the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Special status It was during the second term of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre that the region got special status under 371(J). Some projects, such as the building of ESIC medical complex and a medical college established in Kalaburagi, had people’s hopes up. However, a new Railway Division with Kalaburagi as its headquarters and the textile park remained non-starters and have now come to be cancelled. Another important project sanctioned for the region in the same period was the National Investment and Manufacturing Zone planned to be established in Kalaburagi. The State government had identified 12,500 acres of land for the project. However, no steps have been taken towards implementation of the project over the last few years. Only two major projects, the Kalaburagi-Bidar railway line and the Kalaburagi airport, which were at the final stages of completion by the end of UPA-II at the Centre and before Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa took charge in Karnataka, respectively, were taken forward. The former was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2017 and the latter by Mr. Yediyurappa in November 2019. The rest of the projects have been put in cold storage, while new projects have not been sanctioned, rue locals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/string-of-disappointments-to-kk-region/article34136859.ece

Five Gram Panchayats from across India, who have made significant contribution for water conservation, were picked for the interaction. Mr. Jonnakeri’s initiative and efforts in mobilising his villagers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and dredging a village lake – Goggavvana Kere – during the COVID-19 lockdown had caught the attention of the Jal Shakti Ministry. Dedicated volunteers He has been a part of Team Yuva, a group of dedicated volunteers that has been working for water conservation in Bidar district, ever since its formation in 2013. The group has dredged over 350 wells and kalyanis, and 30 lakes so far, and gave them a new lease of life. “The Prime Minister enquired whether I was supported by the villagers. I told him that all the water conservation activities were taken up with the consent and the active support of the people as it was their requirement,” he told The Hindu .

23 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Bajal STP, four wet wells facing maintenance issues||More than five years after commissioning the 20 MLD (million litres a day) processing capacity sewage treatment plant (STP) at Jeppinamogaru-Bajal, the poorly maintained STP and four wet wells connected to it which are also facing maintenance issues greeted Mayor Premananda Shetty when he went on a round of inspection of these facilities here on Monday. The wet wells which pump domestic sewage to the STP are at Padil, Faisalnagar, Jalligudda and Kadekar. The Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) built these facilities for the Mangaluru City Corporation under the loan availed of from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). These facilities are part of the about Rs. 220-crore underground drainage project built in the city under the Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal Environment Management Project (KUDCEMP). A 65-km sewer network from Shivabagh, Maroli, Tarethota, Pumpwell, Yekkur, Jeppinamogaru, Padil, Bajal and surrounding areas is connected to the STP. The KUIDFC had handed them over to the corporation in 2015. The Mayor noticed that the wet wells and the STP are facing electrical and mechanical issues. These facilities are not being maintained for the past five years and the corporation did not have a proper mechanism, including a dedicated team, to maintain them. Though the corporation officially did not ask the residents to connect the sewer lines of their houses to the network, many had established connection on their own resulting in sewer in some places overflowing the drain and also reaching the STP to an extent of 5 MLD. The wet well at Faisalnagar, which is not in use, faced electrical issues. One of the three pumpsets in Kadekar wet well is not in use. The sand accumulated in Kadekar wet well has remained uncleared for the past five years. The sewage being collected at the STP missed the first two stages of processing and directly reached the third stage of processing that is aeration. The chlorination process is missing.  The Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation built these facilities for the Mangaluru City Corporation under the loan availed of from the Asian Development Bank  A 65-km sewer network from Shivabagh, Maroli, Tarethota, Pumpwell, Yekkur, Jeppinamogaru, Padil, Bajal and surrounding areas is connected to the STP||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bajal-stp-four-wet-wells-facing-maintenance-issues/article34137276.ece
23 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Mayor jumps into action to address underground drainage issues||Mayor Premananda Shetty on Monday jumped into action to address issues related to the underground drainage and associated facilities that were built in the command area of the sewage treatment plant (STP) at Jeppinamogaru-Bajal five years ago, and which have not been put into use. After inspecting the STP and four wet wells connected to it along with Deputy Mayor Sumangala Rao and officials of the Mangaluru City Corporation and the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC), the Mayor instructed the city corporation officials to conduct the trial run of the wet well at Padil for about 10 days and address the issues that may arise before commissioning it. He asked the officials to address the issues linked to the particular wet well to enable the people in Meghanagar, Niddel, Prashanthbagh, Kembar and Padil in Alape North ward to connect their sewer lines to the manholes of the corporation. The Mayor asked the KUIDFC officials to check the manholes in the command area of the Bajal STP for any faults and lapses starting on Tuesday itself. Mr. Shetty said that both the KUIDFC and corporation officials should sit together and list out the immediate mechanical and electrical requirements at Padil, Faisalnagar, Jalligudda and Kadekar wet wells and at Bajal STP and submit them to the corporation for addressing the issues. All the issues should be addressed one after the other without any blame game, he said. The Mayor said that joint action is required to address the issues and put these facilities into use.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mayor-jumps-into-action-to-address-underground-drainage-issues/article34137277.ece
23 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Lift blanket ban on quarrying’||Quarry owners in the twin districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi have urged the government to immediately lift the blanket ban on stone quarrying and crushing activities saying that the ban was not based on any rationale. Dakshina Kannada and Udupi District Quarry Owners Association president Manoj Shetty told reporters here that quarry owners were directed by the Mines and Geology department to obtain permission from the Director General of Mines Safety (DGMS), a Union government agency, for using explosives within the quarry. It was done in the backdrop of two recent blasts in Shivamogga and Chikkaballapur districts. The DGMS has, however, no authority to deal with small operations falling below one hectare (2.5 acres), while stone quarrying is normally undertaken within a hectare of area. Stone quarrying falls under minor minerals category and the Minor Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act empowers the State government to regulate and formulate rules for minor minerals. Karnataka Minor Minerals Concession Rules do not mention the need for obtaining DGMS licence either, Mr. Shetty said. Thus, even if quarry owners wish to obtain such licence, the DGMS could not issue it and this anomaly was brought to the notice of the government. There was no clear response from the concerned and the department instead asked the owners to give an undertaking that they would obtain DGMS licence within two months to issue Mineral Dispatch Permits (MDPs), required for transportation of crushed stones. Licensed quarry owners, therefore, have stopped their activities which, in turn, had a cascading effect on the construction industry as a crucial input had become non-available to it. Nearly 6,000 people were directly dependent on quarrying in the two districts, while thousands depended on the construction industry, Mr. Shetty noted. All development works that should have been completed or reached crucial stages before the monsoon thus have come to a standstill, he said. The blanket ban was entirely unwarranted and it should be withdrawn without further delay. Furthermore, the State government should bring clarity to this grey area in the law by making necessary changes in the rules to specifically exempt small quarry owners holding five acres or less from securing permission from the DGMS, Mr. Shetty demanded. Udupi Chapter president Satish Kini and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lift-blanket-ban-on-quarrying/article34137273.ece
23 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Revised funding approved for rebuilding Kadri Market||The re-construction of Kadri Market at Mallikatta which is in a standstill mode for the last three years due to funding pattern issues is expected pick up pace as the State Cabinet has approved of a revised funding pattern to complete the work. Mayor Premananda Shetty told The Hindu that as per the revised funding pattern, the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) will sanction 70 % of the project cost of the building as loan while the balance 30 % project cost will be borne by Mangaluru City Corporation. “The Cabinet approved of the revised funding pattern a few days ago. Now, about 30 % of the market building works have been completed. The remaining works will be completed in the next 10 months,” the Mayor said. The corpoation laid the foundation stone for the Rs. 12.30-crore modern market-cum-commercial complex at Kadri in March 2018. The project was launched after fixing the funding pattern at a ratio of 50:30:20. It meant that the project was to get 50 % of the estimated cost as loan from the KUIDFC and 30 % of the total cost as loan from any nationalised bank. The corporation would have had to bear the remaining 20 % cost. Mr. Shetty said that the then administration in the civic body launched the project in a hurry when there was no clarity on the availability of funds. None of the nationalised banks had committed their loan as the interest rate for bank loan had been fixed at 7.90 %. The banks did not come forward stating that the interest rate was very low. It forced the present administration in the civic body to revise the funding pattern. In the revised funding pattern, no loan from any nationalised bank will be taken. As per the funding pattern revised for re-building the Kadri market, 70 % (which is Rs. 8.60 crore) of the total project cost will be borrowed as loan from the KUIDFC at 4.65 % rate of interest. The balance 30 % (Rs. 3.70 crores) will be borne by the city corporation from its enterprises fund, the Mayor said. Building plan The building, coming up on 45 cents of land, will have a floor area of 75,112.98 sq ft. The multi-storey building will have lower and upper basements, lower and upper ground floors and three more floors. It will have parking facility in the lower and upper basements to park about 70 vehicles. The upper ground floor will have a vegetable market, with 36 shops. The lower ground floor will house a non-vegetarian market with 28 shops. There will be shops and offices in the first, second and third floors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/revised-funding-approved-for-rebuilding-kadri-market/article34137275.ece
23 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Deputy Commissioner on the ground to enforce mask rule||Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra, who is a doctor by profession, was seen on the roads in Mangaluru on Monday to enforce wearing of masks, which, according to him, is an effective way to prevent the surge of COVID-19. Dr. Rajendra led the team of officials, which included Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar and in charge Commissioner of Mangaluru city Corporation Dinesh Kumar, in enforcement of COVID-19 behaviour in public places. At the City Centre Mall, Dr. Rajendra directed the mall administrators to ensure that those entering the mall wear masks. If safety protocols are not followed, the district administration will take action to close down the mall, he said. Finding two persons outside the mall not wearing masks properly, Dr. Rajendra advised the them to wear it in a manner that that it covers their noses. Dr. Rajendra and other officials stopped a few private city buses and found drivers, conductors and several passengers not wearing the masks. Suspension of permit While imposing penalty on the offenders, officials warned of suspension of permit if conductors and drivers do not ensure that all passengers wear masks. A person at a hotel who was not wearing a mask was taken into custody by the city police, after he had a heated exchange with Dr. Rajendra. Finding few customers not wearing mask at the Jos Alukkas outlet, Dr. Rajendra warned of closing down the outlet for a few days if the outlet administrators do not follow the protocol. The team visited the petrol bunk in Navabharat Circle and fined the personnel who were not wearing masks. Students walking on the M.G. Road and autorickshaw drivers in the vicinity were advised to wear masks. The team also inspected few shops near the KSRTC bus stand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/deputy-commissioner-on-the-ground-to-enforce-mask-rule/article34137286.ece
23 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Parents, managements question rationale for delaying I PU exam||Vinayaka is concerned over the inordinate delay in holding the examination for first year PU in which his son is studying. “Portions of my son has been completed and a round of revision is already complete. I do not know the logic behind delaying annual examination in July and starting 2nd year classes in August,” he said. A principal of a government aided PU college said there will be a gap of 60 days between the end of physical classes on May 15 to the start of the first year PU examination on July 17. “We fear this gap will make students discontinue with their PU studies. This long gap is a matter of concern,” said the principal, who did not to be named. These are concerns expressed by parents and teachers on the PU examination time-table notified by Director of Pre-University Education Snehal R. on March 18. This is the first time that the Pre-University Board has decided to hold the first PU examination after the II PU examination. As per the notification, the II PU examination will be held between May 24 and June 16, which will be followed by evaluation between June 18 and July 13. Then the first year PU examination will be held, followed by evaluation and beginning of II PU courses. “The II PU examinations are aligned with the class 12 examination schedule of CBSE. We have given ample time for the first PU students to prepare as many could not access online video lectures and were solely reliant on physical classes, which started from February,” Ms. Snehal told The Hindu.  Mahesh Bondala, secretary of Saraswat Education Society that runs Ganapathy PU College and Parijnan PU College, said it is not right on the part of the department to make general assessment that the online video lectures failed to reach students. “Students have made good use of online lectures. And we know students who had difficulty in accessing it. Instead of leaving it to managements to address such students, the department has delayed the commencement of the new academic year, which will have a cascading effect, both academically and financially, for students and managements,” he said. Clifford Sequeira, principal of St. Aloysius PU College, said the college almost completed portions of Science, Commerce and Arts streams of the course. “It’s too late to hold first PU examinations in July,” he said. A principal of a government PU college said it will be difficult for them to hold first PU examination from July 17 as it will take more than a month to complete evaluation of II PU papers. President of Dakshina Kannada Pre-University Principals Association Umesh Karkera said the department has failed to consider problem caused in Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu districts during monsoon, which sets in July.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/parents-managements-question-rationale-for-delaying-i-pu-exam/article34137282.ece

23 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Amidst fears, Mysuru looks to revive patient care centres||Amidst the fears of a second peak of COVID-19 with rising active cases, the district administration is now in the process of re-establishing the government-run COVID-19 Care Centers (CCCs) as a readiness to tackle the pandemic in view of sharp rise in infections. The district’s largest COVID-19 Care Centre that was functioning at the KSOU academic block at Mandakalli on the outskirts of Mysuru was temporarily shut in January as the number of cases being referred to it came down following drop in infections since October last. It’s need is now being felt. So, the centre is now being readied to receive patients in case of any further spike in cases. The 250 beds at the District Hospital or the Designated COVID-19 Hospital were fully occupied. As on Sunday, 82 patients are being treated at the hospital and the total number of active cases has risen to 339, including 134 cases being treated at various private hospitals here. The CCC at KSOU building near the airport became operational on July 14, 2020 after the cases rose unusually in Mysuru. It is equipped with 625 beds for attending to mild cases and it had accommodated nearly 600 patients at one point of time when Mysuru reported a huge surge in infections between July and September. Until January this year, the CCC had treated 5,600 cases. Ashok S.U., Nodal Officer, District COVID-19 War Room, Mysuru told The Hindu that the district administration has directed reviving the CCC at KSOU building. Accordingly, steps had been taken to keep the centre ready for combating the pandemic for the second successive year. He, however, said the situation now is not like last year since the COVID-19 management system had been fully streamlined and the entire mechanism of handling patients – form admission till discharge – had been kept ready. “The pandemic also taught us how we can fight it successfully. The entire system is in place and we need to give it a push. Bed management, triage system, tele consultation, counselling and other facilities are ready. Also, the system is also in place in private set-ups which had set aside 50 per cent of beds for COVID-19 patients,” he explained. After emerging as a model CCC, which was bigger than a hospital, the CCC under Dr. Ashok took various initiatives, including scientific disposal of COVID-19 waste for preventing spread of infections, drawing praise. Many districts looked to the district war room to learn about pandemic management and health workers and volunteers were also trained by the war room. Sanitised Dr. Ashok said the template for operating the CCC has been activated and it will become fully functional as and when the need arises. The entire centre had been sanitised and the staff, including doctors, nursing and paramedics, would be roped in as and when required. “It’s just a matter of time to get the logistics ready.” “Unlike the beginning, the taluk hospitals too are now fully equipped to fight the pandemic. They have beds with oxygen supply. If need be, the care facilities can also be expanded, roping in more government buildings like how it was done during the last peak,” Dr. Ashok added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/amidst-fears-mysuru-looks-to-revive-patient-care-centres/article34137305.ece
23 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Property tax payment going online||The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) will roll out online property payment facility from April 1. It has also decided to issue CR for buildings by levying double tax provided the deviation from the approved plan is less than 50 per cent. For online payment of property tax, the software has been developed by KEONICS and will benefit the owners of nearly 1 lakh properties within the MUDA jurisdiction and which is yet to be transferred to the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC). The property details have been digitised to enable the software to automatically calculate the property tax amount and in the first phase, the online payment facility will be open to the properties developed by MUDA. Subsequently the online property tax payment facility will also be available in case of private properties coming within the MUDA jurisdiction. This was stated by MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev here on Monday. He told mediapersons the MUDA property documents were being digitised and once completed it will pave way for online katha-related transactions as well. The online payment system will also augment the property tax collection of the MUDA as it does not entail any physical visit to the MUDA office, standing in lengthy queue etc., to avoid which people tend to procrastinate or delay the payment of property tax. Mr. Rajeev said the MUDA members who met after the Budget on Saturday also approved the issue of Completion Reports in case of buildings with up to 50 per cent violation of the setback rules and deviation from the approved plans. But this will entail a payment of double the tax amount. He said there were lot of complaints about non-issue of CR due to deviations and violation of setback norms. But the MUDA has taken cognisance of the fact that building a house on plots measuring 20x30 ft or 30x40 ft leads to deviation from the setback rules and hence they intend to collect a tax to issue the CR provided the violation was below 50 per cent. The MUDA has also decided to collect fee from the vacant site owners to keep the property clean devoid of weeds and overgrowth of vegetation. The fee will be levied at the rate of Rs. 1 per sq. ft in case of plots upto 30 x 40 ft dimension and Rs. 2 in case of bigger plots. The validity of Building Licence for construction of new houses issued by the MUDA and which expires on March 31, 2021, will also be extended, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/property-tax-payment-going-online/article34137302.ece

23 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||A green cess to shore up tree cover||In a move that will help shore up the green cover of the city, the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) has decided to raise additional resources through green cess for new building and layout plans and share a portion of it with the Forest Department. The MUDA anticipates an additional revenue of Rs. 80 lakh per annum and it will reserve 50 per cent of the amount for the Forest Department to enable it to take up urban forestry schemes. The remaining amount will be utilised by the MUDA for park and lawn development besides planting of trees. The Forest Department was denied any funds from the government this year for urban greening due to resource constraints. As a result it had written to the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) and MUDA to fund the greening programme failing which the city green cover could take a hit. Now that the MUDA has agreed to earmark funds, the greening drive is expected to continue. MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev said here on Monday that shoring up the green cover of Mysuru was essential to neutralise the growing levels of pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-green-cess-to-shore-up-tree-cover/article34137307.ece

Before introducing a commercial flight, private airliners would assess the occupancy and viability of the operations on the route, said Mr. Manjunath. “Or else, they won’t venture on non-Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) routes”, he added. Mysuru airport, which is now connected to seven destinations, saw a passenger traffic of more than 37,500 so far during 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/additional-flight-introduced-to-chennai/article34137306.ece
23 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Vairamudi: Passes for locals||The Mandya district administration is gearing up for a simple Vairamudi Utsava at Melkote amidst the increasing trend of COVID-19. The event has been confined only to the locals with a bar on the entry of inter-State and inter-district devotees besides curbs imposed on the devotees from taluks within Mandya district. At a meeting in Mandya on Monday, which was chaired by Deputy Commissioner Aswathi, it was decided to distribute passes to only local devotees for participating in the rituals to prevent the entry of others into the temple town. The entire temple area and its surrounding would be barricaded and the locals had been told to carry their ID cards compulsorily with passes to get the entry. As many as 650 police officers and personnel would be on duty in the town for the security and crowd management. Superintendent of Police S. Ashwini said the devotees are supposed to follow the COVID-19 guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vairamudi-passes-for-locals/article34137310.ece

Yediyurappa at the Circuit House in Sindhanur on Sunday and submitted a memorandum seeking construction of a bypass in view of a heavy vehicular movement on Jewargi-Srirangapatna National Highway 150-A, which is passing through the city, causing traffic congestion. In the memorandum, he has stated that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has already submitted a report to the government on acquisition of required land to construct an 11.5-km bypass at a cost of Rs. 211 crore. He has, thus, requested the Chief Minister to take further action. Mr. Nadagouda also requested the Chief Minister to give a direction to the officials concerned to release water from the Tungabhadra dam into the canal till April 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/memorandum-submitted-to-cm-seeking-bypass/article34137075.ece

This has resulted in pollution of 17 river stretches, according to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). Speaking at the first of a nine-part webinar series, titled ‘Bengaluru’s Climate Action Plan: Making it participatory and inclusive’, by the Environment Support Group, which was launched on Monday on the occasion of World Water Day, Srinivasulu, member secretary, KSPCB, said it is high time to increase the sewage treating capacity since treated water is a resource that can bring about several positive changes. He mentioned that though the air quality had improved marginally, the city still has a long way to go. Bengaluru, he said, has the highest density of air quality monitors compared to other cities in the country. B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic), pointed out that unless public transportation becomes a ‘culture’, the vehicle population in the city would continue to increase. The city had 93 lakh registered vehicles. He pointed out that poor road engineering was one of the main contributors to congestions and traffic jams; however, this could be sorted out by solving minor issues and micro management. ‘Proactive planning’ Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Administrator Gaurav Gupta stressed on the need for proactive urban transport planning. Environmental sustainability and development were important issues for cities, such as Bengaluru, he said and added that the recently launched Bengaluru Mission 2022 had laid a road map for the same. Jayanagar MLA Sowmya Reddy pointed out that several natural disasters were linked to climate change and remarked that there was a need to work on an updated action plan on climate change for Karnataka. Earlier, Leo Saldanha from ESG said that the objective of the webinar series was to construct an assemblage of visions for the city and how the metropolis can survive with its limited resources for the benefit of future generations, in the light of the BBMP’s commitment to take action under the Paris Climate Agreement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-time-to-increase-sewage-treating-capacity-kspcb/article34136839.ece
23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||‘Were pre-conditions for metro complied with?’||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State and Central governments, and the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) to inform whether they are ready to appoint Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) or Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) to verify whether all the conditions imposed when the metro project was sanctioned were adhere to. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the direction while observing that it is difficult to accept the report of an officer of the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The report had said that there was compliance of the conditions to implement Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) and Integrated Traffic Ratio Rationalisation Plan (ITRRP). The report of the officer lacks detailed consideration about compliance of various pre-conditions imposed for the project, the bench observed. Also, the bench made it clear that it would, during the next date of hearing, undertake the exercise of examining whether the CMP and the ITRRP were complied with if it doesn’t get replies on entrusting the task to IIMs or IITs by both the governments and the BMRCL. The bench was hearing a PIL petition filed by D.T. Devare and the Bangalore Environment Trust claiming that authorities cannot continue metro project without implementing the CMP and the ITRRP as they were mandatory conditions imposed by the Centre in its sanction letters issued in 2006 and 2014. While pointing out that the conditions were also part of Memorandum of Agreements signed in 2010 and 2017 for Phase I and Phase II of the project, the petitioners contended that absence of CMP and ITRRP, and frequent revision of plans for the city’s infrastructure, have resulted in inefficiency in implementation and utilisation of the metro project as desired ridership level has not been achieved besides achieving the anticipated reduction in road traffic congestion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/were-pre-conditions-for-metro-complied-with/article34136843.ece

Another one at Koramangala Indoor Stadium, with a 250-bed capacity, is also getting ready to be reopened. However, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad told reporters here on Monday that there were no takers for the CCCs yet. The CCCs were reopened in the light of surge in number of COVID-19 positive cases in the city. However, most of those testing positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic and choose to be isolated at home, he said. He added that nearly 70% of those testing positive had travel a history, while others had attended social gatherings. That apart, most of the cases were being reported in apartments and not among residents of slums and localities housing low income groups. “The CCCs are essentially for those who do not have the facility for home isolation and have mild or no symptoms. Most of those who are testing positive seem to prefer home isolation. That apart, there is no shortage of beds in any of the government hospitals. Thus, there are no takers yet for the CCCs,” he said. About increasing number of young children being tested positive for COVID-19, he said as per the Centre’s guidelines, children aged below 10 and senior citizens aged above 65 should avoid unnecessary movement. He also urged citizens to mandatorily follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/two-covid-19-care-centres-ready-but-no-takers-yet/article34136848.ece

Law and Parliamentary Affairs and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai informed the Legislative Assembly that the delimitation exercise for ZP and TP constituencies was underway through Deputy Commissioners. With many members raising concerns on the ongoing exercise, the SEC would be informed to put on hold the delimitation work till the government provides it modified guidelines. However, RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa and Mr. Bommai ruled out postponement of elections to ZPs and TPs. Earlier, raising the issue during the Zero Hour, Sunil Kumar of the BJP said there were several discrepancies in the delimitation work undertaken by SEC. Number of members to TPs were not based on uniform criteria and some TP constituencies were spread over several km in coastal and Malnad areas of the State, he said. Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri and Mr. Kumar said delimitation of segments based on unscientific guidelines would adversely impact the administration and governance in the future. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah suggested to the government to hold meeting with members and seek suggestions since the matter concerned constituencies across the State. However, he told the government not to interfere with the reservation of seats and conducting of elections to local bodies. H.K. Patil (Congress) said Deputy Commissioner have not been following the guidelines and undertake the delimitation work as per their whims and fancies. Before March 31 Mr. Bommai said: “I will talk with the SEC and tell them not to continue delimitation till the modified guidelines are issued by the government.” He also said modified guidelines would be circulated to members and they can give their feedback before March 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/guidelines-to-be-modified-for-delimitation-of-zp-tp/article34136861.ece

In a reply to a question of Lakshmi Hebbalkar (Congress), Mr. Ashok said a total of 1,660 posts of village accountants were vacant in the State. Total sanctioned posts were 9,776. Deputy Commissioners will recruit village accountants based on 12th standard marks alone. Several members said the non-availability of village accountants and their residence in cities and towns caused many problems to farmers and the poor in availing certificates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/village-accountants-told-to-stay-in-their-jurisdiction/article34136862.ece

23 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||‘An elected MLA will become UDF CM’||K.C. Venugopal, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary (organisation), has become one of the important leaders in the party. Although Mr. Venugopal, a Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, has limited his day-to-day involvement in Kerala politics after being appointed to the powerful post, he remains an integral part of the grand old party in the State. With the Congress facing a crucial Assembly election, Mr. Venugopal told The Hindu that victory in Kerala and other States would create a favourable climate for the party at the national level. “For both the Congress and the United Democratic Front, it is a very important election in Kerala. After the local body debacle, we have taken several corrective measures, albeit a lot more to be done, including strengthening the party at the grass-roots. We are facing the polls with the purpose of wresting power in the State,” he says. On Sabarimala Repudiating Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s statement that Sabarimala issue does not exist now, the AICC general secretary says the matter is causing a lot of inconvenience to the Chief Minister and the Left Democratic Front (LDF). “If it is a non-issue, why should a Minister in his Cabinet tender a public apology? The Chief Minister is saying it is non-existent because Sabarimala is an inconvenient issue for him. In this election, the performance and actions of the LDF government in the past five years are up for discussion. Among them, Sabarimala is one of the major issues. The government with the assistance of the police helped non-believers enter the Sabarimala temple. It has pained believers. The Congress is not making it an election issue, but when we discuss the performance of the government, the Sabarimala issue needs to be highlighted,” he says. Mr. Venugopal terms the Congress’s candidate list “revolutionary.” “Of the 92 candidates, 60% are youth. The list reflects a generational shift. I have been in politics for 43 years. In my experience, this is a revolutionary list. Unfortunately, the media are not highlighting it. It should be welcomed and projected,” he says, adding the list was prepared unanimously by the party State leadership and no intervention was made from Delhi at all. The Congress leader seems to be not in the running for the Chief Minister’s post. “If the UDF emerges victorious in the Assembly poll, an elected representative will become the Chief Minister,” Mr. Venugopal says. Hopeful On the party’s poll prospects in other States, Mr. Venugopal says the Congress is hopeful of a good show. “In Assam, we have a good chance. In Tamil Nadu, our coalition will sweep the polls. Both in Puducherry and West Bengal we are fighting.” Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and other national leaders of the party will campaign in the State in the coming days.  For both the Congress and the United Democratic Front, it is a very important election in Kerala. K.C.

23 March 2021||Idukki,KERALA||Land issue back in the limelight in Idukki||The land issue is once again in the centre stage in the pollscape of Idukki. With Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announcing that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government has initiated measures to amend the 1964 Land Assignment Act and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy announcing that the first act of the United Democratic Front (UDF), if elected to power, would be to amend the Act, the issue has gained traction in the Assembly poll campaign. The National Democratic Alliance has also reiterated its commitment to solve land-related issues in the district. In the wake of the Western Ghats reports, the issue was raised as a major point in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with the verdict favouring the LDF. In the 2016 Assembly elections also there were ripples of the issue and three of the five Assembly seats went to the LDF. However, the issue was not in the spotlight in the last Lok Sabha and local bodies elections. Now, the sudden twist in the election campaign is in the form of a ban on constructions other than houses as per the title deed issued under the Land Assignment Act, 1964. Till recently, political party leaders had said development concerns, corruption, and general issues raised in the other districts would be highlighted in Idukki too. Then, out of the blue came the rejection of application for a no-objection certificate for erecting a tent on a land with title deed issued under a condition. Conditions In reply to the application, the District Collector stated that the title deed was issued under the Land Assignment Act, 1964 and it specified that the land could be used for farming and house construction only. According to revenue officials, the title deeds issued as per the 1964 rules specified that the land could be used only for farming activities. Houses could only be constructed for living there. The construction ban would prevail until the rules were amended. The UDF decided to raise it as a major poll issue in the Assembly elections. It has called a hartal in Idukki on March 26 in protest against the construction ban. District Congress Committee president Ibrahimkutty Kallar said an all-party meeting called by the Chief Minister in 2019 had decided to amend the 1964 Act. However, the government had not yet amended it. “The Chief Minister and the government have deceived Idukki natives. Now, people cannot construct even a single shop on their title deed land. We have received information that the district administration has refused NOC for such constructions,” Mr. Kallar said. “Even before the election, we have demanded that the government amend the 1964 rules. But the government did not solve the issue,” he said. Retrospective effect The High Range Samrakshana Samiti (HRSS), which raised the Western Ghats issue influencing the Lok Sabha election in 2014 and the Assembly election in 2016, also stressed the need to amend the 1964 Act. Its general convener Fr. Sebastian Kochupurakal said the rules should be amended with retrospective effect. The 1964 rule amendment was a serious issue and the fronts should reveal their stance before the election. The Bharatiya Janata Party is of the view that issues concerning farmers in Idukki needed to be solved first. District president K.S. Aji said both the fronts had ruled the State and the 1964 Act had not been amended yet. Many undeserved had been issued title deeds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/land-issue-back-in-the-limelight-in-idukki/article34137215.ece
23 March 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Rejection of BJP nomination changes equation in Thalassery||Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidates have been getting elected from the Thalassery Assembly constituency since 1977. While the outcome of a three-cornered contest would have been unpredictable, the exit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate, whose nomination was rejected by the Returning Officer after scrutiny, has triggered speculation in political circles here whether it will be a cakewalk for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate who is now in a direct contest against the UDF nominee. With the Kerala High Court on Monday refusing to intervene in the decision of the Election Commission to reject the nomination papers filed by the NDA candidate, N. Haridas, the situation has created uncertainty and confusion in the BJP and NDA circles. Coincidentally, the rejection has come at a time when both the CPI(M) and Congress have been raising allegations against each other of having a nexus with the BJP. ‘BJP-Cong. nexus’ CPI(M) Kannur district secretary M.V. Jayarajan said that the rejection of the nomination papers had once again reinforced the party’s claims of a nexus between the BJP and the Congress. The constituency had been electing LDF candidates with thumping margins since 1977 and anyone could guess who would get the BJP votes now. A.N. Shamseer, the CPI(M) candidate in the constituency, who had won in 2016 by a margin of 34,117 votes, would once again have an easy victory there, Mr. Jayarajan said. Political turmoil The rejection of the nomination has created a political turmoil in the constituency where the BJP has a substantial vote share. In the last Assembly election, the BJP candidate, V.K. Sajeevan. had received 22,125 votes. In the Thalassery segment of the Vadakara Parliamentary constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the UDF candidate was behind the LDF candidate with a margin of 11,469 votes. DCC president Satheesan Pacheni said that the BJP candidate’s nomination papers were submitted inaccurately as part of the BJP-CPI(M) pact at the State level to save the CPI(M)’s bastions from collapsing. He said Mr. Shamseer was facing a stiff challenge in the election from the UDF. With the unexpected twist in the scenario, the election in Thalassery constituency will be a keenly watched contest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rejection-of-bjp-nomination-changes-equation-in-thalassery/article34137146.ece
23 March 2021||KASARAGOD,KERALA||BSP candidate withdraws in Manjeswaram||The BSP candidate K. Sundara, who became one of the reasons for the defeat of BJP president K. Surendran in the 2016 Assembly election in Manjeswaram, withdrew his nomination on Monday and declared his support to the BJP. Mr. Sundara, who stood as an independent candidate in 2016, received 467 votes in the election in Manjeshwar. This spoiled an opportunity for Mr. Surendran to win the seat. He lost the election to Indian Union Muslim League candidate P.B. Abdul Razak by 89 votes. However, Mr. Sundara, who filed the nomination as the BSP candidate this time, had gone missing on Saturday night. BSP leaders had lodged a missing complaint at the Badiyadukka police station. The leaders claimed that they could not contact Mr. Sundara on the phone after 4 p.m. on Saturday and alleged that their candidate had been abducted by the BJP. However, by evening, they had to withdraw their complaint after the BJP released a statement stating that Mr. Sundara had decided to support the party candidate and withdraw his nomination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bsp-candidate-withdraws-in-manjeswaram/article34137147.ece
23 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||As candidates hit campaign trail, political heat rises in Thrikkakara||The NGO Quarters Circle in Kakkanad is humming with activities at 9.15 a.m. The rising heat is obvious. Shops have just opened and workers are dusting showcases. Traffic is heavy. More than a score of Congress party workers have gathered under a tree, wearing white dhoti and stiffly starched shirts. Most of them are on their phones, either receiving or sending messages. But there is an air of expectation. P.K. Shamsu, a Congress party worker, says he is waiting for P.T. Thomas, sitting MLA and the party candidate contesting from Thrikkakara, who will be there to meet them any time now. Their small talks centre around the prospects of the Assembly elections, the rising atmospheric temperature and the possibility of a spell of rain in the evening as Mr. Thomas alights from his car and briskly greets the party workers. Shop owners are greeting the candidate with big smiles and folded hands, without going out to greet with the normal handshake as COVID-19 precautions are a part of social behaviour now. But the warmth of the greetings is obvious as Mr. Thomas says hello to them all with a big smile, waving his hands. They are acknowledged and reciprocated. There is no wall between them, he says as he passes each shop. At a burial ground Dr. J. Jacob, the Independent candidate backed by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Thrikkakara, is in a more sombre mood. He is at the burial ground of the mosque in Padamugal where a funeral is on. As the funeral prayers and ceremonies are over, he greets his friends and supporters. There are groups of supporters waiting to meet him as he moves from one group to another. Supporters try to draw him under the shades of the trees in the compound as he explains how he wishes to meet voters in person instead of relying on social media platforms. He said he has a large support base, including a great number of regular patients who used to meet him as medical doctor, and the response had been very warm in Thrikkakara. He expressed confidence that his supporters would be there to see him through. The day begins around 6.30 a.m. and lasts up to around midnight when the works of the day are reviewed. In between, breakfast and lunch breaks take the form of formalities. But they are never abandoned, he said. A must The day begins around 6 a.m. for S. Saji of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who feels that voters are now turning more to the BJP for an alternative. He said that the daily newspaper reading is a must before he embarks on his campaign. On Monday, he was greeted by a large gathering in Ponnurunni, near Vyttila, where the BJP has a campaign office. He said that he had lunch on most days with party workers, mostly in their homes after getting on to the campaign trail before 7 a.m. On same page The exhaustive heat is having a big say in the way the candidates are trying to reach out to the voters in the constituency. Despite their political differences, candidates begin their campaign between 6.30 a.m. and 7 a.m. every day and all of them said that they loved to meet their voters in person instead of through social media. Key issues Candidates are keen to see the problem of drinking water shortage addressed at the earliest. Mr. Thomas said that the pollution of the Kadambrayar was a big issue while Dr. Jacob said that public transport and health infrastructure would get big attention. Mr. Saji said that the State had done little to establish a Kendriya Vidyalaya the Central government had promised to establish in Kakkanad. Kakkanad can also turn into a start-up centre for the State, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/as-candidates-hit-campaign-trail-political-heat-rises-in-thrikkakara/article34137155.ece
23 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Give people money, create jobs: Rahul||Endemic corruption without any corrective action has been the hallmark of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, MP, has said. Mr. Gandhi was addressing a public meeting in connection with the election campaign of Deepak Joy, the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate in the Vypeen Assembly constituency, at Goshree Junction on Monday. Attacking both the LDF and the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre on the campaign trail at three constituencies through the day, Mr. Gandhi said both the governments did not realise the importance of putting money in people’s hands to jump-start the economy. If people were given money, it would lead to increased consumption, which in turn would trigger production and generate jobs. On Nyay “Instead, the government is taking money off the people through frequent fuel price hikes,” said Mr. Gandhi. The Congress would introduce Nyay programme whereby money would be transferred directly to the bank accounts of people, he added. Deep-sea fishing deal Alluding to the controversy surrounding the deep-sea fishing deal, Mr. Gandhi said the LDF government struck a secret deal with an American company because it did not have the guts to admit that to the fishing community. The government scrapped the deal only when caught red-handed. “The dynamic and hard-working youngsters of Kerala can only dream of a job now. While the average youth in the State cannot find a job, those affiliated to the Left are easily getting jobs, which is unfair,” Mr. Gandhi said at the campaign of UDF candidate from Kochi Tony Chammany. Harmony in society was intrinsically linked to the well-being of people and job creation. “You cannot thrash and kill people and expect the economy to do well, which the Left or the BJP do not seem to realise,” he said. ‘A different list’ Mr. Gandhi described the candidate list of the UDF as ‘very different.’ “It is a perfect blend of youngsters, who account for 55%, and seniors. If voted to power, the UDF would bring about new imagination and new approach, laying the foundation of a new leadership,” he said. Later, addressing a campaign meeting at Vayalar Junction in Alappuzha, the Congress leader said the UDF would raise welfare pensions to Rs. 3,000 and introduce Rs. 2,000 as monthly pension to homemakers. “We will raise the minimum support price of rubber, coconut and paddy,” he said. ‘Global opinion’ Mr. Gandhi said the Prime Minister had become a laughing stock. “We have a Prime Minister who always talks about Make in India, and the world laughs at him. The world knows he is the person who divides India. International institutions say that India is no more a democracy. A country that used to be united and confident is today angry, and divided,” he added. “We are not interested in dividing people. We bring them together,” he said in a meeting at Kommady.

23 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Demand for better roads, transportation amenities||With Assembly polls round the corner, Kochiites across age groups demanded plugging of gaps in road and allied infrastructure and also expressed concern at lacunae on the commuting front, giving credence to the perception that much can be done if civic and other agencies worked in tandem. The condition of most arterial roads has improved over time, but for KWA and other players playing spoilsport by frequently trenching them, inordinate delay in completing their works and improper restoration, said 26-year-old Nevil Jacob Paul, a mechanical engineer who is employed in L&T. “Civic agencies like the Kochi Corporation and the GCDA, and those like the PWD and the NHAI which own roads are duty-bound to ensure that trenching is not at the cost of commuters and road safety. Important roads must have utility ducts, alleviating the need to dig roads. Mobile pothole filling units must be introduced so that potholes are repaired as soon as they develop. Above all, these agencies must take a cue from DMRC/KMRL on how roads along the metro corridor were widened and resurfaced with tarmac-like finish,” he said. In addition, care must be taken to widen junctions so that vehicles can take free-left turns without being caught in traffic snarls. On their part, enforcement agencies must clamp down on permanent and semi-permanent encroachments and obstructive parking by cars and other vehicles, especially on footpaths and narrow roads, Mr. Paul added. Milling of roads District committee member of Ernakulam District Residents Associations’ Apex Council (EDRAAC) D.G. Suresh called for modern road-resurfacing methods like ‘milling’ (in which the tarred layer is scooped out, treated and reused) — a technology that CSML has deployed while developing Park Avenue Road and Shanmugham Road as ‘smart roads’. “This ensures that the road level is constant, while at the same time lessening quarrying to source aggregate. “Similarly, pay-and-park lots must be developed at frequent intervals, to prevent parking on public roads. This can be realised if owners of vacant plots are incentivised and provided technical support.” Mr. Suresh also sought introduction of mini buses along side roads that link residential and commercial areas, which will be able to operate feeder services to the nearest metro station. Adequate number of low floor and ordinary buses must be rolled out in suburban locales not linked by the metro, he said. BRT corridors The founder-chairman of city-based think tank Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR), D. Dhanuraj too sought qualitative and quantitative upgradation of modes of public transport, especially buses. Constructing more flyovers will only result in influx of private vehicles into the city, as is being seen on the Edappally-Aroor NH bypass where three flyovers were commissioned this year. “Kochi also needs dedicated corridors for Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) and tramways, which are getting popular worldwide since they considerably lessen the number of private vehicles and autorickshaws. They can be readied at a fraction of the cost of building a metro rail corridor. It is sad that the State government is subsidising the Kochi metro to the tune of around Rs. 1 crore per day, while not incentivising bus operators.” It is heartening that the Kochi Corporation is now working in tandem with KMTA and CSML to provide the rightful place to pedestrians and bicyclists, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-for-better-roads-transportation-amenities/article34137153.ece
23 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||LDF sees a chance in the working-class segment||There are nine candidates in the race for Kalamassery, being looked upon as a prestige seat by the United Democratic Front (UDF) with the Indian Union Muslim League fielding V.E. Abdul Gafoor, son of sitting MLA V.K. Ebrahim Kunju, as official candidate. There has been obvious opposition to the nomination of Mr. Gafoor as a large group of Muslim League workers gathered in Kalamassery earlier this month in protest. A senior leader told The Hindu said the workers did not hold a rally last week as it would be against party discipline, but they expressed their dissatisfaction with the State leadership decision. Gains in local bodies Besides, the recent gains in the elections to local bodies have given a new confidence and impetus to the campaign of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), which is sensing a chance to capture the seat from the UDF, with P. Rajeev, former member of Rajya Sabha, going way ahead in his campaign. The LDF won 20 seats in the 42-member Kalamassery municipality and it feels that it is well poised to wrest the Assembly constituency, which represents the working class in a big way. The National Democratic Alliance has fielded Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) candidate P.S. Jayaraj in the constituency. Mr. Ebrahim Kunju, who won in 2011 and 2016, was overlooked as he is among the key accused in a corruption case related to the Palarivattam flyover. But it is a fact that Mr. Kunju had defeated popular leaders A.M. Yousuf and K. Chandran Pillai in the previous two elections easily. In 2016 In the 2016 elections, in which 10 candidates were in the fray, the NDA constituent BDJS, represented by V. Gopakumar, had garnered 24,244 votes — nearly 16% of the votes. In 2011, when there were 10 candidates in the fray, P. Krishnadas of the BJP received 6.4% (8,438) of the votes. The 2016 elections saw 1.54 lakh votes being polled, which made up about 81% of the total votes. In 2011, the polling was 1.31 lakh, about 79%. The Kalamassery segment of the Ernakulam Lok Sabha constituency had seen Hibi Eden of the Congress polling 73,745 votes in the 2019 general election. P. Rajeev of the CPI(M) received 53,056 votes and K.J. Alphons of the BJP received 21,026 votes. Kalamassery’s position as representing industrial workers is quite significant as it is home to two major industrial estates and big public sector undertakings, including the Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore. Home to industries The industrial areas in Eloor and Kalamassery, which is home to about 500 small and medium-sized industrial units, add weight to the status of the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-sees-a-chance-in-the-working-class-segment/article34137210.ece
23 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||DHS told to file report on action taken against jail doctor||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday directed the Director of Health Services (DHS) to file by March 29 a report on the action taken against the doctor of the Central Prison, Thiruvananthapuram, who had failed to note the injuries on the bodies of some of the convicts who were allegedly beaten up by the jail officials. The Bench said if the report was not filed by March 29, the DHS should appear in person before the court on March 30.  Assault The High Court issued the directive when a petition filed by the parents of Tittu Jerome, a convict in the Kevin murder case, alleging that their son and other inmates of the central prison were assaulted at the jail came up for hearing. Injuries The court had directed the DHS to conduct an inquiry into the allegation by the convicts that the jail doctor had refused to take note of the injuries visible on their bodies, and to take action against the doctor concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/file-action-taken-report-against-jail-doctor-hc/article34137219.ece
23 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||HC airs concern at ROs’ different parameters||The Kerala High Court on Monday expressed concern over adoption of different parameters by returning officers (ROs) for the Assembly polls in different constituencies in the matter of acceptance and scrutiny of nominations and various forms. Justice N. Nagaresh, while dismissing the writ petitions of National Democratic Alliance candidates in the Thalassery, Guruvayur, and Devikulam Assembly constituencies against the rejection of their nomination papers, observed that “when some candidates get the benefits of liberal approach of the returning officers, some others are put to disadvantageous position affecting their statutory right under the Representation of the People Act to contest in the elections”. The court opined that “the Election Commission of India shall take necessary steps so that such differential treatment is excluded and the purity of the election process is preserved”. The NDA candidates, in their petitions, alleged that time had been granted to LDF candidates in the Konni and Pirvom constituencies to correct the defects in their nomination papers. Besides, the scrutiny of the nomination papers in the constituencies had been postponed. But no such time was granted to the petitioners to rectify the mistakes in their papers. The Election Commission, while taking objection to the pleas of the NDA candidates, submitted that any interference by the High Court at this stage would disrupt, stall, and upset the whole election process. SC directive In fact, the Supreme Court had held that elections had to be concluded as early as possible as per the schedule and all controversial matters and disputes arising out of the election process should be postponed until after the election so that election proceedings would not be unduly retarded or protracted. There could not be a two-pronged attack: one by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the High Court and another by filing an election petition after the declaration of the elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-airs-concern-at-ros-different-parameters/article34137172.ece

The arrested man was identified as Rajeev aka Pothu Rajeev, 39, of Thodupuzha. A special investigation squad formed by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K.

Joseph heaved a sigh of relief with the party managing to ensure a common symbol for all its candidates. In view of the delay in getting a new symbol from the Election Commission of India (ECI), after its merger with the P.C. Thomas faction of the Kerala Congress, all 10 candidates fielded by the party had sought ‘farmer driving tractor’ as their symbol. It, however, faced the prospect of receiving another symbol in one seat as Babychan Mukkadan, a Congress rebel fielded by the Indian Christian Secular Party in Changanassery, too staked claim for the symbol. The Joseph group tried reaching out to Mr. Mukkadan, though to no avail. The uncertainty, which lasted for over a couple of days, ended finally with the Returning Officer on Monday allotting the desired symbol to the Joseph group’s candidate in Changanassery, V.J. Lally. For Kappan too Mr. Mukkadan, meanwhile, was allotted ‘coconut grove’ as his poll symbol. Mani C. Kappan, president of the Nationalist Congress Kerala, who faces Jose K.

23 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Cong., BJP have a deal for polls: CM||Accusing the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of entering into a tacit electoral understanding, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that the victory of the BJP in the Nemom constituency during the 2016 Assembly elections was a manifestation of this deal. Addressing media persons in Kottayam on Monday, Mr.Vijayan said both the winning and losing candidates have admitted in public that the Congress traded its votes in Nemom. “The deal was that the Congress would help the BJP to win from Nemom in return for a similar assistance to the UDF candidates in the neighbouring constituency. The revelations made by V. Surendran Pillai, the victim of UDF’s vote trade, have proven this deal,” he said. According to Mr.Vijayan, while the BJP was trying to sabotage democracy through the purchase of votes, the Congress is also doing the same thing by selling its votes. “That the BJP-led NDA has no candidates in three constituencies this time also raises some suspicions on the existence of an unholy alliance. Some prominent Congress leaders who are contesting this time are attempting to win the election with the BJP’s support, which has fielded rather weak candidates in these seats. This will become more evident in coming days,” he said. Warns LDF workers Meanwhile, Mr. Vijayan also warned the LDF workers against being complacent with the pre-poll surveys released by a section of the media. Meanwhile, Mr.Vijayan sought to evade queries relating to the Sabarimala issue and the NSS’s attack on the LDF.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-bjp-have-a-deal-for-polls-cm/article34137222.ece

There is no politics involved in this stance,” NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair said in a statement The forum, he said, never had any political ambitions and, hence, it never curried favour with any political parties or leaders.

23 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Interesting poll battle in Perambra||The Perambra Assembly constituency is all set to witness an exciting electoral battle between a seasoned politician and a prominent NRI businessman. T.P. Ramakrishnan of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) who proved his capabilities as Minister for Excise and Labour will take on Indian Union Muslim League’s Independent candidate C.H. Ibrahim Kutty, who is popular as a philanthropist and social activist. KC(M)’s influence The contest is going to be a tough one for the United Democratic Front (UDF) with the exit of the Kerala Congress (M) faction. The KC(M), which was a strong opponent of the LDF in the previous elections, is now a fellow-runner of the front. The row over candidate selection, that has not yet been settled, also remains a stress factor for the UDF and may affect the front’s campaigns in the constituency. ‘Pro-farmer policies’ On the other hand, LDF campaigners consider Perambra as one of their sure seats, citing previous victories and the front’s strong hold in all the 10 grama panchayats within the constituency. They believe that the agrarian belt is happy with the “pro-farmer” policies of the LDF government and the due representation it got in the State with the elevation of its people’s representative as minister. Since 1980, the electorate has favoured Left candidates. The LDF expects its highest victory margin against the rival front this time with the entry of the KC(M). Declining margin However, the UDF is banking on the declining victory margin of the Left. The LDF’s victory margin which stood at 15,269 in the 2011 elections was reduced to 4,101 in the 2016 elections. Those in the UDF believe that it is a clear indication of the declining hold of the LDF in the constituency. Many UDF leaders do not consider the exit of the KC(M) as a big challenge. The focus of the UDF this time is on improving the total voter turnout, which is likely to help improve its vote share in the constituency. UDF leaders point out that the low voter turnout has been affecting their candidates in the past and say that it will not happen again. NDA vote share For the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the election is a chance for increasing its vote share. NDA candidate K.V. Sudheer has great hopes to do well for his party. The NDA vote share in the previous election was 6%. For the leadership, it will be an opportunity to test their capabilities in improving the party’s hold at the grassroots-level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/interesting-poll-battle-in-perambra/article34137145.ece

23 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Tipping his hat to teamwork||It was a news story about a kitchen worker who got trapped in a walk-in freezer at a hotel for 13 hours in Atlanta that kindled an idea in Mathukutty Xavier for his debut film Helen . When he speaks to The Hindu , after winning the National Film Award for the best debut director, he refers to ‘the three of us’, sharing the credit with his co-writers Noble Babu Thomas and Alfred Kurian Joseph. “Before venturing into cinema, I was working in the IT field, and in advertising before that. Though I tried writing scripts in my spare time, nothing worked out. So, I decided to quit and work on scripts. Then I met Alfred, who had studied with me from nursery school. Noble joined us soon, and we synced,” says Xavier. The trio wanted to make a big film with major stars. But the Atlanta woman’s story made them think on a smaller scale. With Anna Ben joining them to play the protagonist and Vineeth Sreenivasan offering to produce the film, they did not have to look back. “We had two basic elements for the film — the woman who gets caught in the freezer in a chicken shop and the security guard in the mall who notices her because she is the only one who smiles at him everyday. We knew that everyone could relate to this,” he says. The film also won the national award for the best make-up for Ranjith. The makers had discussed threadbare the changes on the skin of a person caught inside a freezer with every passing hour. Ranjith captured these changes in Helen , the setting in of paleness on the skin and how it turns blue. For the entire crew, the shooting was a bit of an ordeal, as they had at times to be in minus 10 degrees to get the atmosphere right. Xavier is set to work on yet another film with his co-writers, with Alfred turning a director this time. After this, he will be helming his second film as director.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tipping-his-hat-to-teamwork/article34137167.ece

23 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||They pitch for law to protect their rights||While acknowledging the interventions targeted at transgender welfare over the past five years, the queer community in the State expects the next government to take a step further by bringing in legislation to protect their rights. Prijith P.K., president, Queerythm, a community-based organisation, says the transgender policy should be updated, preferably by bringing in legislation, to reflect the issues of all sexual and gender minority people. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s judgment (in the National Legal Services Authority vs Union of India case) and the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the State government could enact a comprehensive law that would delve into marriage, property and succession, parenthood, and other related matters for the LGBTQI+ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (or questioning), and intersex] community. The new government should be brave enough to implement such a law. Once the law is in place, anything that adversely affects the community will no longer be a hurdle, says Prijith. As regards the transgender community, Prijith calls for local level support systems so that people can ‘come out’ easily without worrying about acceptance for themselves and their families in society. Inclusion Syama S. Prabha, project officer in the State Transgender Cell, feels it is time to take steps for inclusion of the LGBTQI+ people in society. The next government should make State rules for the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 so that rights such as marriage and property can be ensured. This will, in turn, require amendment to the transgender policy, says Syama. Reservation of seats for transgender people in local bodies, similar to that enjoyed by women, and a transgender welfare board or commission, on the lines of the women’s commission or the youth commission, should also be set up, says Syama. The government has made welfare interventions for transgender people but more needs to be done such as permanent accommodation for them and PSC reservation to make more employment opportunities available to them, says Syama. Mainstreaming Planning is one area where mainstreaming can be facilitated. Amritha K.P.N., coordinator of the Gender School for Local Governance, Kerala Institute of Local Administration, says along with women empowerment, local bodies should also focus on development activities for mainstreaming the LGBTQI+ people. For this, gender-oriented working groups should be set up so that issues can be seen from the perspective of gender and programmes planned accordingly. Positive discrimination Positive gender discrimination, as in the case of women, can also be considered to give transgender people a leg-up to stand and compete with others, says Amritha. Though there is the transgender policy and transgender people have more visibility now, stronger measures need to be taken by the next government that target at a change in people’s attitude. Such steps will make transgender people more confident about finding social acceptance. Livelihood opportunities is another area the government can intervene in, she adds.  Reservation of seats for transgender people in local bodies and a transgender welfare board or commission are needed. Syama S.

Buoyed by the recent SKOCH Award for Anantapur District Water Management Authority(DWMA) for linking the NREGS works with water conservation, district officials, including Hindupur MP Gorantla Madhav, Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah with DWMA, at a meeting here decided to link MGNREGS funds with project. The Rs. 100-crore project might involve a non-governmental agency and they might be given a 2% consultancy fee. According to sources, Art of Living has also been contacted, and if all goes well, a Memorandum of Understanding is likely in the first week of April. Major hurdles A major hurdle for the proposed Rs. 100-crore project will be the several existing and ongoing constructions on the riverbed at Pamidi and Tadipatri in Anantapur district. Tadipatri has one NTR Bhavan meant for senior citizens, a two-storied tourism guest house building, and a park. Major encroachments on the riverbed all through its journey and the large-scale destruction of the catchment area have restricted the river flow, from Nandi Hills to Kadapa district, to just a few monsoon months. While water flow is restricted to few days during monsoon usually, during the 2020 monsoon, however, the river saw a consistent flow for a longer spell.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-mulls-rejuvenation-of-penna/article34136791.ece

23 March 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Roll back sand policy, urges BJP leader||BJP State general secretary S. Vishnuvardhan Reddy on Monday said that the sand policy of the YSR Congress Party government was a big failure in the State, as it had left the families of the construction workers and the middle-class sections hoping to own a house in dismay. Speaking to reporters in Tirupati, the BJP leader demanded that the State government should drop its sand policy and provide it free of cost to the poor and downtrodden. “The sand, liquor and cement trades have turned into the prime sources of income for many YSRCP leaders. Non-availability of sand has thrown lakhs of construction workers into poverty,” he said. Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy felt that it was unfortunate that the companies whose tenders of liquor and sand were called for were all owned by YSRCP leaders. He said the BJP would launch agitations before the Collectorates and Revenue Divisional Offices across the State, demanding the cancellation of the sand tenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/roll-back-sand-policy-urges-bjp-leader/article34137328.ece

23 March 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lack of enthusiasm for vaccination in phase-3||Amid a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases, lack of enthusiasm among those in the age group of 45-59 years and those with comorbidities is glaring and could possibly lead to vaccine wastage. In Guntur district, which is among the most highly infected regions in the State, only 12,514 people have been covered in the age group of 45-59 years, while 32,206 people above the age of 60 years have been vaccinated. Concerned over low vaccine coverage, the State government has decided to provide vaccines at ward/village secretariats. In Guntur district, a pilot project to provide vaccine at ward/village secretariats was launched at Kaza ad Yadlapadu villages last week. Joint Collector P. Prasanthi conducted an awareness meeting and monitored the pilot project. “We have launched a pilot project at Kaza and Solasa village secretariats, in which we have taken confidence building measures such a having a doctor a day before the camp and vaccinating groups of people. The response is encouraging and we intend to provide vaccination at all ward/village secretariats,” said Ms. Prasanthi. The Indian Medical Association and the NGOs also stepped up campaign and advocated safety and efficacy of the vaccines. The low vaccine coverage could be due to lack of institutional support. The phase-1 and phase-2 vaccination for healthcare workers and frontline workers witnessed almost 80.10% and 81% coverage respectively. Government staff The intent shown in phase-1 and phase-2, where mostly employees belonging to government were vaccinated, was clearly missing in the third phase. In phase-1, of the 34,132 health workers who had registered, 33,118 were vaccinated with two doses. In phase-2, of the 20,193 frontline workers who had registered, 16,342 were vaccinated. The poor performance of Urban Local Bodies in Tenali, Guntur, Narsaraopet , Sattenapalli and Tadepalli was taken to the notice of senior government officials, who responded by issuing notices to healthcare workers and frontline workers, taking institutional undertaking from those who have not turned up for vaccination due to various reasons. The comparison between revenue, panchayat departments and police departments threw up some interesting facts. The vaccine coverage in police touched 84% with 8,316 of the 9,904 personnel getting vaccinated as on March 20, 2021. In comparison, only 17,527 personnel working in revenue and panchayat departments of 41,061 beneficiaries were vaccinated covering just 55.40%.  In Krishna district Krishna District Medical and Health Officer M. Suhasini said hereafter vaccination would be provided in select Village and Ward Secretariats at mandal level in the district. Dr. Suhasini said that one secretariat will be selected per mandal and vaccination will be provided on either Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday throughout the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lack-of-enthusiasm-for-vaccination-in-phase-3/article34137408.ece
23 March 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Karnataka takes a leaf out of A.P.’s book||Inspired by the State government’s public grievance redressal programme Spandana, an official team from Karnataka has arrived here recently and studied its implementation. The delegation, including Project Director, Karnataka E-Governance Unit and the Programme Manager, Centre for SMART Governance, visited the Central Spandana Monitoring Unit at RTGS in the Secretariat on March 22. They were explained about the vision of the scheme and its various technicalities by the Special Officer to Chief Minister M. Hari Krishna and CEO of RTGS Vidya Sagar. The Karnataka government is planning to replicate in their State a similar robust public grievance system called iPGRS – Integrated Public Grievance Redressal System. Mr. Hari Krishna explained Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s vision behind the programme and his idea of having a human face in the grievance redressal process and the need for a smile on the face of every public functionary while interacting with people. While the visitors were impressed by the robustness and processes involved in the Spandana portal, the features like Grievance Reopen, Call Centre Feedback Calling and Dashboards to monitor grievances remained their key areas of interest. Jagan’s brainchild The programme was conceptualised and named by Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy from his experiences and interactions with people during his 3,648-km padayatra. Its primary objective is timely and quality redressal of every grievance. The departments use the Spandana portal to identify major grievance areas and initiate necessary reforms. It helps the departments spot lacunae and process gaps existing within the departments for remedial action. The Chief Minister himself reviews the grievances with SPs and Collectors on a fortnightly basis while monitoring is done by the Secretary to the CM, the Special Officer to the CM and the Secretary, Planning, they were told. The Karnataka team showed interest to know how the Chief Minister personally monitors the programme and were all praise for his efforts to convert the vision into a reality. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s policies have drawn the attention of various States. The village volunteers system had been an inspiration to Kerala and Rajasthan government and the Disha Act became an inspiration for the Delhi government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-takes-a-leaf-out-of-aps-book/article34137322.ece

Chandrasekhar Reddy on Monday said the State government employees would rally behind Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who was trying his best to impress upon the Centre to take back its decision to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). Addressing the media here, he opined that people cutting across party lines should strengthen the hands of the Chief Minister, who had taken up the cause of the VSP with the Centre forcefully. ‘Raw deal’ He said it was unfortunate that the Narendra Modi government had meted a raw deal to the State which had been struggling to overcome the bifurcation blues. None of the major infrastructure projects promised to the State had fructified due to the alleged indifference by the Centre to the development of the State, he lamented. Pay revision The APNGOs would take part in a stir in protest against the ‘anti-labour’ and ‘anti-employee’ Union government, which was ‘bent upon privatising each and every unit in the public sector, throwing to winds the interests of the workers’, he said. Employees could expect a decent pay revision in the new fiscal by the State government, he added. APNGOA State general secretary Bandi Srinivasa Rao urged the Chief Minister to take steps for scrapping the ‘anti-employee’ Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) as promised, regularise the services of employees taken on contract basis and provide house sites to all eligible employees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apngos-to-agitate-to-protect-vsp/article34137330.ece

23 March 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘No irregularities in awarding sand mining contract to JPVL’||Denying that the sand mining contract awarded to Jaiprakash Power Ventures Limited (JPVL) was fraught with irregularities, Principal Secretary (Mining) Gopal Krishna Dwivedi asserted that Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited (MSTC) has done due diligence in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the State government and the eligibility and track record of JPVL were thoroughly verified. Addressing reporters on Monday, Mr. Dwivedi said the sand policy came into force on September 5, 2019, and it has been evaluated through an effective process of collecting feedback and a Cabinet committee has made certain recommendations after several rounds of deliberations were held at the highest level on delivery cost and other issues. The government then prescribed a comprehensive set of guidelines right from the minimum annual turnover of the prospective bidders to the minimum experience required and the need for proven track records. ‘Baseless allegation’ One of the clauses in the tender document clearly stated that the company’s net worth as on March 31 should at least be Rs. 152 crore for the first package and Rs. 238 crore and Rs. 95 crore for the second and the third packages respectively. So, the allegation that JPVL is bankrupt was baseless, he said. Another clause said the company should have completed similar works in the last five years apart from possessing the minimum equipment necessary for executing such contacts. This was looked into by the MSTC, he added. Besides, the government would be holding Rs. 120 crore as bid security. On an average, the State required two crore metric tonnes of sand and with the price capped at Rs. 475 per tonne, the total value of the contract is not more than Rs. 950 crore, of which JPVL has to pay Rs. 765 crore to the government, he clarified. The operational cost per tonne works out to Rs. 64. The company would, therefore, be earning around Rs. 72 crore. Multiple penalty clauses were incorporated in the tender document. Mr. Dwivedi further said JPVL has to pay to the government every 15 days in advance for the next 15 days of business operations. Of the Rs. 475 per metric tonne price at the sand reaches, Rs. 375 goes directly to the government treasury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-irregularities-in-awarding-sand-mining-contract-to-jpvl/article34137324.ece

In a statement on Monday, TDP A.P. State president K. Atchannaidu said that the government sacked the paramedical staff from their contract jobs after utilising their services during the peak of the pandemic. “The frontline staff risked their lives to save people’s lives during the peak of the pandemic. The government is now trying to suppress the protests of the frontline warriors instead of fulfilling their justifiable demand for restoration of their jobs and payment of pending salaries,” he alleged. “The government arbitrarily removed the frontline staff with the single stroke of a pen in February. Their families were plunged into a crisis with salaries not being paid to them properly. The paramedical staff fell at the feet of the people's representatives but nobody cared for their situation. When they finally launched protests, the government has begun to crack down on them,” Mr. Atchannaidu said. The TDP leader added that the government should restore their jobs at the earliest failing which the TDP would launch a Statewide agitation along with frontline warriors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/restore-jobs-of-frontline-warriors-tdp-asks-govt/article34137332.ece

23 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Allocating captive mines best solution for revival: VSP staff||The allocation of captive iron mines has been eluding Visakhapatnam Steel Plant ever since its inception. The employees of VSP and members of Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee (UPPC) are of the opinion that giving captive mines to the only shore-based integrated steel plant in the country is the only way to prevent it from incurring losses and retaining it as a public sector unit. In 1971, when M.N. Dastur had submitted the DPR for the plant, it clearly mentioned about the allotment of a block in Bailadila range of NMDC. However, this never happened and VSP was forced to buy iron ore at market price since 1991, when the plant became operational, said Ch. Narasinga Rao, chairman of the UPPC. Since 1991, the cost per tonne of iron ore has risen drastically and it is affecting production cost, which is leading to losses, he said. In 1991, the cost per tonne of iron ore was Rs. 396 and till 2003 it was well below the Rs. 1,000 mark. In 2003, the cost per tonne was Rs. 821. But from 2004, iron ore was listed under mineral trading with the commodity trading and since then there has been a steep hike in price per tonne. In 2004, the price was Rs. 1,085 and from there it has risen to Rs. 4,779 in 2019-20. Between 2013 and 2015, the prices shot up to Rs. 5,424 per tonne, said Mr. Narasinga Rao. Of the total cost of production, raw material accounts for 61% and of which the major share is taken by iron ore, as it is basic raw material. For production of 1 MT of steel, there is a requirement of about 1.6 MT of iron ore. The production capacity of VSP has been increased from 3.3 MPTA to 7.3 MPTA, and hence the cost of iron ore is playing a key role in its profitability, said Mr. Narasinga Rao. According to him and other employees of VSP, in 2020 SAIL, which has its own mines, had spent around Rs. 2,396 for every tonne of iron ore. But at the same time, VSP spent around Rs. 6,584 per tonne. “This clearly indicates that VSP had incurred an additional expenditure on iron ore to the tune of Rs. 4,188 per tonne, for not having its own captive mines. This additional expenditure could have easily been converted to profit for the plant,” explained Mr. Narasinga Rao. Bad investment For the last two decades, in an attempt to get mines, VSP had submitted 28 applications, including seven to Andhra Pradesh and others to seven other States such as Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. But they had fallen on deaf years and to add misery to the fate of VSP, it was made to buy stakes in the Bird Group of Companies that has holdings on mines belonging to OMDC, by investing Rs. 361 crores of its hard-earned money, said a senior executive from VSP. The mines were under legal tangle due to renewal of licences and it is still to wriggle out. Moreover, VSP was forced to pay another Rs. 500 crore as penalty for damage to environment, for which it was not responsible and till date not single ore of iron was transshipped to the plant from those mines, said Mr. Narasinga Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/allocating-captive-mines-best-solution-for-revival-vsp-staff/article34137334.ece
23 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Strictly adhere to safety norms, Collector appeals to people||District Collector V. Vinay Chand has appealed to all people to strictly adhere to the COVID-19 protocols in view of growing number of cases in the district. He directed the medical officials to create awareness among the people in this regard. The Collector held elaborate discussions with the medical officials on the conduct of tests, data entry, release of test results, treatment of positive patients, hospital beds, availability of PPE kits, sanitisers, masks and pulse oximeters. He directed District Medical and Health Officer Suryanarayana to arrange distribution of pamphlets on the safety precautions needed to be taken to prevent spread of the pandemic all over the district. Those over 45 years of age and suffering from health issues like diabetes and high BP should get themselves vaccinated. The vaccination can be availed at all government hospitals, PHCs and CHCs in the district, he said. He directed the District Immunisation Officer to ensure that all government employees over 45 years of age, get themselves vaccinated. He also directed the DM & HO and the Deputy Director, Information and Public Relations Department, to ensure vaccination for journalists. He directed the medical and health officials to keep at least 900 beds ready at VIMS and KGH. He also directed the DM & HO to ask the medical officers of Anakapalle, Narsipatnam and Paderu Area Hospitals to be on the alert. Isolation wards should be invariably made available for patients. Mr. Vinay Chand said that vaccination was compulsory in view of the increase in number of cases. He suggested that the idea of imposing fines on those coming out of their homes without masks could be considered. Andhra Medical College Principal P.V.

23 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Think tank bats for use of IoT in fisheries to spur growth||The Centre for Strategy and Leadership (CSL), a leading Indian think tank, has released a White Paper on the adoption of modern digital technologies to spur growth of the fisheries sector in the country. This they say will come in handy for the large fishing community in Visakhapatnam. The paper – IoT in the fisheries sector in India – discusses the importance of new technologies for India to realise optimal green growth in the ﬁsheries sector. It focuses on how technologies like IoT optimise management of scarce resources and increase productivity. The fisheries sector provides livelihood to approximately 160 lakh people at the primary level and almost double that number along its entire value chain. India is the second largest ﬁsh producer in the world, contributing 5.43% to world fish production. Challenges The sector faces three major challenges: ensuring fishermen safety while out at sea, maintaining national security by monitoring international borders, and prioritising fisheries as a robust economic activity. Unless digitisation and advanced technology are deployed consistently, these challenges will remain barriers to productivity, growth and safety in the long term. “The IoT sector will boom to grow to a more than $20-billion market by 2022 as per studies. We believe India’s fisheries sector currently in the middle of a transformation would derive great benefits by the adoption of modern technologies such as IoT. Therefore, bringing IoT to the centre of the sector’s growth model should be prioritised,” Vikas Sharma, director and chief executive, CSL, said in a statement. The paper also points out that disruptive technologies, such as those being provided by Skylo, the affordable end-to-end solution connecting machine and sensor data via satellite, are critical to meeting the demands of fishermen, boat owners and regulators as industries innovate. At the heart of the transformation is access to data and cloud-based analytics for unconnected fishing vessels and aquafarms, according to Parthsarathi Trivedi, co-founder and CEO of Skylo. The paper suggests that all value-chain stakeholders need to be involved in the decision-making process, from fishermen to boat owners to government organizations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/think-tank-bats-for-use-of-iot-in-fisheries-to-spur-growth/article34137338.ece

23 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Media has to play a key role in preventing VSP sale, says Amar||Media is a part of the society and it has to fight for the cause of upholding the rights of common people, said National Media Adviser to the State government Devulapalli Amar. He was speaking at a meeting organised by the AP Union of Working Journalists (APUWJ) in association with Media Education Foundation at Andhra University here on Monday. Mr. Amar said that saving the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) from privatisation was important and if the media does not play an active role, the Central government would have its way, with little opposition from the public. He recalled how as a high school student, he heard about the agitation for VSP and the death of 32 persons in it. The lack of response from civil society was emboldening the Centre to disregard dissenting voices, he said. The Chief Minister wrote twice to the Prime Minister seeking the continuation of VSP in the public sector and had even suggested alternatives, Mr. Amar said. Visakha Ukku Porata Committee convener Ayodhya Ram said that the agitation would be intensified further with the involvement of all political parties, except BJP, in the State. Indian Journalists’ Union executive member Alapati Suresh said that lack of civil society response to issue concerning the State was emboldening the Centre to have their way in the State. INTUC leader Gandham Venkata Rao said that unlike private companies which were defaulting repayment of loans to public sector banks, the VSP had paid taxes and dividends to the Centre. APUWJ State president I.V. Subba Rao presided. CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy, a former member of the UPSC K.S. Chalam and IJU representative Nalli Dharma Rao were among those who spoke. Indian Journalists' Union (IJU) president K.

He had created a flutter by leaving a suicide note in the logbook at the end of this night shift at the wire rod mill, in the plant on Saturday morning. He had left the note stating that he would commit suicide by jumping into one of the blast furnaces in the plant, in protest against the Centre’s decision of 100% strategic sale of the VSP. He has gone missing since then and the police after investigation has found that he had fraudulently collected about Rs. 2 crore from a number of job seekers. A senior police officer said that Rao has been leading a lavish lifestyle and this indicates that he has been indulging in some fraudulent activities. The police are also verifying the bank accounts of Rao, as some duped youth have told that they had deposited the amount in Rao’s account.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-intensify-search-for-steel-plant-employee/article34137424.ece

23 March 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||COVID shadow looms over temple festival||The recent surge in COVID-19 cases in some parts of the neighbouring States amid fears over a second wave of the pandemic has cast a shadow on the grand plans of the authorities to conduct Sri Sitarama Tiru Kalyana Mahotsavam at the historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam on an elaborate scale on April 21. The annual fete of the “celestial wedding” attracts hordes of devotees from different corners of the State as well as neighbouring States, including Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, on the occasion of Sri Rama Navami every year. Last year, the pandemic has taken sheen off the mega religious event as the celestial wedding was performed inside the temple complex. At a high-level meeting presided over by Collector M. V. Reddy in Kothagudem in February this year, an elaborate action plan was mooted to conduct the celestial wedding in a befitting manner in conformity to the COVID-19 safety norms at the historic shrine on April 21. The online sale of sector-wise tickets for Sri Sitarama Tiru Kalyana Mahotsavam and Maha Pattabishekam, slated for April 21 and 22 respectively, had already begun through the temple website. The sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in the neighbouring States has left the authorities perplexed over the imminent tough task of implementing the COVID-19 safety protocols during the ensuing mega religious congregation. “We are making all necessary arrangements to conduct the annual religious fete as per the schedule,” Executive Officer of the Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple at Bhadrachalam Sivaji said. When asked about the venue of the ensuing “celestial wedding”, he told The Hindu that they were awaiting the final nod from the State government on this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-19-shadow-looms-over-temple-festival/article34137072.ece

23 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Harish Rao rebuts Congress, BJP views on borrowings||Minister for Finance T. Harish Rao said that the Opposition Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have tried to mislead the House and the people by speaking out only the selective information about the Budget estimates and not the complete picture. In his reply to the discussion on General Budget and the Annual Financial Statement for 2021-22 in the Assembly on Monday, the Minister said the two parties had tried to paint even the temporary borrowings from the RBI, in the form of fixed deposit receipts/special drawing facility, ways and means and overdraft, as the debt. However, the fact remains that such borrowings were adjusted (cut) immediately by the RBI from the current account of the State government as when it receives funds every month, he explained. “Although such an attempt to paint a wrong picture was expected from new member M. Raghunandan Rao (BJP), but it was not expected from a seasoned legislator like M. Bhatti Vikramarka (Congress). Such borrowings were also mentioned in the budget books as the floating debt and for 2019-20 it amounted to Rs. 37,247.59 crore,” Mr. Harish Rao said. Giving further clarity on the State’s borrowings, the Minister stated that it was the RBI that would decide the quantum and any State would not be allowed to have their way indiscriminately. “Telangana is in the fourth position from bottom in terms of borrowings — GSDP versus percentage of debt — with 22.8%, while the Congress-ruled State of Punjab was third from the top with 38.7% borrowings of its GSDP and Rajasthan was in eighth position with 34.7%.” Similarly, Chhattisgarh was in the 18th position from top and Telangana was at 25th place even after the increased FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) from 3% of GSDP to 5% of GSDP, the Minister said. Besides, the borrowings of corporations with the State as the guarantor was also not part of the debt as they were repaid by the agency concerned — like the Civil Supplies Corporation repaying loans borrowed for paddy procurement after getting the money from FCI following supply of rice. On sourcing of revenue during 2021-22, the Minister said the government was planning to mobilise about Rs. 16,000 crore through sale of lands and disposal of other non-performing assets such as Rajiv Swagruha units and Housing Board lands. New mining policy would also be brought to improve revenue through auction of mines. Asking the BJP members to pursue release of funds due to Telangana from the Centre if they were sincere about the State’s development instead of making allegations, Mr. Harish Rao said Telangana would have received a total of Rs. 28,225 crore had the Centre accepted NITI Aayog recommendations and dues of Finance Commission and Backward Regions Grant funds. Besides, Central devolution to State was down by Rs. 24,000 crore for the five-year period following the 15th Finance Commission recommendations. However, the same Centre was sitting on other recommendations of 15th FC such as sector-specific grant of Rs. 3,024 crore and State-specific grant of Rs. 2,350 crore to Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/harish-rao-rebuts-congress-bjp-views-on-debt-borrowings-by-state/article34137119.ece
23 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Hyderabad’s bowlis now in revival mode||Gachibowli, Rethibowli, Doodhbowli, Putlibowli, Gangabowli, Haribowli, Hathibowli, Enginebowli… the names remain while the bowlis, meaning wells, have mostly disappeared in the city. But a new consciousness towards heritage and water is changing the way citizens see the age old step-wells in the city. A few days back, Principal Secretary MA&UD Arvind Kumar tweeted a photograph of a private stepwell cleaned up with the help of the department in Gudimalkapur area. “Bhagwandas Baoli is cleaned by @HMDA_Gov. We will be lighting it up one of these days to enable photography by heritage/baoli lovers (will keep informed). Requesting citizens in the neighbourhood to ensure cleanliness and be a watchdog for anyone throwing garbage,” tweeted the urban development czar. “Hyderabad was dotted with bowlis but they were filled up before my time. Putlibowli got its name as there was a marble statue near it and people chose the name. Doodhbowli got its name as milkmen from outskirts would reach the well to sell their milk near Fateh Darwaza in the Old City. It is time we save whatever heritage we can save,” says Oudesh Rani Bawa who grew up in the Gowlipura area. At the foothills of Maula Ali Ashoorkhana, two step-wells inside the Mah Laqa Bai Chanda’s maqbara are still in use after they were restored nearly 10 years back. In the step well of Balaji Temple in Pahadi Shareef a new addition to age-old temple is the idol of Lord Krishna. The massive step well inside the Sitarambagh Temple in the eponymous area has become a tourist attraction besides fulfilling its role of supplying water to the temple. The step well attached to the Amapalli Sri Rama Temple in Ammapalli with its covered corridors on its side has been a preferred spot for film shootings over the past few years. One of the exciting discoveries has been a stepwell inside the Bapughat premises. The restoration of the step well has been going on apace. As the city marks World Water Day it is appropriate that its legacy of water heritage going back centuries is being protected and restored in a small way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hyderabads-bowlis-now-in-revival-mode/article34137132.ece
23 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Plea to expedite work on historic temples||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has requested Union Minister of Tourism and Culture Prahlad Singh Patel to instruct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for the timely completion of the ancient Thousand Pillar and Ramappa temples in the erstwhile Warangal district as the two restoration works have been going on for long. In a letter addressed to the Union Minister on March 20, TRS MLC from Warangal Local Authorities’ Constituency, Pochampally Srinivas Reddy brought to the former’s notice that the restoration work on the Thousand Pillar temple taken up by ASI was going on for over decade now, although it was scheduled to be completed in 18 months when it was taken up in 2005. He explained that Warangal is the second largest and fastest growing city in Telangana and is also a historical city with several heritage assets and as the capital of the Kakatiya dynasty. It has several tourist attractions such as Thousand Pillar temple built by the Kakatiyas dedicated to Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu and Lord Surya, the Bhadrakali temple and the Warangal Fort, dating backing to the 13th century. Similarly, the Ramappa temple dedicated to Lord Shiva is located 77 km away from Warangal. Recognising the importance of the monuments in Warangal, the Ministry of Urban Development has included the city in the Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) scheme to maintain the heritage sites. The Thousand Pillar temple under ASI is among the tentative list of World Heritage sites of UNESCO. Located in the heart of Warangal, the erstwhile capital of the region during the Kakatiya rule, the Thousand Pillar temple was constructed between 1175 and 1324 AD following the orders of Kakatiya king Rudra Deva. It is considered a masterpiece and its foundation was constructed using the sandbox technique. It was desecrated by the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century after the it area was brought under its direct control. The temple was profaned by the rulers of the Tughlaq Dynasty during their invasion of the Deccan region and was destroyed partially. It was restored by ASI in 2004. The Natya Madapam in the south of the temple complex was dismantled by the ASI in 2005 for reconstruction for completing the work in 18 months, the discouragingly slow pace of work is keeping it incomplete even after 15 years, Mr. Srinivas Reddy noted in his letter. Similarly, the Ramappa temple, standing majestically on a six-feet high star-shaped platform, included in the tentative list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 2019. Several smaller structures in the complex including the entrance arch and Kameshwara temple are in ruins and the ASI is trying the restore the later after dismantling it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/plea-to-expedite-work-on-historic-temples/article34137390.ece
23 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Exotic aquarium fish species threatening lake biodiversity||Discovery of a fish species called Alligator gar in Neknampur Lake has set the alarm bells ringing for the biodiversity of city lakes. An NGO ‘Dhruvansh’, which has adopted the Neknampur Lake, has discovered three dead members of the fish species in the lake and raised concerns about the same, because they are not native to India. “These fish are not found in Indian rivers and lakes. They are grown for aquariums, and when they become too big to handle, people leave them in lakes,” said conservationist and lake activist Madhulika Choudhary, the founder of Dhruvansh. Alligator gar are naturally found in North America, and brought here for sale as aquarium species. They can grow up to several feet in length, which eventually makes them unfit for aquariums. That is when the owners and aquarists, unable to house them and feed them any more, leave them in city lakes. “We found three, because they are dead. We don’t know how many such fish have been left in the lake. They are predatory in nature, and can wipe out the entire lake of its biodiversity,” says Ms.Choudhary. Farida Tampal, State Director of WWF-India, says aquarium species being left in city lakes has become a menace of late. “I have come across an instance where an Alligator gar was left inside the Lotus Pond. There is no control over which kind of fish are being brought from outside and where they are being left. Evidence suggests that even extremely predatory species such as Piranhas which are being grown by aquarists here,” Ms.Tampal says. Another invasive species which is being found in city lakes is the Red eared terrapin/turtle. “A member of this species was found in Neknampur Lake earlier. They are aggressive in nature and kill other pond turtles such as pond terrapins and flapshell turtles. Exotic species are dangerous for native ones. If you can’t care for them, why do you keep them,” asks Ms.Choudhary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/exotic-aquarium-fish-species-threatening-lake-biodiversity/article34137115.ece
23 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||To hold or not to hold classes||Schools in the city have been caught flat-footed as COVID-19 cases have again surged with some schools switching back to online classes while others are persisting with classroom learning. “As a precautionary measure classes will be held online and physical classes will resume from May 5 as two of our students and their family members have tested positive,” read a message sent out by a school to parents in the third week of March. Sudden shift Then there was a well-known public school in Nacharam that suddenly shifted to online classes. “We heard two days ago that a Class X student tested positive for COVID-19. The school, however, intimated us that fewer students are opting for physical classes so they will conduct only online classes,” says a parent whose ward studies in that particular school. “We don’t know the exact number of cases in the residential coaching centre but we brought our daughter home as we cannot take any risk,” said another parent whose child studies at a residential coaching school in Miyapur which has 500 students on its rolls. Another school in Bolarum has been hit hard after three teachers in the humanities section reportedly tested positive for the virus. The school had conducted a practical exam a day prior to the teacher testing positive. “At 5:56 a.m. on March 16, a message was sent out cancelling the History practical and students were asked to self-isolate because the teacher had tested positive for COVID,” says a person in the know of the affairs at the reputed school. Exam schedule Another school in Bandlaguda area now has four students who have tested positive but the school is carrying on with its regular classes and practical exams. The schools have a little leeway given that the Central Board of Secondary Education has announced the schedule for the exams as well as practicals. While a majority of reports has linked clusters of COVID to government-run or residential schools, students in private schools have been asked to lie low. Many parents were wary of sharing information about the outbreaks in schools for fear of reprisal action by school managements. This reporter could confirm about students and teachers getting affected by the virus in four schools based on communication by the institutions.  At 5:56 a.m. on March 16, a message was sent out cancelling the History practical exam because the teacher at a Bolarum school had tested positive for COVID.

23 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State to increase RT-PCR tests||The State government has decided to increase the number of RT-PCR tests along with increasing testing in general. The decision was taken at a meeting held by Health Minister Eatala Rajender with Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and Principal Secretary of Health department Syed Ali Murtaza Rizvi at the Secretariat on Monday to take stock of the COVID situation in the State. At present, the Health department does not mention details of the number of RT-PCR tests conducted per day in daily media bulletins. Health teams use Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) and RT-PCR tests to detect if someone has coronavirus. While results of RAT tests are made available within a few hours of collecting the sample, it takes one to two days to receive results of the later. Earlier, senior Health officials had said that people opting for government healthcare facilities can choose between RAT and RT-PCR tests. From March 15, over 60,000 samples are being put to test on a daily basis. A majority of the samples are examined in government health facilities. ‘Keep hospitals ready’ Another decision that was taken at Monday’s meeting was to keep the hospitals prepared for a surge in patient admissions if the cases were to increase further. Arrangements would be made in COVID-19 wards of Gandhi Hospital and the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences. While claiming that COVID cases in the State were under control, the Health Minister has directed Mr Rizvi to make available the required number of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, N95 masks, and medicines used in treatment of the infectious disease. For the past four days, over 300 cases are being detected per day. Mr Rajender has urged people to maintain COVID-appropriate behaviour such as wearing mask, regularly sanitising or washing hands, maintaining physical distance, and stepping out of home only when necessary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-to-increase-rt-pcr-tests/article34137107.ece

23 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP accuses TRS of electoral malpractices||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday has demanded an independent probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to look into the ‘electoral malpractices including payment of money to voters through mobile digital channels’ in the recent elections to the MLC graduate constituencies for the Legislative Council. Senior leader N. Ramchander Rao in a petition to the Election Commission (EC) complained that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) had resorted to ‘enrolment of bogus voters’ and also ‘distribution of money through digital channels’ during the just concluded elections. He reminded that the BJP has made a complaint earlier about ‘vested interest groups’ indulging in enrolling voters for MLC graduate constituencies on the basis of submission of fake certificate of degrees/diplomas. The party had requested for the certificates uploaded to the universities concerned for verification and thereafter publish the draft list for objections, to ensure free and fair elections. However, “for reasons inexplicable, it was not done, and so many bogus votes with fake certificates were enrolled” and it has affected winning chances of the party candidates like him, he alleged. He also charged that the TRS party members had grossly violated the provision of law transporting “every voter from the villages and even urban areas to the polling station”. His own election agent got a call enquiring about transport requirement from a TRS representative, he pointed out. The BJP leader accused that digital mobile pay channels were used to pay money of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 5,000 to entice the voters. The EC should also seek a report from the Returning Officer concerned about the electoral malpractices, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-accuses-trs-of-electoral-malpractices-in-mlc-poll/article34137121.ece

They were accused in the sensational kidnapping case of two brothers from Bowenpally, reported in January. Earlier, Bhargav Ram’s parents — Murali Nath Naidu and Kiram Mai — got two sureties from Allagadda in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, however, they had criminal cases against them. “They brought only two persons as sureties for four of them, whereas the court had directed them to get two for each and it was rejected.

At a meeting to review progress of Palamuru-Rangareddy scheme for the second consecutive day on Monday, Mr. Rao explained several options to construct additional reservoirs and excavate canals for the purpose of integrating the projects. He asked officials to complete immediately survey of Atchampet lift-irrigation scheme and send the estimates of cost involved for administration sanction. A reservoir with a capacity of three tmc ft should be constructed and named Uma Maheswaram project. Water should be carried from there to Chandrasagar by canal en route Mannanur in Amrabad where another reservoir with a capacity of 1.4 tmc ft shoul be constructed. This reservoir should be named after Chenna Keshava in view of historical importance to the local area by that name. The survey for the reservoir should be completed immediately and foundation stone laid by May. The possibility of expanding the capacity of Koilsagar reservoir should explored. The capacity of Gattu reservoir should also be increased to three tmc ft. There was need to ease the pressure for water on Jurala from Bheema, Koilsagar and Nettempad projects.

The ultra-modern bus station spread over a plinth area of over 80,000 square feet and cellar parking area of over 30,000 square feet has a total of 30 platforms and all modern amenities for passengers and the TSRTC staff. Information Technology and Industries Minister K T Rama Rao will inaugurate the new bus station here on March 27, TSRTC sources said. The new bus station with state-of-the-art facilities is expected to provide hassle-free travel for the commuters and offer ample space for free movement of buses. The new bus station abutting the bypass road is poised to become a new landmark in Khammam, a major trade hub known for agri-business and considered as a gateway to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The new bus station was sanctioned with an estimated outlay of Rs. 25 crore by the State government in 2017 following persistent demands from denizens of the town for a spacious bus station in view of traffic congestion and space constraints at the existing old bus station near Mayuri Centre in the town. The old bus stand parirakshana committee comprising organisations representing farmers, labourers, petty vendors and others organised a string of programmes including a “Praja Ballot” in the past few weeks to press for continuation of the old bus stand as a “local bus stand” for the convenience of commuters from rural areas. Allaying the apprehensions over the fate of the old bus stand, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar made it clear that the old bus stand will be used as the TSRTC Kalyana Mandapam in public interest. Meanwhile, the members of the parirakshana committee staged a demonstration by holding placards here on Sunday opposing the move to convert the old bus stand into a Kalyana Mandapam. They insisted that the centrally located old bus station be retained for use as a local bus stand for public convenience even after the inauguration of the new bus station in view of the fast growing population of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ultra-modern-khammam-bus-station-all-set-for-inauguration/article34137388.ece

Addressing the demonstrators in front of the Collectorate, PDSU district president Azad said some areas in Bonakal, Mudigonda and Kamepalli mandals had witnessed fresh coronavirus cases in the last few days. “It is imperative to provide coronavirus testing facilities in all educational institutions and appoint ANMs in the hostels to effectively implement the preventive measures to keep the infection at bay," he emphasised. He demanded that the government provide masks and hand sanitisers to students attending physical classes in the State-run schools, colleges and residential educational institutions as a safety precaution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pdsu-seeks-better-covid-measures-for-students-safety/article34137366.ece
23 March 2021||MUTRAJPALLY (SIDDIPET DIST.),TELANGANA||Mutrajpally R&R colony yet to be ready||Heavy vehicles are seen moving around here with loads of concrete, cement and sand. Workers, numbering in scores, are busy with laying roads using machinery as construction of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement colony at Mutrajpally on the outskirts is going on at a brisk pace. The authorities plan to accommodate the oustees of Mallannasagar here. There are about eight villages – Vemulaghat, Etigaddakishtapur, Pallepahad, Rampur, Lakshmapur and Brahmana Banjerpallt in Toguta mandal and Singaram and Erravalli in Kodapaka mandal — that would get submerged in Mallannasagar. Already the oustees of Erravalli, Singaram, Rampur and Lakshmapur have vacated by their villages long back, but have not been accommodated so far as the construction is not complete. The authorities are yet to complete the construction of houses though it was announced in the past that about 6,000 houses would be built for the oustees. However, the officials later stated that they are constructing only 2,300 houses for them as some of the oustees asked for only plots in the colony and accepted Rs. 5.04 lakh for the construction of houses, offered by the government. During the course of land acquisition in 2016 from the oustees, officials had promised that within six months the housing project would be completed and they will be asked to vacate their homes only after the keys of new houses are handed over to them. But the reality is different: without completion of houses the oustees have been forced to vacate from Singaram and Erravalli villages. The oustees of other villages also fear being forced to leave without providing any accommodation. “Officials have repeatedly told us that we will be provided accommodation soon after vacating the village. We came here about three months ago and houses are not yet completed. We do not know how long it will take. It may take more than six months to accommodate all the oustees,” said an oustee from Errvalli, who was put up in temporary accommodation at Sangapur double bedroom houses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mutrajpally-rr-colony-yet-to-be-ready/article34137385.ece

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||Bringing the traditional Chindu Yakshaganam to centre stage||“Chindu Yakshaganam of Telangana is distinct, it is not as sophisticated and Sanskritized as the Yakshagana from Karnataka.,” points out renowned Telugu modern theatre personality Srinivas Denchanala. The founder-director of the 37-year-old Janapadam Theatre Repertory dons the director’s hat along with Chindula Shyam to presentt Chenchu Lakshmi , a Telangana Chindu Yakshaganam written by Chervirala Bagaiah. The live performance at Ravindra Bharathi on March 23 in collaboration with Department of Language and Culture, brings a ray of hope for the 20 participating artistes in the COVID-affected milieu. Though Chindu Yakshaganam has a cultural significance in Telangana, the theatre art form is dying slowly. The Chindu communitythat performs Yakshaganam, has a distinct perception of society. “They are radical performances of stories including mythology,” states Srinivas, adding, “Chindu artistes used to perform thousands of shows across Telangana, but now it has been reduced to a few hundred. Unfortunately, all folk/theatre forms are dying.”  Chenchu Lakshmi, a traditional dance ballet shows Lord Narasimha, who after killing the demon Hiranyakashipu falls in love with Chenchu Lakshmi, who has been raised in the forest for 16 years “What the consequences of this love story are, are enacted, danced, sung and narrated through Chindu Yakshaganam,” shares Srinivas. Being a contemporary theatre director, Srinivas has ‘rejuvenated’ the performance to suit the modern context. . “The artistes usually perform in small spaces in villages but we have used the larger stage space of Ravindra Bharati and also brought in slight changes in lights and sound,” he elaborates. Although the show is being staged four days prior to World Theatre Day on March 27, Srinivas calls it a ‘non-occasion performance.’ “Performance is itself an occasion to celebrate theatre every day,” he says in his inimitable style. Even before the pandemic hit, Srinivas notes, the situation had been challenging for Telugu theatre artistes. “Telugu theatre has suffered immensely due to the indifference of audience and the government in the two Telugu states; Unless the audience gets bored with commercial cinema, TV serials and a virtual lifestlye, a change in content for theatre like the plays Hayawadana by Girish Karnad and Macbeth by Shakespeare will not happen,” he points out. Srinivas has not been able to pay the rent of his company in Kukatpally for the past six months. “Government has very little or no funds for theatre and to encourage creative people,” he rues. He spent the lockdown period writing poetry, participating in seminars and reading plays with his group members. A recorded performance of Srinivas too was shown online, an experience he dislikes. “I hate online theatre,” he retorts. “I will beg or sing but will not do virtual theatre. Live performance gives strength to the artistes which is missing in digital theatre.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bringing-chindu-yakshaganam-to-centre-stage/article34137117.ece

Justice K. Lakshman, who recently heard the petition filed by the woman’s mother, directed the Cyber Crime wing of Cyberabad police to explain by March 30 what action was taken by it to get the online content deleted. Mother of a five-year-old kid, the woman lives in Australia with her husband. Recently, her family members came across her private photos on different social media platforms and in some porn websites. The woman’s mother living in Hyderabad approached the Cyber Crime police station of Hyderabad and lodged a complaint. Inquiries by the police revealed that a friend of the woman when she was in her teens had secured her intimate photos. When the woman eventually ended friendship with the friend, the latter posted the photos on social media platforms to harass her. Following a complaint lodged by her, the photos were removed from social media platforms in 2012. The woman got married and was living in Australia with her husband and kid when the photos resurfaced online in 2019. Justice K. Lakshman permitted the petitioner to approach the Union Ministry of Communications to file an application to take action as per law against the persons responsible. The judge directed some social media platform operators to file affidavits explaining the measures they had taken to safeguard the privacy of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/woman-moves-hc-to-get-online-photos-deleted/article34137130.ece
23 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Amarinder hits out at Kejriwal||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday hit out at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, dismissing allegations against the Congress government of failing to fulfil its poll promises. Trashing his Delhi counterpart’s allegations, Captain Singh said it was ridiculous to compare his government’s track record of over 84% promises implemented with the Delhi government’s ‘pathetic’ record of less than 25% of AAP’s 2015 manifesto commitments fulfilled in 2020. “If this is the Delhi model you (Mr. Kejriwal) are promising Punjab, then my people are better off without it,” he added. ‘Focus on Delhi’ “Instead of indulging in deceitful claims and talking of revenge, Mr. Kejriwal should focus on Delhi, which is still waiting for him to fulfil even 50% of his poll promises,” he said. He said, “Unlike Delhi’s voters, those in Punjab are not deceived by such hyperbole and have trust in their own eyes and in what they can see on the ground.” It was a matter of record, said Capt. Amarinder, that despite Delhi Congress leader Ajay Maken’s repeated questioning on the issue, the AAP government had failed to show its progress on its 8 lakh jobs’ promise of 2015. Even the much-touted Delhi Skill Mission had failed to take off, he pointed out. Capt. Amarinder added that as per figures listed in one of the analysis, the Delhi government had given jobs to 102 people in 2016, 66 people in 2017 and 46 people until April 2018. “In contrast, the government in Punjab had provided 16.29 lakh jobs, self-employment opportunities under the Ghar Ghar Rozgar Mission, with a whopping 58,709 in the government sector alone.” “Apparently, your Punjab leaders failed to give you correct inputs before you came to Punjab, or perhaps they deliberately misled you,” he said. Capt. Amarinder also accused Mr. Kejriwal of not ensuring COVID-appropriate behaviour during the rally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/amarinder-hits-out-at-kejriwal/article34136998.ece

23 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||BJP, JJP leaders fear boycott, says Congress||As Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal ‘virtually’ inaugurated various projects worth several crores of rupees across the State, the Congress on Monday said the BJP leaders were not venturing out in fear of facing the “reality among masses”. In the backdrop of the Centre’s agricultural laws, farmer outfits have announced that all legislators, including those from the BJP, the Jannayak Janta Party and the Independents who support the laws, will be boycotted and will not be allowed entry into villages across the State. State Congress chief Kumari Selja said, “People are angry and fearing their backlash, the BJP-JJP leaders are afraid of venturing out. That is why the CM inaugurated several projects through videoconferencing. The BJP-JJP leaders are scared of facing the reality as they know they have adopted an anti-people stance.” Mr. Lal had on Sunday inaugurated development projects worth Rs. 1,411 crore, including education, health, sports, road connectivity, water, power. The Chief Minister, during a State-level programme held through videoconferencing, inaugurated and laid foundation stones of as many as 163 projects in 22 districts. “There’s another reason — the BJP-JJP government has failed to fulfil its promises and their leaders realise that they can’t face the people,” added Ms. Selja. Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the performance of the State government had been nil over the years. “Due to the anti-people and anti-farmers polices and decisions, they are now not in a position to face the public,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-jjp-leaders-fear-boycott-says-congress/article34137001.ece

23 March 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan brings private medical colleges within RTI Act’s purview||The private medical colleges in Rajasthan have been brought within the purview of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, following an order of the State Information Commission, which has imposed a fine of Rs. 25,000 on the principal of Geetanjali Medical College in Udaipur for flouting the transparency law and refusing to provide information. Allowing an appeal against the medical college, the Information Commission held in its recent order that the State government had allotted land to the institution at concessional rates and the college was established under a law passed by the State Legislature. “Based on these facts, the college falls within the purview of the RTI Act. The college is governed by the rules and regulations framed by the State government,” Information Commissioner Narayan Bareth said. He imposed the fine on the principal for refusing to provide information sought by an applicant.  First-of-its-kind order The Commission’s first-of-its-kind order has paved the way for citizens to seek information under the RTI Act from the educational institutions which have obtained land for their buildings and campuses at concessional rates from the State government. The appellant, Gopal Kansara from Rajsamand district, had filed his plea with the Commission, pointing out that Geetanjali Medical College had not attached any importance to his RTI application filed on August 7, 2019, seeking information on his nephew’s admission. Despite the Commission issuing notices three times with the warning of action under the RTI Act, the college did not respond. Mr. Kansara submitted the documents pertaining to allotment of land to the college and the legislation having been passed by the State Assembly. He also cited a judgment of the Supreme Court in the D.A.V. College case, holding that the institutions like schools, colleges and hospitals which received “substantial aid” from the government in the form of land at discounted rate were bound to give information to the citizens under the RTI Act. The Information Commission accepted the appellant’s contention that the non-government organisations receiving financing from the government were a public authority under the provisions of the RTI Act. While imposing penalty on the principal, the Commission directed the college to provide information on its decision and action taken on six points raised by the RTI applicant within the stipulated time frame.

23 March 2021||Mumbai,||COVID-19-hit Deshmukh could not have met Vaze, says Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar on Monday said the allegations made against his party colleague and Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh were to possibly divert the ongoing investigation into the explosive material found outside the house of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. Mr. Pawar said as per the letter of former Mumbai Commissioner of Police Param Bir Singh, Mr. Deshmukh met API Sachin Vaze at his official residence around mid-February. “It has been brought to my notice that Mr. Deshmukh was detected COVID-19 positive in February and got discharged from hospital on February 15 and advised home quarantine between February 15 and 27,” Mr. Pawar said. “Mr. Singh has mentioned that around mid-February, the Home Minister called Mr. Vaze at his official residence and gave instructions to him as alleged in the letter. But it is absolutely clear that Mr. Deshmukh was in Nagpur and in home isolation during that particular time,” he said, adding that he recollected meeting Mr. Singh in the second week of March. “The important thing to keep in mind here is that he mentioned all these things when he got to know about his transfer,” Mr. Pawar said. In a series of tweets, he said, “I honestly feel that the main issue here is the case of SUV with gelatin sticks found near Shri Ambani’s house. I got to know that the ATS has arrested two people in connection with this case and is investigating their involvement in the assassination of late Mansukh Hiren. The main case here was not the allegations made by former CP but that of the matter where gelatin sticks were found in a Scorpio vehicle outside Shri Ambani’s residence and Mansukh Hiren murder case” Mr. Pawar said the investigation would continue and truth would come out. “It is a possibility that the allegations were made to divert this entire investigation,” he said. Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis was quick to counter the claim, saying Mr. Deshmukh had held a press conference on February 15 in Nagpur. In a statement, Mr. Deshmukh said, “On the day of my discharge from hospital, several journalists were waiting outside. Due to weakness, I chose to sit on a chair and answered their questions. After that, I went to my home in Nagpur where I was quarantined from February 15 to 27.” He said his first official meeting after the illness was on February 28 at Mumbai’s Sahyadri guest house.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/covid-19-hit-deshmukh-could-not-have-met-vaze-says-pawar/article34137200.ece
23 March 2021||Mumbai,||No question of Home Minister resigning: Cong.||The Maharashtra Congress on Monday said that there was no question of a minister resigning just because a police officer had made allegations against him. The party also raised questions on why former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh was not willing to probe the death of Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha MP Mohan Delkar, who had named the Union Territory’s administrator in a note. “There is no question of Home Minister Anil Deshmukh resigning. How can anyone resign just because certain officer makes an allegation?” Revenue Minister and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat asked. Mr. Thorat said that senior party leadership from Delhi held talks with State party leaders over the developments after a letter from Mr. Singh making allegations against Mr. Deshmukh became public. In a statement issued by party’s Maharashtra in-charge H.K. Patil, he said that Mr. Thorat and Public Works Department Minister Ashok Chavan would speak to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the latter would take the final call in the matter. The Congress, however, highlighted Mr. Singh’s mention of Delkar’s death and his reluctance to probe the matter. “We have never heard of such excuse. If a crime has occurred in Mumbai, then it is the responsibility of the local police to investigate it. How can anyone deny that?” Mr. Thorat said. Delkar in his suicide note had named Praful K. Patel, administrator of Dadara and Nagar Haveli. Mr. Patel, a former Home Minister of Gujarat, is known as a close aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/no-question-of-home-minister-resigning-cong/article34137194.ece
23 March 2021||Mumbai,||BJP: Governor must send a factual report to President||The Maharashtra unit of the BJP on Monday said the party would meet Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Wednesday to request him to send a factual report to the President regarding the developments following the letter by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh accusing Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of demanding Rs. 100 crore per month. “Allegations levelled against Mr. Deshmukh are extremely serious in nature. These need to be probed by a Supreme Court or High Court judge or by the CBI. The Governor should seek a detailed report from the Chief Minister and send it to the President after verifying it,” senior leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said. Mr. Mungantiwar said as per Mr. Singh’s letter, he had informed the CM at his official residence Varsha in the presence of NCP chief Sharad Pawar and senior members of the State Cabinet. “It is seen that the Chief Minister is incapable of taking action against the minister and the officer. He has not even bothered to issue a statement regarding the allegations.” Referring to the report sent to the President in September 1980 when the Sharad Pawar-led Progressive Democratic Front government was in power leading to the Centre imposing President’s rule, he said a similar situation exists today. He however said the party is not demanding President’s rule but only a factual report to the President.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-governor-must-send-a-factual-report-to-president/article34137198.ece
23 March 2021||Mumbai,||Arnab, Partho exchanged only friendly chats, HC told||The WhatsApp chats between Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and former Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) CEO Partho Dasgupta were merely chats between two very close friends that had nothing to do with Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation, Mr. Goswami’s lawyer told the Bombay High Court on Monday. The submission was made by senior advocate Ashok Mundargi, the counsel for Mr. Goswami and ARG Outlier Media, the company that runs all Republic TV channels. Mr. Mundargi was responding to the court’s query on what was the most clinching evidence cited by the Mumbai Police Crime Branch in the chargesheet in the TRP scam. “The highest evidence is these chats. However, please go through the entire chats because the police have taken these chats out of context to build their case,” Mr. Mundargi said. He then read out some of the WhatsApp chats between Mr. Goswami and Mr. Dasgupta, and told the court that the two had merely been discussing some “persons, market trends” etc. “These chats were between two very close friends. There is nothing, not one text, or one message, which shows that TRP manipulation was discussed. They were discussing topics that two friends might ordinarily discuss,” Mr. Mundargi said. A Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and Manish Pitale then asked if, as CEO of BARC, Mr. Dasgupta had helped “tweak” the TRP in favour of Republic TV to help Mr. Goswami. Mr. Mundargi responded saying while that was the police’s case, they had not established the same in the two chargesheets filed in the case. Mr. Mundargi was making his submissions on the pleas filed by Mr. Goswami and ARG Outlier Media seeking several reliefs in the TRP scam case. The main concern is that the police had filed two chargesheets but were yet to name Mr. Goswami and several other employees of ARG Outlier Media as accused in the case, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/arnab-partho-exchanged-only-friendly-chats-hc-told/article34137195.ece

The ATS last week arrested suspended policeman Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gaur in the case. The SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house had been allegedly stolen from Hiren’s possession. According to the ATS, Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze, now suspended and in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), has emerged as the prime accused in the Hiren case. “Mr. Shinde was taken to Retibunder area near Mumbra creek where Hiren’s body was found (on March 5),” an ATS official said. “Also, our team travelled to Ahmedabad and detained a man from whom the accused had got SIM cards for use in the crime and also seized some of the cards,” he added.

23 March 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Collector identifies 17 ‘wetlands’ in Raigad||After complaints from environment activists, Raigad Collector Nidhi Chaudhary has identified 17 natural water bodies to be treated as wetlands in the district, including those which need to be protected and conserved. Ms. Chaudhary was informed about the complaints of wetlands being destroyed at a divisional commissioner meeting. “First we sent notices to the CIDCO and JNPT, and since there were no response from them, after verifying that some of the places under their jurisdiction fall under the definition of wetland, we sent a communique to the government,” Ms. Chaudhary said. In response to a letter from the State Environment Department to identify wetlands as per the wetland atlas, Ms. Chaudhary in her communique said that some water bodies under the JNPT or CIDCO should be notified as wetlands. “Whether it is a natural or man-made pond, the fact that it falls under the definition of wetland, is enough, and it should be protected,” she said. B.N. Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation, who has been following up the issue, said, “The letter vindicates our stand. Moreover, the list prepared by the Collector on the basis of the tehsildar’s ground report does not mention the areas of the individual wetlands. This is essential to prevent vested interests from shrinking the water bodies with landfill and then claim that these do not fit into the definition of wetland.” A Supreme Court order stipulates protection of water bodies above 2.25 hectares, he pointed out. Of the wetlands identified in Uran, the ones at Sheva and Karal are under the JNPT and they are permanent freshwater marshes and shrub-dominated water bodies. “The JNPT refused to treat them as wetlands. Two other water bodies at Khopte and Bori BK are mangrove wetlands, and they must be protected,” Mr. Kumar said. Ms. Choudhari’s letter also identified two wetlands each in Pimpli and Kharghar and one each in Taloja, Morave, Jui, Kutukbandhan and Sonkhar, brushing aside the CIDCO argument that these do not fit into the wetland atlas code, he said. CIDCO and JNPT officials could not be reached for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/collector-identifies-17-wetlands-in-raigad/article34137197.ece
23 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘AAP is in talks with opposition parties to defeat NCT Bill in RS’||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders on Monday said they are in talks with opposition parties to make sure that the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, will not be passed in the Upper House of Parliament. AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has sent a letter to the Rajya Sabha Chairman requesting him to direct the Centre to withdraw the Bill, which Mr. Singh said “violates” Constitutional provisions. He added that he opposed the introduction of the Bill in the Rajya Sabha. Building consensus Party insiders said AAP has been building consensus against the Bill with other political parties. These included national players such as the Indian National Congress as well as State parties like the Trinamool (TMC) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), among others. “This Bill is an assault on the federal structure of the country and the party is reaching out to other political entities via this plank,” said a senior AAP leader. “Several parties such as the TMC and RJD have publicly expressed their support for AAP on the issue and have criticised the BJP-led Centre for introducing the Bill,” the leader added. Sources said Mr. Singh was part of the party’s outreach to oppose the Bill. The Bill was approved by the Union Cabinet on February 4, but the AAP has organised only one major protest (on March 17) against the legislation till now. “We have opposed the Bill at every stage. On the day we held the protest at Jantar Mantar our workers were beaten up in Uttar Pradesh by the police for protesting against the Bill,” a party insider said, adding: “On Monday, TMC, Shiv Sena and other parties opposed the Bill in the Lok Sabha. The entire Opposition was united. The Bill is a brazen attempt to kill democracy.” When asked whether AAP would approach the courts against the Bill, he said, “The party will explore all options to oppose the Bill. Right now, it is in Parliament. Strategy meeting “We have been opposing the Bill, but the party’s image also gets affected if it keeps fighting with the Centre. We were trying to send the Bill to a select committee,” another leader said. There was a meeting at party chief Arvind Kejriwal’s house on Monday night to discuss the party’s strategy against the Bill, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-in-talks-with-opposition-to-fight-gnctd-bill-in-rajya-sabha/article34136991.ece

Schools of specialised excellence will provide the right platform for our children to nurture their talent and excel in areas of their specialised interests,” Mr. Sisodia said. ‘Correct environment’ He added that these schools hold the potential to serve as examples of how providing the correct environment and opportunities to students can catapult them from even the most marginalised backgrounds to great heights of success in various fields. These schools will be choice-based and cover Classes 9 to 12 — the last four years in the 5+3+3+4 framework of schooling introduced by the New Education Policy (NEP), 2020. The Delhi government said these schools will focus on providing holistic and experiential learning opportunities in order to empower students to achieve their highest potential.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cabinet-approves-setting-up-100-schools-of-specialised-excellence/article34136995.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong. asks govt. to give unemployment allowance||The Delhi Congress on Monday demanded that the Delhi government immediately constitute a Minimum Employment Guarantee Scheme for the urban poor, on the lines of MNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) and give unemployment allowance to the educated and other category of youth.  The party said that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a situation where a large number of youth are unemployed and with the number of cases continuing to rise, the scenario seems bleak in the near future. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar alleged that the rising crime graph in Delhi was directly connected to severe unemployment among the educated and other category of youth in the Capital. He added that the youth, in the absence of any meaningful employment, were taking to crime. “The Congress governments in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan have fulfilled their promises of giving financial support to people who were affected due to the pandemic, which can be emulated by the Delhi government,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-asks-govt-to-give-unemployment-allowance/article34136987.ece

Accusing the Chief Minister of shedding crocodile tears for the farmers, Mr. Bidhuri demanded that the Delhi government live up to promises made to the farmers of Delhi first and then talk about their welfare in other States at a protest staged by the BJP at Kanjhawala Deputy Commissioner’s office. BJP Delhi Pradesh Kisan Morcha president Vinod Sherawat, party members and local farmers were among who participated in the protest. “We will continue to protest against the indifferent attitude and stepmotherly treatment of the farmers by the Delhi government till their demands are met,” Mr. Bidhuri said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-making-false-promises-to-farmers-claims-bidhuri/article34136985.ece
23 March 2021||New Delhi,||Oppn. slams AAP govt. over new excise policy||The Congress and the BJP hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party government over changes to the excise policy announced on Monday. Reacting to the government’s decision to lower the legal drinking age from 25 to 21, and to privatise all liquor vends, the Delhi Congress said that the Capital was on its way to becoming a “Nashe Ki Rajdhani(Capital of intoxication)”. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said the move to privatise liquor vends will also open doors for spurious liquor. The Kejriwal-led government’s bid to mop up 20% more revenue from liquor sales will be a retrograde step as this will lead the youth of the Capital astray, he added. Defending the move as a blow to the liquor mafia, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Twitter: “Excise reforms announced today will act as a major blow to the liquor mafia in Delhi. The mafia will do everything to obstruct these reforms. AAP govt has ended mafia raj in many sectors like education, water, elect, health etc and we are committed to reforming this sector too [sic].” Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Assembly and BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the new policy was “wrong” and “arbitrary”. He said that it would turn Delhi into the “liquor capital” of the country and lead to a possible spike in crime rate. On lowering drinking age, Mr. Bidhuri said it was an unfortunate decision and would have an adverse impact on the youth. “It is unfortunate that the Kejriwal government is putting revenue ahead of the lives of residents,” he said, adding: “Thousands of government employees are involved in liquor trade. The government must ensure they are properly rehabilitated and no one is left jobless in hard times.” Party sources said BJP leaders will meet the L-G on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/city-will-turn-into-liquor-capital-congress-bjp/article34136986.ece

The accused has been identified as Rajesh Kumar Bhartiya, a resident of Nangloi. Complainant Harish Kumar along with 534 others told the police that an NGO — Target Welfare Association —, run by Bhartiya, used to distribute ration to its members. They said the NGO charged membership fee of Rs. 1,500 for distribution of ration for 15 months. It was further alleged that the NGO was operating at different places in Delhi. The complainant said the NGO was neither supplying the ration nor answering their phone calls. Bhartiya had fled off Rs. 8,02,500 collected through membership fees, the police said. “During probe, it was revealed that Bhartiya was the mastermind behind the racket. He was arrested from Nangloi on Friday,” said DCP (EOW) Mohammad Ali.

The successive Delhi governments have been asking for more powers and full Statehood. It is very unfortunate that instead of empowering the elected government of Delhi, the Centre has reduced the CM to a figurehead and the Delhi government to a disempowered one,” Mr. Abdullah told The Hindu . Ms. Mufti also criticised the move. She said it isn’t just disempowering a political rival or the federal structure but disempowerment of popular vote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bill-an-assault-on-federal-structure-omar-mufti/article34136992.ece
23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||China, Russia look to deepen ‘best’ ties||Russia’s relations with China were currently at “the best in their entire history”, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said as he began a key visit to China on Monday. The visit comes shortly after the March 19 China-U.S. dialogue in Alaska and follows the first leaders’ summit of the Quad — India, Australia, Japan and the U.S. — held virtually on March 12. Mr. Lavrov said in an interview with Chinese State media, ahead of his talks with his counterpart Wang Yi, that “the international situation is undergoing profound changes, with new centres of economic, financial and political influence growing stronger”. “However, these objective developments, which are leading to the formation of a truly multipolar and democratic world, are unfortunately being hindered by Western countries, particularly the United States,” he said, adding that “they seek to continue to dominate at any cost on global economy and politics and impose their will and requirements on others”. “In response, Russia and China are promoting a constructive and unifying agenda and hope that the international governance system would be fair and democratic, run smoothly and be based on extensive interaction between countries and their integration initiatives,” the official Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying, adding that the “mutually trusting and respectful dialogue should serve as an example to other countries”. ‘Best in history’ “Current Russia-China relations are assessed both by our national leaders and citizens as the best in their entire history,” he said. “This is a well-deserved and fair assessment.” This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Treaty of Good-neighbourliness and Friendly Cooperation signed in July 2001, which Mr. Lavrov credited for deepening strategic relations and creating “a model of interaction between Russia and China that is absolutely free from any ideological constraints... of an intrinsic nature, not subject to any opportunistic factors nor against any third country.” Both countries are expected to discuss deepening coordination against the threat of sanctions from the West. Only on Monday, the EU imposed sanctions on four Chinese officials for human rights violations in Xinjiang, the first sanctions since the 1989 arms embargo. Mr. Lavrov called on both countries — permanent members of the UN Security Council — to work “under the UN framework on the immediate end to unilateral coercive measures” and to “take the opportunity to enhance their scientific and technological innovation and improve their national strength in response to the sanctions”. Trade ties are also on the agenda, with bilateral trade last year reaching $107 billion. China is Russia’s biggest trade partner. Li Yonghui, a Russia expert at the official Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in an article on Monday in the Communist Party-run Global Times that the China-Russia relationship could “counterbalance” the Quad. “Russia should not be ignored regarding its capabilities to offset the influence of Quad,” the commentary said, noting in particular Russia’s continuing close relations with India as a potential “destabilising factor” for the Quad’s potential. “India will not destroy its relations with Russia just because it wants to seek courtship with the U.S. to deal with China,” it said. “From this perspective, if Russia-India relations continue in a stable way, they will to some extent restrain India-US ties from further deepening.” Strategic triangle Ms. Li, in the commentary, noted that “as early as December 1998, then Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov expressed hope that Russia, China and India could establish a 'strategic triangle' that would be in the interests of peace and security”. “Currently, though China and India have undergone twists and turns in their relations due to border tensions, Russia still hopes that Beijing and New Delhi won’t engage in bigger problems,” she said. “Russia has actually played an active role between China and India. In other words, Russia has maintained relatively close ties with India, which has thereupon become a counterbalance to the so-called Quad group of the US, Japan, India and Australia.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-russia-look-to-deepen-best-ties/article34136658.ece
23 March 2021||Washington,||Amid migrant crisis, U.S. govt. pushes back||“The border is closed”: With those words, a top Biden administration official pushed back on Sunday against fast-mounting criticism that it has bungled immigration policy, spurring an influx of migrants in the biggest crisis to emerge under the new President. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the administration’s message to would-be border-crossers was simple: “Now is not the time to come. Do not come. The journey is dangerous. “We are building safe, orderly and humane ways to address the needs of vulnerable children,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” But with an estimated 15,000 migrant children or teenagers already in federal custody — roughly a third of them in facilities meant for adults — and with the United States on pace to see two million undocumented migrants arrive this year, the problem has become impossible to ignore. Mr. Biden himself vowed on Sunday to visit the border and said he was stepping up the message to migrants to stay home. “We’re in the process of doing it now, including making sure that we reestablish what existed before, which was — they can stay in place and make their case from their home country,” he told reporters. Bipartisan criticism Many Republicans, but also a growing number of Democrats, have criticised the administration’s border policies. Mr. Mayorkas insisted that the administration was doing everything it could to address the influx, but said the task was complicated by policies inherited from Donald Trump’s administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amid-migrant-crisis-us-govt-pushes-back/article34136661.ece
23 March 2021||Washington,||U.S. sanctions 2 Chinese officials for ‘rights abuses’||Days after the Biden administration held its first bilateral meeting with Beijing, the U.S. joined Canada, the U.K., and the European Union in imposing sanctions against two Chinese officials who it said had been involved in human rights abuses. The officials, Wang Junzheng, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), and Chen Mingguo, Director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (XPSB), were sanctioned for “serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities” in China’s Xinjiang province, the Treasury Department announced on Monday. The sanctions were applied under the U.S.’s Global Magnitsky Act, which means their U.S. assets, if any, will be frozen and U.S. entities are prohibited from doing business with them. Reports have emergedof human rights abuses, including torture, sexual abuse, forced sterilisation and indoctrination, as members of the Uighurs, mostly Muslims from Xinjiang, have been sent to internment camps for ‘re-education’. The U.S. has made a determination that China is committing genocide on the Uighurs. Both the XPCC and XPSB have been previously sanctioned by the U.S. “The  XPCC is a paramilitary organization in the XUAR that is subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and was designated on July 31, 2020, for its connection to serious human rights abuse. The XPCC enhances internal control over the region by advancing China’s vision of economic development in XUAR that emphasises subordination to central planning and resource extraction,” the Treasury statement said. “Amid growing international condemnation, the PRC continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. The U.S. reiterates its calls on the PRC to bring an end to the repression of Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, including by releasing all those arbitrarily held in internment camps and detention facilities,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday. Blinken to visit Brussels Mr. Blinken, who is visiting Brussels this week, also praised the EU’s decision to impose sanctions on China. In addition to Mr. Wang and Mr. Chen, the EU also sanctioned Zhu Hailun, former deputy Communist Party head in Xinjiang, and Wang Mingshan, a member of the Xinjiang’s Communist Party standing committee. “A united transatlantic response sends a strong signal to those who violate or abuse international human rights, and we will take further actions in coordination with likeminded partners. We will continue to stand with our allies around the world in calling for an immediate end to the PRC’s crimes and for justice for the many victims,” Mr. Blinken said. Beijing has responded by announcing retaliatory sanctions against EU individuals and entities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-slaps-sanctions-over-china-myanmar-abuses/article34136664.ece
23 March 2021||London,||U.K. to unveil global focus in defence modernisation plans||The U.K. government will on Monday unveil much-anticipated military modernisation plans, vowing to bolster its defence of British interests “across multiple domains and in all corners of the globe”. The long-awaited proposals, detailed in a report entitled “Defence in a Competitive Age”, focus heavily on boosting the country’s Navy and global footprint, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. New commando force It promises more ships, submarines and sailors and the transformation of the Royal Marines into a new unit called the Future Commando Force. The force will be deployed on “an enduring basis” to secure shipping lanes and uphold freedom of navigation, the MoD said. However, reports said the size of the Army would be reduced by around 10,000 to about 70,000 soldiers, the latest in a series of reductions in the last decade. The cut comes as the military shifts towards investment in robots, drones, and cyber warfare, the reports added. Despite that, the Army will create a new special operations Ranger Regiment, which would “be able to operate discreetly in high-risk environments and be rapidly deployable across the world,” the MoD said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-to-unveil-global-focus-in-defence-modernisation-plans/article34136674.ece
23 March 2021||New Delhi,||U.S. data shows AstraZeneca’s vaccine is effective for all ages||A phase 3 trial of the AstraZeneca vaccine candidate in the United States has revealed an efficacy of 79%, when both doses were administered 4 weeks apart. This is a significant jump over the candidate’s efficacy reported in the earlier trial conducted in the U.K., Brazil and South Africa. AstraZeneca reported results of the trial via a press release on Monday and a formal scientific publication is awaited. The finding adds confidence to the Covishield vaccine, which is the same as the AstraZeneca vaccine. Results on Covishield trials done specifically on Indian participants aren’t yet available. ‘No safety concerns’ The U.S. trial, which recruited over 32,000 volunteers across all age groups, showed that the vaccine is 79% effective against symptomatic COVID-19, and 100% effective against severe, or critical symptomatic COVID-19. The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reported no safety concerns among the participants receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, AstraZeneca said in a statement. Andrew Pollard, professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunity, and lead investigator of the Oxford University trial of the vaccine, said: “These results are great news as they show the remarkable efficacy of the vaccine in a new population and are consistent with the results from Oxford-led trials. We can expect strong impact against COVID-19 across all ages and for people of all different backgrounds from widespread use of the vaccine.” Sarah Gilbert, professor of Vaccinology, and co-designer of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 coronavirus vaccine, said: “These new results from the large phase III trials in the U.S., Chile and Peru provide further confirmation of the safety and effectiveness of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.” AstraZeneca will be submitting the data for analysis by the scientific community in peer-review literature, and to the regulators in the U.S., the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and for emergency approval for use.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-data-shows-astrazenecas-vaccine-is-effective-for-all-ages/article34136659.ece

The Philippines on Sunday said more than 200 militia boats were spotted “in line formation” at the boomerang-shaped Whitsun Reef, around 175 nautical miles west of Palawan Island on March 7. Manila called on China to “immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory”. But Beijing disputed the claim, saying that “for a long time, Chinese fishing boats have been fishing in waters near the reef”, which it said was a part of the contested Spratly Islands. “Recently, due to conditions at sea, some fishing boats have been sheltering from the wind near the Whitsun Reef,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. “We believe this is very normal, and hope all parties can consider it rationally.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/vessels-in-disputed-sea-are-fishing-boats-china/article34136662.ece

The initiative includes the reopening of Sana'a airport, and would allow fuel and food imports through Hodeidah port, both of which are controlled by Riyadh’s enemies, the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. Political negotiations between the Saudi-backed government and the Houthis would be restarted, said Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. “The initiative will take effect as soon as the Houthis agree to it,” Prince Faisal said, calling on the group and the government to accept the offer. The Houthis have demanded the lifting of an air and sea blockade, which has contributed to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen, as their main pre-condition before any deal. The Saudi-led coalition has said the port and airport must be restricted to prevent weapons from reaching the Houthis, who control the capital and most populous areas.The announcement did not specify which routes would be permitted for aircraft flying to Sana’a, or whether food or fuel imports through Hodeidah port would be subject to additional pre-authorisations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/riyadh-presents-ceasefire-plan-to-yemens-houthis/article34136665.ece

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Delhi’s administration as the tail wagging the dog||A courtier once said about Charles II, “We have a pretty witty king, Whose word no man relies on. He never said a foolish thing, And never did a wise one.” Charles supposedly replied, “The wise words are my own, the deeds are my ministers.” Thus was seeded the system of the cabinet form of government, which eventually flowered in England and left its imprimatur over constitutional structures throughout the world. India has no monarchs but a President and Governors, in whose name, the government is run. They can do almost nothing by themselves, without the aid and advice of their cabinet of Ministers. However, the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi, will likely be an exception soon. Parliamentary democracy, with a cabinet form of government, is part of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution. Its first article reads, “India that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.” When the Constitution came into force, there were four kinds of States, called Parts A,B, C and D States, with the last two being administered by centrally appointed Chief Commissioners and Lieutenant Governors, with no locally elected Assemblies to aid and advise them. Governing Delhi Delhi as the National Capital, belonged to the nation as a whole. It was felt that if Delhi became a part of any constituent State of the Union, that State would sooner or later acquire a predominant position in relation to other States. Second, the need for keeping the National Capital under the control of the Union Government was deemed to be vital in the national interest. It was felt that if Delhi became a full State, the administration of the National Capital would be divided into rigid compartments of the State field and Union field. Conflicts would likely arise in vital matters, particularly if the two governments were run by different political parties. Hence, Delhi was initially made a Part C State. Its population then was around 14 lakh people. In 1951, a Legislative Assembly was created with an elected Chief Minister. Chaudhary Brahm Prakash became the first Chief Minister in 1952. However, a prolonged stand-off with the Chief Commissioner, and later the Union Home Minister, Govind Ballabh Pant, over issues of jurisdictions and functional autonomy, eventually led to his resignation, in 1955. In 1956, when the Constitution of India was amended to implement the provisions of the States Reorganisation Act, only two categories, namely, States and Union Territories remained in the Indian Union. Delhi then became a Union Territory to be administered by an Administrator appointed by the President. The Legislative Assembly of Delhi and the Council stood abolished, despite loud protests in Parliament. Ten years later, the Delhi Administration Act, 1966 provided for a limited representative Government in Delhi through a Metropolitan Council comprising 56 elected Members and five nominated Members. This structure continued for many years, with repeated political demands for full statehood to be granted to Delhi. In 1987, the Balakrishnan Committee was set up to submit its recommendations with regard to the status to be conferred on Delhi. In 1989, the Committee recommended that Delhi should continue to be a Union Territory but that there must be a Legislative Assembly and Council of Ministers responsible to the said Assembly with appropriate powers; and to ensure stability, appropriate constitutional measures should be taken to confer the National Capital a special status. Based on this report, the Constitution (69th) Amendment Act and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCT) Act, 1991 were passed. They roughly restored the kind of governance system that was offered to Delhi in 1952: a Union Territory with a Legislative Assembly, a Council of Ministers and an elected Chief Minister. This limited reincarnation has continued to hold the field to date, despite several efforts to progress to full or near-statehood. Politics and questions Between 1991 to date, there have been various instances when the Delhi Assembly has been won by a party other than the ruling party at the Centre. In an era of mixed but slim mandates, the Delhi government and the Union Government have differed, but more often than not found a modus vivendi . But the Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and 2019 and the Delhi Assembly elections of 2015 and 2020, have resulted in huge mandates to personality-led governments, from different parties that are seemingly locked in mortal combat with each other. The ensuing fights lead to constitutional questions on Delhi’s peculiar government structure being litigated up to the Supreme Court. A Bench in 2018 ruled that “...Parliament envisaged a representative form of Government for the NCT of Delhi. The said provision intends to provide for the Capital a directly elected Legislative Assembly which shall have legislative powers over matters falling within the State List and the Concurrent List, barring those excepted, and a mandate upon the Lieutenant Governor to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers except when he decides to refer the matter to the President for final decision”. The Court further ruled that “... The Constitution has mandated a federal balance wherein independence of a certain required degree is assured to the State Governments. As opposed to centralism, a balanced federal structure mandates that the Union does not usurp all powers and the States enjoy freedom without any unsolicited interference from the Central Government with respect to matters which exclusively fall within their domain.” The remaining issues of governance, especially in the matter of control over Delhi government servants, was remitted to two judges of the Court for further adjudication. In 2019, there was a difference of opinion recorded in separate judgments by the two judges and the matter awaits hearing before a larger Bench. The consequences It is against this convoluted historical and legal background that we must assess the Central government’s justification that “In order to give effect to the interpretation made by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgments, a Bill, namely, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 seeks, inter alia , to clarify the expression ‘Government’, ….consistent with the status of Delhi as a Union territory to address the ambiguities in the interpretation of the legislative provisions.” The Bill effectively reduces the elected government to a mere vestigial organ and elevates the centrally appointed LG, to the position of a Viceroy with plenipotentiary powers. Simply put, the elected government in Delhi can do nothing, if the LG does not permit them to so do. It provides that, “The expression ‘Government’ referred to in any law to be made by the Legislative Assembly shall mean the Lieutenant Governor.” It further provides that “...before taking any executive action in pursuance of the decision of the Council of Ministers or a Minister, to exercise powers of Government, ...under any law in force in the Capital, the opinion of Lieutenant Governor ...shall be obtained on all such matters as may be specified, by a general or special order, by Lieutenant Governor.” If the Bill is passed by both Houses of Parliament, as it seems so, it will be a case of the unelected tail wagging the elected dog. The population of Delhi which counts among the highest in the world, will have an unrepresentative administration. It will be ruled by an appointed LG, who can only be changed if the rest of the country, decides to change the Central government. There can be no recourse to the ballot box to hold to account an unelected, centrally appointed government functionary. It is quite likely that the amendment act will end up being challenged in the constitutional courts. The Supreme Court has already cautioned — “Interpretation cannot ignore the conscience of the Constitution. That apart, when we take a broader view, we are also alive to the consequence of such an interpretation. If the expressions in case of difference and on any matter are construed to mean that the Lieutenant Governor can differ on any proposal, the expectation of the people which has its legitimacy in a democratic set-up, although different from States as understood under the Constitution, will lose its purpose in simple semantics.” Will Parliamentarians heed the Court’s caution, or like Charles II, will they never say “a foolish thing and never do a wise one”?

Some have averred that the mutual withdrawal amounts to the creation of a “buffer zone on Indian territory”. Others have alleged it to be a “surrender of Indian territory”. Yet others have questioned the withdrawal of India’s presence along the Kailash range on the South Bank of Pangong since it enabled India to dominate the Chinese garrison at Moldo. Things are moving Another charge has been levelled — of inadequate budgetary allocation for defence in the face of a “two front war”. The fact of the matter is that the increase in the outlay for capital procurement announced by the Finance Minister on February 1 for FY 2021-22 represents a 18.75% jump over the previous financial year, the highest in 15 years. Moreover, the government has enhanced the delegated financial powers up to Rs. 200 crore in senior ranks below the rank of vice chief as well, to facilitate procurement. Improved procedures and oversight have ensured better utilisation with no surrendering of funds over the last four years. The charge that India is not according proper priority to national security is baseless. Military modernisation, indigenisation and defence exports are top priorities. The building of long overdue roads, bridges, culverts and other infrastructure in the border areas, in mission mode, has spurred mobility and capacity for a rapid induction of forces. The Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DSDBO) Road has facilitated seamless access all the way up to Sub-Sector North (SSN) which abuts the Karakoram Pass and the Siachen Glacier. It has provided an axis for developing lateral roads towards India’s frontline in Eastern Ladakh. Another example is the eponymous Atal Rohtang Tunnel, approved by the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Tunnel, inaugurated in October 2020, makes for a much shorter logistics loop connecting the Middle and Western Sectors of the India-China boundary on the Indian side. Many defence reforms recommended by the Naresh Chandra Committee have been implemented in recent years. The creation of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA), the appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff, and, the soon-to-be-a-reality Theatre Commands, are but a few examples. The buffer zone stands India has not surrendered any land in Galwan, Pangong or Depsang since the border crisis broke out in April/May 2020. The assumption that the disengagement implemented at Pangong, especially that the temporary moratorium on patrolling by both sides will result in a buffer zone entirely “in our area”, is incorrect. India has neither accepted the unilateral definition of China’s so-called Line of Actual Control (LAC) of 1959 nor its subsequent mutants. As such, a buffer zone on the other side of any so-called Chinese LAC is still a buffer zone on India’s side, given that India regards the whole of Aksai Chin as an integral part of its territory. By using the benchmark of the so-called Chinese LAC to identify India’s territory and China’s, the naysayers are actually legitimising the illegal Chinese presence across the LAC. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the idea of a mutual pullback by 20 kilometres, which would have resulted in buffer zones, had been proposed by China and rejected by India. Later, India had accepted the modified “Colombo Conference Proposals” mooted by six non-aligned countries in December 1962 after the war, which would have permitted Indian civilian administration to be present alongside the Chinese in the vacated areas. China had reservations and backed out in March 1963 after initially acquiescing. It was ready to consider them only as a basis for further bilateral negotiations. Much water may have flown down the Chip Chap, Galwan and Chang Chenmo rivers since then, but it is not as if pullbacks and buffer zones have never been considered before. The pullback on the North Bank of Pangong has resulted in the Chinese ceasing their patrolling between Fingers 4 and 8 for the first time in several decades. After the 1962 debacle, Indian patrols limited themselves to visiting Finger 8, which evolved as the de facto Indian line in this sector, but this access too was restricted by vehicle-mounted Chinese patrols along that stretch in recent decades. Given that China perceives its line to run further west of Finger 3, India has done well to maintain its permanent presence at the Dhan Singh Thapa Post near Finger 3 on what the Chinese regard as their side of the LAC. As former Northern Army Commander Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda has stated in a recent opinion piece, by agreeing to relocate east of Finger 8, the PLA is pulling back from its claimed “customary boundary line” and “this is definitely not a minor concession”. It is, as he has pointed out, in line with India’s consistent demand to restore the status quo ante that existed in April 2020. Different implications The word status quo ante in regard to the India-China boundary matters has different implications for the ground situation depending entirely on the timeline being referred to. In seeking a restoration of status quo ante on the North Bank of Pangong with reference to April-May 2020, the advantage secured by India on the South Bank was naturally a plus point, and put to good effect by Indian negotiators. If the retention of the heights along the Kailash range is deemed so important for leveraging concessions elsewhere, as some claim, why is it that no previous government acted to occupy the heights earlier, including during the face-off in Depsang in 2013? After all, differences over the LAC are hardly new. The fact is that Indian troops secured the heights on the South Bank precisely to offset China’s “first mover” advantage on the North Bank. Moreover, if India’s objective is to achieve status quo ante , India too would logically be required to revert to its pre-April 2020 status. The potential linkage between the heights of the Kailash range and Depsang, or for that matter Gogra and Hot Springs, cannot be arbitrarily conjured up. The situation in the pockets of differences is sui generis . At the end of the 10th round of the India-China Corps Commander Level Meeting, the two sides have positively appraised the smooth completion of disengagement at Pangong, acknowledging that it was a significant step that provided a good basis for resolving the remaining issues along the LAC. Instead of commending our military and External Affairs Ministry negotiators for their efforts in ensuring a successful disengagement at Pangong, some commentators have questioned the absence of “iron-clad agreements” for resolving the differences at Depsang or Gogra/Hot Spring, which are still being discussed. The negotiators ought to be given a chance. The truth is that there were no iron-clad guarantees in any of the agreements and protocols signed so far either, whether in 1993, 1996 or in 2005. Bilateral differences are best negotiated from a position of strength as has been done at Pangong, while maintaining high vigil and striving for positive outcomes elsewhere.

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Of judges, closed probes and the Bar’s omerta||On April 24, 2021, Justice N. V. Ramana is to assume office as the 48th Chief Justice of India (CJI). As Master of the Roster, Justice Ramana would have the sole prerogative to constitute benches of the Supreme Court and allocate matters to be heard by these benches. As a matter of law, he would exercise this power even in cases that concern allegations made against him. The importance of the integrity of the person occupying such an important constitutional position cannot be overstated. Yet, a month before Justice Ramana is to assume office, the public is in the dark about the veracity of serious allegations levelled against him by other constitutional authorities. The allegations On October 6, 2020, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy addressed a letter to CJI S.A. Bobde alleging that Justice Ramana was interfering with the constitution of benches and assignment of matters at the Andhra Pradesh High Court in order to ensure that cases concerning the opposition party in the State were assigned to favourable benches. There were also specific allegations against certain judges of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, including the then Chief Justice of the High Court, Justice J. K. Maheshwari. Mr. Reddy, who faces several allegations of corruption and criminal cases, does not present as a particularly credible complainant. The Attorney General lost no opportunity in alluding to these controversies in his communication declining a request to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against the Chief Minister for his allegations. Consent was declined on the grounds that the CJI was “seized of the matter”. However, the Attorney General thought it fit to observe that Mr. Reddy’s conduct was prima facie “contumacious” and noted that the timing of the allegation “could be said to be suspect” as Justice Ramana had presided over a bench that had recently passed an order directing various High Courts to expeditiously adjudicate thousands of criminal cases that were pending against former and sitting legislators. The order had galvanised the Telangana High Court to direct a CBI special court to hear a disproportionate assets case against Mr. Reddy. It would, however, be improper to dismiss the accusations of a sitting Chief Minister against the future CJI as the insinuations of a disgruntled litigant. Given the high constitutional offices embroiled in the controversy, the allegations at a minimum deserve a thorough, expeditious and transparent inquiry. The Supreme Court, though, has turned institutional inscrutability into high art. On December 14, 2020, the Supreme Court collegium that included Justice Ramana recommended the transfer of Chief Justice Maheshwari from the Andhra Pradesh High Court to the Sikkim High Court. The collegium’s tendency to resort to transfers in order to avoid the uncomfortable exercise of inquiring into allegations of alleged judicial misconduct is so common that one would be forgiven for mistaking it for a constitutional prescription. There is no information as to the reasons for the transfer of Justice Maheshwari to a much smaller High Court in the wake of Mr. Reddy’s allegations. The in-house procedure This episode serves as a reminder of the inadequate, self-fashioned rules that govern inquiries into judicial misconduct. The ‘in-house’ procedure devised by the higher judiciary in 1997 is riddled with shortcomings, including its absolute insulation from external gaze, its lack of prescriptions as to timelines for completion of the inquiry, and the absence of any requirement to disclose the pendency or results of the inquiry (including to the complainant). The procedure confers wide discretionary powers on the CJI. Interestingly, it also does not contemplate a situation in which allegations may be leveled against the CJI. Sheltered by this in-house procedure, the Supreme Court has avoided having to officially respond to the allegations against Justice Ramana, or share information regarding the existence or status of an inquiry into them. Given Justice Maheshwari’s hasty transfer, and the fact that there is just a month before Justice Ramana is to assume office, the irresistible conclusion is that the court would rather not apply its judicial mind to this task. There is legitimate reason for concern that the allegations may receive a quiet burial. In August 2017, Justice Chelameswar (then a senior Supreme Court judge) had addressed a letter to the then CJI Khehar regarding an “unwarranted intimacy” between Justice Ramana and the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu. The concern was that Justice Ramana and Mr. Naidu had rejected certain candidates for elevation to the Andhra Pradesh High Court on identical (but specious) grounds. Despite a senior judge voicing concerns regarding a colleague on the bench, there was no information about the initiation of an inquiry, let alone its result. Two possible outcomes There are two possible conclusions to an inquiry into Mr. Reddy’s letter: that he has falsely accused several members of the higher judiciary, including the second-most senior judge of the Supreme Court, of misconduct; or that the future CJI and other High Court judges have abused their positions. Either outcome requires firm institutional responses. Should Mr. Reddy’s allegations prove to be baseless, his letter would constitute an attempt to use his constitutional office to interfere in the administration of justice and he ought to face criminal contempt proceedings. Should the allegations against Justice Ramana and other senior members of the higher judiciary be found to be credible, the in-house procedure requires that the CJI evaluate whether the misconduct warrants the removal of the judge from office or not. In the former event, the judge(s) may be asked to resign. Only in the event of a judge refusing to resign would steps be taken to withdraw judicial work and communicate the finding of misconduct to other constitutional functionaries (the Prime Minister and President) for appropriate action (and a possible impeachment). If the CJI considers that the misconduct does not warrant the removal of the judge, the CJI may “...advise [the judge] accordingly”, and the report of the committee that conducted the inquiry may be “placed on record.” It is unclear what “placed on record” means. But what is certain is that this report is not available to the public. Indian citizens, as a matter of right, ought to be informed of the outcome of such an inquiry given the institutions and authorities involved, well before Justice Ramana takes office as CJI. Yet, the Supreme Court – that repeatedly proclaims its commitment to preserving public trust in the judiciary – appears to be moving at a glacial pace in response to Mr. Reddy’s letter, and also deems it unnecessary for the public to be informed of the status or outcome of an inquiry. The Bar stands implicated in the omerta over allegations of judicial misconduct, not just for its muteness in respect of the inquiry into the Chief Minister’s allegations, but its historic failure to demand transparency from the higher judiciary. The mantle falls upon the public to declare to constitutional authorities that citizens of democracies deserve better than a self-serving, non-transparent in-house procedure that is founded on the presumption that the CJI is above suspicion.

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||No rights despite reforms||Not one of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states can cater to their labour market needs domestically. Their dependence on migration is only set to increase with fertility rates falling. Despite there being unemployment, the citizens of these countries are unlikely to step in and do the supposedly low-skilled, and definitely low-paid, jobs of the millions of migrants who work there. The reality in Qatar Qatar, the richest of the six countries in terms of per capita GDP, is the most dependent on migrant labour. Nationals count for less than 15% of the 2.6 million population and about 7% of the labour market. About 60% of the population lives in labour camps. The Qatarisation (nationalising the workforce) plan only affects the most well-paid jobs in the private and public sector. But there is enough to go around even after targets are met for the ‘expat’, usually well-heeled citizens of the global North. This reality must be the basis of any analysis of the human rights of migrant workers in the country and the slew of reforms that Qatar has been boasting about. The main reason for the growing demand to boycott Qatar as the host of the FIFA World Cup for 2022 is that the country treats its migrant workers poorly, resulting in destitution and unexplained deaths. But while the muck has been stirred up in light of this event, there is no meaningful effort to actually clean it up. The problem is viewed as one of inadequate legal protection, and the solution is framed as reforming or abolishing the Kafala (sponsorship) system, without acknowledging the many facets of various laws and practices that are the foundation of this system. The failure to understand this complexity has allowed Qatar to get away with the bare minimum in terms of dialogue and reform: it has engaged with the International Labour Organization by entering into a technical co-operation without really ratifying key labour treaties; allowed access to international NGOs and trade unions (which its neighbours won’t do) without allowing civil society activism and unionisation domestically (which Bahrain and Kuwait do); and donated to the World Health Organization and other UN mechanisms while keeping the majority of its residents in poverty. The global scrutiny and demand for accountability does affect the emirate’s reputation, but not enough to lose its rich and influential friends. There is now an increasing presence of UN agencies. Qatar remains one of the few places where there is an opportunity for profitable economic participation for the big businesses headquartered in the North, and that can’t be jeopardised. So, that leaves us with Asian and African countries (a steady source of cheap labour), which are facing climate change, loss of livelihoods, and increasing unemployment. Understandably, they won’t stand up to countries from where much-needed remittances flow. These are some of the reasons why a low minimum wage and allowing workers to exit the country or change jobs without the sponsor’s permission are celebrated. Maintaining the status quo But will Qatar’s response to these aspects in the shape of reforms remove exploitation of workers? The short answer is ‘no.’ Across the GCC, migrant labour is increasingly referred to as ‘temporary’ or ‘guest’. While this may have made some sense a few decades ago, when Qatar and its neighbours were hosting 2,00,000-3,00,000 workers to meet their labour needs, it is unjustifiable when dependency on migrants is inarguably permanent, so much so that the entire economy will collapse without access to cheap labour. In order to maintain the status quo, all the other complexities of the ‘Kafala’ have been ignored in the reforms. There is no attempt to curb the unchecked powers of the kafeel , who can have the workers they sponsor arrested, detained and deported without due process. Charges of absconding are used to keep workers in abusive employment or risk being criminalised as irregular. There are no mechanisms to address rampant wage theft, despite the electronic payment systems. Migrant domestic workers, mainly women, are excluded from the labour law. They are trapped within households at the mercy of the employer and do not enjoy the most basic freedoms, including off days, mobility and access to modes of communication. From domestic and care work, construction and hospitality, to nursing and maintenance, even if a quarter of the employed stop work for a week, Qatar will come to a standstill. It is this fear that drives the GCC countries to exercise control over the most essential of their labour. So, celebrating reforms is questionable. What Qatar is doing is making exploitative laws that enable forced labour more palatable.

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||An unconscionable act||The world has been watching Myanmar descend into a brutal military dictatorship again. The scenes from the past few weeks have been terrible — peaceful protestors being killed, detained, and communities terrorised. In all this, the people of Myanmar have been pleading with the international community to support them in their hour of need. It is incumbent upon Myanmar’s neighbours to stand up for rule of law, democracy and human rights. Engaging in doublespeak While many in India are supportive of those in Myanmar calling for democracy, the Indian government has been engaging in doublespeak. On the one hand, India has made relatively strong, laudable statements as part of the UN Security Council and at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in support of the people of Myanmar. On the other, the government is simultaneously detaining and preparing to deport Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. The Ministry of Home Affairs has also recently issued a diktat to border States to check “illegal influx” from Myanmar to India. The Ministry wrongly labels those fleeing into India as “infiltrators”, arguing that they are not to be considered refugees as India has not signed the UN Refugee Convention. This is an erroneous position in international law. These individuals would fall within the legal definition of refugees i.e., those who have a well-founded fear of persecution, and the customary international law norm of non-refoulement is legally binding. This means that no State can send individuals back to a situation of danger, which is clearly the case in Myanmar. Non-refoulement applies to those countries which have signed the conventions as well as those that have not. This is of particular relevance to those police and security personnel refusing illegal orders to attack protesters, instead seeking refuge in India, as multiple credible reports indicate. There are growing calls from the UN and states for the atrocities committed by Myanmar security forces in the course of these protests to be investigated as possible crimes against humanity, given their scale, coordination and their widespread and systematic nature. Furthermore, this week, the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), a UN established body that is mandated to investigate and build case files for international crimes committed in Myanmar since 2011, issued a public call to security personnel to reach out and provide information regarding illegal orders and policies, which are a necessary component of building cases against those higher up in the chain of command. India must shelter these individuals and allow the IIMM access, should they indicate willingness to cooperate in these international investigations. Crimes against the Rohingya Coinciding with the mass crackdown against protesters in Myanmar this month, reports emerged of Rohingya refugees being rounded up and detained in India, in preparation for deportation to Myanmar. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in India was denied access to individuals detained in Delhi. The Rohingya are refugees who have fled years of atrocities and a genocidal campaign, and must not be sent back to Myanmar where their lives are in certain danger. There are also international legal proceedings ongoing in relation to the Rohingya. A case before the International Court of Justice relates to violations of the Genocide Convention by Myanmar, and has been brought against it by The Gambia, with Canada, the Netherlands and Maldives joining the case recently. Simultaneously, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is investigating international crimes against the Rohingya. These international legal proceedings are indications of the seriousness and gravity of the crimes against the Rohingya, which India would do well to heed. To turn its back on the people of Myanmar would be unconscionable now, and India would be in breach of international law in doing so.

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Free and open||The timing of U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin’s visit to New Delhi over the weekend (March 19-21) was significant for many reasons. As the first senior ranking official of the Biden administration to meet with the Modi government, his visit this early in the new President’s tenure indicates the place India holds, on a par with the other two countries he visited prior to India: Japan and South Korea. The visit, just after the first ever Quad leaders’ summit, confirms the U.S.’s focus on greater maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Mr. Austin’s trip preceded an unannounced stop in Kabul where the U.S. is undertaking a major review of its troops pull-out schedule and peace plan. As a result, all three areas: bilateral ties, the Indo-Pacific and Afghanistan came up for discussion during talks with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. On the bilateral front, the two sides agreed to boost their defence relationship through the use of three foundational agreements (LEMOA, COMCASA, and BECA), as well as increase cooperation in the areas of information sharing and logistics, artificial intelligence, space and build more linkages with the U.S. Commands. On Indo-Pacific strategy, Mr. Singh affirmed India’s resolve to maintain a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region with the U.S., as part of the Quad. On Afghanistan, the discussions are understood to have been consultative, as Mr. Austin is part of the decision-making process over whether the U.S. will stick to its May 1 deadline to pull out all remaining troops, and how to proceed forward in the Intra-Afghan dialogue. The U.S. does not thus far appear to have heeded India’s concerns on talks with the Taliban, making any talks conditional on a ceasefire, including India in all regional talks where Pakistan is also involved, and prioritising the needs of the government in Kabul. Even so, it is important that India expresses its sense of the situation in Afghanistan, given its important role there. While Mr. Austin made it clear the Biden Administration is committed to CAATSA sanctions against all countries procuring high-value Russian military hardware, he said that the determination on India would only come after New Delhi takes delivery of the S-400 missile system. He confirmed that he had raised the issue of human rights in India, but added that these are part of conversations any two democracies would share, a sentiment seconded by the MEA. Finally, while officials said they discussed India’s challenge from China, Mr. Austin was careful not to make any direct reference to Beijing or about the LAC dispute, which New Delhi considers a bilateral issue. The omission, in contrast to his comments in Tokyo and Seoul, signalled both that New Delhi desired discretion on the issue, and that the U.S. Defence Secretary was sensitive to his host’s wish.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/free-and-open/article34136640.ece
23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||The way forward||Ever since the military captured power in Myanmar seven weeks ago, the country has steadily descended into political and economic chaos. When the Generals toppled the democratically elected government, detained its leaders, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, and declared a state of emergency with prohibitory orders, they may have thought that they could quickly consolidate power through force. But they were proved wrong as tens of thousands of people stood up against the junta. Faced with strong challenges in their path towards absolute power, the Generals responded with brutal force. At least 247 people have been killed since the February 1 coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a non-profit. The crisis had its spillover impacts on the borders as well. At least 300 Myanmarese, including police officers, are estimated to have since crossed into India. Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga took up the issue with the Foreign Minister and India has shut the border for now, but it would be difficult for New Delhi to turn a blind eye to the border if the situation in Myanmar turns worse. The military, which controlled the country through direct rule for almost 50 years until former junta ruler Than Shwe initiated the transition into partial democracy in 2010, is one of the most consistent enemies of democracy and human rights. In 1988 and 2007, the Generals unleashed violence to quell protests. But in the past, they managed to restore order quickly through fear and violence. Now, neither the junta’s bloody track record nor the actual use of force is dissuading the protesters who, after experiencing limited liberties for 10 years, refuse to recognise the junta. Mostly youngsters, they use VPN and encrypted messenger apps to organise protests, and are joined by thousands, including bank employees, port workers and medics, bringing the battered economy to a halt. As protests and violence continue, international pressure is also mounting on the Generals. In the past, the Myanmarese military paid little attention to international opinion or targeted sanctions. They are unlikely to be different now. But the Generals now find it increasingly difficult to consolidate power and restore order. The public remains defiant. How long will the Generals continue to kill their own people? And even if they quelled the protests through more bloodshed, what kind of a Myanmar would they be left with? Surely, no one wants an extremely poor, isolated country with a broken society and a shattered economy. The Myanmar Generals should, without further bloodshed, heed the public’s demands, end the coup, respect the election results and restore the country’s democracy. That is the only way forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-way-forward/article34136641.ece

A heavily armed escort could not save him from being roughly manhandled by demonstrators. Several hundred East Pakistani youths greeted Mr. Bhutto, East Pakistan’s alleged enemy number one, with boos and shouts of “Go Back Bhutto” when his car drew up at the International Hotel. Beside him in the car were two soldiers with bren guns. As two officers and an armed guard accompanied him into the hotel lobby, the crowd surged in after them and pressed Mr. Bhutto into a waiting lift. The lift, attended by hotel staff wearing large independent Bengal flags on their jackets, stalled for six minutes. Then when Mr. Bhutto at last arrived at the seventh floor, where his suite was located, waiting Awami youths pushed him back into the lift and pressed a button forcing him to descend back to the ground floor - where he was shot up to the seventh floor again. He later moved four floors up to the top of the hotel. On leaving the President’s house later after his long meeting with Gen. Yahya, he told the press: “Everything will turn out all right.

23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre readies draft plan for district-wise export promotion||The government has readied a draft district-wise export promotion plan for 451 districts in the country after identifying products and services with export potential in 725 districts, Commerce Secretary Anoop Wadhawan said on Monday. Aiming for double-digit export growth from 500 districts over 3-5 years, the Commerce Ministry has asked States to prepare an annual ‘export ranking index’ of districts on export competitiveness with the assistance of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). While foreign trade constitutes 45% of India’s GDP, most export promotion efforts are driven by the Centre. The district-specific approach that perforce involves the States in identifying potential export sectors and the logistics bottlenecks to be fixed, was taken up after Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushed for each district to aim to be an export hub during his Independence Day address in 2019. In the initial phase, products and services with export potential in each district have been identified and an institutional mechanism of State and District Export Promotion Committees (SEPC) are being created, with an action plan to grow exports from each district. Draft District Export Action Plans have been prepared by regional DGFT authorities in 451 districts. “Products/services with export potential have been identified in 725 districts across the country (including Agricultural & Toy clusters and GI products in these Districts),” the Ministry said. “District Export Promotion Committees have been notified in the districts of all the States except West Bengal,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/centre-readies-draft-plan-for-district-wise-export-promotion/article34136629.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Workers in govt. contracts must possess skill certificate’||All workers executing government contracts must have official certification for their skills, the government has decided. Only 2.4% of India’s workforce is formally trained as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey of 2018-19. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has told all government departments to mandate this requirement for all contracts issued under their watch. Paying lower wages It cited contractors’ preference to employ informal workers at lower wages in contrast to the government’s push to train and certify skilled workers. “If the above provision cannot be applied in toto immediately, then a phase-wise application can be thought of … it can be mandated that up to 10% of the strength of skilled workers utilised in 2021-22 will be certified skilled workers, which shall be progressively increased to 100% by 2026-27,” Praveen Kumar, Secretary, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, wrote in a communiqué to Ministries. Government contractors’ preference for low-wage informal workers, Mr. Kumar said, was creating a dichotomy where the government was trying to promote skilling in workforce without insisting on the use of skilled manpower for its projects.  The new stipulation would make more people seek certification and influence industry hiring practices, the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/workers-in-govt-contracts-must-possess-skill-certificate/article34136619.ece
23 March 2021||MUMBAI,||Fix responsibility for Feb. 24 trading halt, SEBI tells NSE||The Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has asked the governing board of National Stock Exchange (NSE) to determine why the NSE management failed to shift NSE’s operations from the primary site to the Disaster Recovery (DR) site within the time frame specified by SEBI, on the day trading was halted last month. The board has also been asked to fix individual responsibility for the same. These need to be completed within 21 days, the SEBI order said. SEBI, which has been probing the incident of trading halt at NSE on February 24, has also directed the NSE and NSE Clearing Ltd. (NCL) to update the functionality of collaterals at the ‘slave system’ of NCL placed at the data centre of BSE/MSEI and connect the trading system at the primary site of NSE to the slave system of NCL placed at the data centre of BSE/MSEI. These have to be implemented within 90 days. SEBI also directed all Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) to switch to the disaster recovery site within 45 minutes of declaration of ‘disaster’. “In the event of disruption of any one or more of the ‘Critical Systems’, the MII shall, within 30 minutes of the incident (from earlier requirement of 2 hours), declare that incident as ‘disaster’ and take measures to restore operations including from the DRS within 45 minutes (from earlier requirement of 2 hours) of the declaration of ‘disaster’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fix-responsibility-for-feb-24-trading-halt-sebi-tells-nse/article34136625.ece
23 March 2021||COIMBATORE,||CCI cuts price of cotton as ‘one-time’ correction||The Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) on Monday reduced the selling price of cotton as a “one-time correction.” International cotton prices had risen almost 12% in the last two months and dropped at the same rate, said Pradeep Kumar Agarwal, CMD of CCI. “The CCI did not increase the prices to that extent. Since CCI prices went up only by about 2%, it has reduced the prices by [about] 2%,” he said. The amount of reduction in prices differs according to the variety of cotton. This nominal correction will give a stimulus to the textile industry as those who want to buy cotton can do so now, he added. A. Sakthivel, chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion Council, said cotton yarn prices had gone up steeply in the last 4 months. The move by the CCI was significant for the textile value chain, especially garment exporters, he said, appealing to textile mills to reduce yarn prices by Rs. 20 a kg as cotton prices had declined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cci-cuts-price-of-cotton-as-one-time-correction/article34136628.ece

23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||India asserts prowess with three more golds||It was a consistent flow of gold medals, both in Olympic and non-Olympic events, as India continued to assert its shooting prowess in the World Cup at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, on Monday. After four days of competition, India has six gold, four silver and four bronze medals. Second-placed USA has three golds, two silvers and a bronze. The golden flow was triggered by Elavenil Valarivan and Divyansh Singh Panwar, both of whom had finished 2019 as World No. 1 in air rifle before the pandemic. The duo won the mixed air rifle gold beating Hungary 16-10 in the final, after having topped qualification both in the first and second stages. “We put up a good show,” said Elavenil, happy to have stepped it up, while Divyansh was happy to “focus on technique”. It was followed by the mixed team gold in air pistol by Saurabh Chaudhary and Manu Bhaker who were challenged by Iran. In the climax, Saurabh and Manu were in top gear and India won 16-12. It was no surprise, as Manu and Saurabh had won the mixed gold in all the four World Cups in 2019. Manu had also won the Asian mixed gold, and the World Cup Final gold. Later, Mairaj Ahmad Khan, Angad Vir Singh Bajwa and Gurjoat Khangura were flawless, as competition hotted up, to beat strong Qatar 6-2. The Indian women’s skeet team of Ganemat Sekhon, Karttiki Singh Shaktawat and Parinaaz Dhaliwal put up a good fare before being beaten by the strong Kazakh team 6-4 in the final.  The results: Mixed air rifle: 1. India (Elavenil Valarivan, Divyansh Singh Panwar) 16 (421.3) 628.0; 2. Hungary (Eszter Denes, Istvan Peni) 10 (419.2) 633.9; 3. USA 17 (418.8) 633.5; 4.

23 March 2021||PUNE,||Time for ODIs as evenly matched teams vie to outperform each other||At a time when the cricket calendar around the globe is striving to make every international series relevant, you may wonder whether a one-day series sandwiched between a T20I series and the Indian Premier League — that too with the World Test Championship final and the T20 World Cup to follow later in the year — would attract interest from the fans. While spectators will not be allowed for the matches in the wake of surge in COVID-19 cases in and around Pune, both India and England will have plenty of reasons to try and outperform each other in the three-match series, starting on Tuesday at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium here. Virat Kohli’s Men in Blue, after taming the No. 1-ranked T20 side 3-2, will hope to repeat the feat against the reigning World champion side in ODIs. For England, the series will provide a chance to stamp its supremacy and avenge the narrow loss in the T20I series. Unseasonal showers With Pune experiencing unseasonal showers over the last couple of days, it will certainly impact conditions a bit. But it’s the cloud of T20 World Cup that’s hovering over the team managements with both captains hinting that the series will present an opportunity to test newer players with an eye on the mega event to be played in India in October-November. India will be hoping to accommodate Suryakumar Yadav and Rishabh Pant in its starting line-up. While Suryakumar made an excellent impact on debut in the T20I series, Pant has done very well with the willow and behind the wickets ever since he was excluded from India’s squad for its last ODI series in Australia towards the end of 2020. With Kohli confirming Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan set to continue their successful partnership at the top and the captain and Shreyas Iyer certainties in the middle-order, if Suryakumar and Pant are to be included, it will have to be at the expense of K.L. Rahul. It will be interesting to see whether M. Prasidh Krishna, the speedster who has been closely monitored by Kohli for the T20 World Cup, will earn a debut on Tuesday. With Jofra Archer out of the series owing to fitness concerns, England will want Mark Wood to be at his best if its attack has to pose questions of a strong batting line-up. England will also be without Joe Root, who has been given a break. Liam Livingstone could be handed an ODI debut.  The teams (from):   India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Rohit Sharma (Vice-capt.), Shikhar Dhawan, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rishabh Pant (wk), K.L. Rahul (wk), Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Krunal Pandya, Washington Sundar, T. Natarajan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Shardul Thakur.   England: Eoin Morgan (Capt.), Jonny Bairstow (wk), Sam Billings (wk), Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Tom Curran, Liam Livingstone, Matt Parkinson, Adil Rashid, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, Reece Topley and Mark Wood.

23 March 2021||Chennai,||Prasidh Krishna has arrived, with pace and bounce||Prasidh Krishna wants batsmen to smell leather. He hustles those facing him with bounce, pegs them back with his pace. He is yet another tall, loose-limbed paceman from the stables of the MRF Pace Foundation. “I like to bowl quick,” says the 25-year-old Karnataka lad who once breached the 150- kmph mark in the IPL. Now he finds himself in the Indian team for the ODI series against England and is excited at the development. Positive influence Looking back, Prasidh cannot forget the positive influence the MRF Pace Foundation has had on his career. He told The Hindu ,“We come to the Foundation in Chennai. There is a gym and a swimming pool. We just train for six to seven weeks getting our body into shape.” He added, “Then the great Glenn McGrath would arrive and he would be with you for three hours every session under the hot sun, sharing his thoughts on your bowling, suggesting improvements. It’s awesome stuff coming from him.” And M. Senthilnathan, the head coach at the Pace Foundation, would call him up from time to time, motivating him, impressing on him to bowl to his strengths. What are his strengths? He is quick with his reply. “My bounce and pace.” But then, he realises that pacemen with speed could be taken for runs when batsmen use the pace to direct the ball to different corners. Effective weapon This is precisely why Prasidh is working on accuracy and control without compromising on speed. “The yorker is a very effective weapon and I realise it.” Someone with a high-arm action and a semi side-on release, Prasidh has a lot going for him. Watch him in action and you can see an unmistakable rhythm in his bowling. Prasidh grew up watching the heroics of Brett Lee, his favourite bowler. “He reversed the ball at a terrific pace and got the ball to climb viciously.” He learnt much during his time with Kolkata Knight Riders where he brushed shoulders with some formidable names. And as he waited to break into the Karnataka Ranji squad, Prasidh honed his skills. Now he shoots to kill. Batsmen beware!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/prasidh-krishna-has-arrived-with-pace-and-bounce/article34136877.ece
23 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||National champion tag sits easy on Shrivalli Rashmikaa||The newly-crowned National hardcourt tennis champion Shrivalli Rashmikaa attributes her memorable win to hours of effort and meditation to help stay calm under pressure. Perfect timing The 19-year-old from the City, now ranked India No. 16, says her National title couldn’t have come at a better time. She had finished runner-up in the Rs. 1 lakh AITA tournament in Chennai after two first-round losses in ITF events in Pune and Delhi after the lockdown was lifted. “Definitely, the tag of National champion means a lot. I never expected it would happen so quickly. I felt proud when I saw my name on the display board alongside all those big names,” said Rashmikaa in a chat with The Hindu on her return to the City. “A morale-booster, indeed!” Finding her rhythm had not been an issue, she said, as she had not ceased working on all aspects of her game even during the lockdown. “I was in touch constant touch with my coaches,” she said. “Training with A.R. Anand Kumar at Anand Tennis Academy and with M. Ravichander Rao Sir at Sinnet Tennis Academy is really helping me a lot,” said the B.Com student of St. Francis College (Begumpet). Simple Sindhu Rashmikaa’s focus has been on all-round improvement with emphasis on physical conditioning. She thanked sponsors Phoenix Group and Praneeth Group for their support. “It was great having strengthening exercises along with (badminton) World champion P.V. Sindhu at the Suchitra Academy under the guidance of G. Sivaprasad sir,” she said. An ardent fan of Roger Federer and Maria Sharapov, Rashmikaa found Sindhu “a nice and humble human being”. Year-end goals She is determined to improve her WTA rankings (No. 1100) by the year-end and realise her dream of playing in a Grand Slam. “A tough journey ahead, but I am ready for the challenges. I am already in preparatory mode for the two $25,000 events in April and May in Haryana and for the European circuit later on,” Rashmika concluded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/national-champion-tag-sits-easy-on-shrivalli-rashmikaa/article34137097.ece
23 March 2021||Mumbai,||Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby to be run on March 28||The 79th edition of the ‘Blue Riband of the Indian Turf’, the Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby will be staged at the Mahalaxmi race course here on March 28 (Sunday). Owing to the restrictions imposed by the Government on pubic events, this edition will be a closed-door affair, with no ticketing for the general public and COVID-19 protocols in place. With a total prize money of nearly Rs. 1.5 crore, the event, however, will be available via live streaming on SEA-based Sports Tech Business, 1 Play Sport’s Facebook and YouTube handles and across digital platforms. Safety protocols RWITC has taken stringent measures to ensure all required safety precautions are followed. Limited number of people, largely involved in organising the event, are being allowed into the venue. Speaking to the media, Gurpreet Singh, head marketing, United Breweries Limited said, “the Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby is the most prestigious equestrian racing event of the year. “In a normal year we would have had a packed house with sports, racing and fashionista aficionados coming together in large numbers and showing their unending support to witness the majestic event in full fanfare, including entertainment that would have kept everyone engaged late into the night. “This year the teams are working together to ensure a safe environment for those conducting and covering the event so that we are able to bring to our patrons an immersive racing experience via 1 Play Sport’s Facebook and YouTube handles.” RWITC honoured Mr. Zavaray Poonawalla, chairman, RWITC, stated “the RWITC is honoured to host yet another edition of the Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby. “Despite the restrictions on spectators coming in, we look forward to experiencing the crowning of the Indian champion. “The RWITC along with our long-standing partners, United Breweries Limited continue to strive towards a grand success of the event while taking all safety precautions required.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kingfisher-ultra-indian-derby-to-be-run-on-march-28/article34137288.ece
23 March 2021||KOLKATA,||Nikhat upbeat after her success in Turkey||For Nikhat Zareen, returning to competition after a year, beating two World champions in a row to land a bronze medal in the Bosphorus tournament in Turkey is a huge confidence-booster. A former World junior champion and an Asian championships bronze medallist, Nikhat now wants to build on this performance and prepare herself for the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games in 2022. “I re-joined the National camp on January 8 and the fact that I could produce such a performance in about two months of training gives me a lot of confidence. “Now I will prepare myself for the big events next year,” Nikhat told The Hindu after returning to the camp on Monday.  Getting back to the disciplined life of a boxer, following the lockdown and other engagements, was never easy for Nikhat, who had last participated in the Strandja memorial tournament in January 2020. But her positive attitude and willingness to take on challenges helped her re-adapt to a regimented life.  Baffled The 24-year-old was baffled to see the 51kg draw at the Bosphorus event. “I did not know how to react. But I stayed calm and thought, ‘This is a new beginning. If I do well here, then I can make an impact’,” said Nikhat. “I took some time to get back my rhythm in the first bout, but grew in confidence as the tournament progressed. Now I have the satisfaction of starting off well, beating two Worlds champions (Paltceva Ekaterina of Russia and Nazym Kyzaibay of Kazakhstan) before losing to a Worlds silver medallist (Busenaz Cakiroglu of Turkey). “I can learn from this experience and work on getting back to my best,” said Nikhat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nikhat-upbeat-after-her-success-in-turkey/article34136796.ece
23 March 2021||Tokyo,||No volunteers from abroad for Tokyo||Volunteers from abroad will not be allowed into Japan for the postponed Tokyo Olympics, organisers said on Monday. The announcement came two days after Tokyo organisers said they would ban international fans from coming into Japan. Both measures are aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Organisers said a limited number of volunteers might be allowed if they have special skills. No other choice “I’m really sorry, but we have decided there is no other choice but to drop the plan,” said Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organising committee. Organisers had planned to use about 80,000 unpaid volunteers. The Tokyo Metropolitan government had lined up 30,000 more. Most, of course, are from Japan. It’s not clear how many will be needed with few overseas fans in attendance. Japan's Kyodo news agency, quoting “sources close to the matter,” said around 500 overseas volunteers would be given exemptions to enter Japan. The first big test for the Olympics begins on Thursday with the torch relay starting from northeastern Japan. The relay will last 121 days, involve 10,000 runners, and end at the opening ceremony in Tokyo’s new National Stadium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/no-volunteers-from-abroad-for-tokyo/article34136805.ece

23 March 2021||Madrid,||Barcelona in scintillating form||Lionel Messi scored twice on Sunday as Barcelona trounced Real Sociedad 6-1 to keep the pressure on Atletico Madrid, which squeezed past Alaves thanks to a late penalty save from Jan Oblak. Oblak’s 86th-minute heroics ensured Luis Suarez’s 500th career goal was enough for a 1-0 victory at the Wanda Metropolitano, meaning the gap at the top of LaLiga remains at four points, with 10 games left to play. But the contrast between Atletico’s nervy win against 19th-placed Alaves and Barca’s demolition of a Real Sociedad side with hopes of qualifying for Europe spoke volumes about where the momentum lies in the Spanish title race. Barcelona has hit its stride, the six goals against Real Sociedad no less than it deserved for a scintillating attacking display, and perhaps its best since Ronald Koeman took charge. Messi’s record Messi scored his 11th and 12 goals in his last 10 games, and made it 16 in 12 this year. The 33-year-old has also now passed Xavi Hernandez’s record of 767 Barcelona appearances, which he had equalled against Huesca on Monday. Alexandre Lacazette completed Arsenal’s comeback from three goals down to draw 3-3 and prevent West Ham from moving level on points with fourth-place Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday. Two own goals West Ham’s capitulation — after conceding two own-goals — keeps the team in fifth place, now two points behind Chelsea after playing its game in hand. Arsenal is nine points from the four Champions League places after recovering a point from a game it looked to have lost after conceding three times in the opening 32 minutes. Tottenham bounced back from a shock Europa League exit to Dinamo Zagreb with a 2-0 win at Aston Villa on Sunday to rekindle its hopes of a top-four finish. Jose Mourinho made eight changes in an attempt to summon a response and got the result he needed.

23 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||The man who padded up and batted for women’s cricket||Kanyaon ki cricket hogi, zaroor aayiye (There will be a cricket match by girls, do come). Thus announced Mahendra Kumar Sharma on a microphone, as he moved around the streets of Lucknow in an autorickshaw one Saturday afternoon five decades ago. Those were the earliest days for women’s cricket in India. Has come a long way There was no such announcement this past weekend, but an excellent crowd — notwithstanding the recent increase in COVID-19 cases — turned up at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium on Sunday to watch India take on South Africa in the second T20I match. The women’s game has indeed a come long away. It is a strange coincidence that big-time women’s cricket is back in the historic city fifty years after those matches were played at the rather small ground of the Queen’s Anglo Sanskrit College, which was established in 1888. The tournament was conceived by Sharma, who wanted to form an organisation for women’s cricket in India. The weekend matches were the first trials for that. After listening to Sharma’s publicity campaign on autorickshaw, some 200 curious people had come for the match — mainly to see if the girls played in skirts! Among those who had heard the announcement was Shubhankar Mukherjee, then a college student who used to play cricket. He was made the scorer by Sharma. “I had to do the scoring because the scorer employed by Sharma didn’t turn up in time,” Mukherjee told The Hindu over phone. “Those days, for the people in Lucknow, the Indian Standard Time didn’t matter much. So when the scorer was asked to come at 10 o’clock, he came in at 11.” Sharma, however, knew the importance of time and worked hard towards forming an association to promote women’s cricket. The Women’s Cricket Association of India (WCAI) thus came into being in 1973. “But for Sharma, women’s cricket would not have taken off the way it did in India,” said Shubhangi Kulkarni former India all-rounder who was the secretary of the WCAI when it merged with the BCCI in 2006. “He organised cricket events and also made cricketers like Diana Eduljee, Shanta Rangaswamy and Sudha Shah known to the public.” Sharma, who has been unwell for some time, is hardly remembered or acknowledged for the pioneering worked he did for women’s cricket. Property sold “He even sold a property of his in Lucknow to promote the game,” said Mukherjee, a former Indian Railways officer who had been an assistant manager of the Indian women’s team. Shubhangi feels Sharma deserves to be recognised properly for his contribution. “Not that he minds it,” she said. “He is just happy to find that women’s cricket has become so big.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-man-who-padded-up-and-batted-for-womens-cricket/article34136743.ece
23 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Indian women to play for pride||For most of the first half of the second T20I at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium on Sunday night, the future of Indian women’s cricket was on display. And it looked bright. Shafali Varma (17 years old), Richa Ghosh (17), Harleen Deol (22) and Jemimah Rodrigues (20), between them, scored 138 out of India’s total of 158 for four. While Jemimah and Shafali have already established themselves in the Indian team, Richa and Harleen haven’t, but they very well could, sooner than later. India, however, failed to defend a good total, as the team paid the price for poor fielding. South Africa thus won the series — its first against India in this format — with a game to spare. Improvement in fielding The final game, to be played on Tuesday, therefore may be of little consequence as far as the rubber goes, but the Women in Blue will surely want to avoid a whitewash. They will have to come up with an improved display, especially in fielding and bowling. South Africa’s batting has been pretty dominant and its depth has worried the Indian bowling greatly. Somebody has been there to take the visitors home, like 21-year-old Laura Wolvaardt on Sunday, when she scored an unbeaten 53 (39b). It will be interesting to see if the young Indian players can also deliver when it matters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-women-to-play-for-pride/article34136748.ece
23 March 2021||Pune,||Players need to be consulted on schedule, says Virat Kohli||Underlining the fallout of living in a biosecure hub, a necessity for professional cricketers during the pandemic, India captain Virat Kohli on Monday stressed on the need for players to be consulted before finalising the cricket calendar. “Scheduling is something that’s not in our control. For us, international games... every game is important and every game has value. It’s an opportunity to represent your team. For us, that remains our sole focus,” Kohli said on Monday, ahead of the first ODI versus England. “Scheduling and workload, everyone will have to be very aware of and keep an eye out for. You never know when restrictions can come in place. “In future, we might have to play in bubbles so it’s very important to consider how much cricket we are playing. Mental side as well  “It’s not just the physical side but mental side as well. Players need to be spoken and consulted with. “Otherwise, it’s going to be a case of who can last through difficult times like these. “If a player moves away and someone else replaces them, I don’t think that’s healthy for a cricket system and a cricket culture moving forward which we want to create stronger and stronger.” Take on umpire’s call The recent Test series and T20I series between the two teams has brought back focus on the “umpires call” element in the Decision Review System. While the Marylebone Cricket Committee, after deliberating on the rule, expressed its support to use the umpire’s call, Kohli maintained that it leads to more confusion. “According to me, umpire’s call is creating a lot more confusion. When you get bowled as a batsman, you don’t consider that the ball was hitting more than 50% for you to be bowled. So when the ball is shown clipping the stumps, the bails are going to fall. From a basic cricket common sense, I don’t think there should be any debate,” he said. “If the ball is clipping the stumps, it should be out. Whether you like it or not you lose the review. That’s how simple the game needs to be. If it hits the stumps, or it misses the stumps, it doesn't matter how much it is hitting, and those things.”  It’s going to be exciting... three games at the same ground against a very strong Indian side is a huge opportunity for everyone  Eoin Morgan England captain||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/players-need-to-be-consulted-on-schedule-says-virat-kohli/article34136750.ece

23 March 2021||PUNE,||Zane Khan starts as favourite||It might sound odd but eighth seed Zane Khan of the US will start as the favourite in the $15,000 ITF men’s tennis tournament to be played at the Deccan Gymkhana from Tuesday. The 19-year-old Zane has dropped only one set while winning back to back titles in the last two tournaments in Lucknow and Indore. Sidharth Rawat will attempt to do better as he has the honour of being the top seed. Manish Sureshkumar and the newly crowned national champion Arjun Kadhe are the only other Indians among the seeds, at sixth and seventh respectively.

23 March 2021||PARIS,||Hamilton ready to chase his eighth title||If Lewis Hamilton wins an eighth Formula One title, he will stand alone among the sport’s greats. And that might be the perfect time to walk away from the track for good. Hamilton’s decision to pen a one-year contract with Mercedes sparked speculation that he may call it quits when the sun sets on the F1 season at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in December. Hamilton will be nearly 37 by then and, if he does successfully defend his crown, the British driver will move one ahead of fellow great Michael Schumacher. Hamilton would have nothing left to prove, with the most titles, wins (95 so far) and pole positions (98) all his. The season starts on Sunday in Bahrain after the traditional season-opening GP in Melbourne was postponed until November because of the pandemic. On the track, the pre-season did not go well for Mercedes. It gave rivals hope that a dominant series of seven straight drivers’ and constructors’ championships may at last be under genuine threat. Red Bull threat Red Bull star Max Verstappen picked up from where he left off after winning last year’s final race in Abu Dhabi in style and appeared very confident in testing. Red Bull has a stronger line-up, too, with Sergio Perez replacing Alex Albon and bringing with him nearly 200 GPs and 10 podiums, including a second place in Turkey followed by a superb win at the Sakhir GP last year. Hamilton is wary of Red Bull’s threat, saying, “It’s going to be a long battle with them.”  I think it is more when I put that helmet on, I still have that smile when I leave the garage. Will that be the case this year? We shall see. Will I enjoy it as much? We’ll see— Hamilton   George Russell of Williams showed everyone what he can do in a leading car when he replaced Hamilton at the Sakhir GP. A stunning performance almost led to a victory in a chaotic race. The 23-year-old British driver is in his final season with Williams and has been tipped for a Mercedes seat in 2022, possibly replacing Hamilton if he leaves F1   Old and new faces Two-time champion Alonso has come out of F1 retirement after missing the past two seasons and returns at the age of 39 Three drivers will be making their debuts, including Schumacher’s 22-year-old, son Mick.

23 March 2021||London,||Leicester ousts United||Leicester sent Manchester United crashing out of the FA Cup as Kelechi Iheanacho’s double sealed a 3-1 win, while Chelsea will face Manchester City in the semifinals after beating Sheffield United on Sunday. Brendan Rodgers’ side can look forward to meeting Southampton in its first FA Cup semifinal since 1982 thanks to Iheanacho’s predatory finishing at the King Power Stadium. He put Leicester ahead in Rodgers’ 100th game in charge before Mason Greenwood equalised late in the first half. Youri Tielemans restored Leicester’s lead and Nigeria striker Iheanacho wrapped up only its second win over United in 23 years and its first since 2014. Leicester, which has never won the FA Cup and last reached the final in 1969, will head to Wembley to face Southampton in April. Limp exit “I’m obviously delighted. It was a great performance. Every aspect of the game was complete,” Rodgers said. “We showed courage to play against one of Europe’s greatest teams. I told the players they were three games from history. Now it’s two.” United’s limp exit ended its run of 29 away games without defeat in all domestic competitions since losing at Liverpool in January 2020. Without a trophy since the 2017 Europa League, that competition is now its last realistic chance of winning the first silverware of boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign. After reaching the Europa League quarterfinals with a win at AC Milan in midweek, Solskjaer made five changes and United’s reshuffled line-up never looked comfortable. At Stamford Bridge, Thomas Tuchel’s much-changed side was below its best but still earned a potentially thrilling showdown with Manchester City by beating Sheffield United 2-0. Own goal Oliver Norwood’s 24th-minute own goal, the midfielder turning Ben Chilwell’s shot into the net, put it on course for the last four. Hakim Ziyech came off the bench to finish Chilwell’s pass in second-half stoppage time. The Blues are back in the FA Cup semifinals for a fourth time in the last five seasons after losing last year’s final against Arsenal. Chelsea won the last of the club’s eight FA Cups under Antonio Conte in 2018.  The results: Quarterfinals: Leicester 3 (Iheanacho 25, 78, Tielemans 52) bt Manchester United 1 (Greenwood 38).   Chelsea 2 (Norwood 24-og, Ziyech 90+2) bt Sheffield United 0.   Bournemouth 0 lost to Southampton 3 (Djenepo 37, Redmond 45+2, 59); Everton 0 lost to Manchester City 2 (Gundogan 84, De Bruyne 90).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/leicester-ousts-manchester-united-chelsea-bests-southampton/article34136819.ece

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Narayana is blemishless||The Vedas tell us how the star Uttara Bhadrapada (Uttarattadi) should be propitiated. The deity for this star is Ahirbudhnya, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. The Veda mantra says that Ahirbudhnya meditated on Himself, keeping the star Uttarattadi in focus. The purpose of this yaga to honour Uttarattadi is to obtain lasting fame. Usually, in a yaga, purodasa (the offering made of rice flour), is placed on a piece of baked clay, before the yaga proper commences. But for the yaga prescribed for Uttarattadi, the purodasa is placed directly on the ground. It is said that even if one knows about this yaga, one gets the benefits of performing it! The mantra says worship through this yaga is offered to Ahirbudhnya and to the star Uttarattadi, over which Ahirbudhnya presides. For any yaga, before the purodasa is set up, a puronuvakya is recited. It is like an announcement that the yaga is about to commence. Once the yaga is completed, there is another mantra that is recited. If one looks at the puronuvakya and the concluding mantra, one gets an idea of the significance of Uttarattadi. Ahirbudhnya is a name that is an amalgam of two words — ahih and budhnyah. Ahi means one without blemish, and is a reference to Lord Narayana. The next word budhnyah means the One who is the foundation of everything. So Ahirbudhnya is none but Lord Narayana Himself. The mantra says He is the best among all devatas. Yet He took avataras and lived amongst mortals. Tondaradippodi Azhvar praises His rushing to the aid of the elephant Gajendra, who called out to Him as ‘Adimoola,’ the One who is at the root of everything. Siva, Brahma, and the celestials marvelled that He, who was the object of the tapas of sages, had come to the aid of an elephant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/narayana-is-blemishless/article34136740.ece

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||Aiming for the stars||Suraj Sharma rediscovered his passion for working with his hands. The 27-year-old (his birthday was on March 21) actor found he had time on his hands, thanks to the pandemic, and created a couple of clay figurines. Suraj, who made his acting debut with Ang Lee’s Life of Pi (2012) feels a kinship with Hassan, the protagonist of his latest film, The Illegal . Hassan comes to the US to study film but circumstances force him to drop out. Speaking from New York, Suraj talks of his role, Life of Pi and the day he would like to repeat on a loop. Excerpts. How did you come to be attached to The Illegal ? Danish Renzu, the director, came to me with the script, which I found extremely beautiful, insightful and familiar. Hassan and I share quite a few similarities — we are both from Delhi and came to the U.S. to study film. When we were shooting, there were a lot of immigration-related questions in the news. It was important to be able to tell the story. Talking with Danish and getting his story and perspective also motivated me. What part of Hassan were you able to connect with? Well, obviously, being an outsider to the US, coming here, feeling lost, following your dreams and learning everything afresh was something Hassan and I have in common. I made friends over the years with a lot of the servers and delivery guys from Indian restaurants. They told me their stories, struggles and dreams. They became close to me and when I read the script all I could think about was them. Danish and I collaborated, he had his opinions, thoughts and experiences and we meshed them together to make Hassan. You have acted in Happy Death Day 2U where the same day repeats over and over again. If you had to choose a day to play on a loop, which one would it be? I would choose a day from school. There used to be this thing called activity week which was basically a sports day but for a week. I could go through those days, infinitely. I loved those days ( laughs ). What is your best memory of shooting for Life of Pi ? There were so many moments in that film, I cannot possibly choose one. I keep having dreams about the scene where a whale jumps out of the water with bioluminescent phytoplankton all over it. It is shining, green and glowing, and towers above him and then splashes back into the water. I do think about that moment quite a lot. How would you describe your acting journey? It has been one of learning, unlearning and understanding with a lot of room to grow. I feel I have a long way to go. It is nice to see that I have survived so far and learned all the things that I have. I have been lucky enough to keep the people that I have met during this process. What next? There are a couple of things that could possibly happen but the immediate next thing is I am going to do is a movie called Wedding Seasons. We will start shooting sometime soon and I am excited about it. The Illegal streams on Amazon Prime Video from March 23   Needful things   Reading:Brain Pickings   Listening:American rapper, J.

23 March 2021||March 23 2021 00:00 IST,||dinner now?||Riya Sarkar had some reservations about moving back home ahead of the nationwide lockdown in 2020. Having lived on her own in Mumbai for the past three years, pursuing a career in public relations, it was a big step for the 28-year-old to return to her roots in Kolkata. She recalls how her mother, during her quarantine at another flat in Kolkata, one day asked her to come to the window just so she could get a glimpse of her daughter, as she stood downstairs. The pandemic catalysed a great deal of human reshuffling, and not in the way many people wanted. Rent, other living expenses and loneliness during a time of uncertainty saw many people moving back in with their parents. When the pandemic hit, the conversation interestingly switched to: ‘you’re so lucky to be living at home!’ Ahead of the pandemic anniversary (now-called ‘panni anni’ on social media), MetroPlus speaks to people as they look at the year that was not, spending time with their families. “That first hug after the 15-day quarantine was special. I woke up that morning with so much excitement,” says Riya, “and I had not packed up my things to go from the quarantine flat to my home. I just ran home to see everyone who were all still eating breakfast!” Riya slept next to her mom who would put her to bed every night, like when she was a child. Rediscovering relationships For Vishakha Agrawal, it had been 10 years since she last lived with her parents. She is now with them and her younger sister in Ahmedabad, as she looks back at 2020 with a lot of love. “I had been with a mindset of making it on my own in Mumbai. Now, living at home has actually been a blessing and makes so much sense. I had no routine before...now I am having breakfast and lunch with my family. I have realised it makes one more empathetic towards others. After all, they spent their entire lives building our lives.” Riya agrees, adding, “When you stay alone, you live your life with bare essentials, and over the past year, I was reminded of how much parents really do for us: like remembering we like some dishes more than others, going the extra mile to make sure we are really at home, the transport logistics of getting picked up. These were things I took for granted for too long.” A recent Master’s graduate, Heera Selvakumar, 22, was prepared to take on the world. Working as a content executive, she just secured a job at a prestigious ed-tech platform. Then the lockdown hit and she had to move from Bengaluru back home to Chennai, where she lives with her mother. “My mom had been through a lot in the past year and my grandmother was living with us under special care. She passed away. It was tough on my mom who had been so strong taking care of everything. I am glad I was there for her. We don’t realise how much our parents need us, even though they do not say it.” Not everything is rainbows and daisies; boundaries were tested to their limit over the past year. Often, arguments would break out about who would do the dishes, or who deserved priority with the better bandwidth at a given time . Vishakha agrees, “At home, there have been ‘rules’, such as everyone going to bed at a certain hour. But these responsibilities and differences helped me get through the last year, which would have otherwise been very depressing.” The sibling equation While the lockdowns brought new closeness, they also ushered in old tensions but new understandings. Siblings under the same roof agree that 2020 was a true test of endurance and understanding. Vishakha says the house-bound period impacted her relationship with her younger sister, adding she is grateful for it. “When we moved back to live with our parents on March 21, 2020, it was initially a little difficult to understand each other. We used to have arguments on miniscule things. Our parents witnessed them as the days passed and eventually had to intervene to address the issue. I realised that being the elder one, I have to understand where my sister is coming from, I would have to take it slow and make her feel loved. I spent time with her during the weekends and reminisced about our childhood by playing games from the 90s. Everyone’s efforts did help to get things back to normal.” Riya, however, points out she and her older brother have gotten closer. “We were always close, but this lockdown helped us figure out our differences, and be each other’s workout buddies. When sorting out problems in person — when you see the body language and expression, and hear the tone of the voice — you are able to see how they really feel.”  While the lockdowns brought new closeness, they also ushered in old tensions but new understandings||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/dinner-now/article34137178.ece

On January 16, the number of new cases was 94 and it slowly increased to 200 on February 24 and it has been increasing since then. “In view of the upcoming festivals, the need for more caution and regulation was stressed upon and random testing at airport and railway stations needed to be done, particularly of passengers coming from States with high incidences of COVID cases,” Mr. Baijal said. As advised by experts, according to Raj Niwas, it was decided to continue with the existing strategy of cluster-based surveillance, testing and genome sequencing.  Mr. Baijal also stressed upon the need to ramp up vaccine coverage with greater outreach and focused public education campaigns with a special emphasis on marginalised and poor sections without access to digital platforms.

23 March 2021||Guwahati,||CAA will be implemented in Assam after polls: State BJP chief||Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass has said his party will implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act after the three-phase Assembly elections in the State ends on April 6. The CAA offers fast-track citizenship to non-Muslims who allegedly fled religious persecution in three neighbouring countries and took refuge in India by December 31, 2014. “The BJP leaders may be keeping quiet on the issue of CAA as Assam witnessed a wave of protests after Parliament approved it. But the party stands by the law and will implement it if voted back to power,” he told journalists, adding that there was no question of going back. He reminded that the contentious Act had no impact on the series of elections during the peak of the movement against it. “The CAA did not prevent the BJP from increasing its seat tally from seven to nine during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Our party also won the panchayat and the tribal council polls before that,” he said. On Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s promises that his party will not allow the CAA implementation in Assam, Mr. Dass said: “Even our booth level workers know better than him about the Act.” Mr. Dass is contesting the Patacharkuchi seat in western Assam. He had won the Sorbhog seat further west in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/caa-will-be-implemented-in-assam-after-polls-state-bjp-chief/article34136974.ece
23 March 2021||Guwahati,||‘BJP functioning like mafia in Assam’||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday said the BJP-led government in Assam has been functioning like the mafia to run various syndicates. She also took a swipe at the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), the BJP’s main regional ally, for being reduced to a bheegi billi (wet, frightened cat) in the process of cosying up to the saffron party. Epic analogy Addressing Congress rallies at Sarupathar, Kaliabor and Batadroba on the second day of her campaign in the State, Ms. Vadra said the BJP’s much-vaunted “double engine” was actually two factions — one led by ‘Dhritarashtra’ and the other by ‘Shakuni Mama’. She did not take names but made it apparent that she meant Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma respectively. Characters from the epic Mahabharata, Dhritarashtra was the visually impaired king of Hastinapur and Shakuni his scheming brother-in-law. “The Assam government has a Dhritarashtra and a Shakuni Mama. The duo and the BJP have betrayed the people of Assam by letting syndicates reign,” Ms. Vadra said. She also reminded the people that “this Dhritarashtra was once called Jatiya Nayak (people’s leader) who betrayed the six ethnic communities in Assam whom he had promised to grant Scheduled Tribe status.” Mr. Sonowal had earned the moniker after challenging the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act in the Supreme Court and having it quashed. The six communities demanding ST status are Adivasi or “tea tribes”— Chutiya, Koch-Rajbongshi, Matak, Moran and Tai-Ahom. “Shakuni Mama runs a corrupt government that only cheats people,” Ms. Vadra said. Barb at AGP The Congress leader visited Batadroba Satra, a Vaishnavite monastery and the birthplace of 15th-16th century saint-reformer Srimanta Sankaradeva. The satras are central to the BJP’s campaign against alleged Bangladeshi encroachers of Assam’s land. At a rally later, Ms. Vadra chose to attack the AGP more than the BJP. “The BJP always weakens its allies. The elephant (AGP’s symbol) of Assam has been reduced to a bheegi billi . Tying up with these people (BJP) comes at a cost. They weaken every supporter because their only ideology is to stick to power,” Ms Vadra said. “The AGP cannot even take any internal party decision in Assam today. They need the approval of Delhi for their internal party matters as well,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-functioning-like-mafia-in-assam/article34136977.ece
23 March 2021||GUWAHATI:,||Shah, Nadda slam Congress for aligning with Ajmal’s AIUDF||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday slammed the Congress for aligning with perfume baron, Maulana Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). BJP national president Jagat Prakash Nadda echoed him at another party rally besides criticising Congress for compromising the security of the country. “We worked for the development of Assam whereas Congress is forging an alliance with Badruddin Ajmal. If they come to power infiltration in the State will increase. Do you want to stop infiltration? Congress party should be ashamed of allying with Ajmal,” Mr. Shah told a crowed at a BJP rally at Jonai in Dhemaji district. The AIUDF is a key constituent of the 10-party Mahajot or grand alliance that the Congress heads.  ‘Steps to check floods’ At Majuli, where he campaigned for Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Mr. Shah said the BJP would build large reservoirs and channels to solve Assam’s perennial flood problem. Majuli, an “island” in the Brahmaputra River, is flood-prone. At Rajgarh Tea Estate under Tingkhong Assembly constituency in Dibrugarh district, Mr. Nadda hit out at Congress for tying up with AIUDF. “Congress means politics of opportunism. It has allied with the Muslim League in Kerala and with the party of Badruddin Ajmal in Assam. (Former Chief Minister) Tarun Gogoi had condemned Ajmal, but his son has joined hands with him today,” the BJP chief said. Mr. Nadda also faulted Congress for not giving importance to Assam’s security, leading to extremism and increase in infiltration at the border. “Congress has hurt Assam’s culture by patronising infiltrators and fanning violence,” he said, claiming there were no incidents of curfew having been imposed during the five years of the Sonowal government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/shah-nadda-slam-congress-for-aligning-with-ajmals-aiudf/article34136967.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||22-yr-old kills friend for seeking ‘sexual favours’||A 22-year-old man allegedly killed his friend in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar in the small hours of Monday, the police said.

At 4.30 a.m., the accused, resident of Trilokpuri and a labourer, was on his way to the police station, wearing bloodstained clothes. He spotted a police van and when they asked him about the blood, he confessed to the crime. “He said he hit Bharat’s head with a heavy stone lying at Vasundhara Road,” Mr. Yadav said. IHe said he committed the crime as the victim used to ask him for sexual favours and he often had to give in. “On the accused’s instance, Bharat’s body was recovered from the spot and a case under section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC has been registered,” Mr. Yadav added. The police said it has also been revealed that Bharat was asking the accused for money to buy a phone. Further probe is under way.

23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two booked for duping businessman||Two persons have been booked for duping a businessman of Rs. 25 lakh on pretext of getting him project work at Jewar airport, the police said on Monday. The victim has been identified as Pratap Singh, owner of Proprietor of Pratap Builders. He told the police that Karan Kumar and Sujit Kumar Mishra introduced themselves as YEIDA employees and also called him from office landline of the authority. They offered a work order of earth filling at Jewar Airport in U.P. Next, Kumar and Mishra took Rs. 25 lakh from Mr. Singh as security money to be taken to the Zurich office in order to obtain the welcome letter and the work order in favour of his firm on February 9 at Hotel Taj Palace in New Delhi. “We paid the amount by withdrawing cash from my personal bank accounts. We received a mail as well as a message on the same day at 6 p.m., claiming welcome of our firm. However, since the email ID did not seem to be genuine, we got worried and later got to know that it was fake,” Mr. Singh said. He also mentioned that he came to know that every claim — regarding interactions with company officials that the duo made — were untrue. The duo had also taken a phone worth Rs. 55,000 under the pretense of giving it to some official in the Home Ministry as gift. An FIR has been registered under relevant sections and probe is under way, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-booked-for-duping-businessman/article34136979.ece
23 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||JNUTA questions interim V-C chairing council meet||The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) raised questions regarding the Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar chairing the Academic Council meeting of the university on Monday as he was continuing at his post as an interim administrator. “The continuation of Mr. Kumar as the Vice-Chancellor as per the order of the Ministry of Education is not an extension of his term and places him only in a position of an interim administrator until the appointment of a new Vice-Chancellor. Implicit in this arrangement is the understanding that he will not indulge in exercising powers in this interim period that are otherwise part of the official duties of a regular V-C,” the JNUTA said. The JNUTA alleged that taking decisions on subjects like changes in admission policies of the university and conduct of Central University Common Entrance Test, appointments, introduction of new academic courses and programmes raised questions of “administrative overreach” by the caretaker V-C. “Mr. Kumar once again demonstrated his open disdain for participatory and deliberative processes of decision making by denying certain members of the Academic Council, including former Deans and Chairpersons, their right to table opinion even once, despite consistent raising of hands during the course of the two-and-a-half-hour long meeting,” the JNUTA said. ‘Well rehearsed script’ The teachers said that the meeting played out like a script that appeared to be well rehearsed in advance as certain members of the Academic Council were specifically asked to speak even when they did not voluntarily raise their hands. The JNUTA added that response is awaited on the official clarification sought by it from the Ministry of Education and the UGC on the powers of an interim V-C. It also stressed on the need to appoint a new Vice-Chancellor at the earliest. The JNU administration did not comment on what transpired at the meeting.  The continuation of Mr. Kumar as the V-C as per the order of the Ministry of Education is not an extension of his term and places him only in a position of an interim administrator JNUTA||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jnuta-questions-interim-v-c-chairing-council-meet/article34136980.ece
23 March 2021||GURUGRAM,||Bail plea in 2017 school murder case dismissed||The District and Sessions Court here on Monday dismissed the bail plea of a juvenile in conflict with the law in the murder case of an eight-year-old boy inside the school premises in 2017 saying that it was “neither maintainable before this court, nor any other ground has been made out to consider such request of granting bail”. In his order, Additional Sessions Judge Amit Sahrawat observed that the earlier bail applications were dismissed up to the Supreme Court, and the question whether the applicant should be considered as a juvenile or an adult for the purpose of trial was still pending. Status quo Mr. Sahrawat said the Supreme Court in its order on November 19, 2018 had directed to maintain status quo and “in such circumstances, this application for bail is not maintainable in any case before this court”. The applicant’s counsel Sandeep Aneja argued that the juvenile has been in custody since November 7, 2017 without any reason as there was no incriminating evidence in chargesheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. He also argued that the State government had declined sanction for prosecuting the four officers of Haryana Police, which showed the genuineness of the investigation made by the State police when another person had been booked as an accused in this case. Administrative action The Judge, however, observed that denial of sanction was an “administrative action” and may not be taken as a falsification of the entire case. The complainant’s counsel Sushil K. Tekriwal, opposing the bail, argued that the applicant was habitually filing bail applications and several such applications moved earlier by him in different courts were dismissed. CBI prosecutor Amit Jindal said the bail application may not be considered by this court without any change in circumstances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bail-plea-in-2017-school-murder-case-dismissed/article34136981.ece

The AIUDF is one of the key constituents of the 10-party Mahajot or grand alliance led by the Congress. At a rally in central Assam’s Jamunamukh where his brother Sirajuddin Ajmal is contesting, the AIUDF president said: “It is getting clearer by the day that the Mahajot will form the next government. The BJP is so scared that its leaders have nothing to say apart from shouting ‘Ajmal, Ajmal’ everywhere.” He named Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma as the chief architects of the “fear of Ajmal”, equating him with Bangladeshis and Mughals from whom the BJP has vowed to save Assam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-selling-fear-of-ajmal-aiudf-chief/article34136969.ece
