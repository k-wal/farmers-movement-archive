The Ministry statement followed an interaction between I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar and representatives of OTT platforms. The statement said that during the interaction, Mr. Javadekar said the Ministry was open to any clarification or queries from the industry. “The Minister said it merely requires them to disclose information and that there is no requirement of registration of any kind with the Ministry,” the statement said, adding that the Ministry would soon release a form for the same. The statement, quoting Mr. Javadekar, further said, “The rules focus on self classification of content instead of any form of censorship.” The OTT platforms, he said, were expected to develop an effective grievance redressal mechanism to tackle complaints raised about the content on these platforms. “Dispelling rumours, the Minister clarified that in the self-regulating body, no member will be appointed by the government,” the statement said. He informed the industry representatives that under the rules, the government would create an inter-departmental committee to look at complaints that remain unresolved at the self-regulatory level. Representatives of Alt Balaji, Hotstar, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Jio, Zee5, Viacom18, Shemaroo and MxPlayer among others attended the virtual interaction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ott-platforms-will-not-have-to-register-centre/article33993204.ece
05 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||20 from Myanmar seek refuge in India||At least 20 people, including some security personnel, have crossed to Mizoram from military coup-hit Myanmar and have sought refuge in India. Border residents in Champhai and Serchhip districts claimed that at least 50 people from Myanmar had crossed over since March 3. All belong to the Chin ethnic group, to which the Mizo community belongs. There have been no reports yet from Hnahtial, Lawngtlai and Siaha, the other districts bordering Myanmar. Serchhip’s SP Stephen Lalrinawma has been quoted as saying some of those who sought refuge were security personnel and they had escaped because of their inability to follow certain instructions. “We cannot confirm right now whether or not they are policemen. Three people crossed over yesterday [Wednesday] and some more came today. They have been put up at a community hall in Lungkawlh village after the mandatory COVID-19 tests,” Serchhip’s Deputy Commissioner Kumar Abhishek told The Hindu . The village is about 8 km from the border with Myanmar. India shares a 1,643 km land border with Myanmar, where at least 50 people have died since the military coup on February 1. Food and shelter “We are providing food and shelter to the people. We have also sent a report to the Home Department and are awaiting instructions on what to do with the refugees,” Mr. Abhishek said. His Champhai counterpart Maria C.T. Zuali said four people had crossed over into her district on Thursday afternoon. “I heard more people had crossed over to other districts but I don’t have the details,” she said. People from Myanmar’s Chin community and the Mizos share a common ancestry. The Chin people are concentrated in Myanmar’s Chin State, which shares a 404 km porous border with Mizoram. Claiming that the people had been affected by the civil unrest, the Mizo Students’ Union in Mizoram had in February appealed to the State government seeking political asylum for them. But the government said it had not received any request for asylum. “So far, none has applied to us seeking political sanctuary or political asylum. If at all there is a request, we will take a decision. It has to be ratified by the Centre since the issue concerns two countries,” Mizoram Home Minister Lalchamliana said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/20-from-myanmar-seek-refuge-in-india/article33993202.ece

05 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Bengaluru ranked most liveable large city||Bengaluru has been adjudged the most liveable large city in the country, as per the Ease of Living Index (EoLI) – 2020, released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on Thursday. This is a big leap from the 58th position in the previous edition of the index in 2018. “The Bengaluru model of development of citizen-centric initiatives and delivery of services has ensured the top ranking,” Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who also holds charge of the city, tweeted. However, the top ranking in EoLI is sobered up by a low ranking of 31 among 49 cities with a population of over one million in the Municipal Performance Index (MPI), scoring below average in the same population category.Meanwhile, in EoLI, Hubballi-Dharwad was ranked 37th among 49 cities with over one million population, while Davangere was ranked ninth, Mangaluru 20th, Tumakuru 23rd, Sagar 25th, Shivamogga 26th, and Belagavi 47th among 62 cities with less than one million population. Inexplicably, Mysuru, conventionally known to have a high quality of life , was not part of the 111 cities reviewed and ranked for the index. While sources in the Urban Development Department said Mysuru was not included as it was not selected as a Smart City, a few cities not part of the Smart City Mission had also been considered for the index.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bengaluru-most-liveable-large-city/article33993655.ece
05 March 2021||CHENNAI,||‘Nearly 450 cases from 209 families in 15 days’||Family clusters are the latest cause of worry for the Health Department as nearly 450 of the COVID-19 cases reported in the last 15 days were from 209 families, many of whom had attended marriages and funerals, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said. “Though Tamil Nadu is reporting less than 500 cases a day, we have clusters of COVID-19 cases. There are family clusters,” he told presspersons after inspecting the State Vaccine Centre along with the Central team on Thursday. He listed out the number of cases reported among families in Chennai in the last 15 days. There were 80 positive cases from 34 families in Kodambakkam; six from two families in Tiruvottiyur; six from two families in Madhavaram; nine from one family in Tondiarpet; 16 from two families in Royapuram; 58 from 27 families in Ayanavaram; 32 from 12 families in Ambattur; 51 from 19 families in Anna Nagar; 25 from eight families in Teynampet; 33 from 24 families in Alandur; 82 from 37 families in Adyar; 35 from 18 families in Perungudi; and nine cases from two families in Sholinganallur. “From nearly 209 families, we have had 450 persons and their contacts testing positive for COVID-19 in the last 15 days. When we inquired, many of them had attended marriages and funerals,” he said. A similar situation prevailed in the districts neighbouring Chennai — Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. The Health Department had collected fine to the tune of Rs. 13 crore from around 14 lakh people for violating COVID-19 norms, he said. All Collectors had been instructed to increase testing in markets, hostels and places where crowds converged. “Active cases stood at 0.47% in the State. We have less than 4,000 active cases. At one point in time, we had 60,000 active cases,” the Health Secretary said. While 98% persons have recovered from COVID-19, the State’s mortality rate was 1.47%. With elections round the corner, people should be more careful, he said, adding that Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo had issued an advisory for COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. Strict action would be taken in case of COVID-19 norms violations, Mr. Radhakrishnan added. “The Central team has said that the cases have reduced to a large extent, and has asked us to follow intensive action for another month,” he said. Meanwhile, the Centre has so far supplied 27,84,330 doses of COVID-19 vaccines for Tamil Nadu, of which 25.07 lakh doses were Covishield and 2.77 lakh doses Covaxin, Mr. Radhakrishnan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/450-cases-from-209-families-in-15-days/article33993719.ece

05 March 2021||New Delhi,||Content needs to be checked, says SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday made it clear to over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video that it is in favour of “screening” the content shown by them. It said some of the films hosted by the platforms were pornographic. “Traditional film viewing has become extinct. Now, films and web series are viewed by the public on these platforms. Should there not be some screening? We feel there should be some screening... There is pornography on some films,” Justice Ashok Bhushan, leading a Bench, also comprising Justice R. Subhash Reddy, observed. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Amazon producer Aparna Purohit’s bail, said this “was not about pornography but the right to freedom of expression”. “But a balance has to be struck,” Justice Bhushan retorted. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta said the content included “filthy abuses”. The hearing was based on a plea by Ms. Purohit, Amazon Prime’s commercial head, against the Allahabad High Court decision to deny her pre-arrest bail in connection with the probe into Tandav , a web series hosted by the platform. The FIR said the series ridiculed Hindu gods and the country’s political power corridors. Justice Bhushan said the court wanted to consider Ms. Purohit’s case in the light of the new guidelines notified by the government to hold social media and OTT platforms accountable for their content. The Bench asked the guidelines to be placed on record and scheduled a hearing for March 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/content-needs-to-be-checked-says-sc/article33993199.ece

Jaishankar said on Thursday. At a joint press conference with his Bangladesh counterpart A.K. Abdul Momen in Dhaka, he said India was partnering with the neighbouring country in economic and health-related recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Every death is regrettable but we also have to ask ourselves why is there a problem, and the problem is because of crime. So our shared objective should be a no crime-no death border and I am sure if we can get it right, we can address this problem effectively.” Mr. Jaishankar added that several of the reported deaths [of Bangladesh nationals] “are fairly deep inside India”. The Indian statement comes in the backdrop of increased incidents of killings of Bangladesh nationals in 2020. Dhaka Tribune, in a report in last December, the said the incidents of killings was the highestin 2020 within a decade. Mr. Jaishankar, however, highlighted the broader contours of India-Bangladesh relation, which witnessed India choosing Bangladesh for the largest consignment of COVID-19 vaccines that Delhi had sent abroad.

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Haryana’s new job quota rule worries India Inc.||Warning that its move to reserve private sector jobs for locals “spells disaster” for industrial development and private investment in Haryana, India Inc. has asked the State to “relook” the legislation, highlighting the lack of adequate availability of skilled manpower. Industry sources cautioned that this may force a rework of their expansion plans in the State, adding that it could also provide a shield to some firms indulging in unethical practices to retrench the existing workforce. The Haryana Governor earlier this week approved a Bill that reserves 75% of jobs in the private sector that pay less than Rs. 50,000 per month for candidates from the State. “Investors and entrepreneurs need to source the best human resources available in the country to be competitive and successful. To force them in such a regressive straightjacket will force them to look beyond Haryana and this will ultimately hurt the interests of the State,” Uday Shankar, president, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), said on Thursday. ‘Against statute’ Mr. Shankar added that the industry body believes the move was against the spirit of the Constitution, which gives citizens of India the freedom to work anywhere in the country. Other industry bodies, including the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA), the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), have requested the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Haryana government to reconsider the legislation while pitching for a consultation with the industry. Skilled workers needed Deepak Jain, president, ACMA, said, “Our industry requires skilled workforce to produce high quality products that are globally competitive. Hiring in our sector is done on the basis of merit and talent rather than the domicile of the candidates. The reason for the industry to employ candidates from outside the State is due to the shortage of adequately skilled and locally available manpower.” Mr. Jain also highlighted that the automotive industry, with investments of over Rs. 40,000 crore, accounts for more than 25% of the State’s GDP and creates employment for over 10 lakh people. NASSCOM added that the move would impact the business friendly image of the State and be detrimental to Gurugram’s growth trajectory as an IT-BPM (Infomation Technology-Business Process Management) hub. Stating that it had already raised industry’s concerns with the State government, NASSCOM added that the growth of the IT-BPM industry was closely intertwined with the availability of skilled talent on demand and such restrictions would be limiting for the industry. In a representation to the State government, CII has stated that the industry should be consulted to understand the overall impact on the State’s economy and employment arising out of the job reservation law. Noting that Haryana is facing tough competition from other States in terms of attracting industrial investment, the CII added that all major industrial houses have maintained that the Act was going to affect their businesses in a big way and they were now looking to rework their expansion plans in Haryana. CII has recommended that the State may, after analysis and discussions, come out with a percentage and also the associated incentives to be offered to industry for employing local people. It added that job reservation for locals could not be made mandatory for existing units as they could not lay off a trained employee from other States to give those jobs to locals. “The purpose can be achieved in case of new industrial units being set up and offering attractive incentives to the unit in lieu of providing reservation,” it has suggested. Recommending that there should be no penalty clause for violation of the reservation criteria, the CII has in the representation said that there needs to be a procedure to employ persons from outside in instances wherein the required talent is not available locally. According to Anupam Varma, partner at the law firm J Sagar Associates, the legality of the Act is prima facie suspect and it may not be able to withstand judicial scrutiny on the touchstone of Article 19(1)(g) and 16(2) of the Constitution of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/haryanas-new-job-quota-rule-spells-disaster-india-inc/article33993245.ece

Dakshina Kannada Bus Operators’ Association President Dilraj Alva told The Hindu that Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra had called a meeting of all the stakeholders.

The association was mulling to increase fares marginally for passengers travelling up to and from Talapady from different destinations on these buses; however fares for intermediate stages would not be increased, he said.

05 March 2021||BENGALURU,||Sparks fly over charge that debate is RSS agenda||The allegation by Opposition Congress members that the special debate in the Karnataka Assembly on the theme ‘one nation, one election’ was part the RSS agenda triggered heated exchange between Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and the protesting members. The Congress members, who resorted to protest in the well of the Assembly against the need for discussing such a theme in the ongoing session, alleged repeatedly that the topic of the debate was an “agenda of the RSS”. In a counter-attack, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri said, “Why are you bringing the name of the RSS here? Talk about us who are in this House and not the RSS.” Mr. Yediyurappa lost his cool towards the end of the day’s session, when protests continued. He said, “What is that RSS agenda you are talking about? The Prime Minister of this country himself is from the RSS.” He told Congress members that they were “grounded throughout the country” because of such an attitude. “You are shouting here just because you have some 55 members [in the House],” he said. Before winding up, he remarked, “Yes we are from the RSS. We are proud to say that.” Meanwhile, JD(S) members staged a walkout expressing dissatisfaction over they not getting an opportunity to speak. JD(S) member Bandeppa Kashempur told reporters that they were not in favour of the theme of the debate. But they wanted to convey this by participating in the debate. ‘Saves money, time’ Earlier in the day, Mr. Kageri argued that if implemented, ‘one nation, one election’ would save a lot of money, time, and burden on human resources, and accelerate the progress of the country. Amid protest by the Congress, Mr. Kageri read out his 18-page speech on the theme and said Rs. 60,000 expenditure was incurred on conducting the 2019 Lok Sabha election and elections to three States. Elections were conducted at one time for Parliament and State Assemblies from 1952 to 1967. But in the 1970s, State Assemblies were dissolved before the term and mid-term elections too were held for the Assemblies and the Lok Sabha in 1970s and 1980s onwards, he said. The Speaker quoted statements made by various leaders supporting ‘one nation, one election’ and said frequent elections in one or the other part of the country adversely impacted the economy and development. Mr. Kageri said at least five amendments had to be made to the Constitution for ‘one nation, one election’ to be implemented. Electoral reforms were the need of the hour to contain influence of money and caste in elections. He pointed out that there were 1,200 political parties in the country and of them 150 were active.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sparks-fly-over-charge-that-debate-is-rss-agenda/article33993346.ece
05 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala takes on Central govt. over KIIFB||The Kerala government is in direct confrontation with the Centre over the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) probe into the “Masala Bonds” of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) and the decision to summon its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) K.M. Abraham and Deputy Managing Director Vikramjit Singh for questioning. The ED is probing whether the KIIFB violated provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in its external borrowings through the “Masala Bonds”, which are specialised debt instruments issued outside India but denominated in Indian rupees. The ED also took note of a CAG report on Kerala finances, tabled in the State Assembly in January, which had criticised KIIFB’s borrowings through the bonds, saying these were not in accordance with the Constitutional provisions and lacked legislative approval.  ‘Smear campaign’ Close on seeking the Election Commission’s intervention on the issue, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan lashed out at Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the ED for “misusing” power, violating the model code of conduct, and attempts to create a smear campaign against the officials and the State government. Reiterating that the State would not “surrender” to such acts of the BJP-led Central government for political gains, Mr. Vijayan said “officials fulfilling Constitutional obligations are part of the government and they are being harassed by misusing laws passed by Parliament”. The officials, including women, had been subjected to harassment and “intemperate behaviour”, he said. “We are answerable to the people. Our tradition is not to budge to those coming to prevent fulfilment of the responsibility towards the people. We have legally moved against the earlier attempts of the Central agencies,” Mr. Vijayan said. According to the decision taken at the highest level to confront the ED politically, Mr. Singh, an IPS officer of Kerala cadre, ignored the summons of the ED served on March 3 to be present at the Kochi office on Thursday. Dr. Abraham, who is the CEO and Member Secretary, will also not appear before the ED on Friday. The KIIFB has communicated to the ED that the top officials would not be appearing before the officials in Kochi. Official sources said the KIIFB had communicated that all they had to say on the “Masala Bond” had been conveyed to the ED sleuths in Kochi. KIIFB officials on Thursday petitioned the Chief Minister, and Chief Secretary V.P. Joy, on their bad experience at the ED office in Kochi, sources added. In a Facebook post, Finance Minister and KIIFB Vice Chairman T.M. Thomas Isaac said the BJP’s efforts to destroy KIIFB and destabilise Kerala’s development would get a strong reply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-takes-on-central-govt-over-kiifb/article33993149.ece
05 March 2021||New Delhi,||GoM suggests steps to stem ‘negative narrative’||In an effort to “neutralise” what it calls a “negative narrative”, a Group of Ministers (GoM), formed to fine-tune “government communication”, has come out with suggestions to track “50 negative and 50 positive influencers” on social media, “neutralise the people who are writing against the government without facts and set[ting] false narratives/spread[ing] fake news” and so on. It also emerges that the decisions on capping FDI (foreign direct investment) at 26% for digital news media and the new IT rules that have a separate section dealing with code of ethics for Over The Top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix were a result of the GoM’s deliberations. The FDI cap was essential, the GoM felt, to constrict the foreign influence on Indian media. Information Technology (IT) Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani, Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Minister Prakash Javadekar, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, Urban Development Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur and Minister of State for Environment Babul Supriyo were part of the GoM, which met six times between June 14 and July 9 last year. The GoM report quotes suggestions made by the Ministers. Mr. Prasad suggested, “A list of media personnel and prominent persons, who are pro our line of thought — both nationally and globally, should be prepared. Few eminent academicians, Vice Chancellors, retired Indian Foreign Service officers etc, should be identified who can write our achievements and project our viewpoint.” Ms. Irani, who held the I&B portfolio in the previous Modi government, recommended, “We should track 50 negative and 50 positive influencers.” The suggestion has been accepted by the GoM and the I&B Ministry has been given charge to implement it. Mr. Javadekar felt that the government overall should learn from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to communicate with the common man. On the negative narrative, he said, “The narrative is fuelled by around 20-30 people. The lines keep changing many times on a single day.” ‘Direct action’ Mr. Naqvi suggested direct action against those writing against the government. “We should have a strategy to neutralise the people who are writing against the government without facts and set[ting] false narratives / spread[ing] fake news,” he had advised. The action points recommended by the GoM include enlarging the Prasar Bharati News Service into a “mainline news agency”. The agreed long-term strategies include “coordination with schools of journalism as present students are the future journalists”. Mr. Puri told the GoM that the journalists who were supportive of the government, even if unemployed now, should be roped in. The report says this suggestion would also be acted upon. Mr. Thakur wanted the BJP and the Modi government to reach out to right-wing parties across the world to arrive at a common ground. The GoM’s report was published by sections of the media. The Hindu also has a copy of it. There is so far no official word on its contents. Attempts were made to speak to Mr. Javadekar, I&B Secretary Amit Khare and Prasar Bharati Chief Executive Officer Shashi Shekhar Vempati, Press Information Bureau Director General Jaideep Bhatnagar but till the time of going to press, there was no comment from them. Minister Naqvi, who was the only one willing to speak on the issue, however, expressed ignorance about the GoM’s suggestions. “I do not know anything about the report,” he said. He refused to elaborate further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gom-suggests-steps-to-stem-negative-narrative/article33993167.ece

Kochi is among the places that I know well (having supervised Kochi metro's Phase I works).

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Saab fighter jets tender still ongoing, opened up to two more categories’||Klas Molin , Sweden’s Ambassador to India, says there have been many highlights in the bilateral relationship between the two countries. He highlights the work of Swedish manufacturing companies that have been here for decades and the new service-oriented operations that are in place. Excerpts:  When Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Stefan Löfven met in Stockholm in April 2018, in the Joint Action Plan (JAP) there was a sharp focus on initiatives in trade and investment. What progress has there been on this front since then? That historic visit was followed by the state visit of President Mukherjee, who had been in Sweden just a couple of years before. That was followed by a Swedish state visit to India at the end of 2019. So, we have had many highlights in the bilateral relationship. Prime Minister Löfven was, of course, here also in 2016, and met Prime Minister Modi during that visit. Many of the original ideas we’ve been cooperating on for four decades, and the work of many manufacturing companies that have been here since the 1950s, and 1960s — and some since the beginning of the 20th century — mean that we are no strangers to working in and cooperating with India. For example, the company Ericsson is bigger in India than anywhere else in the world, including in Sweden, with approximately 30,000 employees. The same is true of ABB and AstraZeneca, including back offices, technical support and service-oriented operations. The climate is generally very positive. This past year has been challenging, but the Prime Ministers have very much set the tone for increased cooperation. Although for its MMRC tender India went with the Rafale, is there hope that the IAF could consider the Saab jet fighters, in the future? Absolutely, and I believe that is also Saab’s assessment. The tender is still there, it is modified, and it was opened up to two more categories. It was a single engine, originally, that was broadened to include all kinds of multi-role fighters. Saab is definitely a contender and would very much like to partner with India, for co-development and production in India. I believe the process is ongoing. At the 2018 summit meeting, the JAP agreed on a Sweden-India Innovation Partnership for a Sustainable Future. Could you touch upon areas where innovation cooperation has been translated into policies or actions on the ground? The JAP [following their 2018 summit meeting] has as one of its provisions a standalone partnership on innovation for a sustainable future. Innovation has very much set the tone. Recently, we had the first dialogue on innovation. Just the other day, during a bio conference, we had a seminar on precision medicine, where Swedish technology, which is not just adopted, but is very much being developed in India at the moment, meets the incredibly rich data of patients in India. This helps pinpointing treatments for patients and developing treatments that can then be extrapolated to huge numbers of patients. This is an example of the latest areas that we cooperate more and more in. And it’s not entirely new. We have had an MoU for well over 10 years now in the health and life sciences. We had a hackathon on mobility recently that ended with an award ceremony. The honourable Union Minister Nitin Gadkari was kind enough to take part in the award ceremony virtually. He has visited Sweden and he and his counterpart in Sweden recently set up a partnership on safe transportation. You might have seen that he had a Road Safety Month declared in February, nationally, and we are now looking at e-highways, electrification and other sustainable and renewable modes of transportation. Mikael Damberg, formerly Enterprises and Innovation Minister, told The Hindu earlier that the issues that require attention to keep the momentum going on bilateral economic cooperation include IPR protection and reducing red tape in the bureaucracy. Have things moved forward on this count since 2018? I would say the way that India is moving up in the Ease of Doing Business index is one good sign and testament to something that I also perceive in the Swedish business community. There is definitely a sense that reforms are taking place that make it easier, for example through investment facilitation meetings under a mechanism set up by our Ministers for commerce and enterprise under a joint commission that that meets under the Prime Minister. Also, the States have been vying in some kind of competition nationally for investments, which can lead to them providing infrastructure, guaranteeing electricity supply, sewage, and more for setting up manufacturing and other presences. This can help with red tape. Predictability is always a factor that these companies mention when asked about what could be even better.  (For the full interview, log on to bit.ly/klasmolin)   This past year has been challenging, but the Prime Ministers have very much set the tone for increased cooperation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/saab-fighter-jets-tender-still-ongoing-opened-up-to-two-more-categories/article33993169.ece
05 March 2021||Kolkata,||Bengal battle lines to be clear today||All the major political parties in West Bengal are likely to announce candidates for the Assembly polls on Friday. The ruling Trinamool Congress may announce candidates for all the 294 Assembly seats, while the Left-Congress alliance could announce nominees for the first two phases,when 60 seats go to the polls. The Bharatiya Janata Party is also likely to announce candidates for the first two phases. After days of discussions the Left parties and the Congress on Thursday came to an agreement on seat-sharing with Furfura peer Abbas Siddique’s Indian Secular Front (ISF). Sources privy to the discussion said the Left Parties, comprising the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Revolutionary Socialist Party, All India Forward Bloc among others may contest in 165 seats, the Congress in 92 and the ISF may get about 37 seats. Leaders of all the parties confirmed the arrangement and said the announcement would be made on Friday. Nandigram fight The Nandigram Assembly in Purba Medinipur seat is likely to witness the biggest political contest. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will contest here, the region that witnessed a violent contest against forcible land acquisition during the regime of the Left Front in 2007-08. Sources in the party said Ms. Banerjee may contest only from Nandigram and not from Bhawanipur. She had announced her willingness to contest from Nandigram in January. Suvendu Adhikari, who was elected from the seat on a Trinamool Congress ticket in 2016 and joined the BJP in December 2020, on Thursday expressed his willingness to contest from the seat at a meeting of party-office-bearers in Delhi. After the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Shiv Sena on Thursday pledged its support to Ms. Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress. Its leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut hailed Ms. Banerjee as the “real Bengal tigress”. Sena to back Trinamool “A lot of people are curious to know whether Shiv Sena is contesting West Bengal polls or not. So, here’s the update after discussions with Party President Uddhav ji Thackeray. Looking at the present scenario, it appears like a ‘Didi vs All’ fight. All ‘M’s – money, muscle and media – are being used against ‘M’amata Didi. Hence, ShivSena has decided not to contest West Bengal polls and stand in solidarity with her. We wish Mamata Didi a ‘roaring’ success, ’cos we believe she is the real Bengal Tigress,” Mr. Raut said on social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengal-battle-lines-to-be-clear-today/article33993163.ece
05 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam tea garden photos brew a political storm||A couple of tea garden photos have sparked a controversy in poll-bound Assam where plantation workers are in focus. Assam Finance Minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) main poll strategist, Himanta Biswa Sarma, on Thursday claimed that the Congress had used photos of tea estates in Taiwan on its campaign page. The Congress trashed the claim and said it would lodge a complaint with the Election Commission of India. “Official Congress campaign page is using photo of tea garden from Taiwan to say ‘Assam Bachao’ (Save Assam). Congress leaders can’t even recognise Assam? This is an insult of Assam and Tea Garden workers of our State,” Dr. Sarma tweeted with screenshot of one of the photos attached. “First Congress couldn’t identify Assam, now Congress can't even recognise Assamese people. This is again a pic from Taiwan. Congress leaders have forgotten Assam. Let’s show @INCIndia how beautiful our land is,” he tweeted again, sharing the other photo. The Congress retaliated to accuse the BJP and Dr. Sarma of resorting to propaganda with “fake” photos. “Without any issue to sell to the people after tall promises, the BJP is resorting to such tricks as people are connecting with the Congress and looking for progress to return. The BJP is clearly rattled,” Congress leader Bobbeeta Sharma said. To file complaint She said the Minister should have verified the photos before using them. “We are filing a complaint to the EC,” she added. Both the BJP and the Congress are concentrating on the votes of tea plantation workers, who are a deciding factor in 45 of the State’s 126 Assembly seats. Hiking the plantation workers’ daily wage to Rs. 365 is one of the five-point “guarantees” of the Congress. The BJP, too, doled out money to the workers and took up other welfare initiatives for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-tea-garden-photos-brew-a-political-storm/article33993161.ece
05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Half of Hyderabad population has antibodies, says study||About 54% of the population in Hyderabad and Secunderabad within the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits have been found to be having antibodies against coronavirus in a latest sero-surveillance survey conducted by city-based scientific institutions. The study conducted jointly by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) and Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) on a sample size of about 9,000 participants, all of them older than 10 years, has indicated that half the population has either been infected or exposed to coronavirus. “It is very exciting as we could be near the end of this pandemic. We have reached a critical stage of infection among the population. This is the right time to go for vaccination when the infection transmission is weak and there are no cases of re-infection. This could take the antibodies prevalence among the population to 75-80% when the herd immunity may kick in,” said CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra at a press conference on Thursday. Data generated in the latest seroprevalence study appeared to be robust considering there was not much variation in each of the divisions. The above 10 years age group, chosen as the segment, have been venturing out and from the data, it was clear that the older generation between 70-90 years had less antibodies because either they were “well-protected or have had asymptomatic infection”. The Director reiterated that both vaccines cleared by government regulatory authorities were safe and people should not hesitate to vaccinate themselves when their slot is determined as it would only strengthen the immune response of the body. “Vaccine will help the body fight the infection better, but it may not prevent us from getting infected and we in turn could infect others,” he cautioned. Dr. Mishra also emphasised the need to continue to adhere to the ‘social vaccine’ of face masking, avoiding indoor crowded meetings, hand washing and personal hygiene as the virus is “around in the air” and live cases across the country are more than a lakh. As things stand now, natural immunity due to COVID infection could last up to six months in most cases while the vaccine efficacy is about a year. Even later, it is possible that the body’s immune memory system could handle any new infection unless its a potent mutant variant, he said. Senior NIN scientist K. Laxmaiah said that data shows infection spread is ‘even’ among all age groups, communities and localities too. For the latest study, 75 personnel were involved to test 300 people from 30 divisions. A follow up study on COVID-19 infected patients had shown that the antibodies rise within a month of infection, increase till the fifth month and reduce after the sixth month. BBIL’s Krishna Mohan said these kind of epidemiological studies are crucial for vaccine-makers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/half-of-hyderabad-population-has-antibodies-says-study/article33993131.ece
05 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Cong. member suspended for a week||The Budget session of the Karnataka Assembly began on a stormy note on Thursday with Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri suspending Congress member B.K. Sangameshwara from the House for a week (till March 12) for “gross misconduct.” The decision came after the member removed his shirt in the course of a dharna by the Congress in the House, opposing a debate on the theme “one nation, one poll” initiated by the Speaker. As soon as the Speaker started reading his introductory speech, Congress members trooped into the well and began shouting slogans. They demanded postponement of the discussion on the subject to the next session. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah questioned the Speaker’s decision and dubbed it an attempt to further “RSS agenda”. Mr. Kageri said the issue was listed on the agenda as it was approved at the Business Advisory Committee meeting. He pointed out that the Congress had given 19 names who would speak on the subject. Moreover, House Rule 363 empowered him to initiate discussion on the subject, he argued. The Speaker turned down the Opposition plea to postpone the discussion and started reading his speech when the Congress members rushed to the well and started shouting slogans, alleging that the Speaker was implementing an “RSS agenda” and the BJP was against the Constitution. Janata Dal (S) members did not participate in the protest. During the dharna, Mr. Sangameshwara removed his shirt and raised slogans. Sensing that it could lead to trouble, Congress member D.K. Shivakumar put the shirt back on Mr. Sangameshwara. Amidst the dharna, Mr. Kageri announced that Mr. Sangameshwara had been suspended from the House for a week and adjourned the House for lunch. When the House reassembled, Congress members continued the dharna. Mr. Siddaramaiah said BJP member Goolihatti Shekhar had removed his shirt during a protest in the House before and no action had been taken against him. He said the dharna would continue until the suspension was revoked. When the protesting members refused to budge, the Speaker adjourned the House. The Legislative Council too saw a dharna by the Congress members post-lunch, while Janata Dal (S) did not join them. Sources in Congress said the party had decided to oppose the debate at its CLP meeting held before the start of the session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-member-suspended-for-a-week/article33993134.ece
05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP and two allies finalise sharing of 86 Assam seats||At a meeting that ran late into the night, the BJP and its two allies in Assam — the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) — finalised their seat-sharing agreement for 86 Assembly constituencies where polling will be held mostly in the first and second phases. BJP State unit chief Ranjit Dass confirmed this after a meeting of the BJP Central Election Committee (CEC) in New Delhi on Thursday night. Sources indicated that for the all-important contest in West Bengal, which was also discussed on Thursday, Union Minister Babul Supriyo may be fielded to take on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram. Assam has 126 Assembly constituencies where elections will be held in three phases, on March 27, April 1 and April 6. “The BJP and its allies have finalised the seat-sharing arrangements. I am not disclosing now the number of seats each party will contest as our alliance partners have to sort out some of their internal issues,” Mr. Dass told presspersons. He said the BJP would announce its own candidates for the first two phases soon. However, the party had not finalised candidates in 12 seats for the time being and had kept them pending, he said. Asked whether Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal would again be projected as the chief ministerial candidate for the election, the BJP State unit president said the party did not make such an announcement where it had its own government. “We project a chief ministerial candidate where we don’t have our own government. Where we have our own government, we don’t make such an announcement,” he said. Sources said the CEC kept a rough calculation of 86-88 seats for the BJP, around 26 seats to the AGP and around six seats for the UPPL out of the 126 seats. The committee of top leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on Thursday to approve the list of party candidates for Assam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-and-two-allies-finalise-sharing-of-86-assam-seats/article33993650.ece
05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bengaluru, Shimla ‘most liveable’ cities||Bengaluru and Shimla were on Thursday ranked as the most liveable in the categories of cities with more than and less than 1 million population respectively by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry’s Ease of Living Index. The Ease of Living Index 2020, in which 111 cities participated during the assessment in 2020 that included citizens’ feedback, had Bengaluru at the top, followed by Pune, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Surat, Navi Mumbai, Coimbatore, Vadodara, Indore and Greater Mumbai in the category of cities with over 1 million population. In cities with less than a million population, Shimla topped the list, followed by Bhubaneshwar, Silvassa, Kakinada, Salem, Vellore, Gandhinagar, Gurugram, Davangere and Tiruchirappalli. The Ministry also released the Municipal Performance Index 2020, which rated 111 municipalities on their services, finance, policy, technology and governance. Indore topped the ranking of municipalities with over 1 million population, followed by Surat and Bhopal, and the New Delhi Municipal Council was the best among civic bodies with under a million population, followed by Tirupati and Gandhinagar. At the online launch of the indices, HUA Minister Hardeep Puri said some State governments were not as serious as others about the implementation of the Smart Cities Mission. He said the special purpose vehicles in each city should be headed by the same person for the duration of the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengaluru-shimla-most-liveable-cities/article33993174.ece
05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||IISc in top 100 list in natural sciences||The Indian Institute of Science broke into the top 100 in the natural sciences category of the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2021, which were released on Thursday. With regard to subject rankings, there are two new entrants in the top 100 list: JNU’s anthropology programme and O.P. Jindal Global University’s law programme, which is also the only private institution in the list. In the broad engineering and technology category, only three institutions made it to the top 100 — the Bombay, Delhi and Madras IITs — in comparison to five institutions last year. The Kharagpur and Kanpur IITs dropped out of the top 100 though the former is one of the government’s Institutes of Eminence (IoEs). The Bombay, Delhi and Madras IITs, which are also IoEs getting extra Central funding with the specific aim of rising in global rankings, have all dropped several places this year as well. DU falls 48 places In the other two broad categories, the University of Delhi was the highest ranked Indian institution in social sciences and management, but fell 48 places to drop out of the top 200. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences remained the only institution in the top 300 in life sciences and medicine, but also dropped more than 10 places. Overall, 25 Indian programmes from 12 institutions made it to the top 100 in their specific subject areas, two fewer than in 2020. Two programmes from the IIT Bombay and one each from the the Madras and Kharagpur IITs slipped out of the list. Only two of the IoE programmes in the top 100 subject-specific list improved their rankings this year. The top-ranked Indian programme globally is the IIT Madras petroleum engineering programme which dropped one place to the 30th rank, followed by mineral and mining engineering at Bombay and Kharagpur IITs, which are ranked at 41st and 44th place in their field. The University of Delhi’s development studies programme is the only other one in the top 50, sliding in at the 50th rank. QS Head of Evaluation Leigh Kamolins noted that India had a good performance in COVID-19 research, ranking fifth in the world in terms of the number of published research papers on the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iisc-in-top-100-list-in-natural-sciences/article33993177.ece
05 March 2021||Bengaluru,||IISc. team finds new mutations and proteins of SARS-CoV-2||A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) has identified multiple mutations and unique proteins in isolates of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This study, published in the Journal of Proteome Research , has also shown that the hosts produce several proteins of their own as their body launches an immunological defence in response to the viral attack. Genomic analysis To better understand how the virus is mutating and its protein biology (proteins are made using genetic information), an IISc. team led by Utpal Tatu, Professor in the Department of Biochemistry, carried out a comprehensive “proteo-genomic” investigation – a series of analyses of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The isolates or viral samples were recovered from nasal secretions of three consenting COVID-19 RT-PCR positive individuals in Bengaluru. The genomic analysis was done using next generation sequencing (NGS), a technology that allows for rapid sequencing of the entire genome. The three Bengaluru isolates had 27 mutations in their genomes with over 11 mutations per sample, more than both the national average (8.4) and global average (7.3).  According to Prof. Tatu, sequencing the genomes of viral strains from around the world is important because it helps keep track of mutations that are arising constantly. His team’s analysis suggests that the virus is now mutating faster than before. History of the virus To understand the spread and evolutionary history of the virus, the team constructed a global phylogenetic tree, or a tree of relatedness, of viral isolates using the sequence data. The phylogenetic analysis found that the Bengaluru isolates are most closely related to the one from Bangladesh. It also showed that the isolates in India have multiple origins rather than having evolved from a single ancestral variant. Detection of proteins The SARS-CoV-2 genome codes for more than 25 proteins, but only a handful of these proteins have been identified so far. In the proteomic analysis, his team detected 13 different proteins – most of them previously unidentified – from clinical samples. One such protein called Orf9b, which suppresses the host’s immune response, had been predicted, but the IISc team provided the first evidence of its expression. In the third analysis, his team explored how our bodies respond to the virus by examining host proteins. They discovered as many as 441 proteins unique to COVID-19 positive patients, many of which are speculated to play a key role in the body’s immune response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iisc-team-finds-new-mutations-and-proteins-of-sars-cov-2/article33993662.ece
05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘Check for illegal constructions’||Telangana High Court on Thursday instructed the Telangana State Housing Board (TSHB) authorities and the Commissioner Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to conduct a joint inspection looking out for illegal structures in Kukatpally Housing Board Colony Phase-III. If any illegal structures were found, the Housing Board officials and GHMC should immediately serve notices to the persons concerned calling for their explanation, the HC said. Officers of the two departments should also restrain private persons from undertaking any unauthorised construction activity there. The directions were issued by a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy while hearing a PIL petition filed by a non-governmental organisation called Community Organisation for People’s Emancipation. The NGO had submitted repeated representations to the authorities over illegal buildings by private persons coming up in Phase-III of KPHB Colony. In addition to the officers of the Housing Board and the GHMC, the bench issued notices to four private persons on the matter. They were instructed to file counter affidavits with four weeks. Private persons, who allegedly built structures illegally in the common areas of the KPHB colony were also directed to respond to the contentions of the petitioner organisation which sought direction to demolish such illegally raised structures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/check-for-illegal-constructions/article33993755.ece
05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Mukhtar Ansari can be tried via videoconferencing’||The Uttar Pradesh government scoffed at Punjab’s argument in the Supreme Court that criminal-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari could be tried via videoconferencing, saying that fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya could also then demand a virtual trial. Ansari is lodged in a jail in Punjab. U.P. wants him transferred. A Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan reserved the transfer case for judgment after hearing both Punjab and U.P.’s arguments. “If videoconferencing is the only mode of trial and accused can appear from anywhere, then Vijay Mallya can appear from anywhere,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for U.P., contended. “He has 50 FIRs against him, 14 trials in advanced stage. It’s the constitutional obligation of the court to enforce free and fair trial. An accused who has violated the law of the land cannot object to the transfer [of Ansari]... Court cannot remain a mute spectator,” he submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mukhtar-ansari-can-be-tried-via-videoconferencing/article33993158.ece
05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||I-T Dept. alleges Rs. 300 cr. mismatch||The Income Tax Department said on Thursday that its search and survey operations on two leading film production companies, a leading actor, and two talent management firms in Mumbai have unearthed a discrepancy in income of Rs. 300 crore, and manipulations in share transactions with tax implications of Rs. 350 crore at one of the film production houses. On Wednesday, the department searched properties linked to filmmaker Anurag Kashyap and actor Taapsee Pannu in Mumbai, as well as premises linked to a talent agency and Phantom Films, co-founded by Mr. Kashyap, and producers Vikas Bahl and Madhu Mantena. “Evidence of cash receipts by the leading actress amounting to Rs. 5 crore has been recovered. Apart from this, non-genuine/bogus expenditure to related concerns by the leading producers/director having tax implication of about Rs. 20 crore has been detected. Similar findings have been made in the case of the leading actress also,” the department said in a statement. Seven bank lockers have been placed under restraint and searches are continuing on 28 residential and office premises in Mumbai, Pune, Delhi and Hyderabad, the statement said. “During the search, evidence of huge suppression of income by the leading Film Production house compared to the actual box office collections has been unearthed. The company officials have not been able to explain discrepancy of around Rs. 300 crore,” it said. Evidence related to manipulation and under-valuation of share transactions of the production house among the film directors and shareholders, having tax implication of about Rs. 350 crore, has been found and is being further investigated. “At the office premises of the two talent management companies, huge amount of digital data has been seized in the form of emails, Whatsapp chats, hard disk etc which are under investigation,” the IT department said. Search and seizure operations on two groups of civil contractors in southern Tamil Nadu have yielded Rs. 3 crore in unaccounted-for cash, and led to the detection of unaccounted-for income of Rs. 175 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/i-t-dept-alleges-rs-300-cr-mismatch/article33993182.ece
05 March 2021||JAIPUR,||Man kills married daughter for eloping with Dalit paramour||A man in Rajasthan’s Dausa district allegedly abducted and murdered his 19-year-old married daughter on Thursday for eloping with her Dalit paramour. The woman, Pinki Saini, had fled with her lover, Roshan Mahawar, 23, five days after her wedding on February 16. The accused father, Shankar Lal, a vegetable vendor, reached the Kotwali police station in Dausa after killing Pinki by strangulating her and confessed to his crime. Pinki’s family had forcibly brought her back home from Roshan’s house, where they had arrived from Jaipur on March 1. Pinki and Roshan had appeared as a live-in couple before the Jaipur Bench of Rajasthan High Court and sought protection against coercion by the woman’s family members before coming to Dausa. Pinki stated in the court that she was married against her will and she wanted to stay with her lover. The High Court had on February 26 directed the police to give protection to the couple and take them to a safe place as per their wish. The court had also asked the counsel for Pinki’s family to advise his clients not to take law into their hands and not cause any harm to the petitioners. ‘Casteist slurs’ On the complaint of Roshan’s father after Pinki was forcibly taken away, a first information report was registered against 11 persons at women’s police station in Dausa with the charges of abduction, criminal intimidation and theft along with the sections of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Roshan’s family members alleged that Shankar Lal and others had abused them with casteist slurs, damaged their house and stole Rs. 1.20 lakh while abducting Pinki.  Visit by in-laws Police suspect that Pinki’s family had tried to convince her to return to her husband, but when she refused to break off relationship with her paramour, her exasperated father lost his control and strangulated her. Pinki’s in-laws had come to her house on February 21, but she refused to go with them and instead eloped with Roshan. The People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has expressed shock over the alleged abduction and murder of Pinki despite the High Court’s order for police protection to the couple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/man-kills-married-daughter-for-eloping-with-dalit-paramour/article33993742.ece
05 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Won’t appear before police: complainant||Dinesh Kallahalli, the activist who accused former Karnataka Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi of sexually exploiting a woman by assuring her a job, refused to appear before the police for questioning citing security reasons. The Cubbon Park police had summoned Mr. Kallahalli to get more details on the case and the woman who was allegedly cheated. Mr. Jarkiholi stepped down from the Cabinet on Wednesday, a day after purported video clips of him with the unidentified woman was aired by Kannada news channels. ‘Security inadequate’ Mr. Kallahalli, a resident of Kanakapura, said he started receiving threats on his phone soon after he filed a complaint against Mr. Jarkiholi. He had noticed unidentified people around his house and had approached the Ramanagaram police seeking protection. Though police have been deployed at his house, Mr. Kallahalli said the security was not adequate and that he could not come to the station. He said he would present himself before the police on March 9. The police said they were yet to trace the woman and her family members, who had approached Mr. Kallahalli seeking help, following which he filed the complaint with the police. On Thursday, a police team visited the lodge in Gandhinagar where a man, who claimed to be a member of the family, handed over the CD to Mr. Kallahalli on March 1. The police are verifying the CCTV camera footage to identify the person. They are also probing the location from where the video was uploaded. Meanwhile, a complaint was filed against Mr. Kallahalli on Thursday questioning his intention. Prashanth Kumar, social activist from Muneshwara Nagar, accused Mr. Kallahalli of blackmail and pressure tactics using fabricated videos. Mr. Kumar alleged that the video submitted was tampered with, and that there were influential people behind Mr. Kallahalli to attack the government.  Dinesh Kallahalli wrote to the police citing security reasons and said he would present himself before the police on March 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wont-appear-before-police-complainant/article33993143.ece

05 March 2021||Thiruvalla/Kochi,||Muraleedharan retracts on CM candidate||After tweeting that technocrat E. Sreedharan, who recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, will be its Chief Minister candidate for the Kerala Assembly elections on April 6, Union Minister V. Muraleedharan clarified on Thursday that the party had not made any such announcement. Mr. Muraleedharan, who tweeted in this regard earlier, clarified, saying he wanted to inform that through media reports he learnt that the party had announced Mr. Sreedharan as the Chief Minister candidate. But when he cross-checked with State party president K. Surendran, he said he had not made any such announcements, Mr. Muraleedharan, who is also a former BJP State president, said. In his tweet, Mr. Muraleedharan had said, ‘‘BJP4Keralam will fight Kerala polls with E Sreedharan Ji as its Chief Ministerial Candidate. We will defeat both CPIMKerala & INCKerala to provide a corruption-free, development-oriented Governance for the people of Kerala.” His social media post on Mr. Sreedharan’s leadership in the Assembly polls came hours after Mr. Surendran said he had requested the party’s national leadership to announce the technocrat as the National Democratic Alliance’s Chief Minister candidate. Referring to Mr. Muraleedharan’s clarification tweets, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor took a dig at the BJP, saying the saffron party was “confused”. “Hilarious! BJP4Keralam manages to be confused about who will occupy the top floor of a building that will never be built. There will be no BJP CM in Kerala,” Mr. Tharoor tweeted. The development comes on a day the 88-year-old technocrat announced his decision to end his 24-year career with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to enter electoral politics.  He says he cross-checked with State party president K.

05 March 2021||Guwahati,||Political talks back on table: NSCN(IM)||The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN (IM), has said the “Indo-Naga political talks are back on the table” and progressing. The extremist group, which had declared ceasefire with Indian security forces in 1997, blamed Nagaland Governor R.N. Ravi for creating “unnecessary confusion” and almost derailing the peace process with his “reckless statements”. In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, the publicity wing of the NSCN (IM) said that the Framework Agreement signed on August 3, 2015, had been “brought back to life” for removing any misinterpretation and hastening the signing of the Naga solution agreement. “It is needless to say that in many points, his [Mr. Ravi’s] statements and conclusions reflected his role as Nagaland Governor and not as interlocutor. It is a matter of regret that his role as interlocutor is nothing less than disparaging and dismal,” the NSCN (IM) said. It said that the New Delhi’s confirmation of the status of the talks as being in an advanced stage “is the ground reality” of the peace process. The outfit was leaving no stone unturned to safeguard the political identity of the Naga people. The NSCN (IM) said Mr. Ravi’s “misleading statement before the whole nation by blatantly contradicting” with the Government of India was “unfortunate” as the sensitive political negotiations had been going on for more than two decades. “In the matter of the Naga political issue, he should be cautious of every single word he utters lest his credibility is damned,” the group said, adding that the political dialogue was handled by both parties toward an honourable and acceptable solution. Mr. Ravi had been critical of the NSCN (IM) and other Naga groups. He had said armed gangs were running Nagaland, questioning the sovereignty and integrity of the nation and challenging the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/political-talks-back-on-table-nscnim/article33993159.ece

The report will be submitted in the next eight to 10 days,” he said in his reply to a question on policing raised by Janata Dal (Secular) member H.M. Ramesh Gowda. He said the government would consider setting up of south division along with three divisions that are currently functioning. “The decision on redefining the jurisdictions of the police stations and setting up of new police stations will be decided after that,” the Minister said. Mr. Bommai said that Bengaluru had seen a growth in population and vehicle density had increased while 110 villages had been brought under the city limits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jurisdiction-of-police-stations-to-be-redefined/article33993349.ece
05 March 2021||KOCHI,||Last day at DMRC||Keeping none in doubt about his entry into politics, 88-year-old E. Sreedharan has said this (Thursday) will be his last day in the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) uniform, a dress he wore first in 1997. “I will tender my resignation as Principal Adviser to the DMRC before submitting the nomination to contest the Assembly polls. I will still be available to oversee development projects, including as an MLA,” Mr. Sreedharan said, after inspecting the Palarivattom flyover here, which the DMRC rebuilt in a record time of five months and 10 days and is ready for opening. To queries on his decision to enter politics, he said he was ready for both bouquets and brickbats, being a keen reader of the Bhagawad Gita. “It is natural that some will laud the decision, while others will criticise. I am ready for both,” he said. On whether he would go for a strenuous campaign, Mr. Sreedharan, who joined the BJP recently, said his would not be a normal type of campaigning. No door-to-door visits “There will not be any door-to-door visits. The emphasis will be on digital campaigning. I will work like a technocrat and rely on a competent team. Ultimately, more technically qualified people must join politics, to stem the rot in the system,” he said. Professional competence and integrity are my strong points. “As for age, it is not just physical agility alone, I am mentally alert,” he said. He exhorted people to focus on four Vs — Vikasanam (development), Vidyabhyasam (education), Vishudha bharanam (clean governance) and Vyavasayam (industry). Governance should be clean and benevolent and the BJP could usher in these in Kerala, he said. Responding to a media survey which hinted at the probability of the Left Democratic Front government staying in power for a second term, Mr. Sreedharan said this was unlikely and hoped that the BJP would come to power. “We have the then-less-known Aam Aadmi Party rising to power in Delhi. It is people's perception that matters.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/last-day-at-dmrc/article33993136.ece
05 March 2021||Yadagirigutta,||Inauguration of Yadadri likely in May||The Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple atop Yadagirigutta, which was taken up for redevelopment by the Telangana State government in 2016, may be inaugurated in May, if all the final touches are put to desired satisfaction, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said on Thursday. He expressed the possibility, as the main temple is already in the finished stage and just requires some last touches. CM KCR, who is also the chairman of Yadadri Temple Development Authority (YTDA), instructed officials to ensure hassle-free amenities, devotee convenience such as audio-visual experience and queue management, and greenery all around the temple. He even suggested the teams of officials and artists to visit temples and structures in the country and abroad, for inspiration. For instance, for mandaps for poor Brahmins and retired priests to continue their practice, he said the teams should visit the Shri Jagannath Temple in Odisha, and a mall in China, for Addala Mandap (A hall with mirrors), and the daily sevas should be organised like they are held at Tirumala. Mr. Rao was here on Thursday, in what was his 14th visit to the temple, and spent about five hours to inspect works, review progress and suggest improvements. The main purpose of the visit, according to officials, was for a practical understanding of the estimated time of completion and the readiness of the temple to open it for devotees. Along with temple artist Anand Sai, architect Velu, special secretary Bhoopal Reddy and others, KCR took an elaborate walk through the temple, the queue complex, various mandaps and the steps way. It was learnt that Mr. Rao gave clear instructions on artistic improvements such as brass plating of metals, illumination to infuse spiritual atmosphere, and for the sculptures of the legend of Prahlad and the legend of Narasimha. Later, Mr. Rao also reviewed plans at the foot of the hill. On the approach and the highway beautification around the temple, bus station, cottages, pushkarni and annadana satram, he gave his instructions. The visit also saw Mr. Rao interacting with shopkeepers and stall owners, who would lose their businesses and property owing to land acquisition for roads and related developmental works. It was stated that Mr. Rao assured them of new, spacious and fully constructed stores, besides free house plots. And the vacated businesses on the hill top will be allotted stores in the newly constructed temple town, following due procedure. KCR also instructed officials for construction of residential quarters to temple priests and staff in the vicinity. Proposals for employment opportunities to land oustees and free plots to temple sculptors was under examination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/inauguration-of-yadadri-likely-in-may/article33993790.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||OTT content needs to be checked, says SC||Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Amazon producer Aparna Purohit’s bail, said this “was not about pornography but the right to freedom of expression”. “But a balance has to be struck,” Justice Bhushan retorted. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta said the content included “filthy abuses”. The hearing was based on a plea by Ms. Purohit, Amazon Prime’s commercial head, against the Allahabad High Court decision to deny her pre-arrest bail in connection with the probe into Tandav, a web series hosted by the platform. The FIR said the series ridiculed Hindu gods and the country’s political power corridors. Justice Bhushan said the court wanted to consider Ms. Purohit’s case in the light of the new guidelines notified by the government to hold social media and OTT platforms accountable for their content. The Bench asked the guidelines to be placed on record and scheduled a hearing for March 5. The Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules of 2021 requires the streaming platforms to comply with a new three-tier self-regulatory complaint redressal system. Mr. Rohatgi said the case against Ms. Purohit was “shocking”. The OTT platforms were like cinema halls where one had to pay to view a film. Mr. Rohatgi said the new guidelines were “like the Censor Board” but they would come into operation “after some time”. “This lady [Purohit] is only an employee of a company. These cases are filed by publicity seekers,” Mr. Rohatgi argued. “We are clearly of the view that there should be screening. Let us see the guidelines... We will take it up tomorrow,” Justice Bhushan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ott-content-needs-to-be-checked-says-sc/article33993150.ece

The Indian statement comes in the backdrop of increased incidents of killings of Bangladesh nationals in 2020. Dhaka Tribune, in a report in last December, the said the incidents of killings was the highestin 2020 within a decade. Mr. Jaishankar, however, highlighted the broader contours of India-Bangladesh relation, which witnessed India choosing Bangladesh for the largest consignment of COVID-19 vaccines that Delhi had sent abroad. He pointed out that 9 million doses of Covishield vaccine had reached Bangladesh from Pune’s Serum Institute of India. India’s vaccine production found strong support from Mr. Momen. He said, “Around 135 countries in the world are yet to get the COVID-19 vaccine but there is our friend India and we have such a rock solid relationship that we got the vaccine and everyone is very happy. Bangladesh has purchased the COVID vaccine from the Serum Institute of India and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government is implementing the nationwide vaccination programme free of cost very efficiently and effectively.” Mr. Momen said Bangabandhu-Bapu Digital Exhibition would be inaugurated in Dhaka in the coming days. Modi visit Mr. Jaishankar is paying a day-long visit to take stock of bilateral ties ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s planned March 26 visit, during which he will participate in the independence day celebrations in Dhaka that will mark the half century of the country’s independent existence. He said both sides took stock of the relationship and reviewed the issues that were being worked on. The issue of sharing of the waters of the Teesta came up during the joint press conference. Mr. Jaishankar said, “We have meeting of our water resources secretaries very soon. The Government of India’s position has not changed.” “There is no domain where we are not working today. Our relationship covers every human activity. The more we do, the more possibilities open up. Most of all let us look at connectivity. If we can get connectivity right between India and Bangladesh, I can tell you the geo-economics of the region will change. The Bay of Bengal will look very different,” noted Mr. Jaishankar. He also highlighted a potential role for Japan in the bilateral connectivity projects between India and Bangladesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bangladesh-border-killings-due-to-crime/article33993151.ece

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Haryana’s new rule spells disaster, says India Inc.||Deepak Jain, president, ACMA, said, “Our industry requires skilled workforce to produce high quality products that are globally competitive. Hiring in our sector is done on the basis of merit and talent rather than the domicile of the candidates. The reason for the industry to employ candidates from outside the State is due to the shortage of adequately skilled and locally available manpower.” Mr. Jain also highlighted that the automotive industry, with investments of over Rs. 40,000 crore, accounts for more than 25% of the State’s GDP and creates employment for over 10 lakh people. NASSCOM added that the move would impact the business friendly image of the State and be detrimental to Gurugram’s growth trajectory as an Infomation Technology-Business Process Management hub. Stating that it had already raised industry’s concerns with the State government, NASSCOM added that the growth of the IT-BPM industry was closely intertwined with the availability of skilled talent on demand and such restrictions would be limiting for the industry. In a representation to the State government, CII has stated that the industry should be consulted to understand the overall impact of the law on the State’s economy and employment. Noting that Haryana is facing tough competition from other States in terms of attracting investment, the CII said all major industrial houses felt the Bill was going to affect their businesses in a big way and they were now looking to rework their expansion plans in Haryana. CII has recommended that the State may, after discussions, come out with a percentage and also the associated incentives to be offered to industry for employing local people. Job quota for locals could not be made mandatory for existing units as they could not lay off a trained employee from other States to give those jobs to locals, it said.  According to Anupam Varma, partner at the law firm J Sagar Associates, the legality of the Act is prima facie suspect and it may not be able to withstand judicial scrutiny on the touchstone of Article 19(1)(g) and 16(2) of the Constitution of India. “The Act impinges upon the sacrosanct fundamental right of freedom to practice any occupation or business. The implementation of the Act just when industrial and business activities are resuming after the COVID pandemic might result in an exodus of investors from the State,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/haryanas-new-rule-spells-disaster-says-india-inc/article33993153.ece
05 March 2021||New Delhi,||Congress slams govt. over GoM report||The Congress on Thursday slammed the government for the purported report by a Group of Ministers (GoM) to “neutralise” negative narrative against the Narendra Modi government and “spin” a positive one. At a press conference, party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate alleged that the government’s recent regulations for digital media and OTT platforms had their origin in such a report to “control free views and spin the narrative in the government’s favour”. Ms. Shrinate cited the latest report of Freedom House, a U.S.-based NGO, to argue that the Modi government had not just encroached on press freedom but freedom itself. “... It [the GoM report] categorically mentions that there has to be a strategy to neutralise people who are writing against the government. It very categorically also seems to suggest that some of the suggestions made in this report have actually been turned into law. The IT rules 2021 announced a few days back by Ravi Shankar Prasad Ji and Prakash Javadekar Ji seem to have taken a lot of these suggestions on board,” the Congress spokesperson said. Legislating power “So, this does raise question: will Parliament make laws or will laws be made by ministers sitting in the drawing rooms with consultations and under guidance of pliant media persons ever willing to serve the Modi government?” asked Ms. Shrinate. She said the ministers should resign on moral grounds since their strategy to spin a positive narrative amounted to a “blatant attack on the free press.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-slams-govt-over-gom-report/article33993164.ece

Three summons were issued against the sisters on November 17, January 8 and February 16. However, till date they have not appeared before the court. The complaint filed by advocate Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh mentions that on April 15, 2020, Ms. Chandel posted a defamatory and objectionable statement against ‘jamati’ from her Twitter account. Thereafter, her account was suspended. On April 18, Ms. Ranaut posted a short video on various social media platform accounts and called a section of Muslims (‘jamati’) terrorists. “Thus, both the accused posted hateful and derogatory statements against the community.

The five-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde termed the pendency of cheques cases a “grotesque” problem. The Bench suggested that even retired judges could preside in these “temporary” additional courts to clear pending cheque cases. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta welcomed the proposal of additional courts from the Bench, but said the idea would require “wide-ranging consultations” at the highest level.

05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC quashes notifications by Maharashtra EC||The Supreme Court on Thursday held that reservation for Other Backward Classes in Maharashtra’s local bodies should not exceed the aggregate 50% of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together. A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar read down Section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act 1961, which provided 27% reservation for persons belonging to backward class. The judgment further quashed the notifications issued by the State Election Commission in 2018 and 2020, providing reservation exceeding 50% in local bodies of some districts. It said election results of OBC candidates, which had been made subject to the outcome of pleas pending before it, were declared as non-est in law and the vacancy of seats be forthwith filled up by the State Election Commission for the remainder term of the local bodies. “The challenge to the validity of Section 12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act is negatived. Instead, that provision is being read down to mean that reservation in favour of OBCs in the concerned local bodies can be notified to the extent that it does not exceed aggregate 50% of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together,” the court held. The top court clarified that the OBC members who benefited from this reservation would “deemed to have vacated their seat upon pronouncement of this judgment, prospectively. This direction is being issued in exercise of plenary power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to do complete justice.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-quashes-notifications-by-maharashtra-ec/article33993652.ece
05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||India wants Chabahar port on key corridor||India wants Chabahar port to be included in the 13-nation International North South Transport Corridor that extends from India to Russia, and expand INSTC membership by including Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Ports and Shipping Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday. Pitching for Chabahar in the INSTC which goes via Iran’s biggest port Bandar Abbas, Mr. Jaishankar proposed that the land route via Kabul and Tashkent would form the INSTC’s “Eastern corridor”. “Establishing an eastern corridor through Afghanistan would maximise its potential. India has also proposed the inclusion of Chabahar in the INSTC route. I am hopeful that during the INSTC Coordination Council meeting, member states would agree to the expansion of the INSTC route to include the Chabahar Port and also agree on expanding the membership of this project,” Mr. Jaishankar said at a “Chabahar Day” event organised as part of the 3-day “Maritime India” summit that was conducted virtually. The event saw participation from several regional officials including infrastructure Ministers from Afghanistan, Armenia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Uzbekistan. The Port has already handled 123 vessels and 18 lakh tons of cargo, said an official statement issued after the conference, which include trans-shipments from “Russia, Brazil, Thailand, Germany, Ukraine and the UAE”. Predicting that Chabahar will change the “geo-economy” of the region, Iran’s Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mohammed Eslami called for assistance from India in developing the project, both through the provision of cranes and other equipment at the port as well as rail tracks, signal and switching equipment for the Chabahar-Zahedan railway project. Credit lines “I hope we can enjoy more credit lines allocated by India for equipping the port as well as completion of infrastructure projects of transport networks related to it,” Mr. Eslami said at the conference. “India has participated in the first phase of development of Shahid Beheshti port of Chabahar and we are now witnessing the supplying of equipment. It deems necessary for the Indian operator to facilitate the process of supplying the remaining equipment,” he said. Asked about the possibility of including Chabahar in the corridor, an Iranian official said Iran would “welcome it”, but that it is the INSTC governing council that would have to review the proposal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-wants-chabahar-on-key-route/article33993180.ece

05 March 2021||Hyderabad,||RMP among four held by Cyberabad police||A registered medical practitioner (RMP) and three others were arrested by the Cyberabad police on Thursday for conning people on pretext of providing gold at a cheaper price. The police arrested Syed Dasthagiri Ahmed, 65, an RMP from Old Mallepally, Shaik Hafeez, 46, of Charminar, Ali Akber Tayyabbi, 50, of Chatta Bazaar, and Mirza Abbas Ali Sajjad, 46, from Mir Alam Mandi, and seized 5.85 kg of gold coated brass biscuits and Rs. 8 lakh from their possession. Another accused, Abdul Faheem, 48, a businessman from Yakutpura is still at large. Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said that recently a man approached Rajendra Nagar police stating that Mirza Abbas Ali Sajjad and Ali Akbar Tayyabi were selling ‘gold’ at cheaper price and that the victim agreed to purchase the yellow metal and informed his associate Mubeen. On March 1, the victim met Sajjad and Tayyabi at 9 number outpost in the area, and informed him that they had around six kg of gold biscuits and offered to sell it for Rs. 40,000 per 10 grams - around Rs. 6,000 less than the actual market price - and they struck a deal. “The duo gave him a ‘gold biscuit’ weighing around 20 tolas for Rs. 50,000 as sample and they informed him to check the quality. The victim found that it was a gold coated brass and approached the police,” Mr. Sajjanar said. Based on his complaint, when Sajjad and Tayyabi were taken into custody on charges of cheating, the investigators came to know that they even cheated Dasthagiri at some point of time. Mr. Sajjanar said that Dasthagiri performs black magic and dupes people on the pretext of unearthing gold treasure from their houses. During his recent visit to Dasthagiri’s clinic, Sajjad informed him that his mother had bad dreams about hidden treasure, and if not found - it would lead to her death. The black magician-cum-RMP convinced Sajjad that his mother’s dreams were true stating that he would perform special pooja to unearth the hidden gold under his house, and asked him to pay anywhere between Rs. 3 lakh and Rs. 5 lakh. He was paid Rs. 3 lakh in advance. Dasthagiri procured brass biscuits, and other articles required to perform puja, and dug up five spots in Sajjad’s house. Later, he hid the gold coated brass biscuits, with the knowledge of the house owner, and stated that they unearthed gold treasure. Stating that the found ‘treasure’ had spiritual power and they would die, Dasthagiri didn’t allow Sajjad’s family to touch the metal bars. He wrapped the gold coated brass metal in a piece of cloth and gave it to the family members for safe custody. “Out of curiosity when Sajjad and his family members unwrapped the cloth, they found that it was a brass and informed Dasthagiri, who in turn blamed them for turning gold into brass by not obeying his instruction,” the Commissioner said. In the last 15 years, Dasthagiri cheated several people, but was never caught by the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rmp-among-four-held/article33993328.ece

05 March 2021||Bengaluru,||HC quashes denotification 260 acres of forest in Shivamogga district||In a setback to the State government, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday quashed the notification issued in 2017 denotifying 260 acres of forest area in Shivamogga district purportedly for rehabilitating people affected from Linganamakki dam project area in 1960. The court set aside the notification, issued on February 23, 2017 under Section 28 of the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, while holding that the State government could not have exercised its statutory power without the prior approval from the Central government under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. While directing the State government to initiate criminal prosecution under the provisions of the FC Act if any officers were responsible for not following the law, the court made it clear that a notification issued under Section 28 of the KF Act, 1963 sans prior approval from the Central government cannot be implemented or given effect to. A Division Bench passed the order while allowing a PIL petition by one Gireesh Achar, a social activist hailing from Hosanagar in Shivamogga district. Petitioner’s advocate Veerendra R. Patil had argued that the notification was illegal and the court in November 2020 restrained the State government from taking further step based on 2017 notification and not to alter status of forest land after Central government said that its prior approval was needed. Not only the State government violated the provisions of the FC Act but it also acted contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Godavarman case, the Bench said. Minimum that was expected from the State government was not to indulge in de-reservation/denotification of forest in violation the FC Act and the well-settled doctrine of public trust to protect the forests, the Bench observed. The Bench also noticed that the State government had not published 2017 notification in the official gazette despite such a mandate in the KF Act. The State government had issued notification in 2017 denotifying 240 acres of forest at Suduru village and 20 acres at Kudi village of Shivamogga citing that people affected from the dam project could not be given land documents for the land without issuing notification under Section 28 (power to declare forests no longer reserved forests) of the KF Act, 1963. It had also claimed that 260 acres were part of around 9,900 acres of reserved forest area that was deserved from forest between 1959 and 1969 for rehabilitating people affected from the dam project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-quashes-denotification-260-acres-of-forest-in-shivamogga-district/article33993135.ece
05 March 2021||Kochi,||HC freeze on regularisation||The Kerala High Court on Thursday ordered deferring all actions on the orders regularising temporary/contract employees in 10 government undertakings, including the C-DIT, LBS Centre for Science and Technology and the Kerala State Remote Sensing and Environmental Centre. Justice Devan Ramachandran also ordered that the status quo  as on Thursday be maintained with respect to regularisation of temporary employees till March 12. The court passed the order on a writ petition filed by Vishnu S, a candidate in the rank list prepared by the LBS Centre for Science and Technology, and five other job aspirants challenging the approval of temporary appointments made in 10 government undertakings. The court granted the government time till March 12 to provide its response to the allegations by the petitioners. Back-door appointments When the petition came up for hearing, George Poothottam, senior counsel for the petitioners, submitted that these government undertakings were resorting to back-door appointments by regularising temporary employees. They were doing this without following the selection procedure and reservation norms as mandated under various laws. The petitioners pointed out that the fundamental rights of eligible candidates were seriously affected by the regularisations. The government action in allowing recruitment of persons without following the due process of law amounted to injustice and constitutional fraud. The persons appointed on a temporary/contract basis were accepting the same on the complete knowledge that the nature of their engagement was purely provisional and, therefore, they could not turn around at a later point and seek regularisation. Even if such a claim was made, the government and its instrumentalities were duty-bound to ignore such illegal claims and make regular appointments in public posts in accordance with the due process of law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-freeze-on-regularisation/article33993137.ece
05 March 2021||Kochi,||ED likely to probe SNC-Lavalin case||After initiating probes into the alleged irregularities in the LIFE Mission and the masala bonds issued by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) appears to be determined to take a look into the SNC-Lavalin case in which Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was earlier involved. The ED has asked journalist-activist T.P. Nandakumar to appear before it on Friday and “provide evidences relating to SNC- Lavalin and others” as mentioned in his letter to the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) earlier, so as to enable the agency to “expedite the investigation.” He has been asked to be present before the agency at 11 a.m.  Incidentally, Mr. Nandakumar had written to the Director General of the DRI on March 10, 2006 regarding the “tax evasion and antinational activities by certain political leaders of Kerala.” It’s by dusting up the complaint filed by Mr. Nandakumar 15 years ago that the agency has sought his presence for investigation. The move may snowball into a head-on confrontation between the State government and the Central investigation agencies as Kerala is going for the Assembly polls on April 6. Interestingly, the Supreme Court has scheduled the hearing of the Central Bureau of Investigation’s appeal in the case on the same day in which the State would go to the polling booths to elect the next government. The CBI had moved the apex court against the Kerala High Court verdict of upholding a CBI Special Court’s decision to discharge Mr. Vijayan from the case. The hearing in the case was postponed on a few occasions after the investigating agency seeking more time. The apex court had frowned upon the agency when it sought the postponement of the hearing a few times. The case The SNC-Lavalin cases pertains to the alleged loss of Rs. 86.25 crore suffered by the State following a contract between the Kerala State Electricity Board and the Canadian firm, SNC-Lavalin, for the renovation and modernisation of Pallivasal, Sengulam and Panniyar hydroelectric projects in Idukki district. Mr. Vijayan was the Power Minister of the State during the time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-likely-to-probe-snc-lavalin-case/article33993138.ece
05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Voters pitch for merger with Corporation||Despite being part of the cityscape, Pallavaram has been facing such civic issues as sanitary sewer overflow, erratic drinking water supply, traffic congestion caused by encroachments, flooding and, above all, garbage being dumped into waterbodies. Residents believe the only solution is the merger of the area with the Greater Chennai Corporation. The constituency consists of Chromepet, Hasthinapuram, Pozhichalur, Nemilichery, Tiruneermalai, Pammal, Anakaputhur and Tirusulam. These areas have a high density of residential population. Infrastructure development has taken place: new flyovers have been built at the Pallavaram and Keelkattalai junctions. But civic issues continue to haunt the residents, who are unwilling to trust the municipality any more, saying it lacks vision and manpower.  Campaign under way Social activists say several village panchayats and panchayat unions were merged with the Corporation in 2014. They have started a campaign asking the residents to vote only for the party that promises merger with the Corporation. They are also distributing pamphlets. Social activist V. Santhanam points to the poor construction of the underground drainage network, which was planned to manage the population growth in 20 years. It suffers from serious design and construction flaws, he says. Sewage regularly overflows from the network at Bhavani Nagar, Natesan Nagar, Jain Nagar Extension and Nemilichery. “It is not proper to blame municipal officials who have been handed a faulty asset. The municipality also suffers from a shortage of manpower and lack of equipment,” Mr. Santhanam says. Meenakshi Sundaram, a resident of Nemilichery, says the residents are paying a garbage cess almost equal to property tax. He blames the municipality for failure to develop the Hasthinapuram bus terminus for more than 25 years and improper maintenance of several lakes, including Veeraraghava Eri, Thiruneermalai Lake, Nemilichery Lake and Putheri Lake. The closure of the Venkatamangalam dump yard and the “exorbitant fees” being charged by the Greater Chennai Corporation to use the Perungudi dump yard had forced the municipality to dump the garbage, collected from every house and segregated at the transit station, in the nearby lakes, he says. The activists also blame the municipality for its failure to remove encroachments mushrooming on GST Road and want the Department of Highways to allow two-way traffic on the newly opened bridge at Pallavaram. Allowing one-way traffic serves no purpose, especially when vendors occupy the service road of GST Road on Fridays, causing severe traffic jams. Residents of Thiruneermalai, where the residential population is increasing rapidly, say there has been no piped water supply for more than two decades. They also suffer from low voltage and poor roads. No water supply S. Krishnamurthy, an office-bearer of the Nagappa Nagar Residents Welfare Association at Thiruneermalai, says the locality has been covered by the Palar piped water scheme but the residents do not get any piped supply. However, panchayat officials collect water tax. Residents of Saraswathipuram Extension at Thiruneermalai have for long been demanding the construction of a culvert to link the Fourth Street with the Second Street. They want the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to prevent rampant discharge of waste from tannery units in the locality. However, the residents credit the government with the creation of the flyover at Pallavaram and renovation of Periya Eri and a few lakes on the Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road in the past five years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/voters-pitch-for-merger-with-corporation/article33993695.ece
05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Several storage structures coming up across the Araniar||In a bid to mitigate seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers north of Chennai, the Water Resources Department is constructing a combination of storage structures across Araniar river at Andarmadam, near Pazhaverkadu. The Department has completed nearly 75% of the work on the barrage and a sub-surface dyke across the 130 m-wide river at a cost of Rs. 13 crore. Officials said the storage structures were being built 3 km upstream of the confluence point of the Pazhaverkadu estuary. Water salinity Although groundwater in the Minjur-Ponneri belt is available at a depth of 2-3 m, it has turned saline. Whenever backwaters flow into the river owing to tidal action, the salinity of the water would extend up to 5 km till Vanjivakkam. “We have designed a combination of storage structures to address seawater ingress and help storage of floodwater and groundwater recharge. The sub-surface dyke built for a depth of 7 m at Andarmadam will prevent seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers in the area,” said an official. The barrage, which is a storage structure with regulator arrangements, is built to store additional amount of water in the river. The 2 m-high structure, with 11 shutters, is expected to help store 500 million cubic feet of water in the river. “The flood carrying capacity of the river in the area is about 20,000 cusecs. Once the structures are completed, water flow in the river could be retained for an additional four months,” the official said. Groundwater quality It would help restore groundwater quality in 10 surrounding villages, including Sirupazhaverkadu, Vanjivakkam, Andarmadam, Pralayampakkam, Kattur and Kadapakkam in the Ponneri belt. Several villages depend on the river and waterbodies in the region for cultivation, including of paddy, and for drinking water needs. The project, which is being executed with financial assistance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), is expected to be completed in one or two months, the officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/several-storage-structures-coming-up-across-the-araniar/article33993705.ece

05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Not correct to say I only criticise AIADMK, says Kamal Haasan||Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Thursday said it was not correct to say he only criticised the AIADMK and had a soft approach towards the DMK. Addressing a public meeting in Madipakkam, he took a jibe at the DMK for allotting only six Assembly seats to the VCK. “Those who are saying they stand for social justice are just doing lip service,” he said, indirectly referring to DMK organising secretary R.S. Bharathi’s reported remarks about members of the Scheduled Castes rising to higher positions in the judiciary only because of the DMK. “You talk so much about social justice. To my brother Thol Thirumavalavan (VCK founder), the negotiations started with double digits and ended with six. My brother has to come to me. We will see in the next election,” Mr. Haasan said. He also hit out at Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, accusing him of pushing the State into huge debt. Mr. Haasan also apologised for initially welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetisation move. “It has killed small businesses while big businesses found other ways,” he said. Mr. Haasan disagreed with those saying his party was not experienced enough. “Yes, we are not experienced in corruption, taking bribes, using caste equations or engaging in a riot. We are not experienced in falling at the feet underneath the table,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-correct-to-say-i-only-criticise-aiadmk-says-kamal-haasan/article33993716.ece
05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||IIT-M sets up aerosol testing centre in the Western Ghats||The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-M) has established an atmospheric aerosol monitoring facility at Munnar in the Western Ghats. The laboratory was set up in collaboration with the College of Engineering, Munnar, and the Department of Environment and Climate Change, Kerala. The Natural Aerosol and Bioaerosol High Altitude Laboratory will study the various atmospheric and climate-related trends of the region. IIT-M and the Institute of Climate Change Studies, Kottayam, have signed an agreement to exchange scientific ideas in the area of climate change.  Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan recently inaugurated the laboratory during a virtual ceremony. In his inaugural speech, Mr. Vijayan said the location of the laboratory would help understand the various aspects of the monsoon. “We have experienced devastating floods and landslips in our State over the last few years,” he said and urged the researchers to study if increasing human activities had a role to play in such extreme weather events.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iit-m-sets-up-aerosol-testing-centre-in-the-western-ghats/article33993905.ece
05 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||DMK inks pact with VCK for six Assembly seats||The DMK on Thursday signed an agreement with the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), allotting it six seats. The stalemate over seat-sharing with the Congress continued, with the DMK not altering its offer of 18 seats and the national party not coming back for talks. The CPI is likely to sign an agreement with the DMK for six seats on Friday. The CPI(M) and the MDMK are yet to reach an understanding with the DMK. AIADMK upset The ruling AIADMK is believed to have decided to leave Vijayakant’s DMDK out and finalise agreements with the BJP and the TMC(Moopanar) on Friday. Wednesday’s speech of DMDK deputy general secretary L.K. Sudhish, ridiculing the AIADMK, did not go down well with the ruling party leadership, a functionary said. VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan said, “Even though our party’s high-level committee expressed dissatisfaction with the allocation of six seats, we have taken into consideration the danger posed by the Sanathana forces. We do not want the secular votes to split. Our decision was shaped by far-sightedness and the future of Tamil Nadu politics.” The VCK would contest on its own symbol. The number of reserved and general constituencies to be allotted to it would be decided at the subsequent discussions with the DMK leadership, he said. While stressing the need for secular parties to stay together in the DMK alliance, he said the Left parties and the MDMK had the right to take a decision in the own interest. “The election is a war to defeat the Sanathana forces. The BJP has targeted Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and hatched a conspiracy to get a toehold in the State and in the Union Territory. It is taking advantage of the absence of Jayalalithaa and Kalaignar [M. Karunanidhi]. Even after decades, it is not able to take root in Tamil Nadu, while it could change governments and form governments on its own even in the north-eastern States,” the VCK leader said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said it was not clear whether Sasikala’s decision to “step aside” from politics was shaped by the need for “peace of mind” or the “pressure from the BJP” or her “intention to bring together the AIADMK and the AMMK”. “She has said the DMK should not win in the election. It means she is particular about the coming-together of the AIADMK and the AMMK. If the AIADMK gains in strength, it means the BJP is also gaining in strength. It will not augur well for Tamil Nadu, the land of social justice,” he said. CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan told journalists, “We had a cordial meeting. We will place the proposal at our party meeting for approval. The agreement will be signed tomorrow [Friday].” Asked about the complications in the talks, he quipped, “Even in a marriage, consideration of a bride and a bride-groom will take place a few times.” The CPI(M)’s secretariat would meet on March 6. General secretary Sitaram Yechury will be present. “We are yet to get the call for talks from the DMK. There is no change in the DMK’s offer of six seats, and it is not acceptable to us,” a party leader. The second round of talks between the DMK and the MDMK remained inconclusive. “There is no change in the offer made by the DMK, and it is not acceptable to us. We will inform our leader Vaiko, and as per his direction, we will hold the next round of talks,” deputy general secretary Mallai Sathya said. While stressing the need for secular parties to stay together in the DMK alliance, he said the Left parties and the MDMK had the right to take a decision in the own interest. “The election is a war to defeat the Sanathana forces.

Our objective is to enter the Assembly,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-inks-pact-with-vck-for-six-seats/article33993243.ece
05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Saliva-based test holds promise||Saliva-based rapid antigen test (RAT) could be effective, faster and economical in the diagnosis of COVID-19, a study has found. Chennai Dental Research Foundation (CDRF), Voluntary Health Services (VHS) and Ragas Dental College and Hospital conducted the study using saliva for RAT. The results achieved the minimum standards set by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It recorded a sensitivity of 56% as against the 50% required by ICMR and specificity of 100% when compared to 95% set by ICMR, according to a release. Gunaseelan Rajan, president of CDRF, told reporters that the biggest advantage of using saliva for RAT was it was faster than RT-PCR test. “It is safe. One can take up self-test at home or office using a point of care device. Our research has shown that using saliva for RAT was rapid and effective. It could be utilised for mass screening, rapid screening, and by dentists and ENT doctors as it can detect the virus in 10 minutes,” he said. He said they had written about the findings to the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/saliva-based-test-can-give-quicker-result-study/article33993701.ece

In the morning, the high-level administrative committee met applicants from 39 district units, representing 139 Assembly constituencies. The evening session covered 34 district units for 95 constituencies, according to releases issued by the party. Totally, there were 8,230 applicants, said an office-bearer of the party. The party is likely to come out with its list of candidates by Tuesday after finalising agreements with its allies both on seat-sharing and the allocation of constituencies. Apart from Chief Minister-co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister-coordinator O. Panneerselvam, the committee included deputy secretaries K. P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam; the medical wing secretary P. Venugopal; literary wing secretary B. Valarmathi and MGR Mandram secretary Tamilmagan Hussain. Addressing the applicants, the Chief Minister called upon them to extend cooperation to the selected candidates. He claimed that even though the party was in power for 10 years, its “good governance” saw to it that “no [adverse] feeling” got reflected among people.

05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK does not want a ‘minority government’ like in 2006||The DMK is playing hardball with its allies only to ensure that it gets to contest in as many Assembly seats as possible and form a “strong” government, according to its leaders. “Our plan is to contest in 180 seats. We do not want ourselves to be called a ‘minority’ government. We were subjected to ridicule between 2006 and 2011 because of our failure to get a majority. We distributed more seats to our allies and suffered in the process,” said a senior leader of the party. The DMK wants to form a “strongest government” to prevent any poaching by the BJP in the future. “The allies should realise that the success rate is very high now and they can win almost all the seats allotted to them,” said the senior leader. Boost to base The DMK strongly believes that its support base has swollen after party president M.K. Stalin’s road shows, his constituency-wise campaign and the party’s work during the COVID-19 pandemic. “We want to make use of the situation. We cannot afford to lose it now,” a leader said. Asked whether the Congress had been invited for talks, the sources said, “We have conveyed our offer and it is for them to get back to us.” “There is no truth in the [enhanced] numbers being circulated in the media. We still stand by our earlier offer. Congress leaders may be discussing the issue with the high command. We can resolve the issue smoothly only if they come to the table,” the DMK source said.

05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Split verdict in assets case against Minister||Two judges of the Madras High Court on Thursday delivered a split verdict on whether Milk and Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji must be booked on charges of amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. Justice M. Sathyanarayanan eschewed a preliminary inquiry report giving him a clean chit, filed by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption and insisted on registering an FIR against the Minister to conduct a full-fledged investigation. However, Justice R. Hemalatha differed with him and ordered that there was no need to do so after the State government had accepted the preliminary report and dropped further proceedings in the matter. In view of the contradicting decisions taken by the two judges in the Division Bench, the matter would now be placed before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee to nominate a third judge before whom the case would be listed for a fresh hearing. The split judgment was delivered on a writ petition filed in the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court in 2013 seeking a DVAC probe against the Minister. On June 12, 2018 Justices Sathyanarayanan and Hemalatha had directed the DVAC to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegation by appointing an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer in the rank of Superintendent of Police and to file periodic reports before the court in sealed covers. They said such an inquiry was essential in public interest and in the interest of purity of administration. After filing a series of status reports, State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan, in December 2019, informed the court that the DVAC had submitted a negative report to the Vigilance Commissioner on July 27, 2019. The then Vigilance Commissioner Mohan Pyare forwarded the report to the government which, in turn, decided to drop further proceedings on August 10, 2019. Expressing surprise over the DVAC having conducted a full-fledged investigation in the guise of a preliminary inquiry and without registering an FIR against the Minister, Justice Sathyanarayanan, during the subsequent hearings, wondered whether examination of 90 witnesses and collection of 94 documents could be termed as a preliminary inquiry. He also pointed out that the DVAC had submitted a 63-page inquiry report along with supporting documents totally running to over 700 pages. He went on to state that it was not a case where the DVAC did not find any substance at all. In fact, the DVAC had found the Minister to have possessed assets disproportionate to known sources of his income. Yet, it chose not to prosecute him because the difference between known sources of income and the value of the assets was less than 10% Stating that the scope of a preliminary inquiry was restricted to find out whether a complaint had made out commission of a cognizable offence or not, the judge asked how the DVAC could go to the extent of according the benefit of 10% permissible variation as per the 1977 Supreme Court judgment in Krishnanand Agnihotri’s case and decide not to prosecute the Minister. Possibly, such a conclusion could be reached after registering an FIR and conducting a full-fledged investigation, but definitely not at the stage of preliminary inquiry, the judge said. In reply, senior counsel M. Ajmal Khan, representing the Minister, had said that ordering a full-fledged investigation at this stage would be a futile exercise since the DVAC had already found that there was no need to prosecute. He also said it was the second time that the DVAC had conducted a preliminary inquiry against the Minister and the government had decided to drop all further proceedings. A similar exercise had been carried out in 2014 too but not satisfied with it, the court had ordered for yet another inquiry in 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-delivers-split-verdict-in-assets-case-against-rajenthra-bhalaji/article33993246.ece
05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Man survives fall from 17th floor in Chennai||Apollo Specialty Hospital in OMR recently treated a 20-year-old air-conditioning mechanic who fell from the 17th floor of a construction site at Perungudi. M.D. Firoj Alam tripped and fell to the fifth floor of the building. He sustained multiple injuries on his body, fractured his legs, skull and facial bones. He was brought to the hospital in an unresponsive state, with breathing problems, extreme hypotension and bleeding from the head, mouth, ears and nose. In both his legs, the bones were exposed. The patient was given artificial respiration and blood transfusion and I.V. fluids were administered. When the patient stabilised, a series of CT scan was done to assess the injury. There were blood clots in his occipital lobes, he had sustained cervical spine fracture, his liver and right kidney were damaged and he had broken bones in both his legs. A team headed by Roopesh Kumar, senior consultant, neurosurgeon, besides critical care consultants Pratheema Ramachandran and Devachandran Jayakumar planned the patient’s treatment modalities. The doctors paralysed him, stabilised the lower limbs using plaster of Paris and did a tracheostomy for ventilation. He was administered medication to reduce the swelling in the brain. When his condition improved, a plastic surgeon began treating his facial fractures. It was a challenge to prevent sepsis and keep at bay psychiatric issues, Dr. Roopesh Kumar said. Luckily, the patient needed only medical treatment for injuries to his liver and kidney. On regaining consciousness, the patient required psychiatric support to treat his aggressive behaviour and mood swings. He suffered several bouts of fever, requiring an infectious diseases specialist’s intervention. Two months after the accident and with rehabilitation support and intensive physiotherapy, Mr. Firoz is ready to return home in Rahikpur, Bihar. His father was with him throughout his ordeal. Doctors said in three months, he would be able to walk normally and within a year he would be fit to return to work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-survives-fall-from-17th-floor/article33993696.ece

Sasikala’s decision to step aside from politics and said that her move will fulfil “Amma’s [Jayalalithaa] dreams” of a united AIADMK. Speaking to reporters at the party State headquarters here, Mr. Ravi said, “Amma dreamt of a united AIADMK, strong AIADMK. But now Sasikala has taken a decision and it will fulfil Amma’s dreams.” Mr. Ravi also said he expected AMMK leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran to take a decision in the same way. “Dhinakaran, also I hope, will fulfil Amma’s dreams,” he said. His statement comes amidst speculation that the BJP is trying to rope in the AMMK into the AIADMK fold. A senior BJP leader told The Hindu on Wednesday that such a proposal had been floated last week by the BJP, but senior leaders of the AIADMK were not on board with the proposal. “Do you think we want to break the AIADMK? To curb Amma’s dreams? No. Our main intention is to defeat the DMK alliance.

05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco can seek changes in tariff only in next plea: TNERC||The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) has ruled that the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) can seek the exclusion of non-manufacturing units from a particular tariff category only when filing the next tariff petition. Tangedco had filed a petition seeking tariff clarification in respect of establishments where no manufacturing activity is being carried out and charged under ‘HT Tariff I A’ based on registered factories licences and under ‘LT Tariff III B’ without any certificate for manufacturing of goods.  Various establishments It mentioned establishments like packaging units, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation workshops, pumping of oil and gas units, central preparation units of food/sweets/bakery, prawn and shrimp culture units, battery charging units and reverse osmosis plants. Industry associations opposed Tangedco’s petition and contended that if any list of industries has to be removed from the HT-IA and LT-IIIB tariff category, then it has to be made available for comments from the public. TNERC noted that in the 2017 tariff order it had mentioned that in case Tangedco identifies the need for specifically excluding any other activity, then the State utility should submit the necessary proposal for the same, along with justification in its next tariff petition. Any mid-course clarification to classify any type/group of activities after 4 years from the issue of the tariff order may result in retrospective revision of tariff for that category, it noted. “Tangedco is directed to include the tariff clarification items in their petition to be filed so as to get the views of the stakeholders and to decide the matter. Until such time, the present tariff order has to be followed,” TNERC said.  Tangedco is directed to include the tariff clarification items in their petition to be filed so as to get the views of the stakeholders and to decide the matter||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-can-seek-changes-in-tariff-only-in-next-plea-tnerc/article33993287.ece

05 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cong. expects allocation of 30 seats by DMK||The Congress appeared firm on its demand for the allocation of at least 30 Assembly seats by the DMK, which heads the Secular Progressive Alliance in Tamil Nadu. The DMK’s current offer, however, stands at 18. Several leaders in the Congress echoed the sentiment of being given a “dignified number” of a minimum of 30 seats. None of the leaders was, however, willing to go on record. After an internal meeting of the TNCC’s top brass on Thursday evening, the consensus arrived at was that anything below 30 seats was unacceptable to the Congress, highly placed sources in the party told The Hindu . “When the AIADMK is making all efforts to keep its allies intact, the DMK’s behaviour is not appropriate. If two of the most powerful Ministers, P. Thangamani and S.P. Velumani, can go and meet DMDK chief Vijayakant to mollify the party on seat adjustments [a few days ago], why can’t the DMK reach out to its allies?” a senior TNCC leader asked. Another senior leader said the Congress’s “vote share” would be important to ensure that the DMK wins. He added that the national party was working only to make DMK president M.K. Stalin the Chief Minister. The Congress was not going to get a share in power, the leader said. The Congress leadership expects the issue to be settled by Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cong-expects-allocation-of-30-seats-by-dmk/article33993712.ece

He was 88. Fondly referred to as R.K., Krishnamurthy was also a renowned epigraphist. He was born near Nagercoil in Kanniyakumari. After studying in a local school, he joined Scott Christian College at Nagercoil and then moved to Karaikudi to do a B.Sc. in Geology. He further did his post-graduation in Geology at the Presidency College. He joined Dinamalar in 1956 and became its Editor in 1977. Krishnamurthy introduced the well-known Periyar script in 1977 in the Tiruchi edition of the newspaper. He also studied various inscriptions in the Vatteluthu script in different parts of Tamil Nadu. The data collected was published in three books in Tamil. In his condolence message, Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit said Krishnamurthy’s interests in Tamil script reform led him to trace its origin, which in turn kindled his interest in numismatics. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, DMK president M.K. Stalin, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri, PMK founder S. Ramadoss, MDMK chief Vaiko and AMMK general secretary T.T.V.

05 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||CPI (M) working to defeat BJP-AIADMK alliance: Yechury||The CPI (M) is working for the defeat of the BJP-AIADMK alliance in Tamil Nadu, its general secretary Sitaram Yechury told journalists in Coimbatore on Thursday. Mr. Yechury charged the AIADMK government with actively supporting every single measure the BJP had taken in Parliament, including the farm bills and the industrial policy. Tamil Nadu had a legacy of fighting for the rights of the States and for the principle of federalism. But the AIADMK government supported every move of the BJP, he said. “We are working for the defeat of the BJP-AIADMK alliance. We will co-operate with all the forces willing to achieve this objective,” he said. The party remained in the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance and seat-sharing talks were continuing. When a journalist suggested that there appeared to be no anti-incumbency in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, he said the ruling party would be defeated in Tamil Nadu, and in Kerala the incumbent government would retain power. Kerala had adopted its own farm laws, rejecting those of the Centre. In Tamil Nadu, on the contrary, the State government was supporting the laws passed by the Centre. “The AIADMK is seen completely as the secondary, junior partner of the BJP,” he said. CPI (M) Polit Bureau member G. Ramakrishnan said that except one seat, the BJP-AIADMK alliance lost all others in the last Parliamentary elections. And, in the two years, there was more displeasure among the people, he said. Mr. Yechury said petroleum prices were being increased almost on a daily basis. This was a tax imposed on the people to meet the propaganda expenses of the Prime Minister and the BJP, he alleged. The economic policies were destroying the country’s self-reliance, which was the basis of the Indian economy. Nearly 15 crore people lost their jobs or livelihood last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the billionaires were actually making bonanza profit. “All policies (of the Central government) are being directed towards further enriching the chosen cronies of the Prime Minister and everybody knows who they are,” he alleged. Later, at a public meeting, Mr. Yechury said “This is a government for the rich of India”. There was a “mega loot” of financial assets by the Central Government. It wanted to privatise the Public Sector Undertakings, banks, etc. For more than three months, farmers are struggling against the three farm laws and wanted these repealed. Over 300 farmers had died. But this government was completely unresponsive to the demands, he said. There should be political courage to implement the options that would revive the economy and the MSMEs, he said. “The entire country was proud of Tiruppur at one point of time, that the whole world was dominated by the fabric that was produced here,” Mr. Yechury said at a public meeting later in Tiruppur. He alleged that the garment industries in Tiruppur had been adversely affected in the past six years under the BJP-led Central government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpi-m-working-to-defeat-bjp-aiadmk-alliance-yechury/article33993307.ece

05 March 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Beaten elephant sent back to temple from camp||Nearly two weeks after temple elephant Jeyamalyatha was roughed up by its mahout and his assistant at the Thekkampatti annual rejuvenation camp for temple and mutt elephants, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR & CE) Department sent the elephant back to the Srivilliputhur Andal temple in the early hours of Thursday. Official sources from the HR & CE Department and the Forest Department told The Hindu that the elephant was sent back in a separate vehicle from the camp premises near Mettupalayam at around 2.30 a.m. on Thursday. On February 20, mahout Vinil Kumar, 46, and another caretaker, Sivaprasath, 32, caned the elephant on its legs. A video clip of this act went viral on social media platforms. Subsequently, the HR&CE Department suspended the mahout and the Forest Department arrested the duo the next day. They were granted bail by a court in Mettupalayam on Tuesday. Since the mahout’s arrest, the 19-year-old female elephant had remained mostly chained at the camp even after the appointment of a new mahout. The sources said a committee comprising elephant experts from the Forest and Animal Husbandry Departments had recently recommended shifting the elephant back to the temple as being chained for long hours would impact its physical and mental health. Following this, the Srivilliputhur Andal temple administration sent a team to the Thekkampatti camp premises on Wednesday. Mr. Subramaniam will continue to be the new mahout for the elephant as per the directions of the temple administration. Meanwhile, the HR&CE Department will continue with its disciplinary proceedings against Kumar and will seek an explanation for his act, the sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/beaten-elephant-sent-back-to-temple-from-camp/article33993305.ece

Farmers from within the district and from nearby districts bring their cattle to the shandy that is held on Thursdays every week. Also, buyers from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and a few other States also visit the shandy and purchase cattle. Since the model code of conduct is in force, the Election Commission has mandated that people should have valid documents for carrying cash above Rs. 50,000. The norms led to poor business at the shandy as most of the traders from other States did not turn up. Farmers, who brought their cattle to the shandy, said they faced the problem during elections as they would not be able to produce any bills after selling their cattle. “On an average, 950 to 1,100 cattle arrive at the cattle regularly. But today, the cattle arrival dropped by 40 % while traders’ arrival by over 65 %”, said a farmer. The farmers said vehicle checks and seizure of cash prevented both farmers and traders from coming to the shandy. “Until the model code is withdrawn, transactions will be fewer,” said another farmer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cash-curb-hits-sale-at-cattle-shandy/article33993313.ece

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice R. Hemalatha observed that the Indian fishermen should be educated in this regard.

The judges took cognisance of the submissions made by the Centre and the State that the joint working group had met in December 2020 to discuss the issue. The Centre said with regard to the recent case of drowning of fishermen from Ramanathapuram, it was the Indian vessel which crossed the maritime boundary and collided with the Sri Lankan vessel. The judges suggested that training programmes could be conducted for the fishermen and navigation systems could be made mandatory in fishing vessels. The Centre and the State submitted that efforts were being made in this regard. The court took note of the submission and disposed of the petition filed by K.K.

05 March 2021||P. A. NarayaniMadurai,TAMIL NADU||New to the poll arena but not to its idiosyncrasies||A political party which never canvasses votes based on caste and community, and rather focuses on public welfare must win the upcoming Assembly elections, say a majority of first-time voters. With the announcement of the polling date for the upcoming Assembly elections, many first-time voters are gearing up to exercise their franchise. The first time voters who spoke to The Hindu have varied expectations from the leaders and the political parties. Education and health R. Nandha Kumar, a first-year student of Government Law College, Madurai, says education and health are important areas that the government must focus on. “Parties that try to attract voters based on caste and community, don’t focus on the welfare of the public. They only try to perpetuate the caste hierarchy prevailing in the society,” he says. Many first-time voters feel that a good political leader must constantly interact with the public to understand their grievances and try to address them. “Political leaders release many advertisements through various platforms, but direct interaction with the people is very important,” says K. Brinda, a first-time voter. S. Atchaya, a first-time voter of Madurai Medical College, says the government must be corruption-free and honest. The political campaigns on digital platforms, especially on social media platforms, play an important role in influencing the young voters, says S. Srinidhi of Lady Doak College (LDC). “Many students take their decisions based on the way the political parties project themselves on digital platforms,” she adds. A good government must focus on the welfare of farmers, says R. Pichaimuthu, 19, from Kambur village. C. Kishore of American College expects a good leader to work for the development of Madurai. “Compared to other major cities, Madurai lags behind industrial development. Many graduates have to travel to other places to get jobs,” he adds. Women’s safety For Esha Jain, a first-year student of Lady Doak College, safety of girls and women is one of the main areas that the government must focus on. She also highlights that roads are in a pathetic condition in Madurai. “Addressing the civic issues of the people is a basic duty of any government,” she adds.  Hopes and views  Parties that play caste-community card never focus on people’s welfare  Instead of media blitzkrieg, political leaders must have interaction with people  Students watch how leaders project themselves on digital platforms||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/they-are-new-to-the-poll-arena-but-not-to-its-idiosyncrasies/article33993301.ece

Everything will be finalised in two to three days,” Mr. Saminathan said. When asked about the delay in arriving at a seat-sharing formula, Mr. Namassivayam said even the Congress and the DMK had not finalised the seats. Mr. Meghwal said the manifesto would be people-centric and it would reflect the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make Union Territory the BEST (business hub, education hub, spiritual hub and tourism hub). Mr. Namassivayam said a preliminary meeting of the committee was held on Thursday. Vehicles would travel to all 30 constituencies, starting Friday, to collect the views of the public, he said, adding people’s wishes would be the party’s electoral commitment. Boxes would be kept at prominent places to collect suggestions from the public. The committee, comprising 12 members, would hold consultative meetings with trade bodies, members from the tourism sector, students, educationalists and those working in the spiritual world, the former Minister said. Other members of the manifesto committee include ex-legislators P.M.L. Kalyanasundaram, A. John Kumar, E. Theeppainthan, M. Ilango and nominated legislator S. Selvaganapathy.

In a memorandum addressed to the Railway Board, the association has urged for revival of the suspended services from Tamil New Year’s day, April 14, instead of June. While reviving the services, the Railway Board should consider rescheduling of train services passing through Adhiramapattinam, Thiruthuraipoondi, Muthupettai, Tiruvarur and others in the East Coast belt that were originating from Chennai to Shencottah/Rameswaram and vice-versa as the services cross these stations at odd hours in the night, the association said. Further, the Chennai- Shencottah train should originate from Egmore instead of Tambaram. The association also sought the introduction of freight services through the East Coast belt in view of the freight potential generated by agriculture and horticulture activities, seafood related industries and salt manufacturing units. It also pleaded that train services on Mayiladuthurai-Madurai route and Vailankanni-Ernakulam route be operated through the newly laid broad-gauge section for the benefit of commuters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-reintroduce-train-services/article33993258.ece

Thanks to regulation of vehicular movements close to the project site, laying of approach roads on either sides of the highway is currently under way. The project which commenced in October last year proceeded briskly but had to be suspended for nearly three weeks in January due to unseasonal rains. However, the NHAI resumed the work later and completed the passageway which runs underneath. The laying of approach road towards the Chennai side as part of the project had reached the advanced stage of completion. Work on laying the approach side towards the Tiruchi side was also under way simultaneously. The authorities said the approach road towards Chennai side is expected to be completed by this month and the one taken up towards Tiruchi side would be finished thereafter. The entire project was proposed to be completed by April or latest by the second week of May, the authorities further said adding that the project was being executed at a cost of around Rs. 25 crore. The authorities said regulation of traffic movements by the City Police near the project site on the Chennai Bypass Road had enabled speedy execution of the project. The Chennai Bypass Road witnesses heavy volume of vehicular movements towards Chennai and towards southern districts. Once completed, the underpass is expected to help reduce accidents at Kondayampettai since vehicle crossings would be completely avoided. Further, the vehicular underpass would ensure uninterrupted highway traffic on both directions and reduce congestion, says a senior NHAI official. The project was taken up by the NHAI following complaints of accidents taking place along the Chennai Bypass Road at Kondayampettai.

05 March 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Covering reduced syllabus remains a challenge for Plus Two teachers||Leave alone government schools, teachers of many private schools under both the State and CBSE Boards are not certain about covering even the trimmed-down portions, reduced in view of COVID- 19 lockdown, ahead of the Plus Two public exam to take place during May-June. The CBSE has reduced 30 % of portions while under the State Board, one third of the portions have been made optional, implying that the teachers will need to cover them in any case to prepare the students for NEET, JEE and other exams for entry into professional courses. Though in-person classes are being conducted for Tenth and Plus Two students over the last two months, there is a lot more to be covered, the teachers say. Not much content could be covered through online classes, a senior teacher said, admitting that the classes were not effective enough in the first place. Postponement of the public exam by two months this year has indeed provided some breathing space for teachers to rush through the portions. But then, there is no certainty that NEET and JEE will also be postponed in a similar way. “There should be at least two months gap between the public exam and NEET / JEE. Otherwise, the prospects of regular students to get through the exam will be bleak,” a correspondent of a private school said. The Ministry of Education at the Centre is understood to have taken a stand that NEET syllabus for 2021 will be confined to the 70 % content of CBSE syllabus. The worry of teachers and students of State Board is that the absence of complete uniformity in the reduced portions vis-a-vis the CBSE syllabus, would put them at a serious disadvantage. “The timing or syllabus of NEET / JEE will not be a problem for repeaters.

As cost of petrol inches towards Rs. 100 a litre, and awareness on reducing carbon emissions gains ground, there is a shit towards electric vehicles, say customers say. Showrooms selling battery-operated vehicles are recording a surge in sales. Even a few months ago, not too many electric vehicles plied on city roads. However, since the spike in petrol prices, many have decided to invest in electric vehicles as they are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Speaking to The Hindu , S. Radhakrishnan, a resident of Srirangam said that the had purchased an e-vehicle two months ago and has saved at least Rs. 1,000 already. “I have used the vehicle for 600 kilometres. In a petrol vehicle, it would require at least 12 litres of petrol. On the other hand, a single charge of the vehicle, which would give up to 100 km of mileage, consumes only up to 1.2 units of electricity,” he claimed. It also helps reduce pollution, he added. A common grouse is that not enough charging points are available. However, Mr. Radhakrishanan was of the opinion that it would soon change. “Once more people start buying electric vehicles, charging stations will crop up just like petrol bunks. This is the future of transport,” he added. Meanwhile, R. Ramaswamy, an e-vehicle vendor said that while there were complaints regarding electric vehicles a few years ago, new models have better features, than regular vehicles. Dealers have recorded a 25% increase in sales over the last two months alone. “Apart from sales, we are also receiving enquiries and people showing interest in test-driving the vehicle. The awareness has surely increased,” he said. An e-vehicle costs anywhere from Rs. 45,000 to Rs. 90,000 depending upon the models. There is no maintenance charge for at least four years after its purchase, Mr. Ramaswamy claims. “In a petrol vehicle, you have to service it once in a few months, road taxes, insurances and other miscellaneous expenses will prove to be very costly,” he said. “Replacing a battery in an e-vehicle now costs Rs. 18,000 and this cost is expected to go down soon”, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/electric-vehicles-rev-up-as-petrol-prices-skyrocket/article33993262.ece

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Poll ticket: race hots up in parties||With the Assembly election fast approaching, members of the ruling AIADMK and the DMK are camping in Chennai trying to bag the ticket through ‘their channels’. The BJP has started electioneering in Tirunelveli constituency, as if the seat has been allotted to the party. The AIADMK workers, however, are undeterred and hope the constituency will be theirs this time. BJP State vice-president Nainar Nagenthran, who was elected to the Assembly in 2001 and 2011 but lost in 2006 and 2016, has started election work in Tirunelveli. He has held bike rallies and has also roped in campaigners including actor Kushboo. No wonder, the AIADMK cadre fumes with anger over the unilateral move of its ally. Party functionaries are keen on getting the segment with a good number of them camping in Chennai to get the ticket. Tirunelveli district secretary N. Ganesa Raja, who has done a lot of spadework in this constituency, Tirunelveli Aavin chairman ‘Sudha’ K. Paramasivan, former Mayor and former Rajya Sabha member Vijila Sathyananth, former Mayor Bhuvaneshwari and former chairman of Maanur union Kallur Velayutham are prominent contenders. In DMK, sitting MLA A.L.S. Lakshmanan, former MLA N. Maalairaja, former corporation councilor S.V. Suresh and a few others are in the race. Since the Palayamkottai Assembly segment, housing sizable number of teachers, government employees and Muslim voters, has been a DMK bastion, there is severe competition among party cadre and its allies to get the ticket. The forerunners are sitting MLA T.P.M. Mohideen Khan, who has been elected from the constituency on four consecutive occasions since 2001, Tirunelveli city district secretary Abdul Wahab and former councilor Kamaludeen. For the Ambasamudram constituency, Mr. Ganesa Raja, former minister Esakki Subiah, a strong contender, sitting MLA R. Murugaiah Pandian, his son Venkatraman and former Rajya Sabha MP P.H. Manoj Pandian are hoping to win the ticket. In DMK, former Speaker R. Avudaiyappan, his son A. Prabhakaran and Ajay Padayappan Sethupathi, a young businessman, and others are in the race. Since Mr. Ajay has done a lot of spadework in the constituency over the past few months in a bid to get the ticket in the DMK, tonnes of complaints against him have been forwarded to the party high command in an apparent attempt to spoil his chances. In Congress, former MLA P. Veldurai, who was disqualified by the Supreme Court in a case filed by Mr. Manoj Pandian, and his son V. Durai, are also trying to get the seat. The race to bag the Radhapuram ticket is so intense in the ruling AIADMK with sitting MLA I.S. Inbadurai, former MLA S. Michael Rayappan, party office-bearers Pauldurai, Narayanaperumal and A.K. Srinivasan in the race. Mr. Inbadurai, who won the electoral battle in 2016 by a wafer thin margin of 49 votes, also faces a legal battle by runner-up M. Appavu of DMK in the Supreme Court, which has stopped the declaration of results of recounting of votes. In DMK, Mr. Appavu, a three-time MLA from the constituency, party office-bearers V.S.R. Jegadeesh, M. Graham Bell and Tirunelveli MP S. Gnanathiraviam’s son Xavier are trying to get the ticket. Nanguneri, which recently witnessed a by-poll, has also attracted intense competition from sitting MLA Reddiyarpatti V. Narayanan and office-bearers Mr. Ganesa Raja, Mr. Manoj Pandian and A.K. Srinivasan. In Congress, party treasurer Ruby R. Manoharan, who has done excellent groundwork in the constituency over the past 18 months even after losing the electoral battle to Mr. Narayanan, is trying to get the ticket even as facing challenge from advocate Kamaraj and a few others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poll-ticket-race-hots-up-in-parties/article33993955.ece

Now, they are an attractive sofa set decorating the reception hall of the Corporation’s administrative office here. Just a few months ago, the civic body created a bathroom with discarded plastic waterbottles for its personnel working at a micro compost centre, which drew huge public attention. It all started when the Corporation purchased 70 drums of the oil to tackle mosquito breeding during the last monsoon that battered the coastal town. The pungent smell from the empty drums put off buyers and the empty drums lay unheeded at the Corporation Ward Office near VVD Signal. The civic officials then hit upon a plan to convert them into furniture such as sofa set. Corporation Commissioner Sharanya Ari agreed. Three drums were crafted into a sofa set and teapoy and found their way into the Corporation’s reception hall at her behest. What is more, the civic chief instructed that all such drums be turned into similar furniture pieces and placed in offices and parks maintained by the urban local body. “We spent about Rs. 2,000 for the sofa set towards purchase of paint and cushions,” said the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drumming-up-furniture-from-waste/article33993293.ece

The BJP has targeted Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and hatched a conspiracy to get a toehold in the State and in the Union Territory. It is taking advantage of the absence of Jayalalithaa and Kalaignar [M. Karunanidhi]. Even after decades, it is not able to take root in Tamil Nadu, while it could change governments and form governments on its own even in the north-eastern States,” the VCK leader said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said it was not clear whether Sasikala’s decision to “step aside” from politics was shaped by the need for “peace of mind” or the “pressure from the BJP” or her “intention to bring together the AIADMK and the AMMK”. “She has said the DMK should not win in the election. It means she is particular about the coming-together of the AIADMK and the AMMK. If the AIADMK gains in strength, it means the BJP is also gaining in strength. It will not augur well for Tamil Nadu, the land of social justice,” he said. CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan told journalists, “We had a cordial meeting. We will place the proposal at our party meeting for approval. The agreement will be signed tomorrow [Friday].” Asked about the complications in the talks, he quipped, “Even in a marriage, consideration of a bride and a bride-groom will take place a few times.” The CPI(M)’s secretariat would meet on March 6. General secretary Sitaram Yechury will be present. “We are yet to get the call for talks from the DMK. There is no change in the DMK’s offer of six seats, and it is not acceptable to us,” a party leader. The second round of talks between the DMK and the MDMK remained inconclusive. “There is no change in the offer made by the DMK, and it is not acceptable to us. We will inform our leader Vaiko, and as per his direction, we will hold the next round of talks,” deputy general secretary Mallai Sathya said. He said the MDMK had presence from Gummidipoondi to Kanniyakumari, and the number of seats offered should match its strength. “We are working together with the DMK to fight the danger facing Tamil Nadu. Our objective is to enter the Assembly,” the deputy general secretary said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-inks-pact-with-vck-for-six-seats/article33993248.ece

05 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||City ranks high on Ease of Living Index||Bengaluru being adjudged the most liveable large city in the Ease of Living Index (EoLI) 2020, a meteoric improvement from 58th position in 2018, has taken many experts and opposition parties by surprise, even as the ruling BJP claimed credit. Several experts have questioned the ‘most liveable large city’ tag. “Clearly, such surveys based on non-existent methodologies are driven by deeply political agendas. Anyone living in Bengaluru knows how seriously degraded the city is. With equitable access to basic amenities like water, roads and public transport being in shambles, such surveys and rankings hold no meaning,” said Leo F. Saldanha of the Environment Support Group. The review criteria for EoLI-2020 significantly deviates from that of 2018. While the criteria in 2018 focused more on governance parameters, criteria for 2020 includes several questions on individual choices and priorities by citizens. Given the legacy of the city, Bengaluru has scored high on these parameters, civic sources said. “An index measures what we seek to measure. Service deliverability, infrastructure and governance are among key factors to be measured. If the index is not reflective of the ground reality, it will only lose credibility,” said urbanist Ashwin Mahesh. “Collectively, we have done little to fix the large governance deficit in the city over the last two years. Even the new BBMP Act, 2020 has failed to stand up to the occasion. In such a scenario, what prompted this big leap in the ranking is puzzling,” said Congress MLA Krishna Byre Gowda. The high ranking in EoLI is accompanied by a poor below average performance in the Municipal Performance Index (MPI) – 31st rank among 51 large cities – also released on Thursday, indicating the ‘governance deficit’ in the city Mr. Byre Gowda points out. The city has scored below average in planning and finances while it has scored on par with the average of 51 large cities in services and technology, and more than average in governance. The IT capital was ranked 25 among 51 large cities on adoption of technology in municipal administration, much below cities like Indore, Bareilly, Surat and Bhopal. “Given the evaluation criteria for EoLI-2020, the top ranking in Ease of Living is more a reflection of the city’s history and legacy. We cannot rest on that laurel as the poor show in MPI is a diagnosis of the future of the city that we need to fix,” said Srikanth Viswanathan, CEO, Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy. Civic Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said the challenge was to retain the ranking. “Our performance in MPI has not been satisfactory. The MPI is calculated on nearly 100 criteria. We will review our performance in each of these criteria and initiate measures to improve ourselves,” he said.  Clearly, such surveys based on non-existent methodologies are driven by deeply political agendas. Anyone living in Bengaluru knows how seriously degraded the city is Leo F.

Under the second phase, senior citizens and those above 45 years with comorbidities are being covered and the demand is high. State Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra told The Hindu that all the 2,300 PHCs and over 60 CHCs were being readied to start the vaccination programme from Monday. Also, all private hospitals empanelled under CGHS, Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka health scheme, and other State health insurance schemes will be allowed to operate as COVID-19 vaccination centres in a phased manner. “We have identified the hospitals and mapped them with the nearest cold chain points to ensure seamless flow of vaccines to them,” he said. “We had an orientation programme for all our health officials today to prepare them for taking up the programme. We will have more such sessions before starting the programme.” In the initial phase, the department had permitted all taluk and district hospitals and two identified private hospitals from each district, apart from 18 private health facilities from the BBMP. Total vaccinations Meanwhile, as many as 10,525 senior citizens and 1,561 above 45 years with comorbidities got vaccinated on Thursday. Cumulatively, Bengaluru Urban recorded the highest numbers — 13,270 and 1,623, respectively. Overall, from Monday onwards when the drive began, a total of 33,632 senior citizens and 5,179 above 45 years with comorbidities have been vaccinated. So far, a total of 4,51,007 healthcare workers and 1,64,194 frontline workers have taken the first dose of vaccination. As many as 2,20,566 healthcare workers have taken the second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vaccination-in-phcs-chcs-and-more-private-hospitals-from-monday/article33993657.ece
05 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Many CDs surface, but truth remains hidden||The episode of a CD surfacing that showed BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi being intimate with a woman, allegedly after promising her a government posting, is only the latest in a series of such scandals in Karnataka politics. However, history shows that investigations into these cases have rarely gone very far. They remain no more than blips in the careers of male politicians. In over a decade now, at least six instances of Ministers and legislators being in compromising positions have been leaked to the media. H.Y. Meti of the Congress in 2016 and Haratalu Halappa of the BJP in 2010 lost their ministerial posts in the process. However, in no case did the woman, the alleged victim, get justice nor the accused man punished. The men who found themselves in a spot over CDs, though suffered temporary setback in their political career, mostly bounced back. A senior police official who has investigated two such cases in the past said the biggest impediment to probes was not just political pressures in favour of and against the accused, but failure to get the woman, the alleged victim, to testify. “Without a victim there is no case,” he pointed out. For instance, in the case of Mr. Meti, the alleged victim made several volte faces accusing the Minister of abuse to only retract it, prompting the CID to give the Minister a clean chit. In the instance of Mr. Jarkiholi, the woman in the video is yet to make a statement to the police. K.S. Vimala, V-P, All India Democratic Women’s Association, Karnataka, said the patriarchal mindset of society often means the woman ends up being shamed, making it tough for women to fight for justice, especially when the alleged perpetrators are those in power. “The recent MeToo movement exposed just that. The need of the hour is a dedicated law to protect victims of sexual abuse,” she argued. Senior advocate B.T. Venkatesh said given that the State has been informed of an alleged crime, it is duty-bound to not only investigate the crime, but also protect the alleged victim. However, he also cautioned that a video of a consensual sexual act between adults was no crime and there was a criminal case only if there was an “element of harm”, which can be established only through an investigation. Another challenge police officials face in such cases was establishing the genuineness of the video. “In many cases, the videos presented would have been edited, compromising its evidentiary value. In such cases, blackmail cannot be ruled out,” a police officer said. “Often politicians and activists speak of the existence of incriminating CDs. But most of them never come to the public domain, indicating this element of bargain or blackmail,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-cds-surface-but-truth-remains-hidden/article33993355.ece
05 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Release caste census report’||In the midst of agitations to seek reservation or changes in the reservation category in Karnataka, ruling party member A.H. Vishwanath on Thursday criticised the government’s decision to set up a three-member committee to look into reservation issues and urged the government to accept the caste census report submitted by the backward classes commission. “Accept the caste census report finalised by the Kanthraj commission and allow a public debate on it. I do not agree with the formation of the committee,” the BJP MLC said during the discussion on the socio-economic census. He pointed out that when reservation was provided during D. Devaraj Urs period without any community asking for it. “Today, communities are demanding reservation, with religious heads taking the lead,” he said. He also questioned the delay in releasing the report. Delay Another ruling party member, K.P. Nanjundi, accused the government of consistently delaying the release of the report. He said, “When I asked the government last time, I was informed that the report would be released soon since a new chairman had been appointed to the commission.” Senior Janata Dal (Secular) member Marithibbe Gowda accused political parties of fuelling demand for reservation of communities, including that of Kurubas and Panchamasalis. When he suggested that religious heads should shed their saffron robes before taking to streets, Congress and BJP members took objection. Mr. Gowda also took objection to Cabinet Ministers taking part in the agitations seeking reservation. Meanwhile, Muzrai Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary, in his response, said the report was ready, and that they would hold discussion with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to release the report soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/release-caste-census-report/article33993348.ece
05 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘No need for BBMP nod to install electricity transformer on footpath’||The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (Bescom) on Thursday told the High Court of Karnataka that, as of now, there is no requirement in law to obtain permission from local authorities to draw overhead lines or install transformers, including on footpaths. A statement was given in writing in response to the court’s question whether Bescom had taken permission from Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to install electricity transformers on footpaths across the city. “Approval of local authority is necessary to be taken in respect of cases and circumstances in which such consent is made necessary by the rules framed by the State government in terms of Section 67(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003,” the Bescom said, while pointing out that the State government has so far not framed rules for this purpose. Rules cited As provisions of the Electricity Act 2003 override all other laws, there was no need to get permission to install transformers from the local authority, the Bescom clarified to the court. The bench indicated that keeping public interest and safety in mind, the court will have to examine the legal status and opinion of the traffic police. The bench adjourned till March 16 further hearing on a PIL petition, filed by G.B. Athri, a retired Wing Commander of the Indian Air Force, complaining about the danger posed to the public by transformers installed on footpaths and locations adjacent to roads. The Bescom has clarified to the court that the Central Electrical Authority had approved its design of installing transformers at a height of seven feet in a spun pole to ensure safety of the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-need-for-bbmp-nod-to-install-electricity-transformer-on-footpath/article33993674.ece

He was referring to the alleged encroachment by Islamia Institute of Technology, regarding which a case is currently in the Supreme Court. To file affidavit Revenue Minister R. Ashok said they would file an affidavit in the Supreme Court over the case soon, as it was expected to come up for hearing on March 8. Congress member Nazeer Ahmed said the land remained under dispute as authorities did not proceed beyond primary certification for the land, which was done in 1980. “It won’t be wrong to say that the college is being discriminated against,” he said. While the government has sanctioned five or 10 acre land to different education trusts within a couple of months, regularisation application of the engineering college is pending since 2018, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/recover-encroached-govt-land-ravikumar/article33993351.ece

Rakesh Tikayat and others, who are leading the farmers’ struggle in Delhhi, will be participating in the event. A preliminary meeting was held in Sagar on Wednesday. Former MLA Madhu Bangarappa, Raitha Sangha leaders K.T. Gangadhar, H.R. Basavarajappa and others participated in the meeting and discussed the preparations. Mr. Madhu Bangarappa, speaking to presspersons on the occasion, said all those who consume products grown by farmers should support the farmers’ struggle. The Centre and State government had passed farm bills without a debate. “Strong protests across the country are essential to teach a lesson to those in power. Shivamogga is a land of struggles. Many stalwarts have led many movements in this land. And, now Shivamogga will hold the first maha Ppnchayat of the State”, he said. Mr..Basavarajappa took serious exception to the way the Centre handled the farmers’ protests. “The Prime Minister had not responded to the demands raised by the farmers. It shows the Centre is clearly in the hands of corporates, who are expecting the benefits from the farm laws”, he said. Mr. Gangadhar said the State government had amended the Land Reforms Act to help the rich and powerful. Both the Centre and State wanted to help corporate companies, which could easily take over food production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-groups-readying-for-maha-panchayat-in-shivamogga/article33993854.ece

According to a press note by KLE Technological University, the team was led by Poornaditya Mishra and comprised Prithvi Deshpande, Alwin M. Reji, Haripriya Jagadeesh of Automation and Robotics, and Swaroop Shenoy and Goutam Muralidhar of Mechanical Engineering. They were guided by Head of the Department of Automation and Robotics, Arun Giriyapur. The team had selected the problem statement ‘fire safe infrastructure for construction industry’ given by Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The given problem was designing a hardware device that could withstand fire and move inside the place on fire, and should be remotely controlled. The challenge was that the design should be in such a way as to help identify survivors and also douse fire near them. The team proposed a robot as a solution, which would be operated remotely. The robot is incorporated with a main processing unit, cameras [one normal and one infrared] and houses two fire extinguishing mechanisms. The primary mechanism is a spring-based launcher mechanism that launches fire extinguisher balls. These balls are excellent at clearing out rooms in a short time and can greatly assist rescue operations where speed and efficiency are paramount. The secondary mechanism is a traditional spray-based fire extinguisher, which is actuated by cam mechanism, the release said. SIH 2020 involved six stages of process flow. The process started in January 2020 and the students underwent various stages of clearance before being finally adjudged as joint winners of SIH2020 in February 2021. Expressing happiness over achievement, Head of the Department of Automation and Robotics of KLETU, Arun Giriyapur, said that such competitions helped students to think out of the box and come up innovative solutions for real problems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kle-varsity-team-wins-at-smart-india-hackathon/article33993340.ece

Mr. Konaraddi said that the Krishna basin and command area comprised the Mahadayi, the Kalasa-Banduri, and the Malaprabha river projects and the water available at the Almatti reservoir was getting utilised more by Andhra Pradesh and Telengana than Karnataka as the State government had not taken steps for ensuring utilisation of the allocated water share. The apathy of the government had resulted in the project being delayed inordinately, he alleged. He said that as increasing the height of the Almatti dam would lead to submergence of scores of villages, the land acquisition process and rehabilitation would require several lakh crore rupees. “Without assistance from the Union government, the State alone can’t implement the project. So, the Centre should declared it as a national project and allocate funds so that the work is taken up on priority and completed,” he said. Regarding the discrepancies in implementation of the Prime Minister’s Fasal Bima Yojna, he said that as the crop insurance had been entrusted to private insurance firms, the farmers were not getting timely compensation. The scheme should be entrusted to the State-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India, he demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jds-declare-krishna-river-basin-project-as-national-project/article33993338.ece
05 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Mutt land row: DC intervention sought||The controversy surrounding the land donation by Moorusavir Mutt in Hubballi to the KLE Society in Hubballi has reached the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Dharwad with a section of the devotees staging a protest on Thursday. Devotees took out the protest march under the aegis of the Moorusavir Mutt Hitaraskshana Samiti in Dharwad onThursday and then staged ademonstration in front of the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad seeking his intervention in the matter. The protesters alleged that the land donation was in violation of the arbitration agreement signed before the arbitrator appointed by the Supreme Court. They said that in the arbitration agreement it was clearly mentioned that the mutt’s property should not be sold but in spite of that, the mutt’s land had been donated, they argued. Submitting a memorandum to the district officials, the protesters urged the Deputy Commissioner to intervene in the matter and conduct inspection of the land and check the documents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mutt-land-row-dc-intervention-sought/article33993336.ece

05 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Mangaluru ranked 20th in Ease of Living Index for 2020||Mangaluru has bagged the 20th rank among the country’s 62 cities having less than a million population and finally ranked in the Ease of Living Index, 2020 released by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry on Thursday. The city has secured the 42nd rank among 60 cities with less than a million population and finally ranked in the country under the Municipal Performance Index, 2020 announced by the Ministry on the day. Union Minister of State (Independent Charge), Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri announced the release of the final rankings in a virtual event. In all, 111 cities participated in the assessment exercise that was conducted in 2020, the ministry said in a statement. The rankings under Ease of Living Index (EoLI) and Municipal Performance Index (MPI) were announced for cities in two categories – with a population of more than a million, and cities with less than a million people along with all the cities under the Smart Cities Programme, it said. The EoLI is an assessment tool that evaluates the quality of life and the impact of various initiatives for urban development. It provides a comprehensive understanding of participating cities across India based on quality of life, economic-ability of a city, and its sustainability and resilience. The assessment also incorporates the residents' view on the services provided by city administration through a citizen perception survey. The MPI examined the sectoral performance of 111 municipalities across five verticals which comprise of 20 sectors and 100 indicators in all totality. The five verticals under MPI are services, finance, policy, technology, and governance. The Ministry said that the MPI was launched as an accompaniment to the EoLI. It seeks to simplify and evaluate the complexities in local governance practice and promote the ethos of transparency and accountability. Both the indices represent an attempt to gauge the performance of cities across India on various parameters of urban living. These indices provide a holistic assessment of cities based on their efforts to cultivate better quality of life, create infrastructure, and address challenges of urbanisation. Learnings gathered from these indices can help the government identify gaps, tap into potential opportunities, and increase efficiency in local governance to improve lives of citizens and fulfill broader development outcomes. The framework for these assessments were prepared by MoHUA with the Institute for Competitiveness as the knowledge partner, it said. The total EoLI score of Mangaluru for the 20th rank stood at 53.95. The total MPI score for the 42nd rank was at 38.16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangaluru-ranked-20th-in-ease-of-living-index-for-2020/article33993834.ece
05 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||AB-ArK: Meeting of representatives of empanelled hospitals on March 8||Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra on Thursday said a meeting of representatives from private hospitals empanelled under Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka (AB-ArK) scheme will be held on March 8 to address grievances of the scheme beneficiaries. He was speaking at a programme to distribute Ayushman Bharat cards to journalists at the Mangaluru Press Club organised by the Dakshina Kannada District Working Journalists’ Association here. Dr. Rajendra said he has already asked hospitals to conduct minimum investigation on patients before they were admitted so as to reduce their financial burden. AB-ArK becomes applicable only after the patient was admitted to a hospital. The DC said over 23,000 patients, including 4,275 COVID-19 positive ones, have availed the benefits of AB-ArK in the district since its launch in 2018. AB-ArK district nodal officer Rathnakar said a referral letter from the district government hospital was a must for a BPL cardholder or other beneficiary of AB-ArK scheme to get treatment in empanelled private hospitals. But, patients in need of emergency medical care, including accident victims, may directly get admitted to the nearest empanelled private hospital without the referral letter and avail benefits of AB-ArK. Dr. Rathnakar said a patient in BPL category could get treatment up to Rs. 5 lakh while non-BPL could get 30% discount up to treatment cost of Rs. 5 lakh under AB-ArK. The scheme was applicable for treatment only in general wards. AB-ArK cell at the district level accords approval within 30 minutes of being informed about the admission, Dr. Rathnakar said. Patients/ relatives may call Dr. Rathnakar (9880157604), Dr. Jagannath Shirlal (9480161055) or Dr. Naushad (8197350823) to get approval.  Dr. Rathnakar said BPL beneficiaries of AB-ArK could get cataract surgery done completely for free in six of the private hospitals in the district. On the occasion, Dr. Rajendra distributed AB-ArK cards to a few journalists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ab-ark-meeting-of-representatives-of-empanelled-hospitals-on-march-8/article33993829.ece

The drive will also be for identification of sites for construction of houses for the houseless, according to the Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra. During the quarterly Karnataka Development Programme Review Committee meeting, chaired by District In-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary here recently, Dr. Rajendra asked an official from the Survey Department to depute a surveyor each from the office of tahsildars of seven taluks for surveying of government land for setting up solid waste management units and for building houses. “The survey work should be completed in another 15 days,” he said.  Dr. Rajendra said from next month, a monthly programme similar to “Grama Vastavya”, will be conducted in the district for clearance of encroached land. Five villages will be pooled together each month for taking up this drive. They will also identify vacant land for allocating sites to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes families and anganwadis. Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Kumar said during a recent meeting Principal Secretary to Rural Development and Panchayat Raj L.K.

05 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Bird census: 204 species sighted||In all, 204 bird species were recorded in Mysuru-Mandya-Chamarajanagar belt during a single-day winter bird monitoring programme for 2020-21 held in January this year. The birders collected data from 133 locations in the three districts, and the 204 bird species included 55 non-resident birds keeping their annual tryst with the region. This is reckoned to be the longest-running voluntary initiative in bird census in the State, if not in the country, and has been in vogue since the 1990s. A. Shivaprakash, who is associated with the bird census since its inception in 1987, said 32,304 birds were counted during this year’s exercise. The volunteers used to conduct the bird count exercise spread over weeks till recent years, but this was abandoned in favour of a single-day simultaneous count to provide a more robust data devoid of count duplication. Mr. Shivaprakash said the maximum individual species seen at any one location was the bar-headed goose (1,100), followed by rosy starling (1,000), glossy ibis (500), spot-billed pelican (468), and openbill stork, with the last two being breeding population at Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary. The maximum number of birds recorded was at Karigala (1,861) on H.D. Kote Road, followed by Kabini (1,478), Irasavadi (958) near Yellandur, Gumballi (914), and Markalu (839). In all, 70 birders took part, covering different routes simultaneously while three routes were covered later after the single-day bird count. Interesting sightings included the ashy woodswallow, Malabar lark, Eurasian wryneck, puff-throated babbler, rock eagle-owl, yellow-throated bulbul, and yellow-throated sparrow. But a comparison with the earlier mid-winter fowl exercise indicates that the winter migratory ducks observed in the entire survey over the years was at an all-time low. While 869 garganey, 635 northern pintail, and 236 northern shoveler were sighted, there was an increase in the population of the Eurasian wigeon (633). The decline in the counts of garganey, northern pintail, and northern shoveler was also attributed to the general decline in their population. Also, habitats in the northern States could support the existing population and hence the birds need not have had to fly all the way down south, Mr. Shivaprakash said.  While the bar-headed goose tends to arrive late — its migration commences from the Mongolian regions and it flies across the Himalayas to its roosting place in the Mysuru region — it is also the first to depart. The reverse migration of birds is expected to peak at the end of March.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bird-census-204-species-sighted/article33993342.ece
05 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||First dose coverage yet to be completed||Even as Mysuru stands second in the State in terms of vaccination coverage among senior citizens after Bengaluru, the first dose of vaccination for the healthcare workers is still not over yet though the drive took off nearly two months ago. The coverage is inching closer to 100 per cent as 93.8 percent target had been achieved as on Wednesday with 25,362 healthcare workers (HCWs) out of 27,032 having taken the first dose of the jab. Sources in the Health Department said the first dose would be completed in the next few days, achieving cent per cent target. The vaccination for HCWs was launched on January 16. Contrary to what the health authorities had claimed after the roll-out, the first dose has taken some time to get over in view of some apprehensions which, the sources claim, had been addressed successfully, encouraging the unvaccinated HCWs to turn up at the vaccination centres in their respective areas. The second dose of vaccination for the HCWs has achieved 53.6 per cent target. Out of 25,362 beneficiaries, 13,605 had been vaccinated until Wednesday. Despite the heads of the various departments taking the lead in encouraging their staff to take the jab by vaccinating themselves, the coverage for the frontline workers (FLWs) has just crossed the 50 per cent target. The lowest coverage has been in the Revenue Department where only 826 out of 2,225 registered came forward and took the first dose as on Wednesday. Only 3 beneficiaries from the department turned up to take the vaccine on Wednesday. Mysuru Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, after taking the first dose of jab, had called upon her department staff not to hesitate to take the shot, saying that the vaccine was absolutely safe. Despite her call, only 37.1 per cent of the target in the department had been achieved until Wednesday. The highest vaccination coverage among the frontline workers had been achieved in MOHA (Police Department), which registered 61.2 per cent target - 4,885 out of 7,978 registered beneficiaries had been inoculated as on Wednesday. Only four registered beneficiaries from the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj turned up. A total of 8,842 frontline workers have taken the vaccine out of 17,470, registering 50.6 per cent target, until Wednesday. The response from individuals aged above 60 years is overwhelming in Mysuru district. On Wednesday, 963 turned up across the district for the jab. Nearly 113 individuals aged between 45 and 59 with co-morbidities had been vaccinated as on Wednesday. As per the State vaccination coverage data, 1,989 people above 60 years of age had received the first dose in Mysuru district. This is the second highest after Bengaluru where 6,778 got it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/first-dose-coverage-yet-to-be-completed/article33993859.ece
05 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Miscreants behind forest fires?||The Forest Department suspects the handiwork of a few miscreants in the outbreak of a fire in the Antharsanthe range of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve and in the Mysuru territorial forests. The fire at Antharsanthe was first noticed around 3 p.m. on Wednesday and the department staff were at the site throughout the night and also on Thursday to douse any embers that could stoke another fire. The authorities are on a state of high alert following the outbreak and Mahesh Kumar, director of the tiger reserve, said it was the handiwork of miscreants. The Forest Department personnel from the region and the adjoining ranges and volunteers besides staff of the nearby resorts worked together to douse the fire and bring it under control.. He said it took a coordinated effort and nearly 2 hours to bring the flames under control. “It was basically a ground fire and we suspect that about 20 hectares of vegetation was burnt in the process.’’ This was the first fire of some significance during the current dry season and the authorities are bracing for a long haul ahead as the threat and scourge of the forest fire looms large till the onset of the pre-monsoon showers sometime during mid May. Precautions With the day-time temperatures soaring, the Forest Department is bracing to cope with any fire outbreak and has taken the necessary precautionary measures including deployment of additional staff. But given the dry deciduous nature of the forests in Nagarahole, Bandipur, BRT Tiger Reserve and MM Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, such preparations only help in reducing the damage and cannot avert a fire altogether. In the adjoining Mysuru territorial division, there was fire in territorial forests at Konanur that devastated vast tract of vegetation before it could be brought under control. This too has been attributed to the machinations of miscreants and the authorities believe it was deliberate rather than accidental. This is because the forest staff discovered that the moment they were able to bring fire under control in one part of the forest, there would be fresh outbreaks elsewhere and this was the third fire reported from the same forests during the current season which reinforces the suspicion that it was deliberately stoked, say the officials. Though forest fires are a regular feature there are concerns that repeated fires could degrade the habitat in the long run as the top soil would be destroyed. At the sam time, repeated fire would impede the growth and nurturing of fresh vegetation making the landscape barren or overrun by weeds that would be unedible for the herbivores which constitute the prey for carnivores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/miscreants-behind-forest-fires/article33993856.ece
05 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Name airport after Jayachamaraja Wadiyar’||Pramoda Devi Wadiyar of the erstwhile Mysore royal family has expressed happiness over the State government’s move to put up the portraits of the late Maharajas Chamaraja Wadiyar and Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar at the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru. Welcoming the step, she said the government has recognised the fact that the idea of establishing the representative assembly was that of Chamaraja Wadiyar which was developed and nurtured to function on democratic principles by Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar. While appreciating the gesture of Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar, who first wrote to Speaker Vishveshwara Hegde Kageri for installing the portraits, Ms. Wadiyar had urged the Minister to also consider installing the portrait of Jayachamaraja Wadiyar at the Vidhana Soudha besides naming the Mysuru airport after him. Ms. Wadiyar had made this appeal in a letter to Mr. Somashekar on February 23. The copies of the letter were shared with the media here on Wednesday. Following the appeal, the Minister has separately appealed to the Speaker to install the portrait of Jayachamaraja Wadiyar and to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to name the airport after the last Maharaja of Mysore. In the letters, the Minister cited the immense contributions of the Maharajas and also the appeal from Ms. Wadiyar. In the letter, Ms. Wadiyar recalled the involvement of the late Maharaja in nurturing the idea of his forefathers on the democratic institution in the form of representative assembly. Ms. Wadiyar had cited the quote of the late Maharaja after inaugurating the joint session of the two houses of the legislature at Jaganmohan Palace in Mysuru on June 9,1941. In accordance with Article 366 (15) of the Constitution of India, the Maharaja became the ‘Rajapramukh’ for the State of Mysore from January 26, 1950, she said. When Justice Fazal Ali Commission, constituted to study the reorganisation of State on linguistic basis, toured Mysore and interviewed the ‘Rajapramukh’, he readily agreed for the merger of the Kannada-speaking areas and sacrifice the Constitution-guaranteed post of ‘Rajapramukh’, she recalled, while narrating the Maharajas’ contributions. Remembering the day when the then Chief Minister K. Hanumanthaiah hosted a birthday celebration in Mysore on the eve of the merger of Kannada-speaking areas, Ms. Wadiyar said Mr. Hanumanthaiah had praised the Maharaja and also shared the excerpt of what the then Chief Minister told about the Maharaja. She said Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, soon after becoming the Maharaja, had accorded permission to form a joint stock company to start Hindustan Aircraft company in Bangalore to support the World War efforts. In addition, the Maharaja and his government contributed Rs. 50 lakh to the war fund. A vessel of the Royal Indian Navy and a squadron of aircraft went as a gift from Mysore to the war, Ms. Wadiyar recalled in her letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/name-airport-after-jayachamaraja-wadiyar/article33993860.ece

Though fire and emergency officials termed it minor and claimed to have contained it, the fire continued to rage till Thursday night. On Thursday, a crane was used to cut off the fire from the rest of the area. According to officials, the fire was triggered by heat on chemical waste dumped in the area. A labourers’ colony is situated close to the lake bed. Many of them work as ragpickers and dump waste on the lake bed, including used plastic and insulated wires. “The ragpickers will burn the wire sometimes to recover copper. Luckily, no one was injured in the mishap,” an official said. Seema Sharma, a resident whose apartment is located opposite the lake, said that there were smoke rings across their flat. “It is lot of inconvenience for residents who have to inhale the smoke. The fire started on Wednesday and it spread before the fire trucks came in. It was hard to contain. The lake marshals do their duty sincerely, but they do not have any equipment to douse a fire,” she said. Fire in Vrushabhavathy In another part of the city, another water body was in the news for a similar reason. A fire was reported in the highly polluted Vrushabhavathy river near Kumbalagodu on Thursday. Residents alleged that several industries and car wash units let chemicals directly into the river, which may have led to the fire. They said thick smoke engulfed the river and adjacent area. After years of neglect, a committee was constituted by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to draw up an action plan for the Vrushabhavathy Valley (V-Valley) last year. Vrushabhavathy Valley is one of the three major valleys in Bengaluru. The river flows south, joining the Arkavathi, a tributary of river Cauvery. The catchment of V-Valley is said to be about 170 sq.km., covering about 90 wards in BBMP. About 480 MLD of domestic sewage is dumped in V-Valley.

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||BBMP, SWM experts differ on usefulness of SPV||The State Cabinet’s decision to establish a separate entity – Bengaluru Solid Waste Management (SWM) Company – to manage the city’s growing garbage has received a mixed response. While BBMP officials point out that the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) will be a focussed agency to manage SWM, which will help with quick decisions and implementation, SWM experts disagree. Pointing out to the organisational structure of the SPV, they said it is highly bureaucratised, and not very different from the BBMP. BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said while sweeping the streets and pourakarmikas will continue to be the responsibility of the civic body, the door-to-door collection, secondary collection and transportation to waste processing plants and management of the plants will be the responsibility of the SPV. While the BBMP’s share will be 51%, the government’s share will be 49%. The company will be headed by the Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Development Department. “The other details will be worked out and formalised soon,” he said. H.C. Sharatchandra, member of the High Court-appointed Technical Guidance Committee, said, “The government has finally realised that BBMP cannot handle the city’s SWM.” However, he said for the SPV to be successful, all the activities related to SWM, including door-to-door collection and transportation, should come under the ambit of the company. BBMP officials, on condition of anonymity, said the plan to constitute a separate body for SWM was mooted in 2016. “There is a lot of interference in decisions related to SWM, be it from politicians or the contractor lobby. The SPV will be a focussed agency, which will help bring in much-needed technological interventions,” the official said. Former Opposition Leader Abdul Wajid disagreed. He maintained that constitution of the SPV would not solve the problem. Fearing lack of accountability in the SPV, he said the government could have strengthened the BBMP with stricter monitoring of the functioning of waste processing plants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-swm-experts-differ-on-usefulness-of-spv/article33993672.ece

The attachment procedure was carried out under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, an official release said. The attached properties belong to Abhishek Tripathi and members of his family, and are situated in Uttar Pradesh. Investigation revealed that Abhishek Tripathi allegedly misused his official position from 2008 to 2016 to enter into a number of suspicious transactions. He allegedly acquired huge movable and immovable properties in his name and in the names of members of his family, which are disproportionate to his known sources of income, the release added. Betting racket In a separate incident, the CCB, on Thursday, busted a horse race betting racket and arrested three persons who were allegedly running the show from a house in Chandra Layout. The accused were running the racket online and had formed a WhatsApp group to communicate with punters. The accused were also using online payment apps to receive bets, the police said. Based on a tip-off, a team of officials raided the house and arrested Varun, 27, Nandish, 37, and Jeevan, 27. The police recovered Rs. 1.9 lakh and three mobiles from them.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said heads of 300 healthcare facilities will be given training on the new features of the CoWIN 2.0 portal. More session sites were likely to be opened across the city by Monday. He said that private hospitals have been roped in for the vaccination programme after a discussion with the heads of those institutions. Stating that while vaccines have been administered in the BBMP’s 141 PHCs, 28 maternity and six referral hospitals since the beginning, the private hospitals where session sites have opened will get Rs. 100 as service charge for every vaccine administered. Mr. Prasad said several private hospitals had sought permission to open a vaccine session site. “However, as per the Centre’s guidelines, session sites can be opened in private hospitals that are empanelled in either State or Central insurance programmes. Private hospitals that want to have session sites may empanel themselves in either of the insurance programmes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/training-on-cowin-20-for-medical-staff/article33993677.ece

05 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Twists and turns of Alappuzha’s poll graph||When the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) returned to power in 2016, it was almost a clean sweep in Alappuzha district. It had won eight out of nine constituencies. Back then, the Haripad Assembly constituency offered the lone solace for the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), where Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala won by a comfortable margin. Between 2016 and 2021, the political landscape of Alappuzha has witnessed many twists and turns. While the LDF retained the Chengannur seat in a byelection held in May 2018, the UDF wrested Aroor from the LDF in a bypoll held in October 2019. When the UDF wave swept the State in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Alappuzha Lok Sabha constituency stood with the LDF. However, the UDF took lead in seven of the nine Assembly segments in the district. In the recent local body polls, the LDF won big. But, the Assembly polls is a new ball game. The LDF, which is banking on the good works of the State government, is hoping to repeat the performance of 2016. The CPI(M) is set to contest from Aroor, Alappuzha, Ambalappuzha, Kayamkulam, Mavelikara (SC reserved) and Chengannur and the CPI from Cherthala and Haripad. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is likely to field Thomas K. Thomas, brother of former minister Thomas Chandy, from Kuttanad. Uncertainties Of the sitting LDF MLAs, Food and Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman of the CPI may not contest the polls after winning three times from Cherthala. Although the CPI(M) has decided not to field those who had contested consecutively and won twice, the party district secretariat has sought relaxation in the norms to field Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac and Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran, both sitting MLAs from Alappuzha and Ambalappuzha respectively. It is learnt that the CPI(M) State secretariat, which met on Thursday, was not in favour of fielding them. A final decision on the matter will be taken by the party State committee. The party has not taken a final call on fielding sitting MLAs U. Prathibha from Kayamkulam and R. Rajesh from Mavelikara. It is almost certain that the CPI(M) will field Saji Cherian, MLA, again from Chengannur. The CPI has prepared a list with multiple names for Cherthala and Haripad. In the UDF, the only certainty is the sitting MLAs Ramesh Chennithala and Shanimol Usman of the Congress from Haripad and Aroor respectively. Of the nine seats, the Congress is likely to contest from eight. The Kuttanad seat may be given to the Kerala Congress (M) led by P.J. Joseph. In the NDA, the BJP is likely to field candidates from Alappuzha, Ambalappuzha, Haripad, Chengannur and Mavelikara, while the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) will contest from Kayamkulam, Kuttanad, Cherthala and Aroor. With the emergence of the BJP, the district is set to witness triangular contest in a number of seats, especially in Chengannur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/twists-and-turns-of-alappuzhas-poll-graph/article33993409.ece
05 March 2021||Alappuzha,KERALA||Alappuzha pipeline repair work in progress||Repair work on the damaged pipeline at Thakazhy is in progress and water supply to the Alappuzha municipal area and eight nearby grama panchayats is likely to be restored by Saturday. Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) officials said that two leaks were detected on the pipeline. “We hope to restart pumping by Saturday evening after completing the repair work,” said an official. The latest burst occurred near the Kelamangalam bridge on Tuesday night. This is the second burst on the pipeline in less than a week. Following disruption in water supply, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) had pressed five tankers into service to provide potable water to households. Central assistance The Alappuzha drinking water project was executed by the KWA with assistance from the Centre under the UIDSSMT in 2017. However, since its launch, pipelines under the project have burst more than 50 times, majority of them at Thakazhy and Kelamangalam, in the past three-and-a-half years, disrupting water supply to residents in Alappuzha municipality and nearby grama panchayats and damaging the Ambalappuzha-Thiruvalla road. Lasting solution District Collector A. Alexander, who chaired a meeting on Wednesday, directed the authorities concerned to find a lasting solution to the problem. A high-level meeting convened by Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty in November 2019 had decided to replace the defective pipeline in three months, however the project remains in limbo. Although the KWA prepared a tentative schedule for starting the pipe-relaying work in March last year, the work failed to take off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the plan, 1,524 m of the defective pipeline will have to be replaced. This includes 1,084 m of faulty pipeline at Thakazhy and another 440 m at Kelamangalam. Officials said that they were awaiting permission from the Kerala Road Fund Board to commence work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/alappuzha-pipeline-repair-work-in-progress/article33993419.ece

Mr. Surendran was responding to the Chief Minister seeking the intervention of the Election Commission of India into the Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe against the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) and the government's decision not to allow KIIFB officials to appear before the ED for interrogation. ‘Probe not tied to polls’ "The Chief Minister is fearful of being caught for corruption. The ED investigation against the KIIFB has nothing to do with the Assembly elections," Mr. Surendran told reporters in Chengannur. On DMRC Principal Advisor E.

From Tuesday, graffiti and hoardings featuring Mr. Joseph began to appear at various locations. However, the election symbol was conspicuous by its absence in the campaign materials. The Joseph faction’s district president M.J. Jacob said campaigning had been officially launched in the Thodupuzha constituency and mandalam committees had been formed in the Idukki constituency. In Thodupuzha, he said, Mr. Joseph was sure to represent the UDF. Mr. Joseph is under COVID-19 treatment in Thiruvananthapuram, and hence the party workers had launched the poll campaign, he said. “In the last Assembly election Mr. Joseph won with a record margin of 45,587 votes. We hope the trend will continue. The seat-sharing talks will be concluded in a day or two,” he said. In the last local body elections, the Jose K. Mani faction of the KC(M), which is with the Left Democratic Front, won 70 seats in the district and the Joseph faction got 107 seats. Same seat likely Roshy Augustine of the undivided KC(M), which was in the UDF, won from the Idukki constituency in the last Assembly election. Now, he is likely to contest in the same seat in the LDF banner. In the Udumbanchola constituency, now represented in the Assembly by Electricity Minister M.M. Mani, campaign graffiti of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have appeared on public places. However, there is no mention of the candidate. The plantation constituencies of Devikulam and Peerumade were with the LDF in the last Assembly elections with S. Rajendran of CPI (M) winning the former and E.S. Bijimol of the CPI, the latter. Ms. Bijimol is unlikely to contest this year as the CPI has insisted on a two-term policy for candidature and she has won thrice from here. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is yet to announce its candidates in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/joseph-faction-makes-an-early-start-in-thodupuzha/article33993417.ece

Lauding ULCCS (for dismantling the pier caps, girders, and deck, rebuilding them and simultaneously strengthening the pillars) for completing the work in record time, Mr. Sreedharan said it was for the first time that he had seen “this efficient a contracting firm.” DMRC gave word to the government to complete the work in nine months, while it set an eight-month deadline for ULCCS. The firm further brought down the time (to rebuild the flyover, which developed cracks within two years of its commissioning in 2016) to five months and 10 days. “We accorded the pride of place to quality, speed, and the structure’s finish. Kochi-based Sreegiri Consultants provided all technical help in remedying the structure’s design flaws. DMRC’s chief engineer G.

Justice Devan Ramachandran passed the directive on Thursday on a writ petition seeking to remove unauthorised boards and hoardings put up in public places. The court made it clear that the EC should ensure that the court's earlier directives against erecting boards, hoardings and banners in public places were scrupulously complied with even while the election process was on. The EC had the competence and was at full liberty to put in place necessary mechanisms to obtain full compliance with the directives. The EC would ensure that no unauthorised boards/ banners/ flags/ hoardings, whatever be its nature, colour or character be allowed to be put up by any political party in public places. Obstructions The directives were passed in view of the submission by the amicus curiae that when the officers entrusted with election duties tried to implement the directives, they were being obstructed by political parties. The court observed that unless the authorities took stringent action, the malice of unauthorised boards/banners/flags could never be rooted out from our streets. In spite of more than 25 High Court orders, vested interests continued to do what was prohibited. The declaration of elections would, in all probability, only make it much worse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stop-unauthorised-hoardings-hc/article33993410.ece

The undertaking was given by senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy when a petition filed by the mother of the two girls seeking a court-monitored investigation and a CBI probe into the death of her younger daughter came up for hearing before Justice V.G. Arun. Centre’s counsel submitted that the State government had forwarded only the notification giving its consent for probing the case. It had not furnished the details of the cases, including the copy of the First Information Report, the outcome of the police investigation, and the reasons for referring the case to the CBI. The State has to provide such details for the Centre to decide on the State’s request. The girls’ mother said the government had consented to a CBI probe only into the death of her elder daughter. Hence, the CBI could not investigate the death of the younger daughter. The 13-year-old elder daughter was found hanging at her home on January 13, 2017 and her nine-year-old sister was found dead in the same manner 52 days later. Later, the special court for POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ) cases had acquitted the accused on the ground that the prosecution had failed miserably to prove the cases. On March 19 However, the High Court set aside the acquittal and ordered a fresh trial. The prosecution later filed a petition with the special court seeking a fresh probe. In the meantime, the government decided to entrust the CBI with the probe. The court posted the case on March 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-to-provide-details-of-walayar-case-to-centre-cbi/article33993429.ece
05 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Shifting loyalties, with a tilt towards Cong.||The Angamaly Assembly segment has shown no permanent leniency to any particular political front even though the United Democratic Front (UDF) enjoyed an edge over the Left Democratic Front (LDF) for the last five-and-a-half decades. The constituency had earned a name for giving candidates of both the fronts multiple chances to represent it in the Legislative Assembly. It was A.P. Kurien of the CPI(M) who kick-started the trend after he remained unbeaten for four consecutive terms since 1967. M.V. Mani of the Kerala Congress bucked the winning streak by defeating Mr. Kurien in 1982. He served two terms before tasting defeat in 1991. P.J. Joy of the Congress had won the seat by 7,598 votes after Mr. Mani left the Kerala Congress (Mani) group to join hands with P.J. Joseph, who was then an LDF ally. Mr. Joy’s attempt to secure the fourth consecutive win was snapped by Jose Thettayil of the Janata Dal (S) in 2006. Mr. Thettayil served two consecutive terms before losing out a chance to contest again in 2016 after getting involved in an alleged sexual harassment case. Roji M. John of the Congress defeated Benny Moonjely of the Janat Dal (S) by 9,184 votes in 2016 to regain control over the constituency. The Kerala Congress (Joseph) and the Janata Dal (S) had fielded its candidates under the LDF since 1991. The Congress, which had given the segment to its ally Kerala Congress (Jacob) in 2011, took it back in 2016 and decided to field Mr. Roji John, who was then the national president of the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI). The political positions adopted by the Syrian Christians and the rebel menace figure among the wide range of factors that might influence the electoral fortunes of both the key fronts this time. The UDF camp appeared buoyant after the win in the civic body elections in which it wrested back power in the Angamaly Municipality and Parakkadavu, Kalady, Malayatoor and Thuravoor panchayats. Benny Behanan of the Congress, who won the Chalakudy Lok Sabha seat in 2019, had also earned a lead of 27,800 in Angamaly. However, the Congress remains cautious amid reports that Mr. Jose Thettayil will be back as the LDF candidate this time recalling the developmental works he had initiated between 2006 and 2016. Mr. Roji John is likely to be the Congress candidate for the second time. The BJP, which failed to make any impact in the previous elections, has plans to expand its presence after it opened its account in the municipality by winning two wards in the recent local body polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shifting-loyalties-with-a-tilt-towards-cong/article33993806.ece

The victim, a first year B.Tech student at a private engineering college at Aarakkunnam, was on her way to the college to take exam when tragedy struck. The Mulanthuruthy police said the girl was overtaking a vehicle when her scooter collided with a private bus on the opposite track and got thrown under it. Though she was rushed to a nearby hospital, she succumbed to injuries on the way. ‘Kingpin’ arrested The Aluva East police arrested the alleged kingpin of a racket engaged in pledging vehicles taken on rent. Nithin, 32, of Kayamkulam stands accused of renting a car belonging to a resident of Nayathodu on June 16, 2019, and then pawning it in Coimbatore.

05 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Church mouthpiece attacks BJP||Sathya Deepam , the mouthpiece of the Syro-Malabar Archdiocese, has come out with a scathing attack on the BJP, questioning whether the party leadership was leading a “yathra” ahead of the elections to celebrate the unprecedented rise in fuel prices. “Is the yathra a celebration by the BJP State president to mark the fuel price crossing Rs. 100?” asked the editorial. The price of cooking gas had gone up by Rs. 225 over three months. There was also a move to cut the number of people getting subsidised rations. This was “another reason for celebrations”, the editorial said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/church-mouthpiece-attacks-bjp/article33993802.ece
05 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Cosying up to religious heads||As the pre-election scene hots up in the State, leading political parties are now cosying up to religious and caste organisations in Central Travancore region. When the BJP’s Vijay Yatra reached Chengannur in Alappuzha on Thursday, State president K. Surendran reached out to the family of the Sabarimala Tantri, which holds a special place among the Hindu upper castes in Central Kerala. Mr. Surendran held discussions with Kandararu Rajeevararu, the reigning Tantri (chief priest), and congratulated him for taking an upright stance during the Sabarimala protests. “The Tantri was one of the important personalities whom I wanted to meet during the rally,” Mr. Surendran later told mediapersons. The Tantri, on the other hand, held that he would welcome help from any political organisations as far as the Sabarimala issue was concerned. RSS initiative The meeting, which closely followed an initiative by the Rashtriya Swayasevak Sangh to bridge relationships with the Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara Church on Wednesday, assumes significance as the Sabarimala women entry issue forms the core of the BJP’s poll plank in the region. It also came amidst intense speculation that Mr. Surendran, who led a series of protests in connection with the issue, would contest from the Konni Assembly constituency, which comprises the Sabarimala zone. Cong. efforts The Congress too has launched active efforts to woo back its eroding vote bank in the region. As part of the campaign, senior leaders Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala on Thursday visited Theodosius Mar Thoma Metropolitan of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church. The meeting, which began around 11.30 a.m, lasted about half an hour. Emerging out of the meeting, Mr. Chandy described it as a friendly call while the Metropolitan responded that the Church’s demands were conveyed to the two leaders. The Thiruvalla-based church commands a significant presence in Pathanamthitta district and its adjoining regions. Earlier in January, Mr. Chandy and Chennithala had met the Orthodox Church head in Kottayam while the All India Congress Committee general secretary Tariq Anwar and AICC secretary Evan D’Souza visited Cardinal Mar Cleemis, Archbishop of the Syro-Malankara Church. Besides the Church denominations, the two parties have also attempted reaching out to the Nair Service Society, a prominent community organisation with its headquarters in Changanassery, ahead of the elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cosying-up-to-religious-heads/article33993412.ece
05 March 2021||KOTTAYAM/ PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||CPI(M) probables for 3 Kottayam seats||Even as the Left Democratic Front is working on a seat-sharing deal ahead of the Assembly elections, a meeting of the CPI(M) district secretariat in Kottayam has proposed the party's candidates to three seats in the district. The list, sent for approval of the CPI(M) State leadership, has nominated Jaick C. Thomas, K. Anil Kumar and K. Suresh Kurup or V.N. Vasavan as the party candidates in Puthuppally, Kottayam and Ettumanur respectively. The decision was taken in the meeting held in the presence of State secretariat members P Rajeev, K J Thomas and Vaikom Viswan. Face-off with Chandy Jaick C. Thomas, a young leader who contested from the Puthuppally seat in the previous election, is likely to face Congress stalwart Oommen Chandy once again. In 2016, he had brought down Mr. Chandy’s majority to 27,092 votes from the margin of 33,255 votes in 2011. Mr. Anilkumar, who was the former president of Kottayam Cooperative Urban Bank, is familiar to the district through his works as the coordinator of Meenachil-Meenanthara-Kodoor river re-linking programme. Meanwhile, a final picture of Left Democratic Front candidates in the district is yet to become clear as disputes between the constituent parties over the Changanassery, Kanjirappally and Poonjar seats are yet to be settled. While the CPI has expressed willingness to hand over the Kanjirappally seat to the Kerala Congress (M), it has also demanded Changanassery seat instead. Besides the CPI, the KC(M) and the Democratic Kerala Congress too have staked claim for the seat. In Pathanamthitta, the CPI(M) district secretariat has nominated Veena George and K.U. Janeesh Kumar, MLAs, to their sitting seats of Aranmula and Konni respectively. The party, however, is yet to decide on its candidate in Ranni as the KC(M) too has staked claim for the seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-probables-for-3-kottayam-seats/article33993418.ece
05 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Poll officials asked to ensure COVID protocol in booths||The district-level training for returning officers, assistant returning officers, and other senior officials in charge of the election has begun in Kozhikode. The first round of the two-day training opened by District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao will draw to a close on Friday. Officials said that one of the major subjects explained during the first day’s session was the mandatory COVID-19 protocol to be followed during election in each booth. Apart from ensuring a smooth election, the officials will be responsible for overseeing proper compliance by voters with the COVID-19 protocol. From the beginning of the submission of nominations and their scrutiny, they will be accountable for making necessary arrangements in accordance with the safety guidelines. To avoid rush, they will be allowed to fix a time schedule for each candidate to submit nomination papers. The number of persons accompanying the candidate will be limited at the time of filing nomination papers. The procedure will be almost the same even during the scrutiny of documents. The returning officers and assistant returning officers were also briefed about the procedures to be followed in case of confirming COVID-19 for any candidate. On such occasions, they will be allowed to complete the election formalities through a proposer on behalf of the candidate. The master trainers who attended the district-level session will be leading the constituency-level training sessions for other poll officials. Special squads Besides familiarising themselves with the general instructions, the officials attended sessions on candidate setting in electronic voting machines, distribution of poll materials, polling booth management, polling process, counting of votes and related awareness programmes. There will be special squads to ensure the enforcement of the protocol considering public safety during electioneering and polling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poll-officials-asked-to-ensure-covid-protocol-in-booths/article33993368.ece
05 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||RMP expected to decide on Rema’s candidature today||In the wake of the new political developments, the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) has been forced to rethink its plan of fielding party State secretary N. Venu from the Vadakara segment in the Assembly polls. Sources said that K.K. Rema, wife of slain RMP leader T.P. Chandrasekharan, was likely to contest the seat with the support of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). The party district committee will deliberate over the issue at its meeting on Friday. “It is for the party to decide on my candidature,” said Ms. Rema. Sources said that senior leaders of the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) had approached the RMP leadership to put up a common candidate to fight the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF). LDF candidate Earlier, the CPI(M) had planned to field its candidate rather than offering the seat to either of its partners — Janata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)] and the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD). But now the LJD will contest from Vadakara after the seat-sharing agreement in the LDF. The Congress-IUML combine can breathe easy till the RMP takes a final call on its nominee in Vadakara. The parties are hoping to influence the voter base of the RMP in the neighbouring segments of Koyilandy, Kuttiyadi, Nadapuram, and Kunnamangalam. The UDF also wants to rake up political violence as a key issue and revive memories of the brutal killing of Chandrasekharan at Onchiyam on May 4, 2012. The Congress nominees were directly or indirectly beneficiaries of the RMP in the Lok Sabha polls in 2009, 2014, and 2019 in the Vadakara parliamentary constituency. The RMP had deftly transferred its votes to the successful Congress candidate, Mullappally Ramachandran, in 2009 and 2014. The party had also not fielded a candidate in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when Congress leader K. Muraleedharan was in direct fight with CPI(M) candidate P. Jayarajan in the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rmp-expected-to-decide-on-remas-candidature-today/article33993359.ece

Silambarasan, a native of Salem in Tamil Nadu, was arrested for his alleged involvement in handing over the explosive materials to the arrested woman. The police said the man was suspected of handing over such stocks earlier too for well-digging and quarry works. The stock was shipped by train many times, they said. It was last Friday that the Railway Protection Force came across the suspicious consignment in the Chennai-Mangalore Express train during a surprise inspection. Ramani, the arrested passenger, was found carrying 117 gelatine sticks and 350 detonators in packets hidden under her seat. The woman claimed she brought it for well works in Thalassery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/seizure-of-explosives-one-more-arrested/article33993362.ece

The vehicle owners alleged that it was purposefully done by anti-social elements. Though a Fire and Rescue Service team reached the spot by around 2.30 a.m, they could not save the vehicles. The Nadakkavu police have registered a case. The drivers said they could spot a few granite pieces inside the gutted vehicle which was a clear indication that someone had set ablaze the vehicles. The side glasses were first smashed using the stones to torch the vehicles, they claimed. Police sources said the drivers of the gutted vehicle had taken membership in a new association which might have led to the revengeful action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ambulance-car-destroyed-in-fire/article33993366.ece

Mr. Sudhakaran’s visit will be the latest in a series of attempts made by the party to placate Mr. Gopinath. Plans to quit KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran had reportedly spoken to Mr. Gopinath over phone and requested him not to take any hasty decision about leaving the party. Mr. Gopinath was upset with the party leadership and had sent feelers about leaving the party before the Assembly elections. Reason cited He said he was unhappy with the continuous neglect of the party leadership and the harassment of his supporters. Although DCC president V.K. Sreekandan, MP, had met Mr. Gopinath on Wednesday, the latter did not show any signs of reconciliation. Mr. Gopinath kept away from a meeting of senior Congress leaders convened here on Thursday under the leadership of Mr. Sreekandan.

05 March 2021||Palakkad,KERALA||Navarang brings Eachara Warrier back on stage||With a hard-hitting play, the Navarang Theatre group here has proved that perhaps artistes are in the forefront in telling post-COVID-19 society about the importance of maintaining vigil against excessive use of force by those in power. The play Kando Ningal, Ente Kuttiye? (Did You See My Son?), penned by Civic Chandran and directed by Kannan Palakkad for the Navarang Theatre, touched many a heart. The work was enacted last week so powerfully by Sethu Kandanakam and others that it transported the audience back to the dark days of the Emergency. The one-hour staging displayed the struggles of T.V. Eachara Warrier, the rights campaigner who famously fought for his son Rajan who was allegedly tortured and killed in police custody during the Emergency. The audience opined that Sethu nearly imbibed the spirit of Prof. Warrier and portrayed the pain of every father who goes in search of his offspring. Writer Raghunathan Parali said Sethu did justice to Eachara Warrier. “However, the play could have taken the theme further to the contemporary period to reflect how the State misuses its powers,” he said. Theatre artiste Asokam Rajeevam said the audience vicariously experienced the performance rather than merely watching it. “That’s the success of a play. Even the very title can stab you like a dagger,” he added. Theatre artiste S.V. Prem said Sethu breathed life into the real-life story of Prof. Warrier years after filmmaker Shaji N Karun’s 1989 award-winning movie Piravi that was based on him. “It was as if something struck me in the throat,” he said of the experience of watching the play.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/navarang-brings-eachara-warrier-back-on-stage/article33993445.ece

05 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Steps to ease vaccination||The Health Department has decided to step in and make special arrangements to ease the process of vaccinating senior citizens and those above 45 years with co-morbidities against COVID-19. A huge number of people with online scheduled vaccination appointments and those walking in for spot-registrations at vaccination sites have been posing serious logistics challenges for the Health Department for the past four days. Till March 3, a total of 30,061 senior citizens had received COVID-19 vaccination, an official release said here. The Health Department has asked the Centre to resolve the issues faced by people in getting online registration and appointments for vaccination on the CoWIN portal. The crowding witnessed at vaccination sites these past three days could in fact torpedo the careful COVID-19 containment activities taken up by the Health Department. There is no need to panic and show haste in securing vaccination appointments, because the State has plenty of vaccine stock at present. Moreover, the Centre has also informed that 21 lakh doses would be arriving on March 9, an official release said. More sites The Health Department will be increasing the number of vaccination sites in phases. The vaccination sessions in each site would be planned ahead. Sessions for 15 days would be created and uploaded on the CoWIN portal. All districts will fix the number of sites planned for each day and inform the State Health administration. The districts will ensure that the details of the sites and sessions every day are made available to the public through print and social media. Districts can modify the list depending on regional requirements. Token system The Health Department has directed the districts to ensure that those who come to a vaccination site with a scheduled vaccination appointment secured online are not sent back with a token. Instead, the token system could be made applicable for spot registrations.  The number of online appointments and spot registrations would be restricted to specific numbers every day, so as to reduce crowding. Till March 3, as many as 3,47,801 health-care workers had received at least one dose vaccine and of these, 1,31,143 had received both shots. So far, 91,916 front-line workers and 1,14,243 poll officials have received a dose of vaccine each.  There is no need to show haste in securing appointments as State has enough vaccine stock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-to-be-made-to-ease-vaccination/article33993422.ece
05 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Senior citizens put to hardships at vaccination sites||The COVID-19 vaccination of the elderly and those between 45 and 59 years with comorbidities is posing major human resource and logistic issues for the Health Department, while at the same time putting senior citizens to much hardships. Ever though the vaccination was formally opened for senior citizens and those with comorbidities on March 1, because of the glitches in the software and sluggish traffic in the CoWIN portal, senior citizens have been queuing up at public hospitals for spot or walk-in registrations since Day One. Unpleasant scenes With those who managed to get vaccination slots also turning up at hospitals and demanding vaccination, major vaccination sites such as General Hospitals here have been witnessing unprecedented crowding and incessant squabbles. Many senior citizens had to wait for long in queues along with those waiting for spot registration, only to be told that they will be issued tokens for vaccination on another day. “The main problem was that the CoWIN portal is issuing unlimited registrations per site per day, whereas we cannot handle more than a maximum of 200 vaccinations a day for the general public. We are also doing vaccinations for health-care workers, poll officials, and senior bureaucrats and Ministers. Though there are many peripheral institutions also where vaccination is available, the portal does not seem to be displaying those sites,” a senior health official at the GH said. Registration stopped “Since March 1, we have had a huge backlog of people who could not be vaccinated despite getting an online appointment and who had to be issued tokens. We have now decided to cancel the registration process till next Wednesday, so that we can streamline the pending bookings. Those who managed to schedule an appointment on Thursday will not get the vaccination before March 10,” he said. He said the hospital staff had been working overtime to ease the vaccination process but they were are up against a huge backlog of data entry work also, which often could not be completed before midnight.  The Health Department’s appeals to the people to wait patiently and that the vaccination process will be smooth once more vaccination sites, including private hospitals, can be opened up in the next one week seem to have fallen on deaf ears. “People seem to be in a tearing hurry to get themselves vaccinated and perhaps they fear that vaccine stocks may run out. But we have plenty of stock and more will be arriving soon,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/senior-citizens-put-to-hardships-at-vaccination-sites/article33993441.ece
05 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Something to cheer for all three fronts at Aruvikkara||In the Aruvikkara Assembly constituency, all the three fronts would be looking at the past election data for comfort, and even confidence, for there is something here for everyone to draw positives from. The United Democratic Front (UDF) has swept the Assembly elections in the past three decades here, while the recent local body elections witnessed the Left Democratic Front (LDF) winning in all panchayats except one. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has derived much confidence from the massive 17.59% increase in its vote share during the 2015 byelections, due to O. Rajagopal’s candidature, although some of it was lost in the subsequent elections. The Aruvikkara constituency in its current form came into existence following the delimitation of 2008, with much of it carved out from the previous Aryanad constituency and some parts from the Nedumangad constituency. The constituency currently includes the panchayats of Aruvikkara, Aryanad, Tholikkode, Vithura, Kuttichal, Poovachal, Vellanad, and Uzhamalakkal. First win for CPI In the first elections in the erstwhile Aryanad constituency in 1957, R. Balakrishna Pillai of the Communist Party of India (CPI) tasted victory. The Praja Socialist Party (PSP) and its splinter group Samyukta Socialist Party (SSP) won thrice in the next four elections, with Congress having one win in 1965. From 1977 until 1991, the constituency remained the fiefdom of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP). Karthikeyan’s victory The voting pattern witnessed a sharp turnaround in 1991, when Congress leader G. Karthikeyan defeated RSP’s sitting MLA K. Pankajakshan, who had behind him a hat-trick of wins. Karthikeyan would never lose from here again, winning four more times, including in 2011, when the new Aruvikkara constituency was formed. When he passed away in 2015, his son K.S. Sabarinadhan took up the mantle, winning the byelection by a margin of more than 10,000 votes and the Assembly elections next year by more than 20,000 votes. The constituency favoured the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections too, with Adoor Prakash, who won from Attingal, securing 58,952 votes from here, compared to CPI(M)’s A. Sampath’s 50,403 and BJP’s Shobha Surendran’s 30,151. However in the local body elections in December, the LDF swept seven of the eight panchayats in the constituency. Till 2011, when it secured just around 6% votes, the BJP was a fringe player here, but in the 2015 byelections, it increased its vote share to 24.2%, which fell to 14.12% in the 2016 Assembly elections. Its performance in the local body elections has also been below par. Many Adivasis With a considerable population of Adivasis in the higher ranges, the constituency also has a large percentage of working class population, dependent on agriculture, rubber tapping and small-scale trading. The bread and butter issues which have had an impact on this largely rural economy could have a say in these elections.

Covaxin has been found to be 81% efficacious in preventing severe COVID-19 disease and mortality. It is also found to neutralise B.1.1.7, the virus variant first reported in the U.K. Hence, people should now set aside all doubts and accept both Covishield and Covaxin vaccines, Mr. Vijayan said. Kerala’s cumulative case burden rose to 10,69,660, with 2,616 new cases when 63,041 samples were tested in the past 24 hours.

At present, drinking water can be booked through the Smart Trivandrum mobile app. The current rates will remain for distribution of water up to 30 km from the Kerala Water Authority’s vending points. More money will have to be paid if the distance is greater than 30 km. Tanker owners had earlier demanded that the charges levied should be proportionate to the distance as operating at the current rates was not feasible in the wake of frequent increase in fuel prices. The increased charges are now being implemented following a decision of the Corporation council. Extra amount Steps are under way to get the changes reflected in the mobile app. Till such time, consumers have to give any extra amount to the tanker owners directly.

Both parties had argued that the Congress would disintegrate if the Left Democratic Front came back to power. A United Democratic Front defeat would prompt Congress leaders to defect to the Hindu majoritarian BJP in droves. Hence, the UDF needed to sail to victory in the Assembly elections. Mr. Vijayan said the Indian Union Muslim League and the Jamaat-e-Islami had shown contempt to Muslim voters by insulting their intelligence. Congress leaders would switch sides to the BJP only if they win the elections. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had recently acknowledged the harsh truth. The Centre and BJP-ruled States have abandoned minorities. They felt safe only in Left-ruled Kerala. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala was working overtime to aid the communally divisive BJP to gain a toehold in Kerala. On KIIFB Mr. Chennithala has parroted the disinformation and lies Central agencies had leaned on to target the LDF government. He had conspired with the BJP to discredit KIIFB, Kerala's engine of growth. However, he had welcomed KIIFB projects to his constituency in Haripad with open arms. The Congress has threatened to disband the LIFE Mission, the government's flagship to provide free and modern housing for the poor. Mr. Chennithala has promised to dismantle Kerala Bank. He has now set out to be the executioner of KIIFB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-questions-iuml-jamaat-campaign-plank/article33993431.ece

Qualifications of medical practitioners who advertise that they can cure various illnesses, their registration and the hospitals they practise should be verified. Veracity of claims The veracity of the claims made should be ascertained by authorities, commission chairperson Antony Dominic said. He demanded that the State Police Chief (SPC) direct the officers concerned to take appropriate action on complaints of quackery and those pertaining to unqualified medical practitioners. Medical council stance The commission order said the medical council’s stance that they could act only against doctors registered with the council was not acceptable. It had the responsibility to ensure that unqualified practitioners and quacks did not treat the patients. The Drugs Controller, instead of acting only on complaints, should take strong legal action against quacks and set a model, it said. The commission directive comes on a complaint by Capsule Kerala convener M.P.

Jagan Mohan Reddy,” he said. “The YSRCP government has been providing welfare schemes to all the eligible people, irrespective of their caste, religion, or party affiliation. In contrast, the TDP, during its term, had failed to fulfil even a single promise it made in the run-up to the 2014 elections. It is trying to cheat people again with false promises,” he said. ‘False propaganda’ The TDP leaders were resorting to false propaganda that the government was increasing property taxes, he alleged. “The TDP has no candidates to contest as its cadre lost faith in party president N.

05 March 2021||P. Sujatha Varma,ANDHRA PRADESH||Keeping guru-shishya parampara alive||“For me, dance is a form of expression that instils self-confidence and self-belief. As I navigate through the sound of my anklet bells, something magical happens and I find an inner voice that is truly me,” says Kuchipudi dancer Sowmya Bhagavathula. Ms. Sowmya also trains children in this traditional dance form. “Whether I dance in a group or alone, there is a sense of exuberance and celebration,” she says, explaining why she could never think of any other career, as she is equipped with a degree in Business Management and a Masters in English. “I have been dancing since I was five. Kuchipudi is in my DNA,” she smiles, explaining how she grew up in this art form with ease and her whole life now revolves around this dance form. Born to Kuchipudi natyacharya Bhagavathula Venkatarama Sarma and Srivalli, who hail from the traditional Kuchipudi village in Krishna district, Ms. Sowmya took to stage performances quite early in life and won accolades from all quarters. Feathers in the cap Ms. Sowmya was recently presented with Kuchipudi Kala Shobasree award at a function in Hyderabad, adding another feather to her cap. Awards and titles galore for this Kuchipudi exponent, who has been trying to groom children of the current generation in this dance form, which has a rich history of evolution, transformation and preservation. “There is a void which needs to be filled up to appreciate, imbibe, practise and propagate the nuances of this art in totality,” she emphasises. She teaches Kuchipudi in Ghantasala Music College and also helps her father by chipping in during his absence in the many dance schools he trains children. New composition of ballets is one of the focus areas. She has donned different mythological roles on stage and has excelled in them. “The role of Krishna in the ballet Srimad Bhagavad Gita and Goddess Durga in Mahishasura Mardini are my favourites,” she informs, recalling that she had taken people by surprise when she played the role of Krishna for the first time on stage and people, who had a doubt if she could pull it off, came to her and appreciated her performance after the show. “We even bagged the first prize in the contest,” she recounts. Amidst a packed schedule of taking care of home, a 10-year-old son, dance classes and stage performances, Ms. Sowmya has also made brief appearances in a few Telugu films like Colour Photo , Balakrishna-starrer Kadhanayakudu and Om Namo Venkateshaya . “All of them are dance-related scenes,” she says. Beyond boundaries Technology enables Ms. Sowmya to reach out to children abroad, who learn Kuchipudi in virtual mode. Dance did not stop for her even during the lockdown when she used platforms like Zoom, Skype or even WhatsApp to continue teaching. “It worked really well because dance lifts the spirits and it helped people a great deal in keeping their sanity intact in this difficult phase,” she says, adding that she would do anything to keep this rich guru-shishya parampara alive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/keeping-guru-shishya-parampara-alive/article33993878.ece

05 March 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vice-President for imparting modern education in traditional format||Vice-President of India M. Venkaiah Naidu has envisaged a day when the modern education in engineering, medicine, law and technology is imparted in the traditional format, that too in the Indian languages. Addressing students and faculty members of the Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati (IITT) at Yerpedu near here, marking the premier institute’s sixth anniversary on Thursday, he spoke on the importance of teaching in mother tongue up to high school and reaching the fruits of governance through the people’s language. “Learning as many languages is welcome, but loving one’s mother tongue should precede others,” he observed. Dwelling on the traditional practices, he said the native diet and physical exercise helped overcome COVID-19 in the country. Claiming that 98% of farmers remained untouched by the virus, he attributed the same to their ability to toil, the fresh air they breathe and the ethnic food habits. Educational hub Dubbing Tirupati a ‘sacred city’, Mr. Naidu said the penance of education should start from this very spot to let it emerge an educational hub. “India has traditionally been a follower of ‘dharma’ and adherer to values since Vedic ages. The academic hubs of Nalanda and Takshasila went out of prominence under alien rule, but now the world is looking at us as a promising destination,” he said. He appealed to the youth to draw inspiration from Swami Vivekananda’s thoughts and former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s clarion call to ‘dream big’. Recalling his presence at the institute’s foundation laying ceremony on March 28, 2015 as the then Union Minister, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu thanked the Central and State governments for extending support for its growth.

Fresh notification  Further, the court directed the Registry to issue a fresh notification inviting applications for general recruitment to 68 posts of junior civil judge in the AP State Judicial Service, comprising 55 vacancies to be filled through direct recruitment and the remaining 13 to be filled under recruitment by transfer. It has been further adjudicated in a batch of writ petitions which challenged the above rule, that all the candidates who appeared for the screening test held on February 21, 2021 in pursuance of the notification dated December 3, 2020 were entitled to appear in the fresh recruitment process on the basis of their applications submitted earlier.

Bad loans in the banks have been increasing because of corporate defaulters. Instead of taking action on them, the government wanted to whitewash the Balance Sheets by shifting these bad loans from the books of the banks to a “bad bank.” This would benefit the defaulters, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bank-staff-to-go-on-strike-on-march-15-16/article33993890.ece

05 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Naidu should apologise to locals for shoddy NAD flyover’||Rajya Sabha MP and BJP leader G.V.L. Narasimha Rao on Thursday said that TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu should apologise to the people of the city for the poor execution of the NAD flyover, as the work on it was started during his tenure. Mr. Narasimha Rao inspected the flyover on Thursday and spoke to the traders, who have shops on the ground near the flyover, and with auto-rickshaw drivers atop the flyover and inquired about their problems. There was heavy traffic on the flyover though it was a quarter past 11. Mr. Narasimha Rao said that he was told that some fatal accidents had already occurred on the flyover even before it was fully operational. The lower rotary works were yet to be completed. “I have not seen a flyover anywhere else in the country, on which the rotary has to be manned by four traffic policemen to prevent accidents. A rotary is built to ensure smooth flow of traffic, without the need for a traffic policeman to control the traffic,” the BJP leader said. He opined that there seemed to be some problems with the construction of the flyover, which resulted in accidents. He wondered whether the YSR Congress government was overseeing the execution of the project at all. To a query, he said that he was unsure whether the flyover was being constructed with Central funds or by the State government with its own funds. Mr. Narasimha Rao said that the Centre had selected Visakhapatnam city as one among the first three cities in India for development under the Smart Cities project and had sanctioned crores of rupees for a total of 70 projects. “We will take the issue to the notice of the Centre and Union Minister of Urban Development if Central funds were used for the project. The BJP would make the NAD flyover an issue in the GVMC polls,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-should-apologise-to-locals-for-shoddy-nad-flyover/article33993970.ece
05 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Newly-merged panchayats list their priorities ahead of polls||Located on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam, towards Bheemili, are located the five panchayats of K. Nagarapalem, Chepaluppada, Kapuluppada, Nidigattu and JV Agraharam. Surrounded by a sea of prosperity on all sides, these panchayats — which constitute around 50 hamlets — have remained bereft of development as they lack even basic infrastructure such as proper roads, drainage, good schools and clean drinking water. The region, which was earlier a gram panchayat, was merged into the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) a year ago. In the recent ward re-organisation procedure, the GVMC has allotted these five panchayats under Ward IV. For the first time, the residents, who are going to cast their votes in the municipal polls, demand basic amenities first and foremost. Most of the main roads connecting the villages are in a bad condition, while interior roads are in an even worse shape. The locality does not have a proper drainage system due to which sanitation problems occur, resulting in health issues for the residents. Dustbins are few and far in between where residents can dump their household waste. Faulty street lights Some locals have complained that the street lights too do not function properly, especially in the stretch between K. Nagarapalem and Kapuluppada. “With many areas located in a hilly region, residents face drinking water issues. I have seen the development in GVMC areas. We want good schools in our region, The primary school in our area does not even have proper toilets. Some blocks are in a dilapidated condition,” said Ramesh Babu, a resident of K. Nagarapalem. Drinking water issue At Chepaluppada, Lakshmi, a resident, said that the drinking water they are supplied is yellow in colour on most days. “We were happy after being merged with GVMC. But we demand basic amenities like roads, proper drainage and drinking water. This is what we demanded from the politicians who visited us during their campaign,” she said. Facilities for fisherfolk Some of the fisherfolk who were found working at the beach said that the government should put in place facilities for the fishermen along the coastal stretch. “We do not have any store rooms near the beach or even some sheds. Some measures should be taken to prevent drowning deaths. Some locals have lost their children recently,” said Chinnayesu, a fisherman from Kotturu. A few residents from Somannapalem village pointed out that these panchayats do not have basic transportation facilities to reach the city. They said that the frequency of the city buses towards Bheemili should be increased. Most of the people in these villages are fishermen, farmers, labourers, toddy sellers and drivers. The locals say that there are many school dropouts from the locality, and unemployment is rampant. The locals sought the government to create some employment opportunities, especially in the tourism sector, for the local youth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/newly-merged-panchayats-list-their-priorities-ahead-of-polls/article33993976.ece
05 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan’s administration failed on all fronts, says Lokesh||The State government led by Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSR Congress has failed on all fronts, and the common man is reeling under heavy inflation, TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh alleged. Mr. Lokesh was on a whirlwind tour of Visakhapatnam city ahead of the GVMC polls, here on Thursday. At a meeting in Gajuwaka, the TDP leader said that the price of a domestic LPG cylinder will soon cross the Rs. 1,000 mark and the price of petrol will cross Rs. 100 per litre. “The State government has failed to check the price of essential commodities as well as the prices of sand, cement and steel,” he said. Critical of the door delivery of essential commodities, he said people instead of standing in a queue outside a ration shop are now standing at street corners to collect their ration from the vans. Paying a visit to the camp site where employees of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant are on a relay hunger strike protesting its proposed privatisation, he said that the YSRCP has 28 MPs in Parliament, but despite that they were not aware of the proposed privatisation plan and neither could they forcefully voice their opinion or lodge a protest against the privatisation. “The employees can bank on TDP for total support. Both the State and the Union governments should work out a strategy to make the plant profitable,” he said. “The MPs were also not able to get any outcome on the Special Category Status,” he said. At almost all the meetings, Mr. Lokesh spoke about the 10 points that are included in the TDP’s manifesto for the corporation and municipal polls. Speaking to auto-rickshaw drivers and construction workers at Saraswati Park, he said that on one hand Mr. Jagan was giving Rs. 10,000 to auto-rickshaw drivers under the YSR Vahana Mitra scheme, but on the other hand he was extracting over Rs. 30,000 per year in way of fines. Mr. Lokesh said he was informed by the auto-rickshaw drivers that the fines have risen by over 1000%, and that they were facing difficulties in paying them. “I have been informed that only 20% of the auto-rickshaw drivers are recipients of the scheme,” he said. Mr. Lokesh said that in the 10-point manifesto, the TDP would construct proper auto-rickshaw stands with clean drinking water and toilet facilities, if they won the GVMC polls. The construction workers informed him about the increase in sand, cement and steel prices and said that unemployment has increased in the sector as a result. Later, Mr. Lokesh interacted with students at a city hotel. He urged them to cast their franchise as it was their Constitutional right. He also advised them to be aware of civic issues and raise their voice wherever civic duties are not being done properly. A few students spoke about some civic issues in their residential areas and how they were facing problems for the last one or two years, as the fee reimbursement was not being cleared by the State government. A few students also brought to his notice some issues regarding scholarship payments. Mr. Lokesh also held a roadshow and public meeting at Bheemili and Anakapalle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagans-administration-failed-on-all-fronts-says-lokesh/article33993980.ece

05 March 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||Sita Rama Kalyanam to be a grand fete this year||Unlike last year, when the divine Sri Sita Rama Kalyanam was performed in a simple manner at the historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year the celestial wedding is all set to be conducted on a grand scale in the presence of devotees on April 21. The historic temple will host the ‘Vasantha Paksha Tiru Kalyana Brahmotsavams’ from April 13 to 27. Last year, the pandemic forced low-key celebration of the celestial wedding, devoid of devotees, at Nitya Kalyana Mandapam instead of Mithila stadium, the regular venue of the annual holy event. The temple revenues plummeted to an all-time low in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. This time, the authorities have begun preparations for the grand celebration of the annual religious event next month. However, the Endowments department is yet to take a final decision on the venue. Meanwhile, the temple authorities have announced that the online booking of sector-wise tickets for Sri Sitarama Tiru Kalyana Mahotsavam and Maha Pattabishekam, slated for April 21 and 22 respectively, will begin on March 5. Devotees can book the tickets online through the website www.bhadrachalamonline.com. According to temple sources, Sri Rama Navami Kalyana Ubhayam tickets (Rs. 5,000 per ticket) will also be available at the office of the temple Executive Officer in Bhadrachalam. For more details, devotees can call the temple office phone number 08743 232428 during office hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sita-rama-kalyanam-to-be-a-grand-fete-this-year/article33993931.ece

According to temple sources, a decision to this effect was taken in consultation with the Vedic pandits and the officials. It has been decided to construct a spacious goshala, ‘Sri Gokularamam’ in the sprawling temple lands in Purushotapatnam in Yetapaka mandal near the temple town in proximity to the Telangana-Andhra Pradesh border. Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy Devasthanam, Bhadrachalam, has sought voluntary donations from devotees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/spacious-goshala-to-be-built-at-purushotapatnam/article33993932.ece
05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||City fares poor in Ease of Living, Municipal Performance indices||City has fared poor in the rankings of Ease of Living Index and Municipal Performance given by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, as part of its Smart Cities project. Hyderabad has been ranked 24 from among a total of 49 cities with over a million population, with its cousin and competitor Bengaluru capturing first place in the Ease of Living Index. A total 111 cities have been ranked based on four parameters, termed as ‘pillars’, including Quality of Life, Economic Ability, Sustainability and Citizen Perception. Based on the scores, they were divided into three colour zones, Green, Orange and Red. Top 10 Begaluru has been given the top score of 66.7, with Pune finishing close with 66.27. Ahmedabad, Chennai, Surat, Navi Mumbai, Coimbatore, Vadodara, Indore and Greater Mumbai were the remaining cities finding place in the top 10 ranks. Several Tier-II cities including Solapur, Thane, Visakhapatnam, Pimpri Chinchwad, and Madurai fared better when compared with Hyderabad. The city could save its honour with the score of 55.4-- which is about two points over and above the average score of 53.51-- and a Green colour coding given to cities with a score of over 50. Scoring high at 70.7 on Citizens’ Perception, and decently at 58.69 on Sustainability, the city has been dragged down by its score of 30.05 in Economic Ability, just scraping through into Orange zone of moderate score in this aspect. To its defence, several other cities, except Bengaluru and Delhi have been Oranged zoned in this parameter. The city’s Quality of Life was given a rating of 51.28, which is not much to boast of either. Hyderabad has been ranked 11 in Economic Ability, 41 in Citizen Perception, 34 in Quality of Life and 17 in Sustainability. Ease of Life Index ranking was conceptualised in 2018 and developed with a framework in 2020. It assesses liveability of Indian cities with four pillars spanning across 13 categories and 49 indicators, as per information from the Smart Cities web portal. Safe and liveable housing, good quality water and sanitation and access to good education and health facilities define the Quality of Life parameter, while the city’s ability to foster economic growth, decent jobs, and investor friendly climate are the markers for Economic Ability. Sustainability is assessed by indicators such as climate change, greening and biodiversity, environmental management, reduction of energy consumption and disaster resilience. Survey feedback A total of 32 lakh citizens have been engaged in the survey for feedback. The overall ranking of the city is 17 in Municipal Performance, based on five parameters, Services, Finance, Technology, Planning, and Governance. With a score of 49.08, it missed the Green zone by a whisker and has been reduced to Orange zone, one rank below Patna.

05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Tempo of registrations continuing||The impressive increase in registration of non-agricultural and agricultural properties is continuing for the third consecutive month with the State registering close to Rs. 100 crore revenue from the Registration and Stamps department during the first three days of the current month. True to the expectations, the department collected registration and stamp duties in excess of Rs. 30 crore a day since the commencement of March. Registrations are expected to see a surge in the activity in the coming days as there will be spurt in registrations during March, marking the culmination of the financial year. The State registered total revenue in excess of Rs. 4,400 crore since the start of registration of agricultural properties through Dharani portal in mid-November and non-agricultural properties towards the end of December. The revenue in January, according to officials, crossed Rs. 950 crore in January while it was Rs. 765 crore in February. Revenue in December was Rs. 456 crore – Rs. 375.99 crore through sale deeds and registration of open plots and another Rs. 80.99 crore through other charges. “There is a tremendous improvement in the registrations since the process is allowed through normal mode. We are confident that it will reach its peak in the coming days,” a senior official of the department told The Hindu . The department is confident of achieving close to Rs. 6,000 crore revenue for the financial year if the current tempo sustains. This was much smaller than the anticipated Rs. 10,000 crore revenue for the current fiscal, but closer to the previous year’s achievement of little over Rs. 7,000 crore. Officials said there were several reasons that need to be factored in for the shortfall in the revenue realization including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the abrupt halt to the registration process due to passage of two important legislations for ensuring transparency in the revenue administration during the third quarter of the previous financial year. Officials asserted that the reforms in the revenue administration and introduction of online registration systems was received well by the people as could be seen from the traffic on the Dharani portal and the systematic manner in which transactions are taking place in the tahsildars and sub-registrar offices. “Dharani portal registered 2.13 crore hits after the initial glitches were rectified. As many as 3.07 lakh transactions relating to agricultural properties have been completed through the portal so far,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tempo-of-registrations-continuing/article33993784.ece
05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Genome sequencing integral: CCMB||CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) are among the 10 scientific institutions across the country, chosen by the Central government, for genome sequencing of COVID samples secured from passengers at airports of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Goa and Karnataka, to monitor new dangerous mutations coming to the country like the latest Brazilian strain. “We have managed the situation well so far and of the 6,000 samples genome sequenced, we have found more than 7,000 variants of the virus but none of them are cause for any alarm. However, it does not mean a more dangerous mutated virus strain cannot arise as the virus keeps mutating, so we have to be on constant lookout,” said CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra on Thursday. “We have made a start and hopefully, within the next few days, we will get work done more efficiently to ensure not a single variant escapes our notice even from remote corners of any panchayat. This is the only way of controlling any further spread of the new variants so that the particular area can be cordoned off with testing and tracing so keep it under control,” he explained. Since the number of reinfections have been minimal thus far, it is a clear indication of the body’s immune system. And, both the vaccines available in the country have shown to be protective towards the UK and South Africa variants while the Brazilian variant is being investigated, he said. With regard to the relatively low mortality rate and lesser hospitalisations across the country, compared to the western world, Dr. Mishra said the jury is still out on the reasons and research is going on various fronts on this ‘mystery’. “Earlier, we thought it is our genetic base that has been saving us but the South Asian population in UK have not been spared. Therefore, it could be something else like may be our environment or our hygiene levels or may be a lesser virus strain similar to COVID-19 may have infected us before making our bodies more resilient,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/genome-sequencing-integral-ccmb/article33993764.ece

05 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Civil Services notification issued||The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has released the notification for the Civil Services examination 2021 for recruitment for 712 vacancies in 19 services of the Central government. The notification was originally scheduled to be released on February 10, 2021. However due to administrative reasons the notification was rescheduled and released on Thursday. The number of vacancies notified this year is 712 vacancies, which is far lower than the 796 vacancies notified in 2020 and the 896 vacancies notified in 2019. Usually the notification is issued for 23 to 24 different services. However, this year the list contains only 19 services. The reduction in the number of services and the number of vacancies is on account of delinking the Railway services — the Railway Traffic Service, the Railway Accounts Service and the Railway Personnel Service — from the combined Civil Services Examination. The government had earlier notified the creation of a Railway Management Service and the inclusion of these services in it based on the recommendations of the Bibek Debroy Committee. A separate exam is expected to be conducted for recruitment to these services from 2021 onwards, according to Gopalakrishna V, director of Brain Tree, Hyderabad. Around 90,000 aspirants from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are expected to apply for the Civil Services Examination 2021. The exam will be conducted in three stages — Preliminary, the Main and the Personality test. The preliminary examination this year will conducted in 73 Centres across India on June 27. There will be six centres in both AP and Telangana — Hyderabad and Warangal in Telangana, and Vijayawada, Tirupati, Vishakhapatnam and Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. It is significant to note that Leh has been added as a centre for the Preliminary Examination from this year. The results of the Preliminary Examination, which are expected to be released in the first week of August, would shortlist about 9,250 aspirants for the Main Examination. Contrary to popular opinion, the Preliminary has been the has been the most formidable challenge of this examination for the last few years. “With the reduced number of vacancies, the difficulty level of the questions is expected to increase this year,” Mr. Gopalakrishna said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/civil-services-notification-out/article33993757.ece
05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Why delay in PPs’ appointment, asks HC||Telangana High Court on Thursday sought to know if six months was not sufficient for the State government to complete the process of appointing Public Prosecutors for all the 570 criminal courts in the State. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy observed that on September 22 last the HC had directed the government to finish off the process of appointment of PPs for all courts. And when the matter came up for hearing, the government was again asking for more time to complete the work, the bench noted. The bench was hearing a PIL plea taken up suo motu by the HC over absence of PPs in all the courts of the State. Such inordinate delay in appointment of PPs would deprive people of justice. The Public Prosecutors were backbone of the administration of criminal justice system, the bench observed. Entire procedure of trial of criminal cases rests on the assistance extended by the PPs to the courts. Their non-appointment only aggravates the criminal justice system, the bench noted. Taking exception to the government’s failure to finalise appointments of PPs, the bench declined to appreciate the explanations of the Government Pleader for Home Srikanth Reddy on the matter. The GP informed the court that already the government had finalised appointments of 212 PPs against 414 vacancies. Efforts were on to fill the remaining vacant posts as well, he said. Appointment of 212 PPPs against 414 vacancies “meant again one Public Prosecutor managing two courts as there are 570 criminal courts in Telangana”, the CJ observed. This would again result in delayed trial and denial of justice to the public, she said. The CJ also expressed serious concern over the post of Director of Prosecutions still lying vacant. The bench noted that the Director of Prosecutions plays key role and that very post was kept vacant. “Why was the DP kept vacant if the process had commenced,” the CJ asked the GP for Home. Instead of appointing a regular officer, why another officer was given additional charge of that post, the CJ wanted to know from the government. The bench instructed the GP for Home to ensure the Director of Prosecutions post was filled by April 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-delay-in-pps-appointment-asks-hc/article33993781.ece
05 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Denying wagon factory shows anti-Telangana approach: KTR||The BJP government at the Centre is exhibiting its anti-Telangana stance by declining to set up railway wagon factory as promised in the AP Reorganisation Act, charged the TRS working president, K.T. Rama Rao. In a statement here, he said the Union Railway Minister has responded negatively for setting up the wagon factory in Telangana in response to a RTI petition and this is injustice to Telangana. "We will raise the issue in the Parliament and fight for what was promised in the Reorganisation Act," he said. The Minister said that the Central government, which had already cancelled the ITIR project and curbed IT development in Hyderabad city, has now denied a major factory for Telangana. He reminded that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had personally appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi but still the project is denied. Mr. K. T. Rama Rao said the state government had made all the necessary efforts including the procurement of space for the railway coach factory. He said that very valuable 150 acres of land has already been acquired for the factory and handed over to the Central Railway Department. The Minister also alleged that there was no response from the Centre to Telangana’s demands of eight pending railway lines, two new lines, Kazipet Wagon Factory, Kazipet Railway Division, and setting up of Railway University. Telangana suffers in every budget with no allocation or a new project and even in the latest budget not a single rupee has been allocated for the railways in Telangana. Further attacking the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), KTR said the Centre was making a concerted effort to fully privatise the Railways. The Centre had already identified the 12 busiest clusters across the country and decided to hand over 109 major railway lines to private companies, which could cost the railways about Rs. 63,000 crore in annual revenue. KTR warned that with the privatization of railways the future of millions of youth in the country is going to be bleak as there won’t be new job notifications from the Railways, the largest employer in the country. He demanded that Telangana BJP leaders, who are raising a hue and cry for government jobs here locally should respond to the railway privatization issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/denying-wagon-factory-shows-anti-telangana-approach-ktr/article33993786.ece
05 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Both BJP and TRS responsible for scrapping ITIR: Congress||Telangana Congress leaders have accused the ruling TRS and the BJP of blaming each other for scrapping the Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR) project but both the parties should apologise to Telangana for failing the project sanctioned by the Congress government. Senior Congress leader, Shabbir Ali and AICC National spokesperson, Sravan Dasoju said both the TRS and the BJP were in power for the last seven years and after deliberately failing the project they were now enacting a drama of sorts to mislead the people. "The ITIR project was sanctioned by the previous Congress-led UPA government in September 2013 to generate nearly 53 lakh direct and indirect jobs. TRS and BJP leaders are shamelessly indulging in blame game over cancellation of the prestigious project," Shabbir Ali said in a media statement. Sravan challenge Mr. Sravan challenged CM K. Chandrashekhar Rao and IT Minister, K.T. Rama Rao to come up with concrete announcements on ITIR Project, job notification and regularization of contract employees and offered them that the Congress candidates will quit from contesting in MLC elections, if those announcements are made in the form of Government Orders (GO). He said that the challenge was also applicable to the BJP which was supposed to have given the funds for the prestigious ITIR project. He said the BJP and TRS didn’t raise even a single question in the Parliament on the ITIR project and Congress was the only party that has been demanding since 2014. Mr. Sravan also asked both the parties to pursue the matter with the Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to restore it or stage protest a dharna in front of his residence in Delhi to prove their honesty. He said necessary infrastructure and the ecosystem is ready for the ITIR project in Hyderabad. Fab City is available, 4,169 acres of land is in the possession of the State Infrastructure Corporation, graduates who had qualified in electronics were also ready, but only thing required was the commitment and investments and the will of the BJP and TRS leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/both-bjp-trs-responsible-for-scrapping-itir/article33993787.ece
05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Attempts alleged to privatise V.M. Home lands||The sprawling lands of Victoria Memorial Home Residential School in Kothapet, liberally donated by Sixth Nizam Mir Mahbub Ali Khan for orphans and semi orphans, are at the eye of the storm yet again, with the Ministry of Social Welfare reportedly proposing to lease the lands out for private cultivation. After being thwarted in its attempts to alienate part of the land for Rachakonda Police Commissionerate some time ago, the government has allegedly come up with the fresh proposals, ostensibly to meet the food requirements of the children staying in the hostel. A meeting of the school’s executive committee chaired by the Minister for Social Welfare Koppula Eeshwar has reportedly taken a decision for leasing out the lands, extending over 45 acres, excluding the built up area. The matter came out when Mr. Eeshwar invited the representatives of the school’s Old Students’ Association to discuss the issue, as the association has been instrumental in blocking attempts to alienate/encroach the lands for quite some time. “We have objected to the proposal, and requested the Minister to construct junior and degree colleges for students passing out after SSC. The Minister has plainly refused, and said he will ensure the students are admitted in the State-run Social Welfare residential schools,” B. Maheshwar, president of the association said. The school’s 73.33 acres of land is divided on either side of the national highway, housing Rythu Bazaar, Babu Jagjivan Ram Bhavan and a private petrol pump on one side, and the school and dormitory buildings, along with sprawling grounds on the other side. Besides, the school also has two separate pieces of land -- behind Rythu Bazaar admeasuring 16 acres, and near NTR Market of L.B.Nagar admeasuring 12 acres. The land near NTR Market was being utilised till last year to cultivate vegetables for the inmates, by engaging a farmer who worked on monthly salary. After the farmer’s death, there has been no cultivation. “The land near Rythu Bazaar too is vacant, where cultivation can be done by engaging farmers on salary. The lands within the school’s premises should not be touched,” Mr. Maheshwar demanded, after submitting a representation to the Minister. The representation sought establishment of an Education Hub at the site with PG college and university, besides clearance of existing encroachments which have been registered in the name of private persons in violation of all rules. Technical education should be reintroduced into the school which will equip the students for easier employment, it said. When sought his version, Mr. Eeshwar refuted the allegations and said there has not been any proposal for leasing out the lands for private cultivation. The meeting was attended by Secretary, SC Development, Rahul Bojja, and Commissioner, SC Development, Yogita Rana, among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/attempts-alleged-to-privatise-vm-home-lands/article33993777.ece
05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HCWs curious about antibodies||Healthcare Workers (HCWs) in Telangana, who took two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, are now curious to know if their body has generated enough antibodies against coronavirus. This has brought them to diagnostic labs to undergo tests to know the level of antibodies. And since government hospitals currently do not have the resources to take up these tests, private labs are the only option. The vaccines are administered in two doses with a gap of 28 days. The State Health department started to administer the second dose from February 13. The curiosity to know the antibody levels started after taking the second dose. Director of Public Health Dr. G. Srinivasa Rao said earlier that antibodies would start developing from two weeks after the first dose and that beneficiaries would get foolproof protection by 42 days after the first dose. Brand manager at Apollo Diagnostics V. Sravan Kumar said that earlier, they used to get around 120 samples a day to check for antibodies. “Now, we are getting around 250 samples a day. Also, a few opted to get the test done before taking the vaccine,” he said. They charge Rs. 499 per test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hcws-curious-about-antibodies/article33993760.ece

05 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Two held for duping job aspirants||Two people, who cheated several youngsters on pretext of providing jobs in Indian Railways, were arrested by the Cyberabad Police here on Thursday. The accused, Sarvesh Sahu, 32, a private employee from Ghaziabad, and Abdul Majid alias Srinivas, 26, a realtor from Vijayawada, collected between Rs. 5 lakh and Rs. 6 lakh from each aspirants from across the country and were given training for three months in Kolkata, Paharganj and other cities. Two others – Mishra from Delhi and Dinesh from Kolkata – are still at large. Prior to the ‘training’, the gang issues appointment letters, and sends them for medical tests at railway hospitals to make them believe that the offer is genuine. They also issued identity cards to the aspirants. Commissioner of Police VC Sajjanar said that Sahu formed a group with Abdul Majid, Mishra and Dinesh and hatched a plan to earn easy money by cheating the unemployed persons by promising jobs in the Indian Railway. According to their plan, Abdul Majid approaches the job aspirants through Facebook WhatsApp and informs them about government jobs through back-door entry. Mishra and Dinesh organised fake training at ‘Railway Regional Training Centre’ (resembling training imparted by government institutions). Abdul Majid would send WhatsApp links to interested aspirants to fill the resume and apply for a job. “Once the aspirant fills the form in the given link, the gang members call them and ask them to deposit Rs. 50,000 towards medical test and provides bank details,” Mr. Sajjanar said. Soon, Sahu would call them stating that they are fit for the job and are selected, and send the aspirants for reporting as per their will. “The aspirants who are willing to work in Delhi are made to report at DRM Office at Paharganj, Delhi, under the supervision of Mishra and those willing to work in south India are made to report at DRM Office, Kharagpur, under the supervision of Dinesh,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/two-held-for-duping-job-aspirants/article33993925.ece
05 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP questions TRS campaigning with PV photo||The BJP on Wednesday questioned the TRS campaigning for the MLC polls using the photograph of former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. “How the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao suddenly realised the importance of PV? Was his family invited for birth anniversary celebrations anywhere in Telangana?” questioned party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar at a press conference. “PV was a former Prime Minister and a leader of the Congress and certainly does not belong to the TRS. Is it not a fact Mr. Rao had criticised him during the separate state agitation? We have his grandson in our party so are we also campaigning using PV’s photo,” he asked. The TRS desperate nature to win the polls at any cost is not going to succeed as the BJP was sure to win both the seats with a decisive majority, he claimed. “We have done our own surveys unlike that of Mr. Rao and we are sure to win just like we won the Dubbak bypoll and the GHMC elections. People are eager to teach a lesson to this government,” he said. Mr. Sanjay Kumar said the Chief Minister cannot claim to be above board if an official in his own office has been found to be indulging in corrupt practices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-questions-trs-campaigning-with-pv-photo/article33993782.ece

05 March 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Etigaddakishtapur-Siddipet road closed||Tension prevailed for some time at Etigaddakishtapur on Thursday evening when police arrested Congress leader Ch. Srinivas Reddy and several others protesting over the closing of road connectivity between the village and Siddipet. Making life more troublesome, the road connecting Etigaddakishtapur with Siddipet via Vagu Gadda is being closed by the contractor on Thursday. Etigaddakishtapur is one of the villages that would get submerged under Mallannasagar. The bund of the reservoir passes through the village. Knowing this large number of villagers arrived at the spot and exchanged heated arguments with the contractors performing work. They were led by Congress leader Cheruku Srinivas Reddy. The villagers argued with the police that this would create trouble for them and they would be forced to make a round to reach Siddipet thereby forcing them to travel more distance. A police force was mobolised to prevent any untoward incident in view of the protest by the oustees. The agitation by oustees continued till late in the evening. The oustees alleged that they were canned by the police.“We have approached the court seeking stay in the works till all compensations were paid to us and rehabilitation and resettlement works were completed. The officials were directed by the court to not to disturb road connectivity, power and water supply. But despite all this, the contractor with the support of police is closing the road that connects Siddipet. We have informed the police that court orders are not to close the roads, but they were not ready to hear us. They are telling that instructions are from higher authorities and they are helpless,” said a villager on condition of anonymity. Police arrested Mr Srinivas Reddy and four other farmers from the village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/etigaddakishtapur-siddipet-road-closed/article33993929.ece
05 March 2021||Chandigarh,||Pay MSP to farmers, Sidhu tells Punjab govt.||Even as he hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre over the three farm laws, former Punjab Cabinet Minister and currently a legislator of the ruling Congress party in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu, on Thursday asked his own Congress government in the State to use its power to legislate to ensure assured procurement of oilseeds and lentils at the Minimum Support Price (MSP). Mr. Sidhu said the Centre’s three farm laws were an infringement on the State’s right to legislate and that the Centre could not scuttle the legislative sphere of the States. “Thus, we have enough grounds to completely deny the implementation of these black laws in Punjab. Yet why, in this case, are we just amending the Central laws and sending them back, when we know very well that all these amendments will not be implemented until either approved by the President of India or if the Central laws are first withdrawn? By means of mere amendments, we are going to the Constitutional head, who may not choose to help us, and maybe is not a good position to be in at this decisive critical juncture. Instead, why not use the democratic power given to us by 3 crore Punjabis by honouring their aspirations?” he said.  Assured procurement Mr. Sidhu, addressing a press conference here, said that to help farmers get MSP, there should be an expansion of procurement beyond wheat and rice in the State. He added farmers cannot diversify until MSP is provided and there’s assured procurement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pay-msp-to-farmers-sidhu-tells-punjab-govt/article33993745.ece

05 March 2021||Guwahati,||Hiren Gohain resigns as chief adviser of Raijor Dal||Noted academician Hiren Gohain has resigned as the chief adviser of the Raijor Dal over the political stand of its president, jailed rights activist Akhil Gogoi, involving the minority-based All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF). Mr. Gogoi had in an open letter asked all Opposition parties to field consensus candidates across Assam’s 126 Assembly seats in order to prevent the BJP from retaining power. But he wanted the AIUDF to be kept out of such an arrangement as he believed the party headed by Maulana Badruddin Ajmal was as communal as the BJP. The first of the three-phase Assembly elections in the State is on March 27. “Akhil Gogoi’s latest decision has gone against my long-term opinion. After this, I won’t have the little responsibility for any of their actions,” Dr. Gohain said while announcing his decision to dissociate with the Raijor Dal on Wednesday evening. Mr. Gogoi has been in jail since December 2019 on charges of sedition and inciting violence during the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the State, which seeks to fast-track the citizenship of non-Muslims from three neighbouring countries who sought asylum in India till December 31, 2014. Gogoi’s warning The jailed activist, who was elected as the Raijor Dal president a few days ago, had warned that the BJP could be in power again if the Opposition did not get together for a strategic fight. This, his party said, could be done without formally joining the Congress-led grand alliance. Apart from the Congress and the AIUDF, the grand alliance has the Bodoland People’s Front, Anchalik Gana Morcha, and three Left Front parties as its constituents. Disagreeing with Mr. Gogoi’s views on the AIUDF, Mr. Gohain said: “The Congress-AIUDF alliance was sealed in Delhi and the former cannot leave now. I have my limitations where AIUDF is concerned, but their activities have not caused any huge damage in Assam.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hiren-gohain-quits-as-chief-adviser-of-raijor-dal/article33993377.ece

05 March 2021||Staff Reporter Mumbai,||Donation drive triggers chaos in Assembly||The Maharashtra Assembly saw heated exchanges on Thursday over the State-wide donation drive for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. State Congress chief and party MLA Nana Patole alleged that citizens were being threatened to make donations. “There are reports from different areas that people collecting donation are resorting to threats. Who are these people collecting funds in the name of Ram? Has the Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] taken a contract for extortion in the name of Lord Ram?” he asked. At this, BJP MLAs rushed to the well of the House. Mr. Patole said he had specifically received complaints from an individual. “Is there a charity trust which is collecting money? Where has the money gone that was collected 30 years ago? The BJP must answer,” he said. As the protests continued, proceedings were adjourned for 10 minutes. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said those who survive on extortion do not understand the importance of donation. “If this Assembly wants to discuss donation, it should hold a special discussion,” he said. Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi demanded that Muslim ministers in the State government resign to protest over the reference to Babri Masjid demolition by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/donation-drive-triggers-chaos-in-assembly/article33993386.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Biden govt. to deepen global alliances||U.S. President Joe Biden released an interim government strategy document on Wednesday that called for America to re-engage with the world while strengthening itself at home. The document warns that democracies are under siege around the world, including in the U.S., and makes numerous references to strategic competition with an increasingly assertive China, which it said was the only competitor who could effectively challenge an open international system. Invest in democracy In addition to reaffirming its alliances with NATO, Australia, Japan and South Korea, Mr. Biden said in the document, ‘Renewing America’s Advantages: Interim National Security Strategic Guidance’, that his administration would deepen its partnership with India and work alongside New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members to advance its objectives. The document, which serves to guide the agendas of U.S. government departments and agencies, said America would recommit to its alliances and invest in its own democracy and economy. “…Because our strength is multiplied when we combine efforts to address common challenges, share costs, and widen the circle of cooperation. As we do, we will recognise that our vital national interests compel the deepest connection to the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere. And we will be mindful of both our values and our interests as we engage partner nations,” the document said. Critics have argued that the Trump administration prioritised interest — including in its relationship with India — over values. Multilateral groups The U.S. will also move to “earn back” its position of leadership in multilateral organisations to tackle shared challenges like climate change, as per the strategy. “Because the United Nations and other international organisations, however imperfect, remain essential for advancing our interests, we will re-engage as a full participant and work to meet our financial obligations, in full and on time,” Mr. Biden said. The U.S. and some other democracies (including India) have been concerned about Chinese government-inspired language finding its way into documents and resolutions of the UN and its agencies. Mr. Biden’s interim strategy highlighted this concern, without naming China, and said the U.S. would not cede ground on it. “It is also critical that these institutions continue to reflect the universal values, aspirations, and norms that have underpinned the UN system since its founding 75 years ago, rather than an authoritarian agenda. In a world of deepening rivalry, we will not cede this vital terrain.” “The most effective way for America to out-compete a more assertive and authoritarian China over the long-term is to invest in our people, our economy, and our democracy,” the document said, adding that the U.S. would support China’s neighbours and trading partners to defend their rights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-govt-to-deepen-global-alliances/article33993129.ece
05 March 2021||Geneva,||UN tells Myanmar military to stop ‘murdering’ protesters||At least 54 people have been killed and over 1,700 detained since Myanmar’s February 1 coup, the United Nations rights chief said on Thursday. The comments come after the deadliest day of protests in Myanmar, with at least 38 dead on Wednesday in rallies where security forces were seen firing at crowds. UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet urged security forces to “halt their vicious crackdown on peaceful protesters”. “Myanmar’s military must stop murdering and jailing protesters,” she said in a statement. “It is utterly abhorrent that security forces are firing live ammunition against peaceful protesters across the country,” she added. Ms. Bachelet said she was “appalled at the documented attacks against emergency medical staff and ambulances attempting to provide care to those who have been injured”. The UN rights office said it had corroborated information that at least 54 people had been killed since February 1. “The actual death toll, however, could be much higher as these are the figures the office has been able to verify,” it said.  Since the coup, more than 1,700 people have also been “arbitrarily arrested and detained in relation to their participation in protests or engagement in political activity”, the statement said. At least 700 people were detained on Wednesday alone, with many of them reportedly swept up as soldiers and police conducted door-to-door searches. Those arrested include parliamentarians, political and rights activists, election officials, teachers, healthcare workers, journalists and monks, it said. “Many of the arbitrary arrests and detentions that have been carried out since February 1 may constitute enforced disappearances,” Ms. Bachelet said, calling for the release of all those who remain arbitrarily detained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-tells-myanmar-military-to-stop-murdering-protesters/article33993124.ece
05 March 2021||Washington,||U.S. officials flag new extremist threat||The U.S. House of Representatives session was cancelled and security was high on Thursday after officials warned of an attack plot by QAnon conspiracists, two months after supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building. Lawmakers and staff were advised to stay away after the FBI and Homeland Security Department warned that violent militia groups and QAnon followers had discussed attacking the legislature on or around March 4.  The FBI-Homeland Security bulletin said extremists are still motivated by unfounded Republican claims of widespread voter fraud in the November presidential election won by Democrat Joe Biden. Also driving the possible threat is a belief by followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory that Mr. Trump could be restored to the White House on March 4, which was the date for U.S. presidential inaugurations before 1933. In late February, some militant groups “discussed plans to take control of the U.S. Capitol and remove Democratic lawmakers on or about March 4”, according to the bulletin. ‘Aspirational threats’ The Capitol Police echoed the bulletin with their own alert. “We have obtained intelligence that shows a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group on Thursday, March 4,” they said on Wednesday. However, the Capitol was not on full lockdown, as the warnings said the threats were more “aspirational” than developed. The Senate was to continue meeting and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was planning a press conference in the building. In the morning hours of Thursday, there were no signs of significant protests outside the buildings of the sprawling Capitol complex.  Capitol Police and the National Guard were on high alert and the Capitol grounds are fenced off. In addition, there was no sign of the many thousands of Trump supporters who were in Washington during the January 6 breach. But security officials warned that the most violent groups have also spoken of using explosives, with Mr. Biden’s yet-to-be-scheduled plan to address Congress a possible target.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-officials-flag-new-extremist-threat/article33993647.ece
05 March 2021||Yangon,||Protesters rally again in Myanmar||Defiant anti-coup protesters returned to cities and towns across Myanmar on Thursday after dozens of people were killed in the deadliest day of the junta’s crackdown. At least 38 people died on Wednesday, according to the United Nations. Online images streamed out of Myanmar showed security forces firing into crowds and blood-covered bodies of protesters with bullet wounds in their heads.  Wednesday’s violence left the United States “appalled and revulsed”, said State Department spokesman Ned Price. “We call on all countries to speak with one voice to condemn the brutal violence by the Burmese military against its own people,” he said, referring to the country by its former name. French President Emmanuel Macron called for an “immediate end of the repression in Myanmar”. More than 50 people have been killed since the military takeover, UN envoy to Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener told reporters. On Thursday, protesters hit the streets again in Yangon and Mandalay, the nation's two biggest cities, as well as other towns that have been hotspots for unrest. In recent days, Yangon’s San Chaung township has descended into chaos as security forces have amassed there to stop protesters from gathering. A residential area known for its hip cafes, restaurants and bars, its streets on Thursday were transformed with barricades built out of sandbags, tyres, bricks and barbed wire. Passersby walked on images of junta leader Min Aung Hlaing, which protesters plastered on the ground to slow chasing security forces who will avoid stepping on the portraits. “Yesterday was horrific ... it was devastating to learn the military in Myanmar has never changed since 1962,” activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told AFP .   Six journalists were also arrested on the weekend and charged under a law prohibiting “causing fear, spreading false news, or agitating directly or indirectly a government employee”, according to their lawyer Tin Zar Oo.  However protesters, citizen journalists and some media groups continued to send images out of Myanmar, and on Thursday the funeral of a 19-year-old woman, Kyal Sin, who was killed in Mandalay, was streamed live on Facebook.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/protesters-rally-again-in-myanmar/article33993119.ece
05 March 2021||washington,||Ahead of Floyd murder trial, U.S. House clears police reforms||A sweeping police reform package was cleared by the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, five days before the trial of a white officer charged with murdering African-American George Floyd. The Bill is named after Floyd, who died last May when then-Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the victim’s neck for over eight minutes. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act cleared the House last year but was blocked in the Republican-led Senate. With President Joe Biden in office since January, and the Senate narrowly controlled by Democrats, the Bill was reintroduced last week and it was passed on Wednesday largely along party lines, 220 to 212.  Before the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the “legislation will not erase centuries of systemic racism and excessive policing in America”, but it takes a “tremendous step” towards stopping the violence and improving relations between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The Bill now heads to the Senate, where its fate is uncertain as the chamber is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Key provisions The measure bans choke holds and no-knock warrants, combats racial profiling, limits the transfer of military equipment to local police forces, expands police training, and establishes a database to track officer misconduct. Its most controversial provision is likely the restriction of officer immunity, which shielded police from civil lawsuits. Republicans have argued that the measure would strip police forces of funding, tie the hands of officers and make communities less safe. House Republican Debbie Lesko warned that the Bill “leaves police unequipped to deal with dangerous or life-threatening situations and limits the tools that police can use in the field”. Floyd’s family heralded the Bill's House passage in a statement from their lawyers on Wednesday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ahead-of-floyd-murder-trial-us-house-clears-police-reforms/article33993125.ece

The trust vote was necessitated after the defeat of Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh in hotly-contested Senate elections on Wednesday. Pakistan Democratic Movement candidate and former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani defeated Mr. Shaikh, from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), giving a major blow to the Prime Minister who had personally campaigned for his Cabinet colleague. In an address to the nation on Thursday, Mr. Khan lashed out at the Opposition alliance for “making a mockery of democracy” and said he will never let the corrupt off the hook.   “If I am out of the government, I will go to the people and bring them out to continue my struggle for the country. I will not let these traitors sit in peace. I call them traitors because they are looters,” Mr. Khan said.     Mr. Khan also hit out at the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and said it failed to stop corruption in polls. “You [the ECP] discredited democracy … you damaged the morality of the nation by doing nothing to stop vote-buying.” He added that the Opposition parties tried to blackmail him to get concessions in their corruption cases. “They used money to win Senate elections to put pressure on me in the parliament,” he said. Mr. Khan claimed that his party members were offered Rs. 200 crores to buy votes and 15-16 members of his party sold themselves. He said it was important to stop corruption at the top before expecting the people to become honest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-pm-to-seek-trust-vote-tomorrow/article33993645.ece

The decision by the court’s outgoing prosecutor to probe Israeli military’s actions and settlement construction on lands captured in the 1967 Mideast war was announced on Wednesday. The move was condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “the essence of anti-Semitism and hypocrisy”. Roy Schondorf, Deputy Attorney-General for International Law, Israeli Ministry of Justice, told Army Radio that the court’s decision was driven by “political agendas” and that opening an investigation was unjustified, but that Israel has not rejected any participation outright. “The court’s conduct until now, and the prosecutor’s in particular, doesn’t inspire great trust in the way the procedures will transpire,” said Mr. Schondorf. The decision turns the court’s focus towards two Israeli policies: its repeated military operations against Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, highlighted by a devastating 2014 war, and its expansion of Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian National Authority welcomed Wednesday’s move, while the U.S. State Department said it opposed the decision.

While the government agreed to lift a ban on the group, release all their party members and supporters in jail and drop all legal cases against them, the rebel group agreed to give up all violence and resolve any issues through peaceful dialogue, the government said in a statement after the peace talks. Details of the agreement would be made public at a joint ceremony on Friday with Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli and the leader of the rebel group Netra Bikram Chand, who is better known by his guerrilla name Biplav. The rebels also call themselves the Nepal Communist Party. Split from party The group had split from the Maoist Communist party, which fought government troops between 1996 and 2006, when it gave up its armed revolt, agreed to United Nations-monitored peace talks and joined mainstream politics. The Maoist fighting had left 17,000 people dead, hundreds missing and many more injured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nepal-govt-signs-peace-pact-with-rebel-group/article33993120.ece

There was no immediate confirmation of an attack by the oil giant or the country’s authorities. Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree on Twitter claimed that the rebels hit an Aramco facility in Jiddah with a Quds-2 missile at dawn on Thursday in retaliation for a six-year military campaign led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen. The Iran-aligned rebels have struck Aramco facilities in the past, underscoring the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia’s expensive oil infrastructure.  The rebels’ latest claim comes after the U.S. on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two Houthi commanders, blaming them for civilian deaths and denouncing their ties with Iran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/yemens-houthis-claim-missile-strike-on-oil-plant/article33993127.ece

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Will West Bengal tilt towards the right this election?||The first phase of the West Bengal Assembly elections is only a few weeks away. While the BJP and Trinamool Congress (TMC) are locked in an intense battle, the Left-Congress alliance is attempting to win back voters. In a conversation moderated by Varghese K. George , Prasenjit Bose and Snigdhendu Bhattacharya discuss the issues dominating this election. Edited excerpts: What issues do you think will be determining this West Bengal election? Prasenjit? Prasenjit Bose:We should look at the BJP’s surprise performance in the 2019 election in which, for the first time, it crossed the 40% vote share threshold and won 18 seats. Although one could see it coming up in a big way, the extent of its surge was not expected. You should start from there. Has the BJP gained further momentum since then? Or has the TMC been able to retrieve some ground, which it appeared to have lost in 2019? Or has anti-incumbency just continued to grow? So, you have anti-incumbency, you have the BJP’s attempt to create a hyper-nationalistic national narrative on questions like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and West Bengal has a history of class politics. Which of these issues could dominate this poll? PB:I think anti-incumbency would be number one, because ultimately, it’s an Assembly election. There are enough reasons for people to be extremely dissatisfied with the TMC government. But there have been some government initiatives which have helped the TMC retrieve some of those groups. Again, I think, borrowing a term coined by a political analyst, it was ‘subaltern Hindutva’ which enabled the BJP to cross the 40% vote share. Identity issues will have a very important role to play. Snigdhendu, we have a larger frame of incumbency factors, and we have identity politics at play. There is a very strong pitch for religious consolidation under the BJP. How would you characterise and explain the strength of each of these factors? Snigdhendu Bhattacharya:The influence of caste politics died down long ago. In its last leg, the Left regime was no longer taking up caste issues as such. In 1977, the Left came to power and implemented Operation Barga, perhaps the largest government-backed land redistribution programme ensuring the hegemony of the farmers. In 2011, Mamata Banerjee came to power by hijacking the Left agenda… You are saying caste is not a factor. Is Hindutva a factor? SB:Identity is a factor, but anti-incumbency is the main factor. With Hindutva, the BJP could have, at most, surpassed the 25% mark, but could not have touched the 40% mark [in 2019]. This anti-incumbency is essentially due to two reasons: one, corruption at the grassroots level and the arrogance of TMC leaders; and two, political violence. The turning point was the 2018 panchayat elections, which the TMC captured by violence. People just took revenge on the TMC in 2019. Who will be the beneficiary of that anti-incumbency sentiment? There are two claimants: the BJP and the Congress-Left alliance. PB:I think the BJP is going to benefit much more. As pointed out, the TMC won the 2018 panchayat elections in a visibly high-handed and violent manner. That created a tremendous amount of backlash, especially in the rural areas. The BJP has emerged as the strongest opposition, as it could face that onslaught in a more effective manner. It has been very aggressive in opposing the TMC government — in educating the public, street politics, etc. — much more than the Left and Congress have. The BJP is in the Central government; it occupies media space; the Governor appointed by the Centre has been running a parallel government... The BJP has already occupied the mind space of the people as the key opposition. Though the Congress-Left alliance will try to leverage the organisational strength of both parties, it is perhaps too late for it to outrun the BJP. Besides being the main beneficiary of the anti-incumbency sentiment, the BJP is also trying to rope in Dalits, tribal communities and backward classes under the Hindutva fold... PB:The BJP is doing that with remarkable success. The 2019 results speak for themselves: the tribal-dominated areas of the State voted for the BJP. Within the Scheduled Caste (SC) communities, the two largest communities are the Rajvanshis and the Namasudras. And many of them are post-Partition refugees. Through the citizenship tripod of the CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register, the BJP said it was trying to champion the cause of these sections. The Left and Congress had absolutely no clue that this was happening until 2019. I would say that the TMC this time appears to have done some damage control. Is there a sense among the subaltern sections that the non-BJP parties are controlled by urban elites? SB:I don’t think so. Because if you look at the construct of the Left parties, it might be true that the top brass in the Central Committee or within the State Committee consists mostly of Brahmins. But they have leaders from the SC, Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBC) at all other levels. So, that wasn’t the issue. I think the major reason behind this switch of SC, ST and OBC votes is that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has been consistently working on these communities. Throughout India there are RSS-backed organisations working tirelessly and quite silently among the tribal communities. The second point is about the corruption, high-handedness and malpractices of the TMC. These backward communities are the most affected by these, so, possibly, the anger was greater among them. Some early intellectual arguments of Hindu nationalism began in Bengal. The State also went through communal partition more than once. How fertile is the West Bengal of today for Hindu nationalism? SB:It is a very fertile ground for many kinds of identity politics, one of which is Hindutva. They (proponents of Hindutva) have two-three main issues. One is demographic change. They say there has been an increase in the Muslim population over the last seven decades and they want to ‘save’ West Bengal from turning into Bangladesh. Then they speak about Ms. Banerjee’s so-called ‘Muslim appeasement’. Her policies have created a certain kind of Hindu backlash. The ground was always fertile in Bengal. There was a kind of communal mindset among sections of Bengalis in the pre-Independence era. Two factors had kept them suppressed. One was the impact of the Renaissance, which had triumphed over Hindu nationalism until the 1930s when communal politics surged across India. Bengal was one of the most volatile States during the communal clashes. From the 1940s rose the communists. What is usually not a part of political discussions and consciousness is the fact that Bengal was divided on communal lines. How deep is the memory of Partition in West Bengal in the State’s political consciousness? How is that being resurrected? PB:Well, one way of directly not only reviving those memories but kind of utilising the dynamics of Partition politics and creating fresh polarisation is the promise of giving citizenship to post-Partition refugees. There was an influx of refugees between 1948 and, say, the early 1950s immediately after Partition. Then there was a huge refugee influx in 1971 when the war took place. Then we had several phases of influx… These are dominantly Hindus. What the BJP has been saying is that we will expel the Muslim Bangladeshis and give citizenship to Hindus. But the experience of the Assam NRC shows us that the vast number of those excluded were Hindus. In West Bengal, the proportion of excluded Hindus could be even higher. So, there is a fear of the NRC. And more the fear, the more the BJP could suffer electorally. I think that is why, after a point, the BJP put the NRC on the back burner. Whereas last year, before the pandemic, it almost seemed like that was its main game plan. Do you foresee all the anti-incumbency votes congregating towards the BJP? What will the BJP do to enable that? And how will the Congress-Left alliance try to remain in play? SB:The Left-Congress alliance is looking to at least do a better performance than in 2019 when the Left and Congress contested separately and managed to get only 12% of the votes. If they can increase their vote share by even a few percentage points, that would essentially take away from the BJP and weaken its prospects. But the fact that Abbas Siddiqui (the Peerzada of Furfura Sharif) has allied with the Left-Congress alliance has started a new debate on the secular character of these parties. There is a possibility that this might help the Hindutva polarisation plan. So, in this case, Hindutva polarisation may help the anti-incumbency polarisation in favour of the BJP. A bipolar contest rather than a triangular contest is increasingly the possibility. Do you agree, Prasenjit? PB:West Bengal elections have been bipolar contests for a long time. I think the people had made up their mind about the BJP in 2019. I don’t see any reason why they should change their mind this year. If the BJP fails to dislodge the TMC government, subsequent developments will take place where other options will be tried out. But in this election, I don’t see those wanting to dislodge the TMC being very confused about who the principal opposition is. Whatever the Left and Congress are trying to do now is too close to the election. Abbas Siddiqui could turn out to be counterproductive, especially for the Left. He is a new player, so whatever he gets, he will gain, because he was not there earlier. It is going to be a bipolar contest. There will be a few constituencies where the alliance will be in the contest. In the large bulk of the seats, it will be the BJP versus the TMC and the BJP will finish much closer to its 2019 vote share. At the margin, what will become decisive is social engineering or the subaltern Hindu experiment. Some of it might just unravel and that may become decisive. At the last moment, as we head towards the elections, I see the BJP losing some steam. We haven’t discussed in detail many other factors such as the defection question. What would be the overall impact of the large-scale defection from the TMC leadership? Also, the subaltern Hindutva point: if the BJP had been so confident, why is it that it is still — so late and so close to the election — hankering for recognition by the Bengali Hindu elite? I think there is something happening on the ground where things may not be panning out in the BJP’s favour in the way it has drawn the script.  Anti-incumbency is essentially due to two reasons: one, corruption at the grassroots level and the arrogance of TMC leaders; and two, political violence.

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Not so stellar in protecting personal liberty||A pair of recent rulings gave us a glimmer of hope that the judiciary might yet serve as a tribune of people’s rights. The first was the acquittal of the journalist, Priya Ramani, on charges of criminal defamation. A Delhi court, in discharging her of the accusations, recognised that a woman’s right to dignity superseded any claims over reputation. The court also held that a survivor of sexual harassment had the freedom to place her grievance at any point of time after the occurrence of the event and on any platform of her choice. The second was the grant of bail to Disha Ravi, a 22-year-old woman who was arrested in Bengaluru and taken to New Delhi on charges of sedition. Her alleged crime: helping edit, and sharing, a “toolkit” that was meant to lend support to protests against the Union government’s new farm laws. In the order granting bail, the court of the additional sessions judge noted that the prosecution had failed to produce even an iota of evidence linking Ms. Ravi to an act of violence. It found the toolkit to be innocuous and the actions of the Delhi police, in restraining her liberty, to be based on “propitious anticipations”. The judge was also constrained to state the obvious: that, in a democracy, the right to dissent is fundamental. Now for another ruling In a free republic, verdicts such as these will be seen as unexceptionable. If anything, they are attempts at undoing, at least in part, injustices wrought by the processes of the criminal justice system. Ms. Ramani spent months on end participating in a trial, not for being a perpetrator of any crime but for speaking out about sexual harassment at the workplace. Ms. Ravi spent 10 days in custody on the basis of evidence that the court found, at best, “scanty and sketchy”. But these rulings are now far from routine. Indeed, on February 25, the Allahabad High Court, in Aparna Purohit v. State of U.P. , gave us a scantling of the disdain with which the higher judiciary views issues of personal liberty. In denying anticipatory bail to Ms. Purohit, who is the head of Amazon Prime Video’s India Originals, which ran the web series Tandav , the High Court was effectively telling the applicant that she deserved to be interrogated in custody for running a show that was “bound to hurt the sentiments of the majority community”. Not that Tandav necessarily does this, but it mattered little to the court that deriding a person’s belief is not an offence, not even under India’s draconian blasphemy laws. Unconstitutional, but upheld Free speech, we all recognise, is a condition of legitimate government. We also recognise that there are limits to this right. The Constitution permits reasonable restrictions on speech on a variety of stated grounds. Determining what is reasonable and what falls within the bounds of those permitted limitations can sometimes be an exercise fraught with difficulty. But India’s Parliament has never grappled, with genuine seriousness, over these questions. It has either chosen to allow colonial-era laws to do the government’s bidding or it has legislated new rules that do not merely err on the side of restraint as much as they treat the restriction as their chief goal and purpose. The cases concerning Ms. Ramani, Ms. Ravi and Ms. Purohit each emanate out a law that is categorically unconstitutional, but that has nonetheless been upheld by the Supreme Court. Tools of defamation, sedition Consider first criminal defamation. It ought to be self-evident that the punishment, even the very idea of prosecution, for libellous speech is disproportionate to the offence. Criminal law does not exist to make prosecutable acts that are essentially private in nature. By making ostensibly slanderous talk a punishable offence, the state imposes a chilling effect on all manners of legitimate speech. It is for this reason that almost every democratic nation of the world has revoked laws criminalising defamation. But in India. it remains a tool for the powerful and is routinely invoked not just by individuals and governments in positions of authority but also by corporations looking to protect their commercial interests. In the case of sedition, its colonial remnants are, again, plainly apparent. Although it was not a part of Macaulay’s original draft, it was incorporated by the British government into the Indian Penal Code with the explicit aim of repressing all forms of dissent against the regime. The offence — which carries with it the prospect of life imprisonment — is defined as any act which “brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India”. The clause also contains an ominous explanation: the word “disaffection” includes disloyalty and all feelings of enmity. In saving the provision from the Constitution’s demands, the Supreme Court, in 1962, read down the offence and held that it was only seditious action that had the “tendency to disrupt public order” that was prosecutable. Since then, in other cases, the Court has held that speech can be criminalised only when it bears a proximate connection to disorder. But despite the imposition of these confines, the offence of sedition continues to be weaponised to restrict even the most inoffensive forms of dissent. India’s blasphemy laws, Section 153A, which deals with speech that seeks to promote enmity between different communities, and Section 295A, which criminalises speech that outrages religious feelings, are also vestiges of colonialism. Rather than aiding in dealing with genuine cases of hate speech, the laws permit governments to target acts that so much as offend a person’s belief, dislodging, in the process, the very foundation of free expression. Signals from the judiciary That the Supreme Court has allowed these provisions to remain on India’s books ought to tell us that its record in protecting personal liberty is acclaimed without reason. Every now and then, the Court does bewail the state of affairs. In Arnab Manoranjan Goswami vs State of Maharashtra , decided in November last year, the Court warned against the use of the criminal law as “a ruse for targeted harassment”. The judgment noted: “Our courts must ensure that they continue to remain the first line of defence against the deprivation of the liberty of citizens. Deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one day too many.” But any hope that the verdict would augur well for the many thousands who continue to languish in jail without trial was quickly quelled. When those involved with the making of Tandav first approached the Supreme Court, weeks after the verdict in Arnab Manoranjan Goswami , the Court not only refused to quash the criminal charges against them but also offered them no interim protection against arrest. What is more, when one of the show’s actors pleaded that he had simply been contracted to play a part, he was told, “You cannot play the role of a character which hurts the religious sentiments of others.” To be sure, as the lawyer Abhinav Sekhri has repeatedly highlighted, India’s bail jurisprudence suffers from a systemic malaise, where the manner in which offences are classified and the manner in which judicial discretion is vested invariably leads to arbitrary outcomes. But when this uncertainty is coupled with the prevailing distrust — which flows from the Supreme Court — in the values of personal liberty, of free thought and expression, what we get is a complete erasure of the rule of law.

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||With Biden, India may need a new template||The new administration in the United States, of Joseph R. Biden, and the 117th U.S. Congress, two separate branches in the American system of governance, hit the road running with a sense of purpose to ‘heal’ the country and restore its leadership role in the world. Now, with the Congress settling down to find its rhythm, it would turn attention to issues the Members are committed to and their constituents push for. While pursuing their agenda on The Hill, members tend to work together building support among colleagues as they move towards legislative action. Early conversations between the leaderships in both countries offer an insight into the priorities of the Biden administration in furtherance of strategic bilateral ties amid early signs that the mood on Capitol Hill could be less favourable. Message by the India Caucus India does enjoy bipartisan support in the Congress but the first signal of a possible direction can be interpreted from the recent formal interaction that members of the India Caucus in the House of Representatives had with the Indian envoy in Washington DC. Founded in the early 1990s, it is the largest country-specific caucus on The Hill. Caucus co-chair Brad Sherman (Democrat) and Steve Chabot (Republican), along with Vice Chair Rohit ‘Ro’ Khanna (Democrat), organised a meet with the Indian Ambassador to the United States, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, with particular reference to the farmers’ protest in India. Irrespective of who took the initiative for the meeting, the message delivered by the Caucus underscored its priority. A formal statement by Mr. Sherman said the group urged the Government of India to make sure that the norms of democracy are maintained and that protesters are allowed to protest in a peaceful manner with access to the Internet and journalists. “All friends of India hope that the parties can reach an agreement,” was the message as a few other Congressmen took to social media on the farmers’ issue separately. Rohit ‘Ro’ Khanna is one of the youngest among the four Indian-Americans in the current House of Representatives, the others being Dr. Ami Bera, Pramila Jayapal, and Raja Krishnamoorthi. He identifies with the progressives group that has more members in the current Democratic Party set-up and is a powerful voice. Mr. Khanna was associated with the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders considered Left and keeping him company in the group is Ms. Jayapal (Democrat). It was her possible presence in a meeting with members in the Congress, that led to India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar cancelling the engagement in December 2019 when he was in the U.S. This made then Senator Kamala Harris join issue.  Indian community is a force While interaction between government officials is a regular exercise, there is another significant dimension to the growth of bilateral relations. It is the immense contribution of the Indian-Americans, the second largest immigrant community with a strength of four million plus people.  The massive effort by this highly educated and economically strong community makes it count as one of the most influential groups in the U.S. From the time when India came under sanctions following the Pokhran explosions, to the time the U.S. Congress voted on the civil nuclear deal, Indian-Americans have played a key role in transforming the relations. Yet, over the past few years, there has been a divergence in the preferences of the community. A recent survey on attitudes of Indian Americans by Carnegie, Johns Hopkins and University of Pennsylvania (https://bit.ly/3kLfMhh) offers an understanding into many facets. The community today may be less willing to engage with lawmakers and their aides with the same sense of purpose it did earlier on account of differing perceptions of events in India. In addition, over the past decade-and a-half, a number of Indian-Americans have found their way into various branches of the administration and the Congress. Assessments and response These second-generation members of Indian-Americans have their own individual assessment of developments in India, making it tougher for New Delhi to put forward a convincing argument from its perspective to counter perceptions. In America’s way of working, the standpoint of aides go in as valuable inputs for hard-nosed policy drafters while preparing documents for the administration and the Congress. The farmers’ protests in India attracted attention across the world and found resonance in the U.S. too. The sharp reaction in India to comments on social media by Rihanna and Meena Harris came around the time when racial justice and the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement remains strong in the current American political discourse. India, of course, has stepped up its outreach on the Hill and New Delhi enjoys an advantage to the extent that both Mr. Jaishankar and the current Foreign Secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, served as Indian envoys in Washington DC. Both are well-versed with the way the city functions inside the Beltway. Adding sinews to this effort is the pace of engagement by Indian missions. A leading Indian think-tank too opened its U.S. arm to supplement efforts in a city where the hiring of a professional lobby firm in Washington DC is well-accepted practice. A direction pointer A challenge in the current scenario would also be to translate the intent expressed at the last India-U.S. 2+2 meeting, in October 2019, of establishing an India-U.S.-Parliamentary Exchange for formal and reciprocal visits by parliamentarians (https://bit.ly/3ecqFHB). This is because opinion articulated by lawmakers has an amplifier effect and at times determines the path for the administration. The accumulated reservoir of goodwill by Indians should help in defining the future course of bilateral ties; but it would require imaginative engagement to deal with the Democrat-controlled House, making it easier for the new administration to work on its India-centric plans. A test case waits in the form of CAATSA, or Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, as India moves ahead to procure the Russian S-400 missile defence system. K.V.

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Ending the war in Yemen||One of the first key foreign policy decisions that President Joe Biden took after assuming office was to end the U.S.’s support for Saudi Arabia’s six-year-long war on Yemen. He halted weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, appointed a Special Envoy for Yemen, and removed the Shia Houthi rebels, who control the northwestern parts of the Arab country, from the list of foreign terrorist organisations. Both former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump looked away from Yemen even as the country, amidst a multipolar civil war and Saudi bombing, descended into chaos and witnessed a humanitarian catastrophe. Can Mr. Biden be different? The war in Yemen The crisis in Yemen is not only about the Saudi-Houthi conflict. It has many more dimensions: humanitarian, civil, geopolitical and sectarian. When Saudi Arabia, the UAE and their allies went to Yemen in March 2015, they had a clearly defined objective: drive the Houthis, who are backed by Iran, out of the capital Sana’a and stabilise the country under the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi that they support. The Saudi-led coalition imposed a blockade on Yemen, which they hoped would eventually weaken the Houthis, and started a bombing campaign aimed at wrecking the rebels militarily. This campaign was a failure as the Houthis entrenched themselves in the north-west despite the military and economic challenges. The only success the Saudis can claim from a tactical point of view is that the Houthis were limited to the north-west. But the Saudi-backed government failed to consolidate its position even in the south. A separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), has established its rule in southern Yemen. The UAE, which backs the STC, has pulled out of the Saudi-led coalition. All this is happening while the humanitarian situation in Yemen is worsening by the day. The war has killed over 10,000 people and pushed the country to the brink of a famine. According to the UN, 50,000 Yemenis are starving to death and 16 million will go hungry this year. They are depending on food assistance to survive, but the war is making it difficult for aid groups to operate in the country. Many more are dying due to preventable diseases as Yemen lacks proper health infrastructure and essential medicines. Blockade and bombing Finding a solution to such a vexed, multipolar conflict will not be easy. But that shouldn’t prevent the international community from taking steps. Their immediate focus should be on tackling the humanitarian situation in Yemen. This week, the UN held a conference to raise up to $2.41 billion for aid works in Yemen, but got pledges only for $1.35 billion, which means the aid operations would be impacted further. Even the limited humanitarian work cannot be sustained if there is no reprieve in the fighting. The last six years of war prove that the Saudi strategy of blockade and bombing was a failure. The Houthis continued to amass weapons, even technologically advanced drones which they use to attack Saudi targets across the border, despite the blockade, while the Yemeni people continue to suffer. The Saudis should ask themselves whether they should continue with a failed strategy while the situation in Yemen keeps worsening. Also, the continued Houthi rocket and drone attacks have left a hole in Saudi Arabia’s national security umbrella. The Houthis are also under pressure. If they want international legitimacy, they should stop fighting and start talking with other stakeholders. A ceasefire is in everybody’s interest but the question is who will blink first. The Biden administration should use its leverage to pressure Riyadh to lift the blockade, a key Houthi demand, as a confidence-building measure and push for talks for a lasting ceasefire. Once a ceasefire between the two main rival blocs is achieved, the U.S. and its regional allies could call for a multilateral conference involving all stakeholders to discuss Yemen’s future. Yemen can find a way out of the current crisis provided the war is brought to an immediate end and the country is given diplomatic assistance. stanly.johny@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ending-the-war-in-yemen/article33993110.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Clearing a low bar||India’s latest auction of telecommunications spectrum is a qualified success from the Centre’s perspective, mainly because the winning bids cumulatively exceeded the government’s own low expectations for receipts from the sale of airwaves. A total of 855.6 megahertz was successfully bid for — out of the 2,308.8 MHz that was on offer — as the three largest telecom services providers sought to optimise their purchases of radio spectrum by seeking to acquire only what they deemed essential airwaves, either as renewal or for strengthening their network, while entirely avoiding costlier bandwidth offerings. The newest entrant to the industry, Reliance Jio, was also the most acquisitive, accounting for close to 60% of the spectrum bought at 488.35 MHz and contributed almost three-fourths of the Rs. 77,815 crore that the Department of Telecommunications garnered from the sale. That Jio’s Rs. 57,123 crore by itself surpassed the government’s estimate of Rs. 45,000-Rs. 50,000 crore for takings from the auction where the reserve price for the entire spectrum on offer across seven bands amounted to about Rs. 3.92-lakh crore, tells its own tale. Clearly cognisant of the prevailing overall economic circumstances amid the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the high level of indebtedness in the industry, the government appears to have tempered its expectations to a more realistic level. Still, the Centre can hardly be sanguine about an outcome where a mere 37% of the airwaves on offer found takers. In a repeat of the 2016 auction’s outcome, the significantly more efficient 700 MHz was yet again shunned by all bidders given its prohibitive reserve price. It is a little hard to fathom the government’s approach to pricing this nationally valuable resource, especially given its avowed intention of accelerating the digitisation of the economy including the broadening and deepening of the digital delivery of the multitude of public services to India’s farthest reaches. The relatively low frequency 700 MHz, for instance, is considered as ideal for enhancing network availability and reach in the highly urbanised settings of large, densely built-up cities where the issue of poor signal penetration inside buildings is a perpetual bugbear for users and providers alike. For all the brave talk on the auction’s outcome providing assurance, the nation’s telecom authorities need to take a hard look at the entire policy framework that has contributed a fair share to the current precarity in the industry. From auction formats that may no longer be relevant given the sharply reduced number of players, to grossly unrealistic pricing of spectrum, and regulatory norms and tax practices that threaten to tip the sector into a fractious duopoly, the government has its task cut out. It must now act quickly to ensure it does not end up hurting the very sector that has become a key multiplier of economic empowerment and progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/clearing-a-low-bar/article33993098.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Efficacious too||Vaccine efficacy of 80.6% for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin at the first interim analysis of phase-3 trials in India is indeed promising, though it took two months for the data to become available after the vaccine was approved for ‘restricted emergency use’ by the Indian drug regulator. The vaccine efficacy was measured based on symptomatic COVID-19 disease — mild, moderate or severe — two weeks after the second dose. The interim analysis undertaken at the first endpoint of 43 COVID-19 cases in the phase-3 trial carried out across 26 sites in India found 36 cases in the placebo group while only seven COVID-19 cases in the arm that received two doses of the vaccine given 28 days apart. The phase-3 trial that began last November recruited 25,800 participants, with one half receiving the vaccine and the other, a placebo. While the phase-3 trial will continue till 130 participants in both groups put together develop COVID-19 disease, another interim analysis will be carried out when there are 87 cases. Covaxin’s efficacy of 80.6% at first interim analysis is higher than AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccine efficacy of 55.1% when the second dose is administered less than six weeks after the first; in India, the second dose of Covishield is approved for four-six weeks after the first. Also, the phase-3 trial recruited 2,433 participants over the age of 60 and included 4,500 people with comorbidities. However, those with severe and/or uncontrolled comorbidities were not recruited. As per the phase-1 data published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases and a preprint of the phase-2 trial, Covaxin appears to be safe and highly immunogenic, and has also been found to be effective against the B.1.1.7 variant first found in Britain. While Covaxin accounts for less than 10% of all COVID-19 vaccinations in India, the absolute number of vaccinations as on March 3 stands at over 1.6 crore. No deaths associated with this vaccine have been reported so far. Though the first interim analysis is based on 43 cases, which is smaller when compared with other vaccines that have been approved by other regulators, the vaccine appears safe and efficacious in phase-3 and early stages of human trials and animal studies. The Indian regulator should therefore revise the restricted emergency use approval such that Covaxin is treated on a par with Covishield and should no longer seek additional precautions in the form of signed consent before vaccination and also remove the label “clinical trial mode” from the approval; their continuation would send a wrong signal about its safety and efficacy. With a narrow window of opportunity available to vaccinate people before a second wave probably sets in or dangerous variants get established, India can ill afford to have roadblocks in the uptake of either vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/efficacious-too/article33993099.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||A year of breathless coaching in science reporting||In February, when the government revived its ritual, the universal immunisation programme, news of two infants dying in Coimbatore, in Tamil Nadu, 24 hours after vaccination, did not create as much noise as it would have, otherwise. This is possibly because people were distracted, even obsessed, with the COVID-19 vaccines. In a sense, the revenge of science is complete. Discussions about viruses and vaccines had been largely confined to closed-door deliberations in scientific institutions, hospital boardrooms, and among the health bureaucracy. Now, all of it has been been dragged into drawing rooms, television debates, social media chatter, on to the roads, and on the lips of children too. It is not as if one could get away from talking about the COVID-19 pandemic; wherever you go, there it is. With India launching the COVID-19 vaccine programme, which is probably the largest logistical exercise of its kind in the world, it is no wonder that vaccine talk is buzzing — people are exchanging side effects stories, comparing vaccination passports, and rolling up a sleeve showing off their deltoid muscle, where they got the shot. It has not always been like this. Health journalists have had to be at it though, even when vaccines were not attention grabbers. There has been enough vaccine news in this country to fuel several newspaper columns; and immunisation has been a key component of every State’s public health programme. The oral polio vaccination drive, with the involvement of the Rotary Club, was among the flagship immunisation programmes in India. It was a resounding success, but not without blimps and moments of anxiety, questions of efficacy, and vaccine hesitancy. Public health advocacy has always put the media at the centre of any vaccine hesitancy debate. Panic reporting has often led to greater vaccine hesitancy in public immunisation programmes, studies show. But reporting on adverse effects following immunisation is like having to walk a high wire, with journalists trespassing into areas where independent verification of the causes of adverse incidents or even access to the key elements in the case is not possible. Pockets in the country have traditionally been suspicious of vaccines and the media has played a role in the massive awareness drives that were conducted across the country, to pull up coverage and achieve immunisation and pathogen eradication targets. Vaccine-related severe adverse events and deaths have been reported from time to time diligently by the media — sometimes, not very responsibly. But children’s immunisation has dominated the coverage; adult immunisation, though significant, has received very marginal coverage. COVID-19 highlighted true vaccine hesitancy as never before in the country. With people consuming everything (including what comes unverified on WhatsApp), the task of health journalists has become more intense. They have seldom been busier, trying to catch up with the multiple and myriad aspects of vaccination and in this case, given the extraordinary circumstances of the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, highlighting clinical phases, following the entire life cycle from lab to the field, and then on to patients, all in a pace that approximates breathlessness. In a sense, all of 2020 has been the treadmill test version of coaching in science reporting. What it has taught health journalists about vaccines and one virus are precious lessons for a career.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-year-of-breathless-coaching-in-science-reporting/article33993109.ece

Retired Judge and Member of the Legislative Assembly writes:- Sir - There is a general feeling among thoughtful men that portions of Hindu Law as administered by our Courts are not in keeping with the spirit of the times we live in. Excepting a few ultra conservative thinkers, every one recognises that it is no disrespect to the memory of the promulgators of the great system of law we have inherited that we should attempt to reform some parts of it. The Hindu Law which we follow is not wholly as Manu enjoined, nor as the later Smriti writers have reproduced it. For the most part, what we follow to-day is what has been evolved out of the Smriti by great commentators who with a view to engraft new ideas in accordance with the custom they had grown up in their times have attributed to the language of Smriti meanings which, in some cases at least, neither logic nor grammar warrants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/hindu-law/article33993107.ece

At the Arattavadi polling centre in Chengam constituency many Lambadi women were seen eager to exercise their franchise. A large number of tribals also came to Chengam for casting their votes. At Singarampalayam in Kinathukadavu Assembly constituency (of Coimbatore district), Karuppan, a 110-year-old blind peasant, refused to take his great grandson’s help in casting his vote to-day. The great grandson carried the old man upto his polling booth. From there on, he flatly rejected the youth’s assistance. Instead, he asked the official on duty to explain the order of the symbols on the ballot paper and then, walking into the booth, marked his preference carefully before dropping the paper into the box. Karuppan explained later that the ballot was secret and that he, as an old man, had to set an example to younger people in maintaining this secrecy. K. Thangavelu, stated to be a polling agent, was found snoring under the influence of liquor in a police station in Pollachi constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/no-vote-without-money/article33993108.ece
05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Fuel prices to drop if brought under GST, says SBI Research||Bringing petrol and diesel under the GST regime could lead to a loss of as little as Rs. 1 lakh crore in annual revenue for the Centre and States while bringing pan-India prices of the fuels to Rs. 75 and Rs. 68 a litre, respectively, as per an SBI Research report. With pump prices of petrol crossing the Rs. 100-per-litre mark in some States, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das had expressed hope for a ‘calibrated and co-ordinated reduction’ in the high taxes levied by the Centre and States on fuels. Tax revenue Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said last week that the Centre and States needed to discuss fuel taxes as they were a major source of tax revenue. Assuming a GST rate of 28%, cess of Rs. 30 and Rs. 20 for a litre of petrol and diesel respectively (shared equally between the Centre and the States), crude oil price of $60 per barrel and a rupee-dollar exchange rate of 73, SBI Research has reckoned the Centre and States would, together, face a revenue deviation from Budget estimates of only Rs. 1 lakh crore, or 0.4% of the GDP, in FY22. The report has adjusted for a rise in consumption if the fuel prices are reduced and assumed a 10% growth in petrol and 15% rise in diesel consumption in 2021-22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/fuel-prices-to-drop-if-brought-under-gst-says-sbi-research/article33993088.ece

The deal, once completed, is expected to help the Indian IT services provider gain a firmer foothold and presence in the European market, especially in the financial services industry where the U.K. firm has an established clientele. “Wipro and Capco share complementary business models and core guiding values,” Wipro’s CEO and MD Thierry Delaporte said in a statement. “Together, we can deliver high-end consulting and technology transformations, and operations offerings to our clients,” he added. The Capco purchase, which will be the Indian company’s biggest-ever acquisition, comes barely eight months after Wipro hired Mr. Delaporte from Capgemini to help the company recover its erstwhile position among India’s top three IT services providers. Capco immediately fills Wipro’s need to raise the profile of its financial services in Europe, observed Phil Fersht, chief technology analyst and CEO of U.K.-based HFS Research. “This is exactly the type of acquisition I expected Thierry to make and expect more to follow as he looks to attack the BFSI sector,’’ he added. Capco has more than 5,000 consultants and offers digital and technology services to banking and financial institutions across the U.S. Europe and Asia Pacific. The acquisition is expected to close by June 30, subject to regulatory approvals. “Under Thierry, Wipro is taking an acquisitive posture and is likely to be adding more scale and capability through acquisitions over the next year or two,’’ said Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO, Everest Group, a Dallas-based research firm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/wipro-to-buy-uk-consulting-firm-capco-for-145-billion/article33993084.ece

Palm oil imports from Malaysia and Indonesia, for soap manufacturing, have become very costly, according to Vineet Agrawal, CEO. “Prices of palm oil have gone up significantly plus import costs have gone up, too, as international freight charges are unusually high now with no signs of them becoming better,’’ he said. Key ingredient Palm oil is one of the key ingredients in all variants of soaps under the company’s flagship brands Santoor, with an annual sales of more than Rs. 2,000 crore, Hygienix and Yardley. According to Mr. Agrawal, the company has plans to rationalise its product portfolio comprising sanitisers, handwashes, surface sanitisers, floor cleaners and surface wipes by reducing the number of SKUs (stock keeping units) while retaining all segments.

VIL has bought spectrum to cover minor gaps in five circles for Rs. 1,993.4 crore, while Bharti Airtel shelled out nearly Rs. 18,700 crore for 355.45 MHz radio waves and Reliance Jio Rs. 57,123 crore for 488.35 MHz spectrum.  “VIL’s positioning may possibly worsen as other operators will be able to enhance their coverage and capacity further post acquisition of additional spectrum in the recent round,” a note by Kotak Institutional Equities said. The deft moves by Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio in shoring up their spectrum holding will allow the two telcos to enhance their user experience further, “compounding woes for VIL.”  As per the Telecom Department, VIL has bought 5.8 MHz spectrum in 900-band and 6 MHz in the 1800-band.

05 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||England’s batting comes unstuck against quality spin yet again||The nature of the pitch changed drastically from last week’s dust-bowl. The colour of the ball returned to conventional cherry red from experimental pink. The turnout was more modest than the 40,000-plus spectators who thronged Motera on the opening day of the third Test. Despite the changing trends on all these counts, England’s lacklustre show against quality spin remained a constant. In spite of winning the toss in the series-concluding fourth Test, the touring side folded for 205 on the opening day. The spin trio of R. Ashwin, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar shared eight wickets to put India in a commanding position at the Narendra Modi Stadium. James Anderson — the lone specialist pacer in England’s attack, with Stuart Broad making way for off-spinner Dom Bess and Jofra Archer unavailable due to a recurrence of his elbow injury — trapped Shubman Gill lbw for a blob in the opening over. He also bowled five maidens on the trot. But Rohit Sharma and Cheteshwar Pujara saw the day out without further damage, India ending on 24 for one. If the home batsmen ensure, on day two, that they don’t repeat the mistakes their counterparts made on Thursday, they will put their side in a strong position to seal a spot in the final of the World Test Championship. England did not fare well against the spin onslaught. If Axar had struck with his first ball after being introduced into the attack last week, it took the lanky left-arm spinner two deliveries to make inroads this time around, after Virat Kohli threw the ball to him at the start of the sixth over. Dom Sibley yet again had no answers to a straight one that took the inside edge and crashed into the stumps. In the next over, Axar beat Zak Crawley in flight, and it resulted in the opener’s attempt to clear mid-off settling in the hands of Mohammed Siraj. Siraj, the seamer, then justified his inclusion over the seasoned Umesh Yadav by beating Joe Root with pace. At 30 for three, England was in danger of another collapse, but Ben Stokes played fluently with able support from Jonny Bairstow. Just when the partnership seemed to have stabilised the innings, Siraj struck, soon after lunch, jagging one back into Bairstow to win another lbw decision. The spinners then took over, with Washington finding Stokes in no-man’s land in the last half hour of the second session. Before committing the fatal error, Stokes not only raised his fifty but also played some delightful strokes. While the left-handed batsman welcomed Ashwin into the attack with a six over long-off, the whip after using his feet against his nemesis was one of the shots of the day. At 144 for five at tea, despite England bolstering the batting with Dan Lawrence at No. 7, it was inevitable that India would bat on the opening day itself. Axar and Ashwin shared the remaining five wickets, as England crossed the 200-run mark before being dismissed about 75 minutes into the evening session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/englands-batting-comes-unstuck-against-quality-spin-yet-again/article33993191.ece

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||‘It’s fantastic joining a side like CSK’||On the day M.S. Dhoni landed in Chennai, a former teammate of his spoke of how he was looking forward to his reunion with captain fantastic. A young Robin Uthappa, less than a year into international cricket, was one of the key members of the Indian team that won the inaugural World T20 in South Africa in 2007. The tournament was also the beginning of Dhoni's successful journey as India’s skipper. Secret desire Fourteen long years later, Uthappa is glad that he would be playing under Dhoni once again, at Chennai Super Kings. “It has been a secret desire for me to play alongside — and not against — MS before he retired and I am delighted that it is coming to fruition,” Uthappa told The Hindu . “And it's fantastic joining a championship-winning side like CSK.” He hopes he will be able to open at the upcoming IPL. “In the last three IPLs I hadn't got to to play in that position,” Uthappa said. “Opening comes naturally to me. If I open the batting, I know I can win matches for my team.” He showed that, yet again, in the league phase of the Vijay Hazare Trophy one-day tournament at Bengaluru recently. With scores of 107, 81, 100, 0 and 87 not out, he led Kerala’s march to the quarterfinals. Quickfire knock The unbeaten 87 against Bihar had come off just 32 balls. It was imperative for Kerala to reach the target quickly if it wanted to entertain hopes of qualifying for the knockouts for the first time in eight years. “When I went out to bat with Vishnu Vinod, we didn’t know in exactly how many overs we needed to win, but the team management was able to tell us — after making so many calls and calculations — at the lunch time,” he said. “We thought we should bat as if we are in a T20 match.” Uthappa, along with Vishnu and Sanju Samson, batted as if it was a T10 match, as Kerala knocked off 149 in 8.5 overs. sHe now wants to take that form forward for the quarterfinals, in which Kerala will take on Karnataka — his former team — in New Delhi on March 9. “Even before joining the Kerala squad, I felt the team had tremendous potential,” he said. “But we cannot call ourselves a champion team unless we win a championship.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/its-fantastic-joining-a-side-like-csk/article33993399.ece

How fortunes turn! The feat came in the sixth over of a bizarre West Indies innings, bowled by off-spinner Akila Dananjaya who in his previous over had been celebrating a hat-trick. Pollard followed in the footsteps of South Africa’s Herschelle Gibbs against the Netherlands in the 2007 World Cup and India’s Yuvraj Singh, who also achieved the feat in the 2007 Twenty20 World Cup against England. Pollard was eventually out for 38 off 11 balls as the West Indies chased down 132 to win, reaching the target in the 14th over when Jason Holder clobbered his side’s 13th six. “I felt I could hit six sixes after the third one,” said 33-year-old Pollard. “Once I had five sixes I knew I had the bowler on the back foot. He was going around the wicket and it was difficult for him. I just told myself: ‘Go for it’.” Sri Lanka, bidding to win a match for the first time in a year, made a below-par 131 for nine after being put in.  The scores: Sri Lanka 131/9 in 20 overs (N. Dickwella 33, P. Nissanka 39) lost to West Indies 134/6 in 13.1 overs (L. Simmons 26, E. Lewis 28, K. Pollard 38, J. Holder 29 n.o., A. Dananjaya 3 /62, incl. a hat-trick, W.

05 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Siraj delighted with Root ‘set-up’||He may have been playing only his fifth Test, but with the rich experience at domestic and India-A level over the last five years, Mohammed Siraj has appeared a mature pacer ever since his debut in Australia. This maturity — and no little skill — was amply evident on Thursday in the manner in which he dismissed Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow. Siraj enjoyed both wickets, especially that of the England captain. “I thought it was a nice set-up,” he said. “I had bowled away-going deliveries to Root in my previous over. When I was coming for the fresh over, I decided to try an incoming ball. It came out as I planned and I was able to hit Root’s pads. It gave me a lot of joy.” Soon after lunch, Siraj broke the partnership between Ben Stokes and Bairstow by getting a quick delivery to move in a little bit and rap the latter’s pads. “I had seen some of his videos and gathered that he is troubled by incoming balls. So when I got a chance to bowl to him after the interval, I decided to try that. The ball tailed in as planned and I had the wicket,” he said. Besides earning the prized scalps, Siraj was also involved in a verbal duel with Stokes after a well-directed bouncer in the morning session. The bouncer was followed by Stokes retorting with pleasantries, but Siraj tried his best to downplay the exchange: “Stokes exchanged a few words with me but it happens on the ground. I told [Virat] Kohli and he took care of the issue.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/siraj-delighted-with-root-set-up/article33993192.ece

05 March 2021||KOLKATA,||LaLiga places net financial loss at €1bn||LaLiga clubs have suffered a net loss of around €1 billion in the previous seasons due to the pandemic, according to Javier Tebas, president of the top Spanish league. Speaking to the world media, Tebas, who was also accompanied by LaLiga’s corporate general director Jose Guerra, said that unlike other prominent leagues in Europe, Spanish clubs will be able to recover faster because of the economic control put in place by the league. The two felt that Spain’s professional clubs would require around five years to recover from the debts they have accumulated because of the pandemic related losses. “COVID-19 has had a considerable impact on incomes in the professional football industry but LaLiga has absorbed the impact better than other European leagues and industries,” said Tebas. “The reason behind this has been the LaLiga’s economic control which has been in place for the previous six seasons. Added to this is the great effort and responsibility of the clubs in limiting their spending and the maintenance of health protocols that allowed the competition to be completed,” he added. “Putting together all the figures, we have calculated that the net loss professional football suffered in Spain has been around €1 billion. So, the COVID-19 impact will extend till five years in which time they will pay off around €250 million every year to recover,” said Guerra. Financial backing “The clubs have the backing of financial institutions and there will be no case of non-payment of loans before the clubs are able to recover,” he added Guerra said that the LaLiga helped 11 second division clubs gain a total assistance of €62 million from financial institutions to tide over the existing financial crisis. “These clubs will have five years to pay up the loans. This proves that the financial institutions have complete faith in the football industry in Spain,” he said.

05 March 2021||KOCHI,||Neeraj-Shivpal showdown the highlight||There is a buzz of excitement as top javelin star Neeraj Chopra opens his season in Friday’s Indian Grand Prix-3 in Patiala. And Asian silver medallist Shivpal Singh hopes to give the Asian Games champion a strong fight. Surprisingly, the two have not competed against each other in a long time. “The 2016 Grand Prix in Delhi was the last time we competed together and Neeraj won with 79.54m and I did 79.34. “Of course, we competed in the 2018 Asian Games but I had an elbow injury then,” Shivpal, who like Chopra has already qualified for the Tokyo Olympics, told The Hindu on Thursday. So, what could one expect on the morrow, 86m...or perhaps an 87? “May be 89m but it will all depend on how my body reacts and how the weather is. But I’m sure it will a good throw, I’m expecting a personal best,” said Shivpal. “Neeraj is doing good too, so it will be a big competition.” That should make the javelin throw the IGP’s prime event. But another event, the women’s 100m, which had the potential to light Patiala, will be a tame affair with World University Games champion Dutee Chand pulling out. And though top coaches feel that the country could qualify for the Olympics in the women’s 4x100m relay, the 100m will have just two runners, Hima Das and Amrit Kaur. Archana, Jabir out Archana Suseendran, who was a part of the 4x100m relay team which finished fourth in the 2019 Asian championship, is down with a hamstring problem. M.P. Jabir, the Asian 400m hurdles bronze medallist who is likely to make it to Tokyo on the strength of his world rankings, is also down with a hamstring injury. Quartermiler V.K. Vismaya will be another prominent name missing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neeraj-shivpal-showdown-the-highlight/article33993389.ece
05 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sharath’s loss ends India’s challenge||World No 7 Yun-Ji Lun defeated Sharath Kamal 11-6, 11-4, 11-8 in the second round to end India’s campaign in the World Table Tennis Contender event in Doha on Thursday. “I just could not get any rhythm today and he simply out-hit me,” was Sharath’s candid admission to The Hindu after the match against the Chinese Taipei No. 1. “The only chance I got to get close came in the third game but he was simply superior today.” The day also saw an injured G. Sathiyan and Sutirtha Mukherjee give a walkover in the mixed doubles first round to the French pair Emmanuel Lebesson and Jia Nan Yuan. Late on Wednesday, Sathiyan and Sharath lost the men’s doubles first round to the Argentine pair of Horacio Cifuentes and Gaston Alto 14-12, 11-7, 11-3. After the match Sathiyan said, “I just could not get my shots in because of an injured shoulder. “I suffered the injury in the recent National championship final (against Sharath Kamal). I took injections and painkillers but they did not help.” May skip doubles To recover faster for the bigger matches ahead, including the Olympic qualifiers, Sathiyan was contemplating pulling out from the men’s doubles and mixed doubles events of the WTT Star Contender, beginning on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sharaths-loss-ends-indias-challenge/article33993231.ece
05 March 2021||London,||United, Leicester stumble again||As a gruelling and intense Premier League season heads toward its conclusion, Manchester United and Leicester are stumbling their way toward Champions League qualification. United has completely lost its attacking spark, with a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace on Wednesday at a fog-shrouded Selhurst Park making it three straight goalless stalemates in all competitions for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team. Rodgers not too unhappy Leicester also had to make do with a point, drawing 1-1 at Burnley, though manager Brendan Rodgers wasn’t too unhappy considering his growing injury list. United and Leicester remain second and third, respectively, but have won just five of their last 16 league games combined. They are giving their top-four rivals a big opportunity to reel them in, with West Ham, Chelsea, Liverpool and Everton all within eight points of United and having games in hand. Sheffield United’s players aren’t leaving the Premier League without a fight. Chris Wilder’s last-place team held on after a 57th-minute red card to veteran centre back Phil Jagielka to beat Aston Villa 1-0. With 11 games left, Sheffield United is 12 points from safety so securing a third straight season in the top flight remains highly unlikely. The players aren’t giving up, though. AC Milan’s Franck Kessie scored a penalty with the last kick of the game to rescue a 1-1 draw against Udinese on Wednesday, a result that hands Inter Milan a big opportunity to gain ground in the Serie A title race. Milan has picked up four points from its last four league games.  The results:   Premier League: Burnley 1 (Vydra 4) drew with Leicester 1 (Iheanacho 34); Sheffield United 1 (McGoldrick 30) bt Aston Villa 0.   Crystal Palace 0 drew with Manchester United 0.   Serie A: Sassuolo 3 (Maksimovic 36-og, Berardi 45+1-pen, Caputo 90+5-pen) drew with Napoli 3 (Zielinski 38, Di Lorenzo 72, Insigne 90-pen).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/united-leicester-stumble/article33993233.ece

05 March 2021||Chennai,||Dhoni arrives ahead of CSK practice||The Chennai Super Kings cricketers have gradually begun arriving in the city for training ahead of the upcoming IPL, tentatively set to begin in the second week of April. CSK icon and skipper M.S. Dhoni is here. He and the other available cricketers from the franchise have gone into a quarantine after which they will enter the ‘bubble.’ Following a disappointing last edition of the IPL, the influential Dhoni has to lift the morale of the side and get the wheels of the machine moving again.  Till last season, CSK was a mean machine. The men in yellow, with some new younger faces, have to rediscover their high-octane ways. CSK CEO K.S. Viswanathan told The Hindu on Thursday, “The cricketers will be confined to their hotel rooms now. They will begin training only on March 9.” Viswanathan added, “Apart from Dhoni, the other CSK cricketers here are Ambati Rayudu, Ruturaj Gaikwad, N. Jagadeesan, Sai Kishore, and Hari Nishaanth.” Gradually, the other players franchise will join the camp after a period of quarantine. Viswanathan said, “The international cricketers from the CSK, if they were already in a bubble, need not have to be quarantined. They can directly enter the bubble.” Breaking the bubble, will CSK rise again?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dhoni-arrives-ahead-of-csk-practice/article33993681.ece

We are more than capable of scoring at least 300 on a wicket like that out here. [It is] frustrating but we can't dwell on it too much and it was nice to get a wicket at the end of the day,” he said. When asked if it was hard to shake off the impact of the losses in the last two matches, Stokes said, “We sit down as a group and say we will try to put it behind us, but it is easier said than done. It is a much better wicket than the last one we played on, so we are just disappointed not to still be batting.” Stokes, who top-scored with a fighting 55, said he was disappointed not to make a big one after being trapped leg-before by Washington Sundar. “Frustrated that I spent two-and-a-half hours trying to avoid getting out to a straight ball and then I ended up getting out to a straight ball.”  I have played 70 odd games and this is the hardest conditions I have faced as a batsman||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/disappointed-not-to-still-be-batting/article33993194.ece

The first-leg clash on Friday will pit MCFC coach Sergio Lobera against his former employer, yet again. The Islanders on Sunday became the second team to lift the ISL Shield after edging out ATK Mohun Bagan on head-to-head record. Meanwhile, few gave the Gaurs a chance to make the last-four after they had just eight points in their opening seven games. But from there, Juan Ferrando’s side went 13 matches unbeaten. “We started the season with uneven results but have entered the playoffs now. The next match will be a challenge because of injuries and cards, but I see it as another opportunity to continue improving,” Ferrando said. Mumbai was one of the favourites this time. The team claimed its first ever title with some eye-catching football. “I think we deserved to win the shield, and hopefully, we can achieve another trophy. Facing Goa won’t make any difference for me. Whichever team we face, we have to win the semifinal. It will be a tough game,” claimed Lobera. Goa will be without four players — Brandon Fernandes and Seriton Fernandes (injuries), Alberto Noguera and Ivan Gonzalez (suspensions) — for the first leg. Amey Ranawade is out for Mumbai after picking up his fourth booking, while Boumous will return after serving a four-game suspension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fc-goa-locks-horns-with-mcfc/article33993396.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||He is the source of all||In the Gita, the Lord clearly states that those who understand the deep significance of His incarnations will get relieved from samsara. What better way to understand the variety and magnitude of the Lord’s avatars captured with great insight in Azhwars’ pasurams? In a discourse, Sri K. Madhavan Kidambi drew attention to Tirumazhisai Azhwar’s description of the Lord’s Kurma avatar wherein the overall effect of His Paratva and Saulabhya is explicit. One is able to easily understand and recognise this not only as a matter of reason and logic but also as an experience to be cherished in one’s inner understanding. Once, the celestial beings seek His help to regain their wealth, resources and glory that they had lost owing to Durvasa’s curse. He suggests that the Parkadal be churned to obtain amrita, the divine nectar. In the form of the tortoise, He supports the Mandara Mountain on His back when it is used as a churning rod with the snake Vasuki as the rope. He also holds the mountain from top to prevent it from toppling. While the devas and the asuras are engaged in this act, thinking it is their effort, Azhwar says that it is the Lord who makes all this possible. During Rama avatar, He creates the impression that the killing of Ravana was made possible because of the might of the vanaras and hides His Paratva under wraps. Such is His penchant for those who seek His grace. With their wealth restored and strengthened by the grace of Lakshmi, Indra and others were appeased and happy. Azhwar also shows how the celestial beings failed to seek Him who is the greatest nectar ever and who alone is to be worshipped with single minded devotion. Azhwar will worship only Him and none else. For, all beings derive their graces from Him alone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/he-is-the-source-of-all/article33993185.ece

But from September last year, we have seen a high demand from customers aged 45-plus,” he says. Sales of Good Fettle, which sells low-sugar and non-sugar ice creams in 10 flavours in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Bengaluru, have gone up by three times in that period, adds Ayush. He is not alone — Minus 30 co-founder Shivani Mirchandani also speaks of a spurt in demand for her vegan and sugar-free range. “We saw a huge increase as soon as the lockdown first began, and thankfully managed to get an operating licence within 10 to 12 days,” she says over call from Delhi. She adds, “Our vegan and sugar-free range usually sells well, either outperforming or staying on a par with our regular gelatos. But we have received customer feedback asking for more flavours in that range, and have some under testing now.” Business post-lockdown has been good enough for Minus 30 to begin 2021 on a positive note, opening up a Mumbai office in January to deliver directly to consumers across the city. The company already has two manufacturing units, one in Delhi and a second in Chennai where it entered in 2019, and also distributes to select retail stores in parts of Gujarat, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. “Our base is stronger in Delhi, but just because we have been here for longer,” adds Shivani. And then there is Get-A-Whey, the Mumbai-based whey ice cream brand that has steadily been making inroads into Tier I and Tier II cities for years, 2020’s lockdowns notwithstanding. Good Fettle too, plans to expand more in Bengaluru and Delhi this year, and also enter the Pune market. The brand already has an exclusive partnership with Cult.Fit, which operates 10 cloud kitchens within Bengaluru alone. The spike in popularity of these health-based ice cream brands, however, cannot be chalked up to pandemic-triggered health consciousness alone. Ayush, for instance, is more inclined to thank the lockdowns and how they changed the social media behaviour of people above the age of 45. Stating that most of Good Fettle’s marketing is digital, he surmises: “I am assuming that they [his new customer base] have been spending more time on Facebook than usual, and so noticed more of these desserts that are keeping with their health concerns. People of that age group are less wary of online marketing gimmicks than millennials or Gen Z, and more likely to try out new things they see online.” His theory is backed up by the involvement levels that Good Fettle has noticed on its social media ads. “They don’t explore much; don’t bother downloading our menu or visiting our website,” says Ayush. “They see the ad, hit the call button, and just place their order.” Click here for dessert Convenience was another factor that helped boost sales, especially in the months when most consumers were either too scared or not allowed to step out of home. Ice cream, after all, is a thing of whims, cravings and fancies. Shivani says, “We offer same-day delivery in Delhi, and though we do state ‘next-day delivery’ for Chennai and Mumbai, those orders usually reach on the same day as well.” Adds Ayush, “Now that small meetings and home get-togethers are happening again, we see a lot of orders for our 500 ml family packs. Many people who still prefer cooking their meals at home, don’t mind ordering desserts from outside, especially if you can have cartons of ice cream delivered to your home within 30 or 40 minutes.”  Good Fettle plans to expand more in Bengaluru and Delhi this year, and also enter the Pune market||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/scooping-up-treats-and-whey/article33993373.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Regal repasts||‘I don’t measure a thing when I cook… I just sprinkle and add stuff until I hear the spirit of my ancestors’ whisper, “That’s enough, child.”’ This statement, which appears early in Rohini Rana’s The Rana Cookbook: Recipes from the Palaces of Nepal , is not attributed, but resonates with someone who has grown up watching magic being turned out in the kitchen. The book itself is redolent of another time: an opulent, grand era that does not exist anymore. Rohini, the wife of General Gaurav SJB Rana (former chief of army staff, Nepalese Army), recalls her “maternal uncle sitting in the verandah, ceremoniously cooking one dish for Sunday lunch, with a line of retainers waiting eagerly to hand him a ladle or some errant ingredient that had escaped his notice. My mother and brother followed the same ritual and the execution would be full of excitement and fun.” Another fond memory is of the family sitting around the dining table, after finishing lunch and planning the dinner. She admits to still getting “excited and very involved in planning menus for occasions or family gatherings”. Before diving into the recipes, Rohini gives the reader a quick peek into the history of Nepal and the Ranas in particular. She does not shy away from talking about problematic issues like the casteist nature of certain practices, or hunting. As she says, “It belonged to ‘THAT’ time and should remain ‘THERE’.” She also points out that the lifestyle of the Ranas was feudal and that both nobles and commoners hunted for the table. The recipes are divided into sections: Rice, Mutton, Wild Game, Fish, Pickles, Herbs and Spices and more. Each section gets a little introductory note stating its place in the Rana cuisine. Main dishes and snacks made with the meat of the wild boar get one section, as it “occupied a very prestigious position in the Rana cuisine.” In the section on fish, readers are informed that it was eaten only during the day, so that the bones could be detected easily. Rohini describes the process of gathering these as “a labour of love. “My husband's nanny, Chiniya Champa Didi, taught me everything I know about Nepali cooking.” She also got members of her extended family to contribute recipes. Since most people cooked from instinct and practice, rather than from written recipes, she had to keep asking them to measure the spices and ingredients. “I documented the recipes while the dish was being cooked, measuring each ingredient, trying the dish multiple times till it tasted just right,” writes Rana. Though she started work on this book quite early, Rohini took 25 years to publish it as family responsibilities took precedence. She feels it is important to preserve and document old recipes and practices before they are lost with the passing of the older generation of Rana ladies and retainers. She even offers suggestions on adapting the cookery for today’s methods and gadgets. However, she insists on authenticity, “since one is trying to retain old flavours.” Deviations from the original would mean loss of the authentic flavour, she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/regal-repasts/article33993376.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Speaking up first||I am:Mary Wollstonecraft. Writer, educator, a radical thinker; a ‘feminist’, though the word wasn’t known in my time! The beginning:I was born on April 27, 1759, in Spitalfields, London. Early lessons:My father lost the family fortune due to bad investments. Though I lacked a formal education, I read widely, was curious and questioned everything. I also taught myself French, German and Dutch. A few things I did first:At 25, with my sisters and a friend, I set up a girls’ boarding school. After it failed, I worked as a governess. I decided to support myself as a writer, and began writing for the Analytical Review . It was unusual then for a woman to be a writer, and so I was the ‘First of A New Genus!’ Friends who mattered:Fanny Blood, a dear friend of my youth; Jane Arden, an educator; her father John, a philosopher; Richard Price, a minister known for his ‘dissenting’ views; and Joseph Johnson, my publisher. My first book: Thoughts on the Education of Daughters , appeared in 1787. This is an early self-help book. I believed that women being primary caregivers as mothers and teachers needed to be educated. I also wrote: Original Stories from Real Life (1788), my only work of children’s literature, and Vindication of the Rights of Men written in 1790, about the French Revolution of 1789. I wrote novels too — Mary: A Fiction and Maria: the Wrongs of Women . My Most Famous Work: Vindication of the Rights of Women . Published in 1792, it is read even today. I insisted again that education is important for a woman and that the school curriculum had to change to suit a woman’s place in society. I also argued that, besides civil and political rights, women needed elected representatives of their own. It would be another 100 years and more before this became possible! Something interesting:I wrote a travel book-cum-memoir in 1796, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway and Denmark . My daughter, Mary Shelley, wrote one of the first science-fiction books. Frankenstein features a scientist who creates a humanoid who, not finding acceptance among human beings, becomes truly monstrous. Some things I said:“It is justice, not charity, that is wanting in the world!” “Strengthen the female mind by enlarging it, and there will be an end to blind obedience.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/speaking-up-first/article33993993.ece

But homework was not one of them. “I don’t mind normal homework,” he explained to Raghav. “But when teachers ask us to do difficult things, it’s too much!” Raghav, who knew all about Abhi’s hatred for homework, asked, “What is bothering you now?” “Writing about women who inspire,” Abhi groaned. “You know what that means, right? Everyone will rush to look for information about inspiring women on the Internet!” “You can do that too!” Raghav said. “I don’t want to write about the same freedom fighters that everyone else will write about!” Abhi said. “I want to write about someone different; someone who has done something really inspiring!” Look around you Raghav, who could sometimes be unsympathetic, said, “So, who’s stopping you?” “Where,” asked Abhi dramatically, “am I going to find such women?” “In your house,” Raghav said. “In my house?” Abhi was stunned. “But the only women there are my Aji and Ai! What would I write about them?” “Wasn’t your grandmother a scientist?” Raghav asked. “But that was years ago,” Abhi objected. “So what?’ Raghav said. “That’s inspiring! Imagine, she was a scientist when few women worked! And your mother writes stories for children, doesn’t she?” “Yes, she writes for newspapers and stuff. She’s also published books for children.” “That’s awesome!” Raghav grinned. “You now have two inspiring women to write about!” Raghav’s words made Abhi think. His father had told him many stories about how Aji had been a scientist and travelled around the world to give lectures. In fact, Aji was still invited to talk at colleges. And Ai? For as long as Abhi could remember, his mother had been writing. One shelf in the living room was stuffed with the books she had written. People were always writing to tell her how much they had enjoyed her writing. But, Abhi frowned, they were just his mother and grandmother. He had never thought of them as women who inspired others. “If you don’t want to write about them, I will,” Raghav said. “No!” Abhi said at once. “I am going to write about them.” “You are lucky to have two inspiring women to write about,” Raghav said. Yes, Abhi thought in surprise, he was lucky to have them. Why had he never noticed them? Or appreciated what they did? He felt small and silly. “Who are you writing about?” he asked Raghav. But before the latter could reply, Abhi broke in excitedly, “Your sister. Didn’t she form a group to clean up our park?” “Yes,” Raghav smiled. “Now she and my mother help children with their studies. And when that’s done, Amma coaches the parents. So, I too have two inspiring women to write about!” “We are fortunate to have so many inspiring women around us!” said Abhi, and Raghav agreed.

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||The man behind the Konark festival||As we arrived at Konark Natya Mandap, the venue of the 35th annual Konark Dance and Music Festival in Odisha, held over the past fortnight, we found people pausing for a moment at the entrance to offer prayers at a memorial before taking their seats. This memorial is dedicated to Guru Gangadhar Pradhan, who, for 25 years, used to stand with folded hands at this very entrance every day of the festival as he welcomed audience, artistes and guests. Founder of the popular festival, which he curated, Guru Pradhan also established the Konark Natya Mandap.  “After his untimely death a decade ago, the festival continues to celebrate his vision and artistic values. Legendary artistes such as Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Vyjayanthimala Bali, Ustad Zakir Hussain, Yamini Krishnamurthy, Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia and Vikku Vinayakram, who have been the recipients of Guru Gangadhar Pradhan Lifetime Achievement Award, have supported and performed during the last 10 editions,” says Gurupada Baliarsingh, joint secretary, Konark Natya Mandap. Aesthetic setting  Barely two kilometres from the stunning Sun Temple stands the Konark Natya Mandap on some sand dunes nestled amidst casuarina groves. A replica of the Konark temple, it provides a perfect ambience for the dance and music festival that is held here every February. In an earlier interaction, Guru Pradhan had told me, “When I started Konark Natya Mandap and the annual festival here, my objective was to promote and project the rich cultural heritage of my state to those visiting Konark and Puri from all over the world. I wanted to set up a gurukul to train youngsters.” Not just an amazing guru and choreographer, he had a remarkable sense of visualisation too. The three-tier stage that can accommodate about 200 dancers at a time is proof of that. Guruji is said to have altered the design six times before arriving at the final one. Son of a poor farmer, Gangadhar Pradhan was offered at the age of five to a village temple to serve as a Gotipua dancer. He stayed in the temple for 10 years. When he was 25, he established the globally renowned Orissa Dance Academy in Bhubaneshwar. And by the time he was 30, he had already acquired the land for his dream project, the Konark Natya Mandap. His only precious possession then was a bicycle and he used to make a living by teaching dance and accompanying dancers on the mardal (percussion instrument). “When we shifted from Bhubaneswar to Konark with our children, there was no habitation around this site. We put up a thatched hut on the small piece of land given by my mother and stayed in it. Guruji would hardly sleep or eat well those days. He would often wake up in the middle of the night and walk around immersed in his thoughts. It worried me; I did not know what was on his mind,” says Sulochana Pradhan, guruji’s wife. Despite no financial backing and support, Gangadhar Pradhan did not give up his plan. Recalling the first festival, Guru Pradhan once said, “It is etched in my memory. It was on an open-air stage of brick and mud. The artistes found it extremely difficult to perform on it. But such was our spirit that the 10 dancers and seven singers, including Ileana Citaristi from Italy, and the small audience were oblivious to it all, being immersed in pride and delight.” His close associates remember how late Odissi exponent Sanjukta Panigrahi asked him to cancel the festival the year his mother was diagnosed with cancer and use the money for her treatment, but guruji refused. He often skipped overseas tours for the festival, even though that resulted in monetary loss. When he was appointed as a visiting faculty at Cornell University, U.S., he used the Rs. 12 lakh grant he received to buy land for the Natya Mandap rather than build himself a house. A recipient of the Padma Shri, the Sangeet Natak Akademi award, an honorary doctorate from Utkal University, Odisha, and honorary citizenship from some countries, Guru Pradhan not just promoted classical dance but all genres of Indian art, especially the lesser known ones. . “He was the first to offer a platform for Odisha’s indigenous percussion instrument mardal, which was till then seen only as an accompanying instrument for Odissi,” says noted mardal exponent Guru Dhaneswar Swain. Similarly, he was also the first to introduce Assam’s Sattriya dance to Odisha through his festival. Like the arts, his audiences were treated equally. At the festival, there were no reserved seats, and villagers and invited guests all sat next to each other. The famous community dinner he organised during the festival saw audiences and artistes sitting on the floor to eat the Odia food served on banana leaves by the villagers, who also worked as volunteers at the festival.  It was the spectacular success of Guru Gangadhar’s Konark festival that prompted the Odisha Government to launch its own famed flagship festival, the Konark Utsav.  “A day should not pass without a performance happening at Konark Natya Mandap,” Guru Gangadhar had told his disciples. And they have kept it going. Music and dance are the daily offerings to the presiding deity, Lord Balunkeswara. The day he passed away, the Gotipuas performed his favourite composition, ‘Ame Odiare Ame Odia’ (We, the Odias) at the Mandap’s entrance. As we left the venue this year, we felt Guru Pradhan’s presence. He lives on through every performance staged here.  The author is a   Bhubaneswar-based journalist, who writes on culture.       Guru Gangadhar Pradhan was not just an amazing choreographer, he also had a remarkable sense of visualisation.

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||The falling star sons||The millennials, who love to hashtag nepotism each time a scion of a film family gets a challenging role at the cost of a grass-root actor, often forget that a generation earlier people used to wait for their favourite star’s son or daughter to be launched. In the 1980s, for the fawning public that was putting up with dynasties in politics and business, cinema was no different. They might eventually reject the star kids at the turnstiles, but they were more than happy to give them a chance. And like traditional business houses, actors used to see their sons as the cultural capital they needed to invest in for the market of show business. Growing up in a small town, one remembers old uncles discussing the futility of Dilip Kumar’s marriage with Saira Banu for it failed to provide the country another Tragedy King. Reams were written when his nephew Ayub Khan made his debut with Mashooq (1992).  The public was equally impatient to watch Dharmendra’s son flex his muscles when Sunny Deol was launched with Betaab in 1983, followed by Sunny . In the same breath, they blamed Suniel Anand for failing his father Dev Anand when the latter launched him with Anand Aur Anand (1984). The title was not drawn from the storyline. It was a clear message for the public that they were paying for a dramatic launch. Manoj Kumar’s son Kunal Goswami met the same fate. Neither Sridevi nor Kishore Kumar’s ‘Neele Neele Ambar Par’ could help him find a footing in the industry with Kalaakar (1983). Hardly anybody wondered why Raj Kapoor always wrote the hero’s part for somebody from the family. He gave Rishi Kapoor a break, but the actor proved his merit. In fact, Rishi posted an angry tweet when Rahul Gandhi talked of dynasties, saying that his family had for four generations been giving work to actors who survived on their merit and hard work. Recently, after the demise of the showman’s youngest son Rajiv Kapoor (58), many realised how illustrious genes can also come in the way of success. Despite immaculate diction and decent acting skills, Rajiv’s uncanny resemblance to uncle Shammi Kapoor and brother Rishi limited his progress. When Prem Granth, his take on caste and rape, failed at the box office, he could not muster the courage to stand up again as a director either, for the RK image was bigger than his personal growth. In a television interview with senior journalist Bharti Pradhan that has found traction after his death, he hinted that he lost out because he looked like his uncle Shammi Kapoor. “I indeed looked like him and even my gestures resembled his.” He spoke of how he was “brainwashed” by writer-directors into taking the genetic similarity seriously. “I should have realised early that I have to make an identity of my own. By the time I realised it was too late.” In the same interview, Rajiv pointed out that his father Raj Kapoor ensured that in Ram Teri Ganga Maili (1985) he did not look like a Shammi Kapoor lookalike, but of coure that was Raj Kapoor at work. The same year, Rajiv put on a moustache in Ravindra Peepat’s Lava but sounded too much like his brother Rishi Kapoor. And if Ram Teri Ganga Maili turned out to be a Mandakini show, Lava was remembered for Dimple Kapadia’s explosive performance. It reminded me of Sanjay Kapoor’s candid statements in the series Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives, on how he faced the pressure of being Anil Kapoor’s brother. The two are strikingly similar in looks and Sanjay’s Prem proved to be a launching pad only for Tabu. Shah Rukh Khan once said when he was young that it was said that he looked like Kumar Gaurav. “I used to feel so happy with the comparison. When I landed in Mumbai, the first person I wanted to meet was Kumar Gaurav.” Those who have grown up in the 1980s cannot forget the Kumar Gaurav craze. It was bigger than Sanjay Dutt’s, who was also launched around the same time with Rocky. In fact, it was these two sons, Rajendra Kumar’s and Sunil Dutt’s, who started the star son rush in 1981, riding on the music of R.D. Burman. Love Story was also a kind of launchpad for Amit Kumar, son of Kishore Kumar. But both Amit and Kumar Gaurav failed to come out of the giant shadows of their fathers. Kumar Gaurav worked in titles like Star and All Rounder but could not become one. A decade later, Rajendra Kumar tried to salvage his career with Phool by casting Madhuri Dixit, the reigning queen, opposite him. But the film proved to be one of the biggest flops of Madhuri’s career. Like Rajiv Kapoor, Kumar Gaurav was not a bad actor either, as the discerning discovered afterwards in films such as Mahesh Bhatt’s Janam and Naam (1986). But while the latter put Sanjay Dutt's career on track after a series of flops, Kumar Gaurav had to bow out. Unlike his father, he was a lot subtler, and perhaps that proved his undoing in an era where acting needed to be seen. It was not until Kaante (2003) that he could prove to the millennials that he is more than just his father’s son.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-falling-star-sons/article33993618.ece
05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Rise of the young brigade||As the fresh-faced youngster takes the stage, there are few expectations among the socially-distanced music lovers scattered around the Veer Savarkar Hall in central Mumbai. At best, you think, he will be competent; at worst, the occasional slip. Then Siddharth Belmannu starts and jaws drop. In a stunningly assured Todi, there is both flair and depth, confidence and quietude. This kind of craft is the preserve of the old masters, not of a 25-year-old.Belmannu was among the eight early career Hindustani vocalists to make their voices heard at Gharana GenNext, a 12-hour marathon hosted by impresario Shashi Vyas’ newly-launched networking platform for youngsters, Grace Foundation. In a dynamic music tradition, an event like GenNext would not be a rarity. The Carnatic ecosystem, for instance, keeps doors open for young performers with avenues and platforms. The sabha pipeline, for all its flaws, regularly pushes out new names every once in a while. Its audiences are large, informed and generous enough to give fresh talent a fair hearing. A young artiste is not an aberration in this world, but the norm. But Hindustani circuits, fossilised over time, have become the monopoly of about a dozen names, with no systematic entry points for the young. So much so that the popular belief is that this music tradition is moribund, well on its way to extinction without a next generation to pick up the baton. The truth, however, is that there is magnificent talent waiting in the wings, straining at the leash, desperate for opportunities. The system, however, is loaded against them. Patronising known names The best an aspiring performer can hope for is a starter slot just before the marquee name — served up mostly as an appetiser to the real feast. “The trouble is that our emphasis has shifted from the art to the artiste, creating a sort of coterie. If content was more important you would have a wider range of artistes in the fray. The problem is also that the audience for Hindustani music is ageing and they only patronise known names,” says Vyas. “If you schedule a young artiste before a big name, people arrive just in time for the star. We need to showcase the young on their own, even if only 50 people attend.” A crippling culture of reverence circumscribes the Hindustani orbit, discouraging change, debate or dialogue and distancing the young. Any conversation rarely gets past oft-repeated profundities — about its ‘5000-year-old’ antiquity, its oceanic depths, its superiority, its spirituality, its sheer inaccessibility. In this world being young is a serious handicap. “Yes, yes. If you are not nearing 50 you can’t have reached anywhere. If you are 25-30, you are told abhi bahut aage jana hai or lamba rasta hai . The establishment is averse to change, there is pride in the fact that little changes here — aise hi chalta aa raha hai . But in any other art, you are judged for talent, not age,” says young Pune-based sarod player Abhishek Borkar. The stranglehold was broken last year. Ironically, it was the lockdown that managed to bring a semblance of democracy into this world, putting a lot of young artistes centre-stage. It made everyone invisible, the star as well as the struggler. And in this vacuum, the young had the upper hand — they were more anxious to stay relevant, more resourceful and, most importantly, far more digitally active. Over social media, in digital events, however badly produced, a whole bunch of superbly talented youngsters became visible — talking, singing, playing. Suddenly the Hindustani tradition seemed not just alive, but kicking. “It sort of levelled the playing field,” says Agra gharana singer Priya Purushottaman. “Young musicians managed to capitalise digital resources to amplify their voices, not just by performing, but by writing, speaking up on issues, disseminating their work.” Last year also saw this world shaken by allegations of sexual harassment against some of the pillars of the Hindustani tradition. “Some of the intimidating aura around this music has to be deconstructed to make it accessible. It is a baggage we can do without,” says Purushottaman. In this new world, music entrepreneurs thrived, especially those who had already been using alternate platforms and showcasing fresh talent. Devina Dutt’s First Edition Arts goes with what she describes as “off-market musicians” who are not beholden to the establishment. Deepsankar Bhattacharjee (sitar), Aditya Modak (vocal), Rujuta Lad (vocal) and Pratik Srivastava (sarod) are some of the fresh names to find a place on its YouTube menu. Dutt now wants to move to an even younger league, those between 25 and 30. “In social media and over private conversations, I find that the young are questioning old hierarchies. I guess this is because the young are now more anxious about their future,” says Dutt. In March, Borkar launched Artistes United, a Facebook forum for young artistes featuring 450 musicians. Of them, 90% were going live for the first time. “Attempts like these loosened the hold of the establishment, bridged the payment gap. Otherwise, the top bracket earns Rs. 5 lakh a concert, while the young have to make do with as little as Rs. 5,000,” he says. Online also meant all kinds of collaborations and experiments that allowed youngsters to find new audiences and sustain themselves. The eminently talented US-based Samarth Nagarkar was among the first to engage directly with listeners through exclusive subscription-based platforms like Patreon, where Nagarkar offers paid concerts, talks, and workshops. Few opportunities “There is simply not enough work for young musicians past their taleem and looking to perform, needing to make ends meet. Networks matter, with little space for merit. Since there are few opportunities, insecurities run deep. The lockdown, however, forced us to accelerate efforts to connect directly with audiences, improve our visibility, and supplement earnings,” says Nagarkar, who has had 85-100 subscribers for Patreon shows at various points over the year. For most musicians, of course, the real joy lies in live events. For them, the digital medium is at best an effective magnet to pull more listeners into their live concerts by raising their profiles. So, will the post-Covid world see a shift in the establishment? Nagarkar is not very hopeful, but believes there will be some rethink on age bias and the huge payment gap between old and young performers. He sees the possibility of audiences wearying of old fare and seeking freshness. “There is an ocean of deserving talent out there, those who can carry a concert on their shoulders. The onus is on organisers to give platforms to them,” he says. With a confidence that only the young can muster, Belamannu believes that you can never go wrong with content that has integrity. “I am not chasing fame or money but good music always finds audiences. It is a great responsibility I carry on my shoulders, I am aware of that.”  The Delhi-based writer   explores the intersection between culture and society.

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I am the catalyst between the creator and listener of music’||Sai Shravanam has always been the person in the shadows whose work speaks — in bursts of music and silence. The musician, recording and scoring engineer and music producer was recently honoured withthe Tamil Nadu Government’s Kalaimamani Award, and is said to be the first sound engineer to have received it. Only after the awardees’ list was announced did many outside of the music circuit get to know of the work Shravanam does at the bespoke Resound India studio, set inside Parameshwari Nagar in Chennai’s Adyar. Shravanam has worked in Life Of Pi , and Matthew Brown’s The Man Who Knew Infinity , about the life of mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan. Shravanam is a self-taught artiste — as a child, he was charmed by the sight of Ustad Zakir Hussain playing the tabla and began learning it. He also picked up the engineering behind sound along the way, and set up his studio. “I see myself as the catalyst between someone who creates music and the person who enjoys it. I am the person between the creator and the listener and my job is to find that place of balance between the two, and take decisions from a position of least judgement,” he says. This means that Shravanam, whose name means ‘to listen’, cannot get carried away by an artiste’s legacy, but must work keeping only the end product in mind — ensuring the music reaches the listener the way it is meant to. “I am very frank, and that’s something that artistes appreciate. They trust that I will ensure their art lingers for long. Artistes can fade, but the art they create lasts centuries and my job is to ensure quality during such longevity,” says Shravanam. In an earlier interview to this paper, Shravanam had said: “Indian music, unlike Western orchestration, is all about horizontal harmony. It’s a struggle to recreate that in recordings. But the end result is fantastic, with each layer and each instrument merging into another seamlessly to create a magical carpet of sounds.” Shravanam works with classical Indian musicians and dancers and composers of film music, occupying a unique space where he straddles the classical and the contemporary. He says sound recording is not just about technology, but more an aid for an artiste. “I basically record their musicianship and personality. It is my response to their artistry. And I have my moment when a listener goes ‘Aha’ hearing a certain phrase or note.” Music that speaks to all Shravanam says he works knowing that 90% of listeners are not connoisseurs of music, but casual listeners. “So, technical and musical prowess does not matter to them. The music has to speak to them, and ensuring it speaks is what I do.” Recently, while recording ‘Kandaa Vara Sollunga’ by composer Santhosh Narayanan, a frequent collaborator, for director Mari Selvaraj’s Dhanush-starrer Karnan , the team had initially decided to record in the studio. “But I felt the instruments, the Raja Melam, the percussion, needed to breathe in the open. Santhosh and I are on the same wavelength and he did not hesitate to go along with my plan. We decided to capture it in the village the artistes were from, and decided they could play in a field. But there was so much breeze, it got difficult. Technology is too small in front of nature. Eventually, we managed to record it in a temple praakaram (outer circle of the temple) with an incredible sound rhythm. The intent of the song came through, and that touched people,” says Shravanam of the song that has clocked more than 12 million hits on YouTube. Shravanam has built Resound India bit by bit, adding things as he’s progressed. “I always feel the need to step up. The quest is to keep updating oneself.” When the call regarding the kalaimamani award came, he thought it was a prank. “It came late at night and I never expected anything of this sort, because few people know about this niche field. The next morning, singers Ranjani and Gayatri were at the studio, speaking about a call they had received too. That’s when I realised it was a real call. The award is truly special, because it is a State honour, and I received it with a lot of my friends. I dedicate the award to the artistes’ fraternity that trusts me unconditionally.” Shravanam has been playing the tabla for A.R. Rahman’s recordings and concerts for over a decade now, and he was pleasantly surprised to receive a note from Rahman after the awards were declared. “I would not be in the field of sound but for him. He’s a god-like figure.” There’s also a deep sense of equanimity in the way Shravanam perceives music. He is aware of the deep divide between classical and folk music. “But I am in a position where I realise the truth of both forms of music. My chair is a fantastic one. I am disconnected with the art and the artiste, the region or the form of music. What I record has to touch people. That is why I do what I do. This career chose me, and I have to do justice to it.”  The writer is a Mangalore-based freelance journalist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/i-am-the-catalyst-between-the-creator-and-listener-of-music/article33993642.ece

05 March 2021||March 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Rebel with a cause||There is something arrestingly mystifying about Peichi . The novel written by Malaysian Tamil writer M. Navin was banned in December 2020 by the Malaysian government under section 7(1) of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984, because it ‘might be detrimental to public order, morals and public interest’, as an official statement had then said. But Peichi is a spectacular exploration of Tamil life in Malaysia — a territory largely unexplored in the Tamil literary landscape. The novel follows Kopperan, a traditional medical practitioner and priest of Pechi temple, to Malaysia. He is driven by his fear of the goddess he so devotedly worships; she protects as Pechi but also annihilates as Peichi ( pei means ghost). Kopperan believes that the loss of his five newborns on the sixteenth day of their birth to mysterious illnesses is the handiwork of Pechi, probably as an act of revenge for a wrong done to a woman generations ago. Desperate to save the sixth male child, Kopperan deserts his wife (who he thinks is a reincarnation of Pechi) and walks from village to village holding the child till someone finally offers him a job in Malaysia. From here on, the novel goes on to lay bare the various facets of Malaysian Tamil life — colourful and dark, deep and layered. “For those outside of Malaysia, Tamils here are largely from rubber plantations. But I have been here all my life and I know there are fishermen who are Tamils, who work in tea estates. They live in entirely different environments. There are Tamils who also live in very urban environment. The Malaysian Tamil landscape is very expansive, but it is disappointing that Tamil literature has hardly documented these varied landscapes in the last 50 years,” rues 38-year-old Navin, born and brought up in Malaysia. “For that matter, there is no literary documentation of the life of labourers who have come from India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, or those of Chinese origin. There is absolutely nothing about the ethnic tribes here.” Troubled by the lack of proper representation of Malaysian Tamil life, Navin made it his priority when he stepped into serious literature. “I saw writers like Cheran, Shoba Sakthi and A. Muttulingam writing on Sri Lankan Tamil life and issues even if they had migrated elsewhere. Malaysian Tamil life lacked this identity in the Tamil literary space. It was represented by a few who were financially well-off, had close connections. We never had an alternative magazine tradition here.” In 2005, Navin, supported by a friend, began to edit an alternative Tamil magazine, Kaadhal, in which he interviewed 15 writers ‘he thought were important in Malaysia’. “This was my way of telling people that look, we have this kind of Tamil writers too in Malaysia. It helped create a discussion around their works. The magazine wound up after 10 issues due to financial problems.” In 2007, he started Vallinam to continue the job, which wound up after eight issues but continues online. Vallinam has also published 39 books in Tamil. Dialogue between writers Navin also did documentaries on Malaysian Tamil writers. He opened a space for dialogue between Malaysian Tamil writers and Tamil writers in India, by inviting the latter to the country and organising literary events. “Soon people started recognising Malaysian Tamil writers; one of whom, Muthusamy, also won the Vishnupuram literary award, but on the other hand, since I was shaking up what had been represented till then, I started facing a lot of hostility.” Writers, organisations and even some political parties in Malaysia petitioned against Peichi to ban the novel because it contained ‘offensive words.’ “Obviously, the officials are Malay and they have no idea. I have written to them explaining how many documents have been submitted to demand the ban is fake and have requested them to consider. It is a long process though.” Navin says that his writings — he has 15 to his credit including Peichi , his first novel, and collections of short stories and travelogues — might have been seen as some sort of cultural shock in Malaysia. “Tamil literature is not Sri Lankan literature or Malaysian literature. It is Tamil literature; we are Tamil writers. I don’t think we need to restrict that to the idea of one nation. As a Tamil writer, I do not want to be restricted to a small circle. My space expands towards the pioneers of the entire Tamil literary landscape. When I put forth my writings in that sense, it is seen as culturally shocking. But I choose my spaces and I will keep expanding. I know when I oppose every power centre, I become an abandoned writer. But that is not going to stop me.” Jeeva Karikalan, who runs the Yaavarum publishing house in Tamil Nadu, which has published several of Navin’s works including Peichi says the writer is a singular voice in Tamil literature. “In a sense, considering the issues and ideas in his writing, I wouldn’t hesitate to say that he is the first Tamil writer from Malaysia, and we are proud to be associated with him. Peichi is, of course, doing well at the Chennai book fair.”  The writer is an independent Chennai-based journalist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/rebel-with-a-cause/article33993637.ece

05 March 2021||New Delhi,||Farmer death: U.P. Police told to give medical reports to Delhi counterpart||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed Uttar Pradesh Police to submit the original X-ray plate and post-mortem video of the 25-year-old farmer, who died during the tractor parade on Republic Day here, to Delhi Police by Friday. Justice Yogesh Khanna gave the order after Delhi Police said the Chief Medical Officer of District Hospital at Rampur and the local Superintendent of Police have refused to provide the original X-ray plate and post-mortem video without specific orders from the court. Bullet injuries The Delhi Police said it has no objection in handing over a copy of the post-mortem video and inquest report to the deceased’s grandfather, who has approached the High Court, seeking a court-monitored Special Investigating Team (SIT) probe into the incident. “Our case is that there are no bullet injuries. If the reports show otherwise, so be it,” said Delhi government Standing Counsel (Criminal) Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi Police. The court said both the original documents will be retained by the investigating officer of Delhi Police for safe custody till further orders. Delhi police’s counsel additionally stated that it was willing to show footage of 12 CCTV cameras, installed around the area of the incident, if the family members of the deceased request for it. Advocate Vrinda Grover, representing 69-year-old Hardeep Singh, the grandfather of the deceased, said a report based on the X-ray plate be prepared by medical institutes in the Capital since it has not been done till now. Justice Khanna said he will consider this aspect on the next date of hearing on March 17. ‘Reports already given’ During the hearing, the U.P. government’s Standing Counsel said the original post-mortem and inquest reports have already been handed over to the Delhi Police. Mr. Singh, in his plea, had stated that the circumstances in which Navreet Singh lost his life are “highly suspicious”. The plea said: “Eyewitness statements corroborated by medical opinion does not rule out that the petitioner’s grandson was shot by policemen”. “Delhi Police has without any inquiry or investigation whatsoever, has hastily prejudged the cause of death by declaring that the petitioner’s grandson died in an accident and there were no bullets fired,” the petition said. Advocate Grover had earlier argued that the way Delhi Police has conducted itself in the matter “does not inspire a shred of confidence”. The petition also said: “As per statements made by eyewitnesses as well as the opinion of two independent medical experts, Navreet Singh received firearm injuries [bullet wounds] before he lost control of his tractor and hit police barricades...As such, the petitioner’s grandson is possibly a victim of police brutality and unwarranted use of force... the petitioner has a right to know the truth about his grandson’s death.”  Report based on the X-ray plate be prepared by medical institutes in the Capital, since it has not been done till now   Vrinda Grover Hardeep Singh’s lawyer||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmer-death-up-police-told-to-give-medical-reports-to-delhi-counterpart/article33993449.ece

He also sought a probe into the money spent on publicity of these measures from the taxpayer’s money. “It is requested of the L-G to order an immediate probe by a sitting judge of the High Court into the bungling of crore of taxpayer’s money by the Kejriwal government so that all facts are made public and the misdeeds of this government are exposed,’’ he said in his letter. Mr. Bidhuri alleged that pesticides worth Rs. 40,000 worth were purchased and nearly Rs. 13.20 lakh was shown as cost spent on transportation and distribution of these pesticides. After which, he allege that the Delhi government spent around Rs. 7 crore on publicity and advertisements to showcase this as a big achievement. Taxpayers’ money The Delhi government did not reply to these allegations when ask for a comment. “It is sad and unfortunate that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal not only misused taxpayers’ funds for self-publicity and misled the people of Delhi but also, misled the country by making tall claims about having found a solution to the stubble burning issue and subsequent pollution,” Mr. Bidhuri said.
