03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||4.34 lakh seniors get vaccinated||The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country crossed 1.54 crore till 7 p.m. on Tuesday. This includes 67,32,944 healthcare workers who have taken the first dose and 26,85,665 of them who have taken the second. A total of 4,34,981 beneficiaries over 60 years of age have taken the vaccine so far, along with 60,020 aged 45 and above with comorbidities, according to data released by the Health Ministry. At a press conference, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said since Monday, the first day of the second phase of vaccination, 50 lakh registrations had been made on the CoWIN platform. Indian Council of Medical Research Director-General Balram Bhargava said both the vaccines available in India were safe for use by people on blood thinners. “There are some precautions to be followed which are routine and simple,” he said. V.K. Paul, member (health) NITI Aayog, said that taking the second dose of the vaccines was vital. “Only after that the vaccination is complete.” With the States such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Haryana registering a rise in number of cases, Mr. Bhushan said the Health Ministry had deputed teams to understand the reason for the surge. He said India had been witnessing a marginal rise for the past two weeks. “Public compliance of COVID-appropriate behaviour cannot be diluted. Avoid large gatherings, parties and weddings. These could be super-spreading events,” Dr. Paul said. To a question about some political leaders asking medical staff to vaccinate them at home instead of designated medical centres, Mr. Bhushan said, “We are aware of this incident in Karnataka, and this is not allowed as per protocol. A report has been sought from the State government on the incident.” R.S. Sharma, Chairman of the Empowered Group on COVID-19 vaccination, said the upgraded Co-WIN system was ready for the registration of the large volume of beneficiaries “that we are expecting in the second phase”. “It is also geared to ensure data security and offer best safety measures against any cyberattacks.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/434-lakh-seniors-get-vaccinated/article33975487.ece
03 March 2021||COLOMBO,||India and Japan back in new Sri Lanka port project||Sri Lanka on Tuesday said it will develop the West Container Terminal (WCT) at the Colombo Port, along with India and Japan. The decision comes a month after the Rajapaksa government ejected the two partners from a 2019 tripartite agreement to jointly develop the East Container Terminal (ECT), citing resistance to “foreign involvement”. Addressing the media on decisions taken at Monday’s Cabinet meeting, spokesperson Keheliya Rambukwella said approval had been granted to develop the WCT with investors nominated by India and Japan. While the High Commission of India had “approved” Adani Ports, which was to invest in the ECT project earlier, Japan is yet to name an investor, according to officially published Cabinet decisions. Neither India nor Japan has officially commented on the offer, or on the said private investment from the countries. According to official sources in New Delhi, Colombo had been in talks directly with the Adani Group, while the government “was not part of” the discussions. Official sources in Colombo expressed surprise at the mention of the Indian High Commission in the Cabinet decision, pointing out that it was the Government of Sri Lanka, and not a foreign mission, that would “approve” investments coming into the island nation. Both India and Japan had expressed displeasure about Colombo “unilaterally” pulling out of the 2019 agreement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-japan-back-in-sri-lanka-port-project/article33975491.ece

Khandu Wangmo allegedly played a key part in the intrigues. The arrested officials —Supreme Court judge Kuenlay Tshering, Drangpon (Associate Justice) Yeshey Dorji and Royal Body Guard (RBG) Commandant Brigadier Thinley Tobgye — face several charges, including “abetting mutiny, nepotism and favouritism, misappropriation of RBG funds and fictitious documents to secure loans”, according to the official Bhutanese newspaper Kuensel . All three were denied bail by the Thimphu ‘Dzonkhag’ Court on February 17, and are due to face trial, expected to begin this week. Ms. Wangmo, a well-known figure in Thimphu as she dealt with senior officials in the Royal Court due to her work position at the Indian Embassy from 2012 to 2016, is accused of having conned a number of people into helping her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bhutan-plot-spotlight-on-woman-who-worked-at-indian-embassy/article33975489.ece

Mr. Pawar made the statement after Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis raised the issue through an adjournment motion. MLAs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had earlier staged a protest over this issue. The BJP leaders claimed that people across the State were very angry over the inflated electricity bills. “Farmers have already suffered big losses due to the lockdown and heavy rainfall. Now, they are facing a crisis owing to cutting of power supply. Lakhs of people are receiving notices,” Mr. Fadnavis said. Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole too favoured stopping the ongoing drive of disconnecting the power supply of defaulting consumers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-not-cut-power-connection-of-defaulting-consumers-ajit-pawar/article33976112.ece
03 March 2021||GUNTUR,||Time ripe to unlock the potential of Blue Economy, says Jagan||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that true value of “Blue Economy” is unlocked only when all the allied sectors, which are directly and indirectly dependent on the ocean such as aquaculture, maritime & coastal tourism, chemical & bio-technological exploration, ship building and other port led industries provide sustainable employment and growth opportunities. Mr. Jagan was speaking at the “Maritime India Summit 2021”, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually, from his camp office here, on Tuesday. Fishing policy “The draft of the first-ever National Fishing Policy released by Government of India in September 2020 is an example of the steps taken in that direction. Now, 95% of India’s trading by volume and 70% by value is through maritime transport. Indian ports handled approximately 1.2 billion metric tonnes of cargo traffic in the year 2019-20 and much required policy reforms like 100% FDI, Make-in-India, Sagar Mala and Bharat Mala have been introduced to ensure exponential growth in this sector,” Mr. Jagan said. Stating that the importance of Blue Economy in a nation’s growth story extended much beyond the maritime trade and the export- import statistics, Mr. Jagan said Andhra Pradesh was ranked No.1 in the country in Ease of Doing Business rankings 2020, and one of the factors that contributed to this achievement was the State Government’s efforts in developing port infrastructure, support ecosystem and encouraging port-led industrialisation. To further unlock this potential offered by the long coastline, the State government had undertaken development of three greenfield ports at Ramayapatnam, Machilipatnam and Bhavanapadu on an innovative model that mitigated all risks associated with greenfield port development, thereby making the port operation a risk-free proposition for the private sector. After the development of the port by the government, the operator of the port would be selected on competitive bidding basis ensuring maximum revenue realisation for the government. These all-weather, deep-drafted ports were all set to be operational by 2023, creating an additional capacity of at least 100 million tonnes of cargo per annum in the short term, with a potential to grow leaps and bounds in the long term, Mr. Jagan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/time-ripe-to-unlock-the-potential-of-blue-economy-says-jagan/article33975482.ece

The amount exceeded the expectations of the government as well as analysts, as telcos focused on renewing expiring spectrum and consolidating holdings in select bands.

The Central team comprising a Union Joint Secretary from the Health and Family Welfare Ministry and two doctors arrived in the city on Monday to review COVID-19 safety precautions and control measures in the city, in the light of the emergence of clusters recently. Team visits The team that had visited the testing facility at Kempegowda International Airport, a cluster at Sambhram College of Engineering and Genomic Sequencing laboratory at NIMHANS on Monday, visited Tumakuru District Hospital and some vaccination centres on Tuesday. The team later had a review meeting with the Chief Secretary and other top officials from the Health Department and BBMP on Tuesday. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar told The Hindu on Tuesday that the Central team had expressed satisfaction over measures initiated by the State in containing the cluster outbreaks. “The team has asked us to further tighten vigilance at the borders of Kerala and Maharashtra and step up contact tracing,” he said. Contact tracing Pointing out that the State was now tracing eight primary contacts and four secondary contacts, the Minister said the team had asked to increase this to 20 primary and 15 secondary contacts. “Except these suggestions, the team lauded our containment efforts and testing measures. If required, we will further increase the number of daily tests conducted,” the Minister added. Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said the team had asked the State to ensure strict enforcement of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. “People are not serious about COVID-19 precautions now though there is a need to continue following them. Wearing masks should have become a habit by now but not all are keen on this,” he said. “The Central team has asked the State to strengthen screening and testing at the borders. We have already intensified preventive measures at the borders and will further strengthen them,” the Commissioner added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-karnataka-told-to-tighten-border-vigil/article33975410.ece
03 March 2021||Kolkata,||Bengal candidate lists take time||Even as the Election Commission on Tuesday issued the notification for the first phase of polls in West Bengal, major political parties in the State are yet to announce candidates. The notification was issued for 30 seats going to polls on March 27 in Purulia, Paschim Medinipur, Jhargram and Purba Medinipur districts of the south-western region of the State. Usually, it is the ruling Trinamool Congress that takes the lead in announcing candidates, but in this high-stakes election, the party leadership has decided to go slow. Party sources said the list of candidates for the first phase had been finalised but the final call had to be taken by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. There are apprehensions among sections of the ruling party that if all sections were not accommodated, then dissent over seat-sharing could come out in the public. The Left-Congress leadership, holding a series of meetings over the past few days, has still not been able to make a breakthrough. A meeting was held on Tuesday at the State headquarters of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Alimuddin Street, where Indian Secular Front (ISF) leaders also participated. At a city hotel, the BJP is in a huddle to finalise the number of candidates. The party is most likely to announce candidates after the Trinamool Congress comes out with its list of nominees. Jitendra Tewari joins BJP Prominent Trinamool Congress leader and former Mayor of the Asansol Municipal Corporation Jitendra Tewari on Tuesday joined the BJP in the presence of State party president Dilip Ghosh. Mr. Tewari, Pandaveshwar MLA and former party president in Paschim Bardhaman district, was keen on joining the BJP in December 2020 but chose to stay with the Trinamool Congress after the intervention of Ms. Banerjee. A section of BJP leaders, including Asansol BJP MP Babul Supriyo, was opposed to Mr. Tewari joining the BJP in December. Mr. Supriyo, however, has changed his stand now and welcomed Mr. Tewari into the party. In another development, officials at the office of the Chief Electoral Officer said the ECI had extended polling time by 30 minutes for the first phase of polls, and voters would now be able to exercise their franchise from 7 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. The decision has been taken in the wake of safety protocols due to COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengal-candidate-lists-take-time/article33975435.ece

In a statement on Tuesday, the Union Health Ministry said the country’s total active caseload now stood at 1,68,358. It added 12,286 new cases in the 24 hours till 8 a.m. on Tuesday. Maharashtra continued to report the highest daily new cases at 6,397, followed by Kerala, with 1,938 and Punjab 633. Maharashtra and Kerala alone accounted for 67.84% of the total active cases, the Ministry said. The country reported the recovery of 12,464 people in the 24 hours, and 86.55% of the new recovered cases were observed to be concentrated in six States. Maharashtra reported the highest number of single-day recoveries, with 5,754. As many as 3,475 people recovered in Kerala and 482 in Tamil Nadu. Six States accounted for 85.71% of the 91 new COVID-19 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. Maharashtra reported the highest number of casualties (30). Punjab followed with 18 and Kerala at 13. Nineteen States and Union Territoriess have not reported any COVID-19 deaths in the 24 hours. Among them are West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Lakshadweep and Ladakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/12286-fresh-cases-in-24-hours/article33975460.ece
03 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Cong. faces rebel trouble in Kerala||The Congress on Tuesday appeared to face the challenge of possible rebels or Left Democratic Front-backed party deserters in the Palakkad, Chadayamangalam, Konni and Muvattupuzha Assembly segments. District Congress Committee former president A.V. Gopinath has raised a rebellion in Palakkad. He accused the party leadership of sidelining him. The CPI(M) sought to exploit the “mutiny” to turn the tables on the Congress in Palakkad. It floated the possibility of pitting Mr. Gopinath as an LDF-backed Independent against incumbent legislator and Youth Congress president Shafi Parambil. The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) is in touch with Mr. Gopinath. It is likely to seek some accommodation for him. Touchy subject The wrangling between the Joseph faction of the Kerala Congress and the KPCC over the Muvattupuzha constituency has emerged as a touchy subject in the United Democratic Front. The Youth Congress has protested against the move to cede Muvattupuzha to the Joseph faction. It alleged that the Joseph faction has no base in the Assembly segment. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran on Tuesday hinted that Muvattupuzha was not on the table in the party’s talks with the Joseph faction. Local Congress workers are up in arms against the proposal to yield Chadayamangalam to the Indian Union Muslim League. In Konni, a faction in the Congress has opposed Adoor Prakash’s loyalist Robin Peter. The KPCC felt the noises of discord would subside once the All India Congress Committee announced the candidate list for Kerala. Congress MPs, MLAs, district and mandalam committees have submitted their panel of names to the KPCC. A committee led by H. K. Patil will scrutinise the nominations. AICC general secretary in charge of Kerala Tariq Anwar, Mr. Ramachandran, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy are also on board. They were likely to travel to New Delhi this week to submit a whittled down list of nominations to the AICC. Mr. Ramachandran and V.M. Sudheeran are unlikely to be in the fray. Talks with IUML The UDF seat-sharing talks with IUML have reached the final stage. By some accounts, KC(J) might relinquish its claim for Muvattupuzha in deference to the Congress. The RSP is likely to field Babu Divakaran and Shibu Baby John in Eravipuram and Chavara in Kollam, respectively. Nationalist Congress (Kerala) of Mani. C. Kappan is expected to get two seats, including Pala. Bharatiya Janata Dal and Kerala Congress (Jacob) will get one seat each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-faces-rebel-trouble-in-kerala/article33975417.ece
03 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Motor strike hits life in Kerala||Normal life in the State was disrupted on Tuesday on account of the Statewide dawn-to-dusk motor strike called by the Kerala Motor Vyavasaya Samrakshana Samiti in protest against the spiralling prices of petroleum products and cooking gas. Private stage carriers, taxies and autorickshaws remained off the road. The hurdles in mobility also affected the attendance in offices and institutions across the State. The movement of goods and the construction sector was also hit with lorries and trucks remaining off the road. Private vehicles plied as usual despite the call by the samiti, an umbrella organisation of trade unions affiliated to INTUC, CITU, AITUC, and organisations of owners of private stage carriers, lorries, trucks and other commercial one. The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation was able to operate its fleet only partially, as two recognised unions -- INTUC-affiliated Transport Democratic Federation (TDF) and CITU-affiliated Kerala State Road Transport Employees Association -- supported the cause.

03 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Engineering research policy launched||Karnataka launched the country’s maiden Engineering Research & Development (ER&D) Policy 2021 on Tuesday in order to up its contribution to the country’s ER&D sector to 45% in the next five years. The State government anticipates the policy has the potential to create over 50,000 new jobs in the ER&D space in five years. According to industry apex body Nasscom, ER&D has the potential to become a $100-billion industry in the country in the next five years. Unveiling the policy, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who also holds the IT/Biotechnology and Science and Technology portfolios, said,“The ER&D sector in the country is the fastest growing industry with a CAGR of 12.8%. Meanwhile, the global engineering research and development industry is expected to reach a spend of $2 trillion by 2025. Considering this scenario, this policy aims to prepare the State to make use of the future opportunities emanating from this sector.” The new policy, drafted jointly by the Department of Electronics, IT, Biotechnology and Science and Technology, Karnataka Innovation and Technology Society, and Nasscom in consultation with industry stakeholders, has identified five key focus sectors such as aerospace and defence; auto, auto components and EV; biotechnology, pharma and medical devices; semiconductors, telecom, ESDM; and software products. “We are already the leading contributor to the country’s ER&D industry revenue. Our State is home to over 400 R&D centres, global capability centres and engineering service providers. Through this policy, we are aiming to grow our contribution, develop more intellectual properties, and make Karnataka a skilled knowledge capital,” he added. According to Dr. Narayan, his government would invest in skilling, improve academia and industry collaboration, and also encourage IP creation locally in a big way. In his keynote address Ajay Prabhu, president, Technology Services at QuEST Global and chair for Nasscom Engineering R&D (ER&D) Council, said, “The new ER&D policy heralds a new chapter in the State’s position as a hub of innovation and transformation. Significant investments by global engineering and IT services companies in the State have already laid the groundwork that makes the State an attractive destination for ER&D, contributing a sizeable 40% to the country’s overall revenues in this sector.” To foster innovation Through this endeavour, the State government would provide greater impetus to foster innovation while creating lakhs of jobs in the coming years. The ER&D sector in India was already expected to generate over 6.5 lakh jobs by 2025, Mr. Prabhu said. To facilitate internship opportunities, to bridge the gap between academic skills and the needs of the ER&D industry, the government has decided to reimburse 50% of the monthly stipend, up to Rs. 10,000, for interns for a period of three months, according to Dr. Narayan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-launches-engineering-research-policy/article33975406.ece
03 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||Will bring law to nullify CAA: Cong.||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday launched the party’s ‘five-guarantee’ campaign for the upcoming Assembly election in Assam. The five guarantees are bringing a law that nullifies the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, providing five lakh government jobs, raising the daily wage of tea plantation workers to Rs. 365, free electricity up to 200 units per household, and Rs. 2,000 as monthly income support to all homemakers. “The people of Assam were cheated by a party five years ago that promised them 25 lakh jobs but gave them CAA instead. The Congress party is not making empty promises but undertaking five guarantees,” Ms. Vadra said at a rally in Tezpur. Campaign committee chief and MP Pradyut Bordoloi said the first guarantee was based on the feedback from the people. “We have already asked lawyers to start drafting a law towards stopping the CAA from being implemented in Assam,” he said. Fellow MP and manifesto committee chairperson Gaurav Gogoi said the promise of jobs was realistic, unlike the 25 lakh jobs that the BJP had promised. “The figure was arrived at after studying the State budget and consulting economists,” he said. The tea business was studied and compared with the tea workers’ wages in Kerala, which is Rs. 380 a day. “Tea planters can easily manage Rs. 365 and we will make this wage happen within 30 days of coming to power,” said leader of the Opposition in the 126-member Assembly Debabrata Saikia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-bring-law-to-nullify-caa-cong/article33975426.ece
03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP hits out at Cong. over alliance with ISF in Bengal||The BJP on Tuesday waded into the internal differences within the Congress on the latter’s alliance with the Indian Secular Front (ISF) in West Bengal, stating that the alliance and other political tie-ups were only for the maintenance of the “political relevance of the Gandhi family”. “This alliance and several others entered into by the Congress is not for improving its performance or offering transformative leadership and good governance, but to preserve the political relevance of the Gandhi family,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said. “Many months ago, in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had used the correct phrase to describe such alliances as “ thug-bandhan ” (alliance of deception) rather than a gath-bandhan (alliance),” he said. This is now happening in West Bengal, he said at a press conference here. “The tussle within the Congress party over this alliance with a party set up by a Muslim cleric, Abbas Siddiqui, which in our view is hardly a secular outfit, has also come out in the open. There is a war being waged on Twitter among different Congress leaders and on TV, too, where the Congress’s own leaders have asked whether such a tie-up can be considered the secularism as espoused by Mahatma Gandhi,” Mr Patra said. ‘Azad being castigated’ “While what is happening within the Congress is its own internal issue, it is very sad to see leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad being castigated by the Congress,” he said. “This is core hypocrisy and doublespeak — the Congress that terms itself a secular party but ties up with the ISF in West Bengal, with the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam, and the Welfare Party, a front organisation of the Jamaat-e-Islami in Kerala,” he added. “The pinnacle of the hypocrisy is the fact that the Congress is fighting in alliance with the Left in West Bengal and opposing the same party in Kerala. After tying up with parties like ISF, AIUDF, Indian Union Muslim League etc, it is running a government in Maharashtra with the Shiv Sena. There is no logic here, save the logic of power and to keep the Gandhis in power at all costs,” he said. Leaders from the Congress, inlcuding Anand Sharma, have also questioned the alliance with the ISF.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-hits-out-at-cong-over-alliance-with-isf-in-bengal/article33975428.ece
03 March 2021||Lucknow,||Sexually harassed woman’s father shot dead in U.P.||The father of a sexually harassed woman was shot dead in Uttar Pradesh allegedly by the main accused, who has been out on bail since 2018, and his associates on Monday. Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal said the man was shot by Gaurav Sharma and his friends at Naujarpur village of Sasni in Hathras district, and he died on the way to hospital. A daughter of the deceased filed a police complaint, saying the accused had told them to withdraw the sexual harassment case. The police arrested Lalit Sharma, one of the four accused. While Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav targeted the BJP government over the murder, BJP leaders alleged that main accused, Gaurav Sharma, was affiliated to the SP. SP leaders retaliated by posting pictures of the accused along with the BJP MP from Aligarh, Satish Gautam. Piyush Mordia, Inspector-General, Aligarh, said the body was found in a potato field by the police. In June 2018, the man lodged an FIR against Gaurav, Mr. Jaiswal said. The next month, Gaurav was sent to jail and he was released on bail after a month, the officer added. On Monday, when Gaurav’s wife and maternal aunt went to a temple in the village, they got into an altercation with the daughters of the victim over the sexual harassment incident, he said. On Facebook, the accused ran a page under the name of Gaurav Songra and claimed to be an SP leader. Juhie Singh, senior SP leader, said the accused was not associated with the SP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sexually-harassed-womans-father-shot-dead-in-up/article33975440.ece
03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Don’t create buffer stock of vaccines: Health Ministry||The Health Ministry urged States/UTs to utilise 100% capacities of private hospitals functioning as COVID Vaccination Centres (CVCs) and said private hospitals not under the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and the State Insurance Schemes can also be utilised as CVCs. “There is no shortage of vaccines, adequate vaccine doses to be allocated to all hospitals functioning as CVCs,’’ said Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday. The Ministry said that States/UTs should not store, reserve, conserve or create a buffer stock at the State and district levels. The Central government has also instructed that private vaccination centres should have in place effective crowd management protocols along with facilities for seating, water, proper signage etc. Besides this, States/UTs in consultation with the private hospitals should open the vaccination slots for 15 days to a month and announce this as part of their time table.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-create-buffer-stock-of-vaccines-health-ministry/article33975452.ece
03 March 2021||New Delhi,||PMO project: land use change proposed||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on February 27 proposed changing the land use of four plots - two meant for the construction of the new Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, and two as compensation for the green space lost due to the change of the other two. In its public notice inviting objections for a period of 30 days, the DDA proposed changing the land use of two plots of 9.5 acres each located between Motilal Nehru Marg and K. Kamraj Marg (plot 38) and between Dalhousie Road and Tu-Tu Road (plot 36) from recreational use (district park) to government office in the Masterplan for Delhi-2021. These plots have been proposed to be used for the new PMO as a part of the redevelopment of Central Vista by the Centre. As part of the project, a new Parliament building is being constructed, the Central Vista Avenue is being redeveloped and new secretariat buildings, Prime Minister’s residence and Vice-President’s residence have been proposed. Also, in its February 27 notice, the DDA proposed changing the land use of a 12.8 acre plot located between Dalhousie Road and Tyagraj Road (plot 30B) and 6.54 acre in Chandrawal, near Civil Lines from government office and residential respectively to “recreational (district park)”. Reacting to the development, architect and member of the citizens’ collective LokPATH Madhav Raman said on Tuesday: “It appears that, in the context of the Central vista redevelopment project, the DDA persists in playing fast and loose with the basic tenets of statutory master planning, which is its constitutional mandate.” ‘Dangerous precedent’ During the legal challenge to the change in land use for the Central Vista project last year, the government’s submission to the Supreme Court had shown plot 30B already as “recreational [district park] land use”, he said. “It is currently used to house government offices in temporary barrack structures. This proposed land use change sets a dangerous precedent because it means that if a plot of land is occupied long enough in violation of the statutory Masterplan land use, it can arbitrarily be regularised by putting false information about its current statutory land use in the public domain by the statutory authority itself,” Mr. Raman said. A senior DDA official, however, said that the plots listed for change of land use had been listed as per records of the urban body. “Plots 38 and 36 are recreational [district parks] ones and land use will be changed to government office while land use for 30B will be changed from government office to recreational (district park). The data provided has been authorised and is according to the requisite records maintained by the DDA,” the official said. The official added that the plot in Chandrawal would be a part of compensatory land use changes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dda-floats-land-use-change-for-pmo-project/article33975686.ece
03 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Farmer suicides: Karnataka HC poser to govt. on relief||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State Chief Secretary to make the government’s stand clear on why the compensation payable to the family of farmers who committed suicide was not extended to those farmers who borrowed money from private individual moneylenders. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty issued the direction after noticing from the report, submitted by the government on compensation paid to the families of farmers who ended their life in Shahpur taluk of Yadgir district, that compensation was paid to family of those farmers who had availed of loans from banks and other financial institutions. The government’s report said that of the 125 farmers who committed suicide between 2016 and 2020 in Shahpur taluk, family members of 20 farmers were not eligible to receive compensation as they had borrowed money from private moneylenders. The Bench observed that prima facie the policy of the government appears to be discriminatory in nature as the government had categorised farmers based on the source from where they had borrowed money though the object of paying compensation to the family members of farmer appear to be the cause, which is the debt, for committing suicide Also, the Bench asked the Chief Secretary to explain why the farmers were forced to go to private individual moneylenders instead of approaching banks and other financial institutions. The directions were issued during hearing a PIL petition filed in 2019 by Akhanda Karnataka Raitha Sangha, Yadgir district. The petitioner had complained that many farmers in Shahpur taluk were denied of benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojanafor crop loss though they had paid the premium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmer-suicides-karnataka-hc-poser-to-govt-on-relief/article33975600.ece
03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Alert helps foil plan to hack power systems in Telangana||A possible hacking of the power systems in Telangana by a China-based group was averted by the power utilities of the State by taking timely precautionary measures following an alert issued by the Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT- In) on Tuesday. According to Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Transco and TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao, CERT-In has reported from a trusted source that China- based “Threat actor Group Command and Control” servers were trying to communicate with systems belonging to Telangana State Load Dispatch Centre (TSSLDC) and Transmission Corporation of Telangana Ltd (TS-Transco) and advised suitable precautionary measures to ensure security of the power systems. Mr. Rao stated that, acting instantly on the alert, various measures were taken by TS Transco such as blocking server IPs communicated by CERT-In, temporarily disabling the control function for remote operation of circuit breakers from SLDC. Besides, user credentials for all the users accessing TSSLDC website were also changed and suspected equipment within the perimeter of the SCADA control centre were isolated to ensure safety of the grid and satisfactory power supply to all consumers in the State. The cyber attack attempt which came to light assumes significance as it comes at a time when The New York Times reported recently that power black out in Mumbai in October last was due to a China-based cyber attack.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/alert-helps-foil-plan-to-hack-power-systems-in-telangana/article33975403.ece
03 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka Minister caught in ‘sex for favours’ scam||In an embarrassment to the ruling BJP days ahead of the Budget session, an activist approached the Bengaluru police on Tuesday seeking an investigation into Karnataka Minister for Major and Medium Irrigation Ramesh Jarkiholi for allegedly abusing a woman and seeking sexual favours from her in return for a government job. Purported clips of the Minister and the woman together and some telephone conversations allegedly between them have gone viral on social media, prompting the Opposition Congress to demand his resignation. BJP sources said the issue would be discussed with Central leaders on Wednesday. According to Bengaluru-based activist Dinesh Kallahalli, the Minister threatened the woman after he learnt of the video clips, following which her family, fearing for her life, approached him for help. Based on his complaint, the Cubbon Park police have registered a non-cognisable report and are probing the allegations. “We have received a petition about the alleged incident and are probing the matter,” said M.N. Anucheth, DCP, Central Division. The complaint has not revealed either the identity of the woman or source of the video, said an officer. “We will serve him a notice asking him to furnish us details of the woman, or her relatives so that we can approach the woman and investigate the claims of harassment further,” a senior police officer said. Mr. Kallahalli also submitted a CD of all the video and audio clips to the police. In his complaint, he said the woman had approached the Minister seeking permission to use drone cameras to shoot a dam for a documentary. They met multiple times as Mr. Jarikholi reportedly sought to learn more about the woman. In his complaint, Mr. Kallahalli said that during one of their meetings, Mr. Jarkiholi promised to get her a job at Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. in return for sexual favours. According to sources, the victim not only recorded their private moments but also every meeting and phone conversation she had with Mr. Jarkiholi. “The reason behind these records is also part of the probe,” a senior police officer said. Meanwhile BJP senior leader and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi said he would discuss the issue with party leaders in New Delhi besides Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and party State president Nalin Kumar Kateel. “Being a disciplined party, the BJP would not tolerate such things. Leaders should be clean in public and private life,” he said. In 2019, Mr. Jarkiholi had led a group of 17 MLAs who switched to the BJP from the Congress and other parties, which eventually led to the fall of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government and formation of the BJP government. If the sex for favours episode takes a serious turn, it could weaken the new Ministers who came from other parties, said a section of insiders. “We will serve him a notice asking him to furnish us details of the woman, or her relatives so that we can approach the woman and investigate the claims of harassment further,” a senior police officer said. Mr. Kallahalli also submitted a CD of all the video and audio clips to the police. In his complaint, he said the woman had approached the Minister seeking permission to use drone cameras to shoot a dam for a documentary. They met multiple times as Mr. Jarikholi reportedly sought to learn more about the woman. In his complaint, Mr. Kallahalli said that during one of their meetings, Mr. Jarkiholi promised to get her a job at Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. in return for sexual favours. According to sources, the victim not only recorded their private moments but also every meeting and phone conversation she had with Mr. Jarkiholi. “The reason behind these records is also part of the probe,” a senior police officer said. Meanwhile BJP senior leader and Union Minister Pralhad Joshi said he would discuss the issue with party central leaders in New Delhi besides with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and party State president Nalin Kumar Kateel. “Being a disciplined party, the BJP would not tolerate such things. Leaders should be clean in public and private life,” he said. Stating that the episode was an embarrassment for the party, he, however, noted that the veracity of the CD was yet to be verified. “If it is found that the Minister is guilty, action will be taken by the Chief Minister,” he said. Mr. Jarkiholi led the team of 17 MLAs from the Opposition parties who switched to the BJP from the Congress, which eventually led to the fall of the Congress–JD(S) coalition government and formation of the BJP government. If the video episode takes a serious turn, it could weaken the new Ministers who came from other parties, said a section of insiders. Sources in the BJP observe that any possibility of Mr. Jarkiholi’s resignation would alter political equations within the Ministry in which the newcomers have a major say. Many BJP old-timers were not comfortable with Mr. Jarkiholi’s instant political growth. Several Congress and JD(S) leaders too were upset with him for bringing down the coalition government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cd-scandal-lands-minister-ramesh-jarkiholi-in-trouble/article33975593.ece
03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress urges calm as its leaders spar over ISF ties||As senior Congress leaders Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Anand Sharma sparred over the party’s choice of allies in West Bengal, the party on Tuesday urged everyone to come together to take on the BJP in the upcoming elections. The party said the grand alliance formed in Bengal is a secular alliance and leaders should not fall for the BJP’s propaganda, in what seemed to be a snub to Mr. Sharma. On Monday, Mr. Sharma had attacked the party’s decision to ally with the Indian Secular Front (ISF) and its founder, Abbas Siddiqui of Furfura Sharief, saying it militates against the Congress ideology. Hitting back, in a series of tweets late on Monday night, Mr. Chowdhury said, “Those who are committed to fighting against #BJP parties’ venomous communalism should support the Congress & campaign for the party in five states rather than attempting to undermine the party by remarks in tune with BJP’s agenda. Would urge a select group of distinguished Congressmen to rise above always seeking personal comfort spots & stop wasting time singing praises of PM. They owe a duty to strengthen the Party & not undermine the tree that nurtured them.” Mr. Sharma told news agencyANIthat they [Group of 23] stand for a united Congress, despite having reservations on some issues. Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi at a press conference urged colleagues to work together. “I think, the whole idea of this larger front in Bengal was to create, as far as possible, to the maximum extent, a good political fight against the BJP’s particularly vitiated brand of politics and, therefore, I would say that each one of us, each one of my senior and respected and valued colleagues should join wholeheartedly and unconditionally in that fight to combat the false propaganda of the BJP,” Mr. Singhvi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-urges-calm-as-its-leaders-spar-over-isf-ties/article33975436.ece
03 March 2021||New Delhi,||LSTV-RSTV now merged under banner of Sansad TV||After nearly two years of work, the merger of the Lok Sabha TV (LSTV) and the Rajya Sabha TV (RSTV) has been finalised and will be replaced by Sansad TV. On Monday, retired IAS officer Ravi Capoor was appointed its Chief Executive Officer. In November 2019, after deliberations between Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, a committee headed by former Prasar Bharati Chairman Surya Prakash was set up. It submitted a report in February 2020. Three different sub-committees are currently examining the report to finalise the integration of technical and manpower resources of both the channels. The Surya Prakash panel held a meeting with Members of Parliament from different political parties and they strongly recommended the continuation of the live telecast. Under the banner of Sansad TV, sources said, the LSTV would continue to telecast live the House proceedings and the RSTV that of the Upper House. “During the inter-session period and beyond the working hours of Parliament, both will telecast common content to a large extent. The LSTV platform would telecast programmes in Hindi, while RSTV would do so in English. The two language variants, it was felt, enables better branding and increased viewership,” a top official said. The attempt is to go beyond the proceedings of the Houses and show the functioning of Parliament and parliamentarians when the House is not in session. Mr. Capoor’s mandate is also to work out the nitty-gritty of the merger, including the integration of the assets and manpower. There are nearly 250 personnel working with the RSTV and around 100 with the LSTV. As part of cost-cutting, there was a possibility of termination of the contract of a few employees, the sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lstv-rstv-now-merged-under-banner-of-sansad-tv/article33975458.ece

While the ED has asked the senior officials of Axis Bank, the key banker of the project, to appear for interrogation on Wednesday, it has asked K. M. Abraham, the CEO of the Board to be present at its Kochi office on March 5. The Deputy CEO has been summoned to appear on March 4 for interrogation, according to sources. Primarily, the agency is probing violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act in the financial transactions involving the board. The Chief Minister is the chairman of the Board and the Finance Minister its Vice Chairman. The Chief Secretary, the Vice-Chairman of the State Planning Board, the secretaries of Law, Finance and Finance Resources are its members.

The production unit of the upcoming film being directed by Koratala Siva has sought permission from competent authorities of the State-owned SCCL to shoot some important action sequences mainly fighting scenes of the movie at the coal mine locales in Yellandu from March 7 to 14, sources said. The SCCL management has reportedly given its nod for the film shooting at Jawahar Khani-5 Opencast Project (JK-5 OCP) and the more-than-eight-decades-old 21 incline underground coal mine in Yellandu, SCCL sources added. The Yellandu coal town last played host to the shooting of some sequences of Telugu movie “World Famous Lover” starring Tollywood actor Vijay Devarakonda in 2019. In the 90s, some action sequences of Telugu movie Nippuravva with actor Balakrishna in the lead role were shot in the coal mine area in Manuguru town. SCCL sources said that a song of an upcoming Telugu movie was recently filmed in the Open Cast Project in Manuguru. Some action sequences of the multilingual movie “Salaar” starring Telugu actor Prabhas and Shruti Haasan were filmed in the SCCL’s Ramagundam coal belt region in Peddapalli district recently. Apart from the coal belt region, the industrial hub of Palvancha and the picturesque Kinnerasani reservoir in the predominantly tribal populated Bhadradri-Kothagudem district played host to shooting of several documentaries of the SCCL highlighting its growth trajectory and message-oriented short films on diverse themes by various organisations. A host of Telugu films based on revolutionary themes were also shot in the forest fringe areas of the old undivided Khammam district in the past.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yellandu-to-host-shooting-of-chiru-film/article33976045.ece
03 March 2021||NEW DELHi,||Emergency was a mistake, says Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the Emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was a “mistake” but sought to differentiate the situation in 1975 and now in terms of “capture of democratic institutions”. In an online conversation with Cornell University Professor of Economics Kaushik Basu, who was the Chief Economic Adviser to the Manmohan Singh government, Mr. Gandhi said what happened in 1975 was “wrong” but it was fundamentally different from the present where, he alleged, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had “penetrated every institution, including judiciary, bureaucracy, election commission and the press”. Discussing democracy, Mr. Gandhi said “democracy was not just eroding but it has been strangled” ever since the Narendra Modi government came to power in 2014. “I think that was a mistake. Absolutely, that was a mistake. And my grandmother [Indira Gandhi] said as much,” Mr. Gandhi said in response to a question on the imposition of the Emergency. “The Congress party at no point attempted to capture India’s institutional framework, and frankly, the Congress party does not even have that capability. Our design does not allow us that and even if we want, we cannot do it,” he added. Recalling a conversation with former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath before his government collapsed, he said Mr. Nath told him that senior bureaucrats would not listen to him as they were RSS people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/emergency-was-a-mistake-says-rahul/article33975915.ece
03 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||Himalayan serow spotted in Assam||A Himalayan mammal, somewhere between a goat and an antelope, has been confirmed as the newest creature to be spotted in Assam. A couple of nature guides had spotted the Himalayan serow, a goat-antelope, in the 950-sq.km Manas Tiger Reserve on December 3. The animal — a high-altitude dweller usually found 2,000-4,000 metres above sea level — was seen being chased by wild dogs. “We have now confirmed the animal as the Himalayan serow, spotted close to the border with Bhutan in Manas’s Bansbari-Mathanguri forest. The sighting augurs well for the health of the tiger reserve,” Anindya Swargowari, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest for areas under the Bodoland Territorial Council, told The Hindu on Tuesday. He said the serow has been spotted for the first time in the tiger reserve or anywhere else in Assam, but “this does not mean the animal never visited our forests before”. According to Mr. Swargowari, the sightings of rare animals and birds in Manas is an outcome of better access to remote parts of the protected area where extremists and hunters once ruled. “There are chances of more faunal species, found in the higher reaches, being spotted in the park.” The Reserve is contiguous with the 1,057-sq. km. Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan. The black-necked crane was also recently sighted in Manas. A pair each of such cranes was sighted on January 10 and February 18. The Buddhists revere the bird that nests in the Tawang region. Officials in Manas said the critically endangered white-bellied hero was also seen a few weeks ago. In February, birders had sighted the colourful Mandarin duck in the Maguri-Motapung wetland near eastern Assam’s Dibru-Saikhowa National Park. This duck was last spotted in Assam 118 years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/himalayan-serow-spotted-in-assam/article33975443.ece
03 March 2021||KANNUR,||Sri M did mediation: Jayarajan||Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader P. Jayarajan on Tuesday said talks were held with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur under the mediation of spiritual leader Sri M. Writing on Facebook that society needed to understand the facts about this discussion, he said the meeting in Kannur was held after a discussion in Thiruvananthapuram, which was with the participation of the Chief Minister. Sri M took the initiative for a discussion between the RSS and CPI(M) leadership with the aim of ending the violence in Kannur. He said the discussion came after the RSS informed Sri M that it did not want the attacks to continue. All other bilateral discussions took place in the presence of those in charge of the district administration. There was a covert attempt to portray the peace talks as a secret pact between the CPI(M) and the RSS. Mr. Jayarajan said even after the talks, there were clashes between the CPI(M) and the RSS in Kannur. The conflict between the CPI(M) and the RSS had been going on for decades. “It is the agenda of the Jamaat-e-Islami to portray the peace talks as a secret affair,” Mr. Jayarajan said. The efforts made by Sri M. were with the good intention of bringing lasting peace in this matter, he added. BJP reaction BJP State president K. Surendran said many mediation talks had been held in Kannur to end clashes between the RSS and the CPI(M). Mr. Surendran alleged the Congress was spreading fake news to get political mileage. It was not the first time such talks were held to end RSS-CPI(M) clashes. P. Parameswaran and E.M.S. Namboodiripad also had held peace talks. The party had no links with the land allotted to Satsang Foundation founder Sri M, he said.

03 March 2021||Hubballi/Bengaluru,||Furore as Karnataka Minister gets jab at home||Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil courted controversy on Tuesday by getting himself inoculated at his home in Hirekerur in gross violation of the COVID-19 protocol and later defended his action saying that he had ‘not committed any crime’. On Tuesday, the Minister reportedly summoned the taluk health official and staff to his home and got the vaccine shots for himself and his wife. The video and photographs of the same were subsequently circulated on social media platforms evoking strong reactions from netizens and also from Opposition party leaders for ‘misusing power and blatantly violating the norms’. He said that inconvenience could have been caused to people waiting at the hospital, if he had gone there. Moreover several people were waiting to meet him at his residence and after getting vaccine he was able to speak to them. “It is not a big issue at all. What is wrong in getting vaccine at home,” he said. However, District Health Officer Rajendra Doddamani has issued notice to the Hirekerur Taluk Health Officer for violating the COVID-19 protocol while administering vaccine to the Agriculture Minister. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar told The Hindu that action would be initiated against the doctors concerned. “No doctor can vaccinate anyone irrespective of whether the beneficiary is a VIP or common man at home. What if some adverse event happens after vaccination? How can it be managed?” the Health Minister said. Pointing out that the COVID-19 vaccination guidelines clearly specify that vaccination should be at the vaccine session sites only, the Minister said: “We will again issue a circular directing Health officials not to visit anyone’s residence for vaccination.” He said probably Mr. Patil was not aware of the guidelines and may be the taluk health officials obliged as he is a Minister. “Our Health officials should have apprised him about the guidelines. We will ensure such incidents are not repeated,” the Minister added. Meanwhile, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has said that it is important to get vaccinated irrespective of whether the person takes the shot at home or at the vaccination centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/furore-as-karnataka-minister-gets-jab-at-home/article33975408.ece
03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Centre gets Rs. 77,815 cr. in spectrum auction||In the auction — first in nearly five years, and among the shortest one with participation from only three players — a total of 2308.80 MHz of spectrum across seven bands worth about Rs. 3.92 lakh crore was put up for sale. Of this, bids were received for 855.60 MHz or 37% of the spectrum. At the end of a total of six rounds of bidding, no bids were received for the premium 700 MHz band as well as the 2500 MHz band. The 700 MHz band remained unsold during the previous 2016 auctions as well due to the high prices. The government expects to receive an upfront payment of about Rs. 26,000-27,000 crore, of which Rs. 19,000-20,000 crore will come in during the current fiscal (before March 31, 2021), while the remaining payment will be received by December 2021. “Our estimate itself was Rs. 45,000-50,000 crore and we have got bids worth Rs. 77,814.80 crore, which is much higher than expectations,” Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash told reporters. In a press statement, Reliance Jio said it acquired spectrum in all 22 telecom circles, across 800 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2300 MHz bands, and its owned spectrum footprint has increased by 55% to 1,717 MHz. Bharti Airtel, which bid for spectrum across all bands barring 700 MHz and 2500 MHz, said the spectrum acquired during the auction gives the company “the most formidable spectrum holdings in the country”. Vodafone Idea, which bid for small quantities in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz band, said the company had entered this auction holding the largest quantum of spectrum with a very small fraction coming up for renewal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-gets-rs-77815-cr-in-spectrum-auction/article33975415.ece
03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Spotlight on woman who worked at Indian Embassy||The Hindu spoke to a number of diplomats and other officials who had dealt with her during her tenure at the embassy. They described her as “very efficient” and “very plugged in” to the top echelons of Thimphu society, while others said she was “ambitious” and “frightfully manipulative”. Ms. Wangmo was arrested in 2019 on charges of “seditious allegations” and continues to be held in custody, facing 11 charges of criminal conspiracy in the latest case. The arrests in February are believed to have followed her interrogation. During her tenure at the embassy, Ms. Wangmo also underwent training as a “Desuup”, or volunteer who is part of a “Guardians of Peace” programme launched by the Bhutanese King, where she recounts meeting many senior military officials. In an article for the Kuensel in 2015, she had written, “I am a DeSuup ready for action. More importantly, I am a pilgrim in search of relationships that honour and edify. It has been my destiny to weave my own little story into the grand fabric of the illustrious Indo-Bhutan relationship,” signing herself as DeSuup Bumden Khandu Wangmo, Embassy of India. However, officials told The Hindu that she was not a very senior official and had not pursued her links there after her contract ended. “There is no connection with the Indian Embassy — she left from here in 2016,” an embassy official said, when asked if the Bhutanese police had made any formal inquiries with them. A source who had seen the chargesheet against the three officers, clarified that there was no suggestion of her links with the embassy in Thimphu to the case. The most serious of the charges relates to a plot to overthrow the RBA chief, Lieutenant-General Batoo Tshering, by Brigadier Tobgye, who is in charge of the security of King Jigme Khesar Namgyal and other members of the Bhutanese royal family. Mr. Kuenlay Tshering and Mr. Dorji, who was married to Ms. Wangmo earlier, were allegedly part of the conspiracy against the RBA chief, which involved using fraudulently obtained documents of a deal for United Nations vehicles to frame him, with the aim of catapulting themselves into the positions of the Chief Justice and the Court Registrar respectively. Giving an account of the inquiry in The Bhutanese newspaper, Editor Tenzing Langsam said that according to their testimonies, the three officials said they had been duped by Ms. Wangmo into thinking their actions were in line with the wishes of some “higher authorities”. The full array of charges against Ms. Wangmo and the three officials will be known in the next couple of weeks, as the trial gets under way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhutan-plot-spotlight-on-ex-indian-embassy-staffer/article33975421.ece

Mr. Chaoba is the executive editor and Mr. Wangkhemcha is the associate editor of The Frontier Manipur (TFM), a digital media outlet. The duo and two others — independent journalist Grace Jajo and columnist Ninglun Hanghal — had taken part in the discussion on February 28. Letter from Ministry The withdrawal of notices followed a letter from the Information and Broadcasting Ministry to Rajesh Kumar, Manipur’s Chief Secretary, pointing out that the powers to wield the new digital media rules “have not been delegated to State governments/District Magistrate/Police Commissioner”. Mr. Chaoba, who is also the publisher of the TFM , said his family found the withdrawal notice put on the gate of their house in the evening. “It is to inform you that this office notice of even number dated March 1, 2020 served to you stands withdrawn with immediate effect,” the notice read. In the earlier notice, the two editors were directed to furnish all relevant documents showing that they comply with the provisions of the new rules, failing which “steps as deemed fit shall be initiated without further notice”. “The new IT rules are being used to intimidate journalists, as was evident from six-seven armed policemen who came to deliver the first notice at 9 a.m. today. The Deputy Commissioner retracted the notice because he is not empowered under the Act,” said Mr. Chaoba.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-manipur-journalists-get-notices-under-new-rules/article33975430.ece

03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers to campaign against BJP during polls||Ratcheting up the pressure on the BJP, protesting farm unions have decided to campaign against the party in the upcoming Assembly elections. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha general body on Tuesday decided to send teams to the four election-bound States and one Union Territory. “They will not ask for support for any particular party, but they will appeal to people not to vote for the BJP,” said veteran Punjab farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, who heads his own faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. “They will tell people that the Modi government is not treating farmers fairly, and counter the propaganda of the BJP,” he added. March 12 rally “This government only understands the language of elections, of votes, of seats. So we will go to all the five poll-bound States,” said Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav. In Bengal, the campaign will kick off on March 12, when SKM leaders will take part in a farmers’ rally in Kolkata, he said, adding that campaign vehicles will also go to all Assembly constituencies in the State “to tell them the reality of what is happening to farmers”. Following a meeting with trade union leaders on Monday, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha also announced that it will support the March 15 call of ten central trade unions to protest against privatisation and corporatisation. On March 6, to mark 100 days of the campaign’s arrival on Delhi’s borders, protesters plan to block the entire length of the Western Peripheral Expressway or Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway for five hours between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. The six-lane highway surrounding the capital connects the main border protest sites at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur. Those who support the protesting farmers in other parts of the country are encouraged to unfurl black flags on their homes and offices or wear black strips on their clothing on March 6, which will be observed as a black flag day, said SKM leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-to-campaign-against-bjp-during-polls/article33975433.ece
03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pak. has given ‘pension’ to terrorists, says India||India on Tuesday reiterated Kashmir is an “inalienable” part of its territory and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has no “ locus standi” to raise matters related to the region on international platforms. Using the Right of Reply at the 46th session of the Human Rights Council, India’s diplomatic team said Pakistan has given ‘pension’ to terrorists and urged Islamabad to focus on its poor economic condition and improve the life of its minority communities. “The members of this Council are well aware that Pakistan has provided pensions to dreaded and listed terrorists out of State funds and has the dubious distinction of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations,” said Pawan Kumar Badhe, First Secretary, Permanent Mission of India at the Council. He highlighted the challenges faced by the religious and ethnic minorities of Pakistan and said ‘holy’ sites of the minority groups have been attacked by Pakistan. The tough exchange came days after India and Pakistan agreed to adhere to the 2003 ceasefire agreement which is being interpreted as early signs of engagement between the two sides who last held high-level dialogue in December 2015. Despite those positive signs at the bilateral level, Pakistan and the OIC raised the Kashmir issue at the HRC which drew sharp response from India. “The Council should ask Pakistan why the size of its minority communities such as Christians, Hindus and Sikhs has drastically shrunk since independence and why they and other communities such as Ahmadiyas, Shias, Pashtuns, Sindhis and Baloch have been subjected to draconian blasphemy laws and systemic persecution,” said Mr. Badhe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pak-has-given-pension-to-terrorists-says-india/article33975441.ece

In another case, the court stayed the arrest of a man accused of rape by his former partner, with Chief Justice Bobde commenting “however brutal the husband is... when two people (are) living as husband and wife... can sexual intercourse between them be called rape?’”  The open letter, endorsed by activists including Annie Raja, Kavita Krishnan, Kamla Bhasin, Meera Sanghamitra, Maimoona Mollah and Zakia Soman, said, “From the towering heights of the post of CJI of the Supreme Court, it sends the message to other courts, judges, police and all other law enforcing agencies that justice is not a constitutional right of women in India. This will only lead to the further silencing of girls and women. To the rapists, it sends the message that marriage is a licence to rape; and that by obtaining such a licence, the rapist can post facto decriminalise or legalise his act.” Nearly 50 groups, including the All India Progressive Women’s Association, were among the signatories.   In a separate letter to the Chief Justice of India urging him to withdraw his comments, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat said, “Rape victims are not robots whose thoughts and feelings are under remote control of others”.

03 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Cyber volunteer plan will create social distrust’||The Ministry of Home Affairs’s (MHA) controversial “cybercrime volunteers” programme targets to rope in around 500 persons to flag unlawful content on the Internet for “improvement in the cyber-crime ecosystem of India”. The programme will include 200 “cyber awareness promoters” and 50 “cyber experts”, according to the output outcome monitoring framework of the MHA’s budget 2021-22. The output outcome framework developed by the NITI Aayog was adopted in the 2019-20 budget to define and evaluate government schemes below Rs. 500 crore in terms of outcomes. The Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), a digital liberties organisation, has written to the MHA that the scheme will lead to a “culture of surveillance and constant suspicion in society creating potential social distrust”. The IFF said in a representation to the MHA that there is no information available on how the Ministry will ensure that programme is not misused by certain elements to extract misguided personal or political vendettas. It should also be noted that there is no process in place for withdrawal of complaints once submitted, it said. The MHA’s framework says under the “Cyber-crime Ecosystem Management Unit”, it aims to hold regular consultation with “government bodies, academia, NGOs, private bodies, technical companies, etc.”. According to the output outcome monitoring framework of 2021-22, the “number of cyber volunteer unlawful content flaggers applying” to achieve the “improvement in the cybercrime ecosystem of India” is stated to be 500. The National Cybercrime Ecosystem Management Unit is part of the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) scheme launched by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in January 2020. The project was approved in October 2018 at an estimated cost of Rs. 415.86 crore. The I4C scheme, which also includes other components, has been allocated Rs. 69.80 crore in the budget. Under the National Cyber Research and Innovation scheme, Rs. 9 crore will be provided to institutions to solve the problems of law enforcement agencies, the budget document said. As reported by The Hindu on November 1 last year, the MHA through its grievance portal, cybercrime.gov.in, aims to raise the “cyber crime volunteers” group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cybercrime-volunteers-plan-is-fraught-with-dangers-says-iff/article33975438.ece

The sisters also sought the transfer of a criminal defamation case registered on a complaint filed by lyricist Javed Akhtar. The sisters, represented by advocate Neeraj Shekhar, said the cases have been filed to malign their public image. They said they have a “stellar reputation and huge fan following among the Indian public”. They said they were “public-spirited citizens”. They contended that the complaints against them were frivolous and a means for harassment. ‘Malafide intentions’ “The Maharashtra government led by Shiv Sena has been harassing the petitioners,” the petition said. It accused Shiv Sena leader and MP Sanjay Raut of name-calling besides highlighting how the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had illegally demolished a part of Ms. Ranaut's Pali Hill bungalow. She said the action “smacked of malafide intentions”. The petition said, “The acts of the Maharashtra government clearly shows that it has malafide intentions against the petitioners and that if they visit Maharashtra to attend the trials, there will be a constant threat to them from the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra government.” The petition, as proof of the danger against Ms. Ranaut, said the Home Ministry has provided Y-Plus category CRPF security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kangana-seeks-transfer-of-cases-to-shimla/article33975445.ece

Prakash has ordered booth-level officers to start visiting households on March 12 to distribute applications (Form 12B) for postal ballot to people with disabilities, COVID-19 patients and those aged above 80. Officials have been directed to visit houses at least twice between March 12 and 16. The electors who are eligible for postal ballot also have the option of visiting the polling booth to vote on the day of polling.

03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State’s largest constituency in terms of electors lacks even basic infrastructure||It was in 2011 that most localities in this thickly populated Assembly constituency became part of the Chennai Corporation. But not much has changed thereafter, say residents of Shozhinganallur, the largest in the State in terms of the number of voters. It has 6.94 lakh voters, as per the latest revision, and a large section of people lives in slum clearance board flats and don’t even get regular water supply. “The rain was abundant this year, and while other localities get daily water supply, we are a cursed lot and get water once in three days. Sometimes we get supply once in four days. And with homes that measure less than 150 sq. ft. each, where will we store so much water?” complained Girija Kailasam, a resident of Kannagi Nagar. Water supply and sewage remain an issue for other areas, too. Harsha Koda, co-founder, FOMRRA (Federation of OMR Resident Associations), said piped water supply and a sewage network still remained a distant dream for many localities. “Our other demands include removal of toll plazas on Rajiv Gandhi Salai since we are very much inside the Corporation limits, reclamation of the Pallikaranai marsh since it will help prevent floods and clean up the groundwater. The marsh, the Buckingham Canal, Oggiyam Madugu and connected lakes should be cleaned and developed like the Adyar Poonga,” he said. The constituency, through which three major roads — Old Mahabalipuram Road, East Coast Road and Velachery-Tambaram Road — runs, still needs a proper transport plan. It also does not have a transport system like Metro Rail or MRTS to help a large number of IT workforce. “The IT Corridor is like an island, and lacks connectivity with other roads. One cannot get that easily out of a traffic jam. We don’t have connecting roads. There are tiny bridges built across the Buckingham Canal and these get jammed every day. Even huge lorries cross them. They clamber over the space meant for pedestrians... We need flyovers at all signals, something they have been promising for over 10 years now,” said K. Bhavani, a Palavakkam resident. Flooding is a major problem in many localities since they lack storm-water drains. “Even during the last monsoon, several areas got flooded and remained under water for over a week... The Corporation did not have enough motors to pump out the water,” said G. Murugesan, a resident. This election, the constituency will be part of Chengalpattu district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/states-largest-constituency-in-terms-of-electors-lacks-even-basic-infrastructure/article33975969.ece
03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||15 more paramilitary companies for T.N.||Besides the 45 companies of paramilitary personnel that have fanned out to various parts of Tamil Nadu ahead of the April 6 Assembly election, 15 companies are expected to arrive in the State within two or three days, Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo said here on Tuesday. The Election Commission of India has deputed flying squads and stationary surveillance teams to every constituency, besides video surveillance teams. Over 330 companies of personnel are to be deputed to the State. Election officials have removed over 61,710 posters and banners that had been displayed in violation of the model code of conduct, and registered 36 cases. Over 50% of the booths will have web streaming of polling, and the proceedings will be recorded at the booths identified as sensitive. Mr. Sahoo chaired a meeting of officers of government departments involved in monitoring election expenditure during the run-up to the election. Those who are aged above 80 and eligible for casting postal ballots on the day of polling should fill up form 12-D when officials visit their homes, Mr. Sahoo said. According to the Election Commission, over 12.91 lakh people on the rolls in Tamil Nadu are above 80 years of age. Chennai district has the highest number of such persons, 1.08 lakh, followed by Coimbatore-64,755, Salem-61,728 and Tiruppur-61,272.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/15-more-paramilitary-companies-for-tn/article33975546.ece
03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Roadwork in full swing in Velachery||The Greater Chennai Corporation has started repairing several interior roads that had been damaged while laying pipelines and underground electricity cables in Velachery. More than 100 roads are proposed to be covered before the Assembly election. The residents at Velachery had been facing hardship as the utility agencies had dug up several roads. Although the model code of conduct is in force, the civic body has taken up roadwork since Monday at Bala Murugan Nagar, Annai Indira Nagar, Bethel Avenue and Sarathy Nagar 5th Street. A senior official of the Corporation in the Adyar zone said the roadwork, which had been progressing slowly, was being speeded up to be completed by April-end. Pipeline work Several streets at Velachery coming under Divisions 178 and 179 had been dug up by the utility agencies. The Chennai Metropolitcan Water Supply and Sewage Board (CMWSSB) had taken up work in streets which had been without piped water supply and underground drainage connection. While the Corporation officials said the CMWSSB had completed its work, the shifting of overhead power cables was in progress. M. Arumugam of Bethel Avenue said the water board dug up several streets for installing water and sewer pipelines and this had inconvenienced hundreds of residents, particularly during the northeast monsoon with water stagnating for more than a feet at several places. He wanted the civic body to complete the roadwork at the earliest. A senior Corporation official of the Adyar zone said 114 roads, totalling 20 km of length, were proposed to be repaired at a cost of Rs. 4.60 crore, for which contractors had been finalised. The civic official said streets coming in the peripheral areas of Velachery like Ram Nagar, Vijayanagar, Bethel Avenue, VGP Selva Nagar, Srinivasa Nagar, Bhuvaneswari Nagar, and the main localities of Dhandeeswaram Nagar, Tansi Nagar, Jaganathapuram, Rajalakshmi Nagar and Orandiamman Koil Street are proposed to be relaid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/roadwork-in-full-swing-in-velachery/article33975955.ece
03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Not behaving like big brother’||The DMK leadership on Tuesday rejected the perception that it was behaving like a “big brother” at the seat-sharing talks with its allies. The talks were being held smoothly and cordially, the party said. “Do you think we can behave like a big brother with the Congress and the Communists? We are talking to them cordially. We are not like [former Chief Minister] Jayalalithaa, who had announced the constituencies that her party [the AIADMK] would contest even as talks with the alliance partners were in progress [in 2011],” DMK principal secretary K.N. Nehru said. He and organisation secretary R.S. Bharathi interacted with journalists. They said none of the allies expressed dissatisfaction at the talks. “They can demand as many seats as they wish. But we can only offer what we have. There are a lot of allies this time, and we have to share the seats with them. There is no dissatisfaction among them, though a section outside sought to create such an impression,” he said. The two leaders pointed out that even Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who held talks for three hours after midnight with the ruling AIADMK, could not finalise a deal. ‘Not a problem’ Mr. Nehru said the Congress was allotted 41 seats last time since there were not many allies. “There is no problem... Everything will be all right in a few days,” he added. The DMK leaders did not agree with a suggestion that such a problem had never occurred when M. Karunanidhi was alive. “Even then, there was a stalemate. Many rounds of talks are necessary. How can we decide on the demands of the allies in a flash. We need to talk,” Mr. Nehru said. Mr. Nehru and Mr. Bharathi said the DMK would contest in the maximum number of seats. “The number will be known only after the talks are over,” Mr. Bharathi said. Asked whether pressure was mounted on the allies to get them to contest on the DMK’s symbol, Mr. Bharathi said it would be easy to contest on the known symbol. “We are ready to allow them. What is your problem?” he said. There was no basis to the report that youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin had decided to opt out of the race in Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni. “A person submits application only to contest,” Mr. Nehru said. The two leaders said the exclusive reservation for the Vanniyars was announced by the AIADMK government with an eye on the upcoming election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-behaving-like-big-brother/article33975949.ece
03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Encroachments removed from pavements at Pudupet||The city police, with the help of traders, removed encroachments from pavements at Pudupet, a hub for automobile spare parts in the city. Usually, the roads and pavements are choked with vehicle spare parts displayed by traders. Pedestrians find it difficult to walk on the congested main road, especially during peak hours. P. Subramani, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Egmore, said: “We held a meeting with traders to ensure removal of all encroachments and convinced them to remove the materials such as display boards and vehicles from pavements. The pavement is meant only for pedestrians to walk without any hindrance.” Association holds meet K.H.

The Meteorological Department has forecast dry, hot weather ahead for most parts of the State this week. However, one or two places in south Tamil Nadu may receive light rain around March 6, officials of the Meteorological Department said.

Parthasarathy for allegedly being part of a job scam, along with his son and others. In 2019, Parthasarathy’s son Vishveshwar, 29, and his accomplices — Rajapandi of Perambur, Arumugam of Madurai and Raju of Villivakkam — were arrested following several complaints of cheating. An investigation revealed that Vishveshwar had issued fake appointment orders for jobs, including the post of the public relations officer at Anna University, assistant engineers, junior engineers, junior assistant and office assistant posts at Tangedco, after taking Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 15 lakh each. While Vishveshwar was the main accused, the others worked as his agents. The victims were mostly from Erode and Madurai. The police suspect the gang might have cheated youth from Chennai as well. “Following a probe, the involvement of Parthasarathy came to light. The offences were committed with his connivance.

03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK, BJP and PMK using caste for electoral gains: Thirumavalavan||Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan on Tuesday slammed the AIADMK and its allies, the BJP and the PMK, on the Vanniyar reservation issue. The AIADMK government had recently enacted a legislation providing 10.5% internal reservation for Vanniyars in higher education and government jobs within the MBC quota. In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan said that providing internal reservation for one particular community was nothing more than an attempt to make ‘electoral gains by moving the caste pieces’. He said that the law would be struck down if one of the aggrieved communities in the MBC category goes to court as it is not based on caste census. “The AIADMK-BJP-PMK combine knows this truth. Despite that, they want to showcase this law to reap electoral benefits,” he charged. According to him, this was a reflection of the BJP’s national politics of “deepening caste divisions by creating fake sentiment and affecting the unity” in the society through the AIADMK that is “under the complete control of the BJP”. “Did non-Vanniyar communities in the MBC category ask for internal reservations? Why were they split? They have given 7% for 93 communities (25 communities such as Paravar, Meenavar, Vettuva Gounder and another 68 communities under denotified tribes) and 2.5% for 26 communities such as Isai Vellalar. By doing this, they have forced these communities to protest against the internal reservations,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said that this would affect the reservations for communities in the MBC quota including the Vanniyars. “If reservations are about implementing social justice, internal reservation is just a micro-version of it. I don’t have another opinion on it. But it is important to understand how PMK, BJP and AIADMK view it,” said Mr. Thirumavalavan. He recalled how Governor Banwarilal Purohit delayed granting of assent to the Bill that guaranteed 7.5% reservations for government school students in medical admissions but had consented to the internal reservations Bill in a matter of hours. “This is an attempt to divide the MBC communities, increase the distance between them and break their unity. This has been done for electoral gains temporarily,” he charged. Mr. Thirumavalavan asked why the PMK settled for 10.5% internal reservations based on the 1931 census after demanding 20% separate reservations. “Why did they agree to settle for almost half of the original demand? Was their original demand based on a lie or is it all a drama to mobilise Vanniyar votes? Won’t the 9.5% Vanniyars be affected because of this?,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said that this has split the other MBC communities from the Vanniyar communities and the people will defeat the AIADMK-BJP-PMK alliance in the Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-bjp-and-pmk-using-caste-for-electoral-gains-thirumavalavan/article33975548.ece
03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK to sign pacts with allies today||The ruling AIADMK is likely to ink seat-sharing agreements on Wednesday with most of its allies, including the BJP. The other parties include the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar), the Thamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) and the New Justice Party (NJP). Last Saturday, the AIADMK signed a deal with the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) for 23 seats. According to AIADMK and BJP sources, the BJP may get 24 seats, DMDK 15, TMC(M) 3, TMMK 2 and the NJP 1, subject to the last-minute changes. Having contested in the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Kanniyakumari, the BJP will again get the seat, where a byelection is to be held along with the Assembly election. As the TMMK and the NJP are expected to contest on the ruling party’s ‘two leaves’ symbol, the number of the seats to be contested by the AIADMK is around 170. With the possibility of roping in the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) having been ruled out, the AIADMK did not lose time in re-establishing its contact with the DMDK. “To the extent possible, we have accommodated their demands,” explained a leader, adding that the DMDK had earlier scaled down its demand to at least 20 seats, coming to know that there would be no parity with the PMK. Patch-up idea After sensing that the ruling party did not support the idea of patching up with the AMMK, the BJP decided to revise its demand for 40 seats, but it wanted seats of its choice, especially in the western districts. But the AIADMK, too, is keen on contesting in as many seats as possible in the region. However, sources in the two parties say the identification of seats had almost been completed. On Monday or Tuesday next, the details of seat distribution will be out. The ruling party will announce its candidates around the same time, the AIADMK leader said.  Having contested in the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Kanniyakumari, the BJP will again get the seat||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-to-sign-pacts-with-allies-today/article33975549.ece
03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK sticks to 18-seat offer to Cong.||The talks between the DMK and the Congress on Tuesday could not progress further as the DMK leadership refused to increase its original offer of 18 seats. Further, the two Communist parties could not reach an agreement as the DMK offered them only four seats each. “The DMK seems to be firm. We do not know how to break the deadlock. In fact, we are shocked by the unrelenting stand of the DMK leadership,” a leader of a Left party told The Hindu on Tuesday. No progress Congress leaders, including Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri, held talks for over 70 minutes with the DMK team, led by treasurer T.R. Baalu, at Anna Arivalayam. “There was no progress since they have not increased the number. The next round will be held only after the DMK leadership gets back to us,” said a Congress leader. The Congress leaders had told their DMK counterparts that the offer should match the status of the national party which had been part of the DMK alliance for 15 years [except in 2014]. “The alliance will take off successfully only if all partners are satisfied. Otherwise, we can share the dais, and there will be no cordiality among the workers,” said the Congress leader. The Left leaders also expressed similar sentiments. “We may adjust in view of the greater threat from the BJP and the Sangh Parivar that seek to find a toehold in Tamil Nadu. But it is not easy to convince the rank and file,” a Left leader said. Asked about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s stand on the alliance, another Congress leader said Mr. Gandhi was for the continuation of the alliance. “But he wants us to have a dignified status,” he said. The DMK seems to have evolved a formula of allotting two seats each per Lok Sabha constituencies won by the allies. It has fixed 18 seats for the Congress since it won 9 seats (including in Puducherry). As the CPI and the CPI(M) won two each, they have been offered four seats each.  Congress leaders, including TNCC president K.S. Alagiri, held talks for over 70 minutes with the DMK team led by treasurer T.R.

03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Ethics, empathy and spirituality are going down in medical profession‘||Ethics, empathy and spirituality were going down in the medical profession due to increased commercialisation, said V. Mohan, chairman, Dr. Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre. Speaking after the launch of his autobiography titled Making Excellence A Habit , he said that the medical profession had lost the kind of respect that it once had. He said that more than talking about diabetes, he wanted to bring out in his book how ethics, empathy and spirituality could still be combined with medicine. Mohan Kameswaran, managing director, Madras ENT Research Foundation, said the message Dr. Mohan had not spelt out but conveyed in every page of the book was to not lose one’s humanity. “The conflict between his head and heart comes through in every chapter,” he said. “When we entered the profession, we never knew that we will be entering an industry,” he said. Venu Srinivasan, chairman, TVS Motor Company, who released the book, lauded Dr. Mohan for his hard work, deep knowledge and diligent approach. “He has worked hard at all stages of his career in setting up this institution, a research centre, and treating almost a million patients. However, all this is underscored by a deep devotion and sense of service. That is what sets him apart from many other practitioners,” he said.

When an advocate made a mention before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy and sought the leave of the court to list the case for early hearing, the judges said the matter would be taken up next week. The law was passed by the State legislature on February 26 and received the Governor’s assent on the same day.

03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||TTV dismisses talk of AMMK joining AIADMK front||Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran on Tuesday dismissed the talk of his party joining the front led by the AIADMK. Talking to journalists, he termed “speculative” the reports of the BJP pressuring the AIADMK to accommodate the AMMK. As decided by the general council of his party last week, the AMMK would head a coalition with the sole objective of preventing the DMK from returning to power. He and AMMK functionaries were in touch with “several and important” parties. “I am willing to talk to all those parties that are opposed to the DMK. They all can join the front to be led by the AMMK. As far as I am concerned, I do not believe in treating any party undesirable,” he said. Answering a question whether the Congress was one of the parties approached by the AMMK, he replied, “At present, it won’t be proper on my part to reveal the identity of the parties.” As and when the negotiations reached the final stage, he would announce the constituents of the coalition. He denied the suggestion that he had in recent times toned down his criticism of the Central government, especially over the rising prices of petroleum products. “I have called for reducing the hike. I have been making my comments, as done in the past. Even with regard to the Union Budget, I had said it had some amount of happiness and much room for concerns,” he said. On the State government’s decision to provide 10.5% quota for the Vanniyars, the AMMK leader said the opinion of the public should have been gathered first and the reservation system should be framed in such a manner that it would be acceptable to all sections.  I am willing to talk to all those parties that are opposed to the DMK. They all can join the front||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ttv-dismisses-talk-of-ammk-joining-aiadmk-front/article33975552.ece
03 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘T.N. govt.’s ad not promotion of ruling party’||The Election Commission of India (EC) on Tuesday told the Madras High Court that a recent advertisement campaign carried out by the Tamil Nadu government to showcase its achievements in the last four years did not contain either the election symbol of the AIADMK or the name of the ruling party. Hence, it could not be construed as use of public funds to publicise the party, it said. Filing a counter-affidavit before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy in reply to a case filed by the DMK, the EC said: “The occurrence of photographs of former Chief Ministers along with the present Chief Minister also cannot be taken as promotion of the political party so as to invoke paragraph 16A of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968.” Withdraw recognition Paragraph 16A of the 1968 Order empowers the Commission to suspend or withdraw recognition of a political party for its failure to observe the ‘Model Code of Conduct for Guidance of Political Parties and Candidates’ or to follow the lawful directions and instructions issued by the Commission from time to time in order to ensure conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections and to safeguard the interests of the electorate. After submitting the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the EC as well as Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Satyabrata Sahoo, advocate Niranjan Rajagopalan told the court that the advertisement campaign, about which the DMK had complained to the EC, was carried out before the Assembly election date was announced. However, after the announcement on February 26, a ban had been imposed on government advertisements too. Govt. functions The Commission had written to the State government on February 26 itself asking it to stop issuing such advertisements, he said. Advocate-General Vijay Narayan, assisted by Special Government Pleader E. Manohar, said not just government advertisements but government functions, too, could not be conducted as long as the model of code of conduct was in force in the State in view of the elections scheduled on April 6. However, senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the DMK, said the EC should be directed to pass written orders on representations made by the DMK complaining about the advertisement campaign so that the party could have an opportunity to challenge the Commission’s decision. Accepting his submissions, the Bench directed the EC to dispose of those representations within a week. Authoring the order, the Chief Justice said the case appeared to be the first pre-election sparring between two principal political parties in the State before the actual competition on the ground began. Impressing upon the need to ensure fair play and a sportive spirit during election time, he appealed to all political parties to eschew any form of violence or incitement of violence on the streets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-governments-advertisement-not-promotion-of-ruling-party/article33975556.ece

Talking to reporters after the first round of seat-sharing talks, he said the DMK also had expressed its difficulties since it had to accommodate all parties that had joined the alliance. “We had a friendly discussion. DMK leaders listened to our request with utmost concern. They have asked us to consult our party leaders. CPI(M) will continue in the DMK alliance. We hope that there will be a smooth end to seat-sharing talks,” he said. Asked about AMMK leader T.T.V. Dinakaran’s assertion that the defeat of the DMK was more important, he said the reality was that DMK alliance would win the elections. CPI leader R. Mutharasan also participated in the talks.  Meanwhile, MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Tuesday reiterated that his party would contest on its own symbol in the Assembly poll as part of the DMK-led alliance. When told that a separate symbol would be allotted by the Election Commission only if his party contested in 12 seats, he said he could not respond to speculations. Mr.Vaiko explained that a party could obtain recognition of the Election Commission if it was able to win eight seats. He said the MDMK had held the first round of talks with the DMK. The next round would take place after the party sent a word. When asked whether the DMK leadership was taking an inflexible stand when it came to seat-sharing, he said it was natural for the party to contest in more seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpim-will-continue-in-dmk-alliance/article33975551.ece

A statement issued by K. Ramakrishnan, additional director general, DGGI, Coimbatore zonal unit, on Tuesday said that its officers conducted simultaneous search operations on Monday at the residence-cum-business premises of the man who is into cardamom trade, based on intelligence that he ran a fake bill trading racket without actual supply or receipt of goods. The firm had obtained fictitious registrations across five States namely Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala and Tamil Nadu with a view to generate and pass on fraudulent input tax credit (ITC). All these firms dealt with the trade of cardamom in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. These firms controlled by the businessman have received invoices without supply of goods with a taxable value of approximately Rs. 840 crore, thereby availing and passing on fraudulent ITC of around Rs. 44.85 core to various entities, said the statement. The person is stated to have set up and controlled 10 separate GST registrations, some of which created under his own PAN, while other companies were registered in the name of his relatives and friends in order to generate and receive invoices without supply of goods and also receive ITC from these fake companies to offset his outward GST liability. This resulted in huge loss of revenue to the Government. During the search operations, incriminating documents such as sales and purchase copies of the fake firms and cheque books/pass books and debit cards of the bank accounts set up in the name of these fake firms were recovered from his residence and business premises. The offender has admitted to have issued fake bills through multiple fictitious registrations by misusing the facility extended by Government under GST regime for ease of doing business. The proxy firms floated by him have availed or passed on ITC without actual supply or receipt of goods, said the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/businessman-arrested-for-gst-evasion-of-rs-45-crore/article33975576.ece

03 March 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||Cash curb hits sales at Gani market||With valid documents mandatory for carrying cash above Rs. 50,000, traders from other districts and States did not turn up for purchase at the weekly E.K.M. Abdul Gani textile market (Gani market) here on Tuesday. There are over 700 weekly shops at the textile market that functions from Monday night to Tuesday night that witnesses brisk business as merchants from other districts and other States arrive in large numbers for bulk purchases. Since the model code of conduct (MCC) is in force, the Election Commission had mandated that people should carry valid documents for carrying cash above Rs. 50,000 or warned that the cash would be seized. “Restriction on cash possession has hit transactions severely”, said a trader who feared that their business would be affected till the MCC is withdrawn. Only a few local merchants visited us on Tuesday, he added. Traders said that with summer setting in, the demand for cotton dress materials will be very good. “Since traders will not turn up for the next four to six weeks, sales volume will be less than 20% when compared to normal sales volume”, said a trader Pugal. He said that traders will not be able to carry cash or use the Automated Teller Machines for making payments. “Usually during elections we face this problem for over one-and-half months”, he added. On Tuesday, most of the retail shops wore a deserted look as a very few local traders and public turned up at the market. Traders also said that though polling will take place on April 6, counting of votes is scheduled for May 2 and hence they have to wait for withdrawal of MCC for more days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cash-curb-hits-sales-at-gani-market/article33975584.ece
03 March 2021||KARUR,TAMIL NADU||Allegations of distribution of gifts to voters fly thick and fast in Karur||Allegations of gift distribution to voters by political parties, including the ruling AIADMK and the Opposition DMK, have surfaced in Karur. Though both Dravidian majors are yet to finalise seat-sharing arrangements with their allies, electioneering has begun in the constituency soon after the schedule was announced. Both parties have formed booth committees and started reaching out to the voters. The sitting MLA and Transport Minister, M.R. Vijayabaskar, is expected to be re-nominated by the AIADMK. Aravakurichi MLA and former Minister V. Senthil Balaji, of the DMK, is trying to contest against Mr. Vijayabaskar. It is alleged that the two parties have started distributing gifts at night. While one is said to have distributed stainless steel plates, the other has allegedly handed out saris, dhotis and stainless steel plates to many voters at Vengamedu, Kulathupalayam,Sengunthapur- am, Rayanur and Pasupathipalayam. Ward secretaries and functionaries, hand-picked by the parties, would visit the houses in their wards during the day and alert the residents to expect “gifts or cash” late at night or in the early hours. They invariably keep their promises. “A man, who claimed to be representing the DMK, delivered three stainless steel plates for three voters at my home on February 28. The next day, another person, said to be of the AIADMK, handed over three sets of saris and dhoties. They do not seem to be wary of election officials,” said a 50-year-old man who runs a textile unit at Sengunthapuram. He said he had employed 60 persons at his unit. Of them, 35 were from Karur. All of them had received stainless steel plates, saris and dhoties from the DMK and the AIADMK. M. Pughal Murugan, a leader of the Makkal Needhi Maiam, said the distribution of gifts had been taking place openly. Thousands of voters had been given gifts even before the candidates were announced by the DMK and the AIADMK, he said. Collector-cum-District Election Officer S. Malarvizhi told The Hindu that she had not received any complaint about the distribution of gifts, though she had received complaints about the violation of the model code of conduct. A team would be asked to verify the claims immediately. Officials had been asked to check out whether bulk purchases of stainless steel plates, saris and dhoties had taken place in Karur or other areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allegations-of-distribution-of-gifts-fly-thick-and-fast-in-karur/article33975550.ece

The court observed that the petitioner sought the High Court to play the role of a conservative censor board to monitor and control the content of what was broadcast over the social media. Though specific complaints may be entertained, courts are not there to impose sanctions or guidelines on how the media or even social media operates and it is for the other agencies to do so, based on the policy decision taken by the legislature of the day or the executive arm, the judges said. “It would be open to the petitioner to propagate the kind of philosophy that he sought to espouse.

03 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Two parties show interest in recycling demolition debris’||Two private parties have shown interest in processing and recycling construction and demolition waste within the city, in response to a call made out by Madurai Corporation. The Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016, mandates the local bodies to work along with waste generators to process construction and demolition waste and recycle them to manufacture non-structural concrete, paver blocks or other materials that can be used in laying roads or pavements. Around 25- 30 tonnes of construction and demolition waste is generated in Madurai city every day. The Corporation has earmarked four places across the 100 wards of the city for dumping construction and demolition waste — Vellaikkal, Masthanpatti, Vilangudi and inside Chinna Kanmoi (tank) near Anuppanadi railway gate. The selection of the spot at Chinna Kanmoi had received wide criticism from the local residents. Although the rules have been in place since 2016, there is no proper implementation of the rules, said a corporation official. "There are still many instances where the construction debris is dumped along roadside and inside waterbodies," said the official. As the first step in adherence to the rules, the Corporation had called out for parties that would process and recycle the construction and demolition debris. "Two private parties had shown interest. Proposals will be obtained from them and evaluated. Further works will be carried out only after the conduct of the Assembly elections," said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-parties-show-interest-in-recycling-demolition-debris/article33976081.ece

Disposing of a batch of petitions seeking a direction to stop transportation of minerals, a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi observed that implementation of Section 23 C of the Act was the discretion of the State government as the court could not go into the issue which was in the realm of the executive. The court observed that Section 23 C provided for measures that could be taken, including arrangement of weigh bridges, establishment of check-posts for checking of minerals under transit and regulation of minerals being transported from the areas granted under licences. The judges said the government was the custodian of natural resources. Therefore, the transport of minerals would to be regulated and the natural resources must be preserved for posterity.

03 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||A boost for Congress at the right time||The Congress has got a much-needed fillip at the most appropriate time, say political commentators in the southern districts. The visit of party leader Rahul Gandhi to the region has invigorated the cadre and office-bearers who were not hopeful of the party’s prospects. During his three-day campaign in the four districts from February 27, Mr. Rahul’s down-to-earth approach, humour, clarity in thoughts on pressing issues appealed to the party workers as well as the public. Even when he criticised the ruling BJP and the AIADMK, he was decorous. As the public acknowledged his points with wild cheers, Mr. Gandhi addressed gatherings even at unscheduled places. After interacting with advocates in Thoothukudi and the salt-pan workers, he closed out with a public meeting near Nanguneri. Impressed with the huge crowd, he said: “Excellent arrangements.” On February 28, despite being a sunny Sunday, a huge crowd waited at Paavoorchathram, Surandai and Sernthamaram, all in Tenkasi district, and greeted him with flower petals. At Alangulam, the gathering wanted him to garland a Kamaraj statue. After the police denied permission on security grounds, Mr. Rahul garlanded the statue of the leader at Paavoorchathram, the next stop, where over 5,000 people patted applause to mark his arrival. He got a good reception even in smaller and interior places such as Surandai, Sernthamaram, Puliyangudi and Kadayanallur. Since Kamaraj is revered like a god at these places, the very mention of his name evoked cheers. And Mr. Gandhi went on to recall Kamaraj’s contribution to Tamil Nadu, connecting his achievements with the situation after demonetisation and the introduction of the GST regime. Congress bastion The reception he received in Kanniyakumari district, considered a Congress bastion, could have been better, party leaders felt. The gathering was huge at Kanniyakumari and Colachel, but not so at other places. His visit to the memorial of late Kanniyakumari MP H. Vasanthakumar through the narrow roads of Agastheeswaram won the hearts of people of all walks. “We had never expected Mr. Gandhi to be here to pay homage at his memorial,” said Balakrishnan of Agastheeswaram. Even as Congress leaders and workers were anticipating a “formal campaign”, Mr. Gandhi brought in a lively mix. He interacted with roadside-vendors, tea-vendors, schoolchildren and others spontaneously. When he visited a teashop at Valliammalpuram near Sattankulam or enjoyed a sip of tender coconut at the entrance of Alangulam, he enquired with the vendors about their families in a smattering of Tamil. “Frankly, we did not expect such a rousing response... People’s love and affection for our leader reminded us of the days of Kamaraj. Mr. Gandhi’s approach to campaigning and his decency while criticising the government’s performance had a positive impact on the people. So the workers are upbeat,” Congress functionary Ruby Manoharan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-boost-for-congress-at-the-right-time/article33975544.ece

03 March 2021||TIRUPPUR,TAMIL NADU||ATM heist: Tiruppur rural police bust Haryana-based gang||Two days after an automated teller machine (ATM) machine of Bank of Baroda containing Rs. 1 lakh was stolen by a group of men, the Tiruppur District (Rural) Police on Tuesday busted a Haryana-based gang of six persons. The gang followed a modus operandi of stealing the ATM, taking it away in a stolen vehicle, then transferring it to a container truck, and later abandoning it after taking away the cash. Seven special teams constituted by Tiruppur Rural Superintendent of Police Disha Mittal zeroed in on the accused on Monday evening and arrested them on Tuesday. The arrested have been identified as Rahul (24), Rafiq (24), Shahid (25), Shajith (21), Irshad (38) and Kasim Khan (45), all from Haryana. The police recovered Rs. 69,120 from the accused, out of the Rs. 1,00,100 that was in the stolen ATM. According to R. Dhanarasu, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kangeyam, the special teams got specific information about a container truck bearing Haryana registration, which the police suspected that the accused could have used in the heist. Hiding in truck The truck was found parked near a warehouse at Thirunagar Colony near Karungalpalayam in Erode district around 6 p.m. on Monday and the police apprehended the accused who were hiding inside. During questioning, the accused told the police that they stole a sports utility vehicle belonging to Subramani of Nallikaundanpalayam at Ingur near Perundurai in Erode district and used it to steal the ATM from Sarkar Periyapalayam on Tiruppur – Uthukuli road around 4 a.m. on February 28. The men had pulled out the ATM from its counter using a rope tied to the SUV. The vehicle was abandoned at Vijayamangalam near Perundurai after shifting the ATM to the truck. “The truck had come to Bengaluru with a consignment. Then it was brought to Tamil Nadu for the heist,” said Mr. Dhanarasu. Uthukuli Inspector S. Balasundaram said two country-made pistols were also seized from the accused. They had bought the guns for Rs. 7,000 per piece from Haryana. Nine live rounds were also seize.

03 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Citizens flag road maintenance issues||A whopping 5,435 instances of potholes, bad stretches of roads and footpaths have been reported by citizens through WhatsApp chatbot to the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA), which conducted a random survey to ascertain the status of the city’s roads and footpaths on the directions of the Karnataka High Court. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oak and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty on Tuesday took note of the report submitted by the KSLSA’s Member-Secretary H. Shashidhar Shetty after analysing inputs from citizens and random inspection of several stretches of roads by para-legal volunteers. While directing the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to come out with an action plan to fill potholes, repair bad roads and footpaths, the bench also directed BBMP’s Chief Engineers in charge of road infrastructure to personally attend the next hearing on the PIL petition, through which court is monitoring the conditions of roads, to explain the technique that would be adopted to fill up potholes. The report pointed out that of the 5,435 response from citizens, 437 were related to potholes and bad road issues, and the remaining 4,998 are related to footpaths. The KSLSA received these responses from citizens within 20 days beginning from January 11 through the chatbot, created in association with Reap Benefit, an NGO, to exclusively receive inputs from citizens on the status of roads and footpaths in their locality. Of the 4,998 footpath related inputs, 3,531 were about blocked footpaths, 1,443 were of damaged footpaths, and the remaining 24 were of not building a footpath, the report stated while pointing that inputs from citizens indicated that garbage, street vendors and parking of vehicles are the main causes for blocking of footpaths. BBMP’s claim On BBMP’s claim made in February 2020 that 74 roads are free from potholes, the report stated that its volunteers inspected 25 of these roads, and majority of them were not free from potholes. Only four stretches – Bannerughatta Road to Bilekalli Kodichikkenahalli Main Road; K.R. Road to 9th Cross Chamarajpet; Uma theatre signal to BEMS College; and Ashrama Junction to National College Circle – were found to be pothole-free during an inspection conducted on February 1, 2021, the report pointed out. The report mentioned that the BBMP did not furnish documents sought on road maintenance due to which KSLSA could could not assess quality of roads with the assistance of officials of the National Highways Authority of India. It was not possible, due to non submission of documents, to ascertain whether BBMP is really invoking the Defect Liability Period (DLP) clause in contracts, and compelling the contractor concerned to carry out repair of damaged roads within the DLP. Earlier, BBMP counsel submitted that a majority of complaints related to newly added areas to BBMP where works of laying underground drainage and drinking water supply pipes are under way. The bench replied that the BBMP can give many excuses, but the fact remain that all the areas are under its jurisdiction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/citizens-flag-road-maintenance-issues/article33975928.ece
03 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||On-site registration for COVID-19 vaccination begins in urban areas||Following several complaints that the lack of on-site registration in urban areas, especially Bengaluru, was inconveniencing senior citizens, the State Health Department started on-site registration in BBMP limits from Tuesday. Senior citizens were finding it hard to upload documents online. This is mainly because most of them are not computer literate. It was a problem even for those who know how to use computers as the CoWIN portal either does not open or is very slow. “Although the portal opened, I was unable to get an appointment. I tried for an appointment in at least 18 vaccination centres but was unable to register on Tuesday,” said K.B. Krishnamurthy, a resident of K.R. Puram. Another senior citizen from Malleswaram who had returned without getting vaccinated from K.C. General Hospital on Monday as on-site registration had not opened, said she had to take the help of a relative to register online. Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said on-site registrations had started in Bengaluru from Tuesday. “We are aware of the problems senior citizens are facing. But, we had to keep online registrations in urban areas to avoid crowding at vaccination centres,” he said. Arundathi Chandrashekar, State Mission Director, National Health Mission (NHM), said the department wanted to stablise the portal issues before allowing on-site registrations in urban areas. “We have started on-site registrations in BBMP areas from Tuesday and will expand this to other urban areas in a day or two,” she said. Admitting that the CoWIN portal issues had hit the second phase, she said: “There is a lot of eagerness among senior citizens and those above 45 with comorbidities to get vaccinated. This phase has been much better in comparison to the first. But the CoWIN portal issues are delaying the process of beneficiary verification and OTP generation. These issues have been resolved to some extent on Tuesday but as this is a pan-India problem, it will take a day or two to stabilise.”  Total vaccinations Meanwhile, a total of 5,166 senior citizens and 1,147 above 45 years with comorbidities got vaccinated on Tuesday. Cumulatively from Monday, a total of 7,426 senior citizens and 1,771 above 45 years with comorbidities have been vaccinated. Bengaluru Urban recorded the highest numbers - 766 and 1,387 - respectively, in both these categories, cumulatively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/on-site-registration-for-covid-19-vaccination-begins-in-urban-areas/article33975614.ece

03 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Anganwadi, RTC workers protest seeking pay hike||Ahead of the State Budget, scheduled to be presented on March 8, thousands of anganwadi workers and employees of road transport corporations held rallies and protests in Bengaluru on Tuesday seeking a pay hike. Both groups demanded that they be treated on a par with government employees of their equivalent cadre and be made eligible for benefits such as health insurance and pension schemes. At present, following a hike in honorarium in 2019, anganwadi workers get Rs. 10,000 while helpers get Rs. 5,000 a month. The Karnataka State United Anganwadi Workers’ Union has demanded that they be treated on a par with Group ‘C’ and ‘D’ employees, or until that happens be given equal pay for equal work — Rs. 25,000 for workers and Rs. 21,000 for helpers. “The LPG cylinder price has shot up and the cost of living has gone up immensely even as our pay remains the same,” Rama T.C., a union member, said. Peddappaiah, Commissioner of the Department of Women and Child Development, who visited the protesters, said the government was considering the demand for a pay hike based on seniority for anganwadi workers. A meeting with Women and Child Development Minister Shashikala Jolle is scheduled for Wednesday. Meanwhile, Karnataka State Road Transport Employees’ League, which had protested for four days in December 2020 and procured a written commitment from the State government to fulfil nine demands, alleged that none of their demands have been met yet. Services remained unaffected. “The government expressed difficulty in taking all of us on its rolls, but had promised to implement the Sixth Pay Commission in three months. The deadline ends on March 15. We demand that the State Budget make an announcement in this regard,” said K. Thippeswamy, general secretary of the league. Sources in the KSRTC saidRTCs had already held three meetings on pay revision and it was a cumbersome process which could not be hurried. KSRTC officials added that they had already fulfilled six other demands — something the employees dispute. The league has threatened to go on an indefinite strike from March 15 if the members’ demands are not met. LPG price hike The women’s wing ofKPCC staged a protest against the hike in price of LPG cooking gas cylinders. The price of a cylinder has shot up by over Rs. 100 inthe last month alone, now sitting at Rs. 822.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/anganwadi-rtc-workers-protest-seeking-pay-hike/article33975618.ece
03 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC to hear Kangana’s plea on March 18||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday adjourned hearing till March 18 on a petition filed by film actor Kangana Ranaut challenging an order of a trial court in Tumakuru district directing the police to register a criminal case against her based on a private complaint filed by a lawyer alleging that her tweet on protest against farm laws amounts to inciting violence. Justice H.P. Sandesh, before whom the petition came up for hearing, directed Ms. Ranaut’s advocate to rectify the objections raised by the court’s registry while ordering to post the petition for hearing on March 18. When her advocate requested the court to consider passing an interim order, the court said it would consider the plea after the defect pointed out by the registry was rectified. A Judicial Magistrate First Class on in October 2020 had directed the Kyathasandra police in Tumakuru to register a first information report (FIR) and submit an investigation report to the court based on the complaint lodged by Ramesh Naik L., a Tumakuru-based advocate. Ms. Ranaut had tweeted: “People who spread misinformation and rumours about CAA [Citizenship Amendment Act] that caused riots are the same people who are now spreading misinformation about Farmer’s bill and causing terror in the nation, they are Terrorists. You very well know what I said but simply like to spread misinformation.” The complainant had alleged that her tweet on protest against farm laws attracted offence under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including under Section 153 for wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot, and under Section 153A for promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-to-hear-kanganas-plea-on-march-18/article33975747.ece

In the online petition on Change.org, the All India Professionals’ Congress (AIPC) Karnataka has demanded that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who also handles the Bengaluru Development portfolio, make roads a priority for the safety of citizens. “The callous negligence of road maintenance by our agencies has cost Tasdeeq and her family dearly,” stated the petition. In February, Ms. Bushra came under the wheels of a truck while negotiating a bad stretch on Hennur Main Road on her two-wheeler. “She was trying to avoid a crater on the road, a common sight on most roads now... “Her family had seen her off to college feeling proud that she was finally on her way to realising her dreams.

03 March 2021||Bengaluru/mysuru,KARNATAKA||Mayoral poll row: KPCC show-cause notice for Sait||The disciplinary committee of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) on Tuesday served a show-cause notice to former Minister and MLA Tanveer Sait seeking an explanation on the political developments related to the mayoral election in Mysuru and the forging of a tie-up with the JD(S) there. The matter has led to differences within the party, with Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah objecting to the party giving up the Mayor’s post to the JD(S). In the hung Mysuru City Corporation, the BJP has 22 members, the Congress 19, the JD(S) 18, and the BSP one. There are five Independents. Following instructions from the party high command, KPCC disciplinary committee chairman K. RahmanKhan has issued a notice to Mr. Sait seeking his explanation on the developments. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Sait said, “I am a disciplined soldier of the party. I will reply to the notice in 2-3 days and provide all the details and circumstances that led to the alliance.” Both Mr. Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar had told him to form an alliance with the JD(S) to get the post of Mayor. However, the party failed to secure that post and settled for the post of Deputy Mayor, he said. Mr. Sait, who was instrumental in the formation of the tie-up, defended the alliance to keep the BJP out of power. He met Mr. Shivakumar at the Congress office on Tuesday and submitted a report on the MCC polls. KPCC working president R. Dhruvanarayana had met the KPCC president and submitted his report on Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Siddaramaiah has been annoyed over the KPCC president’s “interference” in the MCC polls and the ceding of the Mayor’s post to the JD(S) without consulting him. Mr. Sait said that he had not made any mistake and had formed the alliance on the party’s instructions. However, he admitted that it was wrong on the part of some party workers to shout slogans against Mr. Siddaramaiah in Mysuru. Asked whether he had become a victim of the differences between Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Shivakumar, Mr. Sait merely said, “The people of the State are watching it.” Earlier in the day, All-India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Madhu Goud Yakshi met Mr. Shivakumar and discussed the political developments in the State. Late at night, in a possible conciliatory move, Mr. Shivakumar met Mr. Siddaramaiah at his residence. On Monday, former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda had criticised Mr. Siddaramaiah for the Congress’ alleged attempts to poach JD(S) councillors to get the Mayor’s post in Mysuru. AICC observer in Mysuru Meanwhile, Mr. Goud arrived in Mysuru on Tuesday to look into the mayoral poll issue. According to Mr. Dhruvanarayana, Mr. Goud is expected to submit a report on the matter to AICC general secretary Randeep Surjewala in New Delhi on Wednesday. Mr. Goud met a number of party leaders at the Jaladarshini Guest House in Mysuru. He will also submit separate reports to Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mayoral-poll-row-kpcc-show-cause-notice-for-sait/article33975621.ece
03 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Implementation of NEP being worked out: Suresh Kumar||Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Tuesday said the State Cabinet had given in-principle approval for implementation of the new National Education Policy (NEP) and the plan of action was being worked out. Speaking to presspersons after participating in a seminar on the role of teachers and educational institutions in implementation of NEP in Hubballi on Tuesday, Mr. Kumar said the taskforce on implementation of NEP headed by former Chief Secretary H.V. Ranganath and former Vice-Chancellor Thimme Gowda had already submitted its report. The State government was contemplating implementation of NEP based on the recommendations of the taskforce, he said. Mr. Kumar said considering the surge in COVID-19 cases in the neighbouring States of Karnataka, the Centre had expressed concerns. Consequently, the government had put off the decision to restart classes for first to fifth standard students. “We are waiting for the report by experts of the Health Department on the issue. Children’s health is our priority. If at all private schools start these classes, strict action will be taken against them,” he said. Earlier, speaking at the seminar, Mr. Kumar emphasised that it was the duty of teachers and educational institutions to study NEP and think about its implementation. “The policy should be nearer to the land’s culture. Karnataka has played a crucial role in the formulation of NEP. Scholars like Kasturi Rangan, former Vice-Chancellor M.G. Sridhar, and Anurag Behra of Azim Premji Foundation have played important roles in formulation of NEP,” he said. Member of Legislative Council S.V. Sankanur and others were present. Subsequently, the Minister visited the government school at Agadi in Hubballi taluk and interacted with students and residents of the village. The residents submitted a memorandum to the Minister seeking additional educational facilities in the village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/implementation-of-nep-being-worked-out-suresh-kumar/article33975609.ece
03 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||DNA testing helps identify genetic disorders: Former V-C||DNA tests help a great deal in diagnosing genetic disorders and diseases transmitted genetically, former Vice-Chancellor of Karnatak University Pramod Gai has said. He was inaugurating ‘DNA testing’ organised as part of National Science Day at Dharwad Regional Science Centre in Dharwad on Tuesday. Prof. Gai said as it had already been established, the human body had thousands of cells and some people inherited genetic disorders from parents. DNA tests could identify such diseases or disorders, he said. He said it had now been established after diagnosing human body cells through DNA tests that diseases inherited through blood relationships were more. And identifying diseases was comparatively easier now with advent of technology, he said. Prof. Gai said ailments like diabetes were more a result of bad food culture and lack of physical activities, apart from other causes. Emphasising the need for students to take up basic sciences and also take keen interest in research, he called on students to make good use of the Dharwad Regional Science Centre (DRSC) to add wings to their dreams of becoming scientists. Director of DRSC Veeranna Bolishetti said the demonstration aimed at helping students understand the multi-cells and singular cell and the role of DNA in identifying genetic disorders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dna-testing-helps-identify-genetic-disorders-former-v-c/article33975607.ece

03 March 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Corona warriors asked to pay for second dose or go to govt. centres||Healthcare personnel including doctors, nurses, lab technicians and medical students who reported for the second round of COVID-19 vaccinations on Tuesday were allegedly asked to pay for the dose, much to their ire. “These are the frontline corona warriors who worked round the clock at government and private health facilities treating COVID-19 patients risking their own lives. Some of them are still treating COVID-19 patients. It is unfair to ask them to pay for the vaccine or stand in long queues at government hospitals for getting it for free,” Kiran Deshmukh, Deputy Coordinator, COVID-19 Committee of the Mahadevappa Rampure Medical College (MRMC), said. Falling numbers As per data from MRMC and Basaveshwara Teaching & General Hospital attached to it, as many as 1,200 healthcare personnel were given the first dose. Of these, only around 200 were administered the second dose on February 25 and 26 before the vaccine portal was down for three days. When the remaining workers went for the second shot on Tuesday, they were asked to pay. Similarly, of the 343 healthcare workers who had been given the first dose of the vaccine at United Hospital, another private facility in Kalaburagi, only 27 were given the second dose free of cost on Tuesday. “The second dose of the vaccination has been stopped for the last three days and there was no communication from the government on the issue,” Dr. Vikram Siddareddy, Chairman and Managing Director of the hospital, said. ‘Feel betrayed’ The Kalaburagi city branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to Kalaburagi Deputy Commissioner on the issue. “Healthcare professionals and supportive staff at private hospitals cooperated with the district administration during the COVID-19 crisis and [it] is unfortunate that the government is asking them to pay for the second dose at the same centre where they have treated COVID-19 patients. We feel betrayed,” stated the letter. Portal issue District Health and Family Welfare Officer Rajashekhar Mali pleaded helplessness citing the fresh guidelines from the Centre. “We have a limited number of government vaccination centres and we have been asked not to increase their number for a couple of days as there is some problem in the vaccine portal. As per fresh guidelines, everyone, be they ordinary persons or frontline health workers, who want to get their vaccine at private hospitals, will have to pay. We will supply the vaccine to private facilities at Rs. 150 a dose,” he said. Minister’s response When contacted, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the issue had not come to his notice. “Complete vaccination (both the doses) is free for all healthcare and frontline workers. If anyone is being asked to pay, we will look into it and set that right,” he told The Hindu.   These are the frontline corona warriors who worked round the clock at government and private health facilities treating COVID-19 patients risking their own lives. Some of them are still treating COVID-19 patients. It is unfair to ask them to pay for the vaccine or stand in long queues at government hospitals .

03 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||New Mayor to make effective use of Rs. 100 crore reserve for projects||Newly elected Mayor Premananda Shetty said on Tuesday that the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has in its kitty Rs. 100 crore collected under premium floor area ratio (FAR) clause. The corporation has not been able to utilise the fund for various reasons. He said he would try to make best use of it for development projects. Speaking at the council after being elected for the next one year term, the Mayor said the FAR fund got accumulated since 2009-10. The civic body collected the fund from builders after the premium FAR clause was added in the Master Plan II for Mangaluru Local Planning Area, which came into effect from October, 2009. Under the premium FAR clause, a builder can pay a certain fee to the corporation and can add extra built-up area to a building as per the provisions mentioned under the zonal regulations of Master Plan II. The corporation should utilise this fund for development works as per specified guidelines. Referring to constituting ward committees, the Mayor said its process had come to a stage now. The official machinery in the corporation will go ahead with further steps to be taken up for constituting the committees. Fresh survey Mr. Shetty said the corporation will have to increase its own revenue. The civic body has already taken up a fresh survey of properties under its jurisdiction. The survey aimed at recording the properties to ensure that all paid the property tax under the self-assessment scheme without undervaluing the tax proposed to be given to the corporation. Congratulating Mr. Shetty on being elected as Mayor, Mangaluru city south MLA D. Vedavyasa Kamath said projects worth Rs. 2,500 crore are being implemented in the city now under various schemes of the government, including Rs. 1,500 crore worth projects under the smart city mission. The Mayor has the onus of ensuring that all the projects are implemented effectively. Mangaluru city north MLA Y. Bharat Shetty said the e-governance initiative mooted in the corporation should reach its logical end to help people. There are issues in managing the solid waste, which have to be addressed. Naveen R. D’Souza, councillor, urged the Mayor to take up an initiative to ensure that the government build a flyover at Nanthoor junction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-mayor-to-make-effective-use-of-rs-100-crore-reserve-for-projects/article33976099.ece

03 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Govt. committed to facilitating world-class maritime infrastructure’||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Tuesday said the State was committed to facilitate world-class maritime infrastructure through private participation and urged entrepreneurs to invest in the maritime sector. He was speaking at a session on ‘Investment opportunities in Karnataka’ as a part of the Maritime India Virtual Summit 2021, organised by Union Ministry of Shipping in association with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. New airports Mr. Yediyurappa said the government had facilitated construction of a greenfield port under PPP at Honnavara with an investment of Rs. 600 crore. Another Rs. 3,000 crore was likely to be invested in two more greenfield ports at Pavinakurve and Belikeri in Uttara Kannada district, he said. This was apart from developing second phases of Karwar and Mangaluru fishing ports at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,172 crore. In his introductory address, Additional Chief Secretary (Infrastructure Development) Kapil Mohan said the government intends to convert Karnataka into a Global Maritime Hub through private participation. Karnataka Maritime Board intends to unlock the huge potential of land and island along the coast. Director of Ports K.C. Swamy said the government also intends to encourage ship building and breaking industries along the coast. Value unblocking New Mangalore Port Trust chairman A.V. Ramana said though Karnataka has 12 non-major and one major port, lack of proper connectivity has blocked their values. He hoped the present dynamic leadership would address the connectivity between the coast and the hinterland. If ports were developed and connectivity was improved, the huge value could be unblocked ushering in port-led industrialisation and development. Tourism too could flourish along with facilities to fishermen, he said. A representative from the Tourism Department said the Tourism Policy 2025 envisaged Rs. 5,000 crore investment in the tourism sector creating nearly one million employment. The department was offering subsidies, incentives and concessions of different forms to private investors to create facilities across the state, including the 320 km long coastline, she said. Minister for Ports and Fisheries S. Angara was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-committed-to-facilitating-world-class-maritime-infrastructure/article33976109.ece

On the controversial Disneyland project near the KRS dam site, he said the pros and cons of the project would be discussed before taking a final call. Earlier, the Minister visited the BJP party office and also met Chamarajnagar MP V. Srinivas Prasad at his residence.  Mr. Yogeshwara said he has no differences with H. Vishwanath, MLC, who had attacked him and questioned his entry into the Cabinet. “He is a senior leader. Allegations and counter-allegations happen in the public life and I have no qualms in meeting him,” he told reporters, after meeting Mr. Prasad. ‘Ambari’ flagged off Five open-roof double-decker buses called ‘Ambari’ of the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation were flagged off here on Tuesday by Mr. Yogeshwar and KSTDC chairperson and actor Shruthi at Radisson Blu.

03 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||State to host global travel expo||Minister for Tourism, Ecology and Environment C.P. Yogeshwar on Tuesday said Karnataka will be hosting the second edition of Karnataka International Travel Expo (KITE) in August this year and added that the event was expected to attract delegates from over 30 countries seeking opportunities in the State tourism ecosystem and to discover Karnataka tourism. Speaking after inaugurating Connect-2021, a stakeholder networking initiative, organised by the Department of Tourism and Karnataka Tourism Society (KTS) here, the Minister said tourism, before the pandemic, contributed 14.8 per cent towards the State’s GDP and supported over 16 million jobs. Karnataka has immense potential to become a world-class destination and the Department of Tourism was being supported to globally market the State, he said. The KITE on August 27, 28 and 29 is aimed to aid recovery of the tourism and hospitality industry in the State which had been hit by the pandemic. Connect-2021 is an annual event to meet all tourism stakeholders in the State and to interact with them, and to showcase the activities of the Department of Tourism and KTS. T.K. Anil Kumar, Principal Secretary, Tourism, said Karnataka is home to a large and exciting portfolio of globally acclaimed tourism products with UNESCO world heritage sites, wildlife sanctuaries, and virgin beaches. The Karnataka International Travel Expo would provide an impetus to inbound travel and tourism and also enhance the marketing efforts of Karnataka Tourism Department to promote destinations to the travel-trade from all over the world. K. Shyamaraju, President, KTS, said Connect-2021 will help the hospitality, leisure and tourism sectors in the State to come together under one initiative and will add value to the stakeholders’ efforts to market their products and create a networking opportunity with various other marketing organisations and professionals. Nagendra, MLA; MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajeev; actress and KSTDC chairperson Shruthi; and prominent stakeholders from the tourism industry were present at the inauguration. Stakeholders have welcomed the government’s decision to accord industry status to the classified hotels and resorts at a time when it was reeling because of the pandemic. The decision is timely, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-to-host-global-travel-expo/article33975741.ece
03 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Protest against LPG price hike||Former MLA M.K. Somashekar on Tuesday led a protest against the hike in price of LPG cylinders used for cooking purposes. The protestrs gathered at Chamundipuram Cirlce in the city and shouted slogans against the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They accused the Union government of making the lives of common man miserable by increasing the prices of fuel. In a statement here, Mr. Somashekar said the price of one cooking gas cylinder was Rs. 380 when the price of crude oil was $ 118 per barrel in the international market. Now, when the price of crude was just $ 66 per barrel, the cost of cooking gas cylinder had reached Rs. 824. During the last 25 days, the government had increased the price of cooking gas by Rs. 125, he alleged. One cylinder of cooking gas was available for Rs. 699 on February 3, but on February 4, the price went up to Rs. 744 before reaching Rs. 774 on February 15 and Rs. 799 on February 25, the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protest-against-lpg-price-hike/article33975744.ece

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||SC-appointed committee warns of misinformation||The Supreme Court-appointed committee has advised building owners, who had constructed residential and other structures on land notified for formation of the Shivaram Karanth Layout of the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), to not fall prey to misinformation. Head of the committee Justice A.V. Chandrashekar told The Hindu that some unscrupulous elements were spreading incorrect information on the submission of records. The police have been asked to take action. “The Supreme Court has appointed the committee to protect the interest of those who have legally constructed buildings prior to the final notification. But some people are misleading the general public. We do not know why,” he said. In Byalakere village, people were reportedly going around in autorickshaws affixed with mikes urging owners not to submit records. Online and offline modes for submission of records pertaining to buildings constructed prior to August 3, 2018, began on Monday. On the first day itself, more than 40 building owners, including those residing abroad, submitted their documents online Justice Chandrashekar said that during the committee’s visit to notified areas, it was noticed that some villagers are continuing to construct structures despite the Supreme Court clearly mentioning in its order that buildings constructed after final notification are illegal. “People who are constructing new houses or other structures in the notified areas are doing it at their own risk,” he warned. Many such new constructions have come up in Doddabettahalli, Ramagondanahalli, Lakshmipura and other villages, which are part of the land notified for the layout. To create awareness, the committee has started issuing pamphlets and making announcements in 17 villages where land has been notified for formation of the layout. Fear of losing land When The Hindu visited the help centre at Government Urdu Primary School in Medi Agrahara, there were only a handful of people. Four additional help centres, including one at the BDA head office, will be commissioned in 10 days. Some property owners, who visited the help centre, were worried that formation of the layout, which has been delayed for over a decade, and acquisition of ‘developed’ land will cause them more hardship. Krishnappa P., a land owner from Vaderahalli, said around 200 acres in his village were notified for formation of the layout. “There are around 60 families living in the area. During our interaction, the people manning the help desk told us to submit relevant documents, which we will do. However, we do not want to give up our lands for formation of the layout. Moreover, many families continue to rely on agriculture in our village. They will end up losing farmland,” he said. Private layouts have also come up over the years. Boards advertising ‘DC converted/BDA NOC received’ layouts can be seen in many villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sc-appointed-committee-warns-of-misinformation/article33975932.ece

But this is getting difficult due to beef ban in the State, Satish Jarkiholi, MLA, said in Belagavi on Tuesday. He was speaking to journalists during a visit to Rani Kittur Channamma zoo near Mukti Mutt on Belagavi-Kolhapur road. Providing nutritional food to wild animals in zoos is the State government’s responsibility. We expect the government take enough steps to provide proper food to the animals, he said. “Not feeding them the designated meat in prescribed quantities could lead to malnutrition. That amounts to cruelty against animals. The State government should ensure that such things do not happen. It should make adequate provisions to exempt zoos from the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act, he said. He noted that the Act had in-built exemptions like allowing slaughter of cattle aged 13 and those certified by veterinary doctors. Such exemptions should be extended to zoos,” Mr. Jarkiholi said. Letter to govt. Deputy Conservator of Forests M.V. Amarnath said the Karnataka Zoo Authority had written a letter to the State government seeking exemptions. The zoo got three lions in February. In the coming days, it will get tigers, cheetah, bears, and other animals, Mr. Jarkiholi said. He said he had sanctioned some funds for the zoo while he was the Forest Minister. The zoo would be opened to the public in two months. The zoo lies at the border of two States. It would be developed into a model zoo by spending around Rs. 50 crore over five years,” he said. “The zoo needs around 1.5 lakh litres of water per day. The officers are trying to adopt rainwater harvesting methods within the 85-acre zoo. The State government is trying to provide treated water from Honaga industrial estate. We will also try to get water from the nearby Markandeya river,” the MLA said. Conservator of Forests B.V. Patil said the zoo authority had launched a mobile app to allow philanthropists to adopt animals by paying the cost of maintenance per year. We are getting several inquiries, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/providing-nutritional-food-to-zoo-animals-is-govts-responsibility/article33975606.ece

03 March 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||A leg-up for a rare Ghat amphibian||Galaxy frog ( Melanobatrachus indicus ), an amphibian species endemic to the eastern part of the Western Ghats, has been identified as the flagship species for conservation in the Mathikettan Shola National Park, home to rare flora and fauna. Munnar Wildlife Warden R. Lakshmi says a 15-year management plan for its protection is in place, which will help in studying ecological degeneration, if any, and take corrective measures. The micro-level conservation plan will also help in protecting the rare flora and fauna there. Galaxy frogs (in the genus of narrow-mouthed frogs in the family of microhylidae) are listed as endangered in the IUCN (International Union of Conservation of Nature) Red List. Galaxy frog, though small in size, is known by that name due its galaxy-like appearance with striking blue and yellow colour to its skin. Looking like a microcosm of a galaxy with a million stars, the galaxy frog is one of the 13 amphibian species of around 8,280 worldwide listed as most important. It is in the evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered (EDGE) list under the IUCN. It is one of the rarely encountered frog species in India with only 10 specimens reported so far, that too in the eastern part of the Western Ghats. Though its first sighting was in 1878 at Anamudi, by a British scientist, it had remained elusive for long. In Mathikettan, it was first sighted by Bhupathi and team in 2004. Rajkumar K.P., a research fellow under EDGE, later discovered it in Mathikettan, Marayur, Anamudi, and on the Periyar basin at Vallakkadavu. According to him, the galaxy frog’s immediate relatives are in East Africa He says the limited knowledge of its distribution, habitat preference, ecology, and behaviour make it difficult for conservationists to understand the species, potential threats, and develop a conservation strategy. Mr. Rajkumar, who led a training programme for forest staff in conservation of its habitat in Mathikettan, says as the flagship species for conservation, the micro-level changes that might affect its habitat are taken note of and remedial measures taken. In the long run, it will help in the conservation of the rich biodiversity in Mathikettan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-leg-up-for-a-rare-ghat-amphibian/article33975723.ece
03 March 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||CUK celebrates 12th foundation day||Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Tuesday said that the essence of Indian culture was the vision that divinity existed in every human being. Although many of the pre-historic cultures of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece had become history, Indian culture was still alive, inspiring and was well ahead because of the spiritual power inherent in it. The Governor was inaugurating the 12th foundation day celebrations of the Central University of Kerala (CUK) in Kasaragod district and the Nilgiris guest house on the campus. Mr. Khan said it was important to illuminate the divinity contained in man. Differences of caste, religion, colour, and language were all insignificant factors. “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” was the vision given by our sages. The essence of Indianness was coexistence with all thoughts, he observed. Christianity came to India before it had come to Europe. Jews and Zoroastrians came to India. Thus, India was a people of all religions. The Governor expressed hope that the Central University would grow into one of the best universities in the world. Union Minister of State for External Affairs, V. Muraleedharan; Vice Chancellor H. Venkateshwarlu; Registrar M. Muraleedharan Nambiar; and academic dean K.P. Suresh spoke on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cuk-celebrates-12th-foundation-day/article33975637.ece
03 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Air quality dips across State||The Air Quality Index (AQI) at nine real-time air quality monitoring stations managed by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board has worsened after the relaxations came into force post lockdown. The AQI levels had witnessed a considerable reduction, from the ‘moderate’ range (100) to the 'good' category (50), during the lockdown period. The average air quality index of most of the stations was around 50 (good) from March to October last year, except for Vytilla, M.G. Road in Ernakulam and Kollam where it touched 100 in September, according to an assessment by the board. The AQI of all stations went up to 100 (moderate) while some stations crossed 100 (unhealthy for sensitive groups) between October and December. The study found that the air quality in stations such as Vyttila, Thrissur and Kollam often crossed 150 (unhealthy) and rarely went up to 200 (very unhealthy) after further relaxations were implemented.  The nine real-time air quality monitoring stations are located at Plamoodu and Karyavattom (Thiruvananthapuram), Polayathodu (Kollam), MG Road, Vyttila, and Eloor (Ernakulam), Thrissur (Corporation limits), Palayam (Kozhikode), and Thavakkara (Kannur). The average AQI was calculated over a period from January 1 to December 31. Within range The AQI, which used to spike between March and May every year owing to lack of rain, remained in the good to moderate range in view of the lockdown in all stations. The reduction in overall traffic resulted in clear skies and clean air. However, the revival of the economic activity and increase in movement of trucks and other commercial vehicles in the post-lockdown phase led to an increase in air pollution.  The monitoring station at Polayathodu recorded the highest value of 278 in the maximum AQI level while the corresponding figures in Vyttila and Thavakkara were 235 and 228 respectively. The levels between 200 and 300 are considered ‘very unhealthy’ as per the standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board under its National Air Monitoring Programme. The maximum AQI levels in other stations were Plamoodu 174, Thrissur 165, Eloor 152, M.G. Road 144, Karyavattom 125, and Palayam 123.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/air-quality-dips-across-state/article33975651.ece
03 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||New sub-division brings hopes of better policing||The creation of an additional sub-division, Ernakulam Central, within the Kochi City police limits, thus taking the number of total sub-divisions to four, is expected to ensure better policing and law and order maintenance. The newly formed sub-division accounts for seven police stations — Central, North, Mulavukad, Kadavanthra, Elamakkara, Cheranalloor, and women’s police station — under a separate Assistant Commissioner. The Elamakkara police station was previously under the Thrikkakara sub-division. “The creation of a new sub-division helps reduce the span of control of each Assistant Commissioner by bringing down the number of police stations under their jurisdiction, thus facilitating superior quality of policing and enabling them to spend more time on each police station and each case. It will also make them more accessible to people at the police station-level. The basic logic is that the creation of every new police station or sub-division should effectively reduce the size of jurisdiction,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). The reconfigured Ernakulam sub-division now comprises South, Palarivattom, Maradu, Panangad and Habour police stations of which the Harbour station was previously under the Mattancherry sub-division. Work distribution However, it is being pointed out in certain quarters that the bifurcation putting seven stations under the jurisdiction of the Central sub-division and five under the Ernakulam sub-division amounts to unequal distribution of workload. “For instance, the Central station alone accounted for the registration of as many cases a year as the five stations under the Ernakulam sub-division clubbed together. At least one station should have been taken away from the jurisdiction of the Central sub-division,” said police sources. However, Mr. Nagaraju pointed out that the number of cases was only one of the factors considered in the creation of a sub-division by bunching together some heavy and relatively lighter police stations. “Geographical contiguity, law and order status, presence of vital installations, frequency of VIP movements, and major arterial roads are also considered in the creation of a sub-division. “Besides, the number of police stations alone is not an indicator of the hectic nature of work. For instance, a sub-division with four stations may be far more hectic than one with seven stations,” he said. The Thrikkakara sub-division now has seven stations — Thrikkakara, Kalamassery, Infopark, Hill Palace, Ambalamedu, Udayamperur, and Eloor — and the Mattancherry sub-division has five stations — Mattancherry, Palluruthy, Fort Kochi, Thoppumpady, and Kannamaly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-sub-division-brings-hopes-of-better-policing/article33976067.ece
03 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Political entry of retired judges kicks up a debate||The decision of two former judges of the Kerala High Court to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has kicked up a debate with former Gujrat Chief Minister Sankarsinh Vaghela tweeting against it. “Judiciary become a joke,” tweeted Mr. Vaghela on Monday, in response to the news that P.N. Ravindran and V. Chitambaresh had joined the BJP. Mr. Ravindran formally enrolled himself as a member of the party at Kochi on Sunday at a public function organised in connection with the Vijay Yatra, a campaign rally taken out by BJP State president K. Surendran. The meeting was attended by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Though Mr Chitambaresh was not present at the function, organisers announced that he too would join the party soon. While Mr. Ravindran, who served as a judge for 11 years, retired from service in 2018, Mr. Chitambaresh demitted office in 2019 after being a judge of the court for eight years. BJP fellow traveller Asked about his political entry, Mr. Chitambaresh said he need not join the BJP afresh as he was a BJP man and a party fellow traveller all through his life. “The very purpose of revealing my political identity is to push for economic reservation and end all caste and community-based reservation system, especially the one prevailing in Kerala,” Mr. Chitambaresh said adding that he was one of the founding vice presidents of the Bharatiya Vidyarthi Janata, the student wing of the BJP. “Caste-based reservation shall be limited to Scheduled Castes and Schedules Tribes alone. For others, reservation shall not be extended except on economic basis,” he said. “A cooling-off period shall be introduced for judges for not accepting assignments or gratis from the government and not for revealing one’s political identity. I had refused to accept several plump posts offered to me,” said Mr. Chitambaresh. He said he had won a college union election as an Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad candidate. Mr. Ravindran, when contacted, said Mr. Vaghela was entitled to his views on the issue. “I don’t want to do anything that destroys society, constitutional institutions, the judiciary and Parliament,” he responded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/political-entry-of-retired-judges-kicks-up-a-debate/article33975725.ece
03 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Immunisation of senior citizens begins in district||Government hospitals in the district began administering the COVID-19 vaccine to senior citizens and people over 45 with co-morbidities on Tuesday, with 160 people taking the shot. A total of 5,400 people, mostly polling officials, took the vaccine on Tuesday. While only 10% of slots at government vaccination centres were set aside for the public, it will go up to 20% on Wednesday, said Dr. M.G. Sivadas, nodal officer for vaccination. Most private hospitals did not administer vaccinations on Tuesday. But some 10 private hospitals have paid for the vaccine and are likely to begin administering it soon, Dr. Sivadas added. Dr. Junaid Rahman, medical director at Sree Sudheendra Medical Mission, said a few private hospitals had paid on Tuesday to procure the vaccine. Private hospitals are required to pay Rs. 150 per dose to procure it. The hospitals, even those that are not empanelled under any government health scheme, are attempting to purchase it on a day-to-day basis, with around 100 doses per day, Dr. Rahman said. Each private hospital is tied up with a government one from where they receive the supply. Private hospitals are in a dilemma about charging health workers for the vaccine. According to State guidelines, all beneficiaries at private hospitals are required to pay for the shots, while it remains free at government facilities. Dr. T.V. Ravi, medical director, Ernakulam Medical Centre, said there had been a positive response from the health authorities, who had suggested that health workers would be reimbursed for the cost. But some private hospitals were awaiting a definite decision on the matter before they procure the vaccine, said Dr. Ravi. Doctors at the Angamaly Taluk Hospital and the Ernakulam General Hospital said they had been fielding several enquiries from senior citizens. “But we are able to set aside only a few slots for senior citizens and people with co-morbidities, since over 200 polling officials are being vaccinated here everyday,” said a doctor at the Angamaly Taluk Hospital. Long queues of polling officials at the General Hospital as well means that vaccination for senior citizens will begin in full swing only after the officials have taken the shot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/immunisation-of-senior-citizens-begins-in-district/article33976060.ece
03 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Suspended policeman accused of multiple charges||The Special Branch report on the suspended civil police officer accuses him of multiple charges in connection with the operation of a coffee vending machine at the station where he worked. Deputy Commissioner (Kochi City) Aishwarya Dongre on Monday suspended P.S. Raghu of the Kalamassery police station on disciplinary grounds based on the Special Branch Assistant Commissioner’s report. The Kochi City Narcotic Cell Assistant Commissioner, who is probing the charges, will submit a report within a month. Mr. Raghu was entrusted by the Station House Officer (SHO) to install a coffee vending machine for visitors to the station. However, the Special Branch report accuses him of turning the installation of the machine into a celebration by inviting the media and giving them interviews without the knowledge of the SHO, who was away attending a meeting called by the District Police Chief (Kochi City) on February 17. The report accuses him of organising the event by abdicating station watch duty. The report found it a serious lapse considering that the accused in a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act were being held in the station cell on the day. On his part, Mr. Raghu said it was not even an inaugural function but just an installation of a mere coffee vending machine. “The senior officers seem to have been unaware of it, but then it was for my superiors to inform them. Also, the event received such wide publicity, and that seems to have backfired,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/suspended-policeman-accused-of-multiple-charges/article33976068.ece
03 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Civic body cracks whip on illegal tobacco kiosks||The Aluva Municipality has begun cracking the whip on makeshift roadside kiosks and pan shops found selling banned tobacco products. The removal of six such kiosks between the Aluva railway station and Bank Junction last week has been cited as just the beginning of a sustained drive, which was triggered following police action against a few vendors on the charge of selling ganja in the guise of tobacco products. “We will continue action against illegal kiosks, which are run without valid licences. Just one of them was among the nine street vendors who were issued identity cards by the municipality, though even that was not meant for sale of tobacco products. Any such illegal kiosks will be immediately removed,” said N.P. Simon, chairman, health standing committee, Aluva Municipality. The police said organised networks were behind the supply of banned tobacco products in migrant-centric places like Aluva. “While such products are banned, it was not followed up with supporting legislation with adequate penal provisions. It entails a meagre fine of Rs. 200 under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act. Even the penalty for repeated offences is not a proper deterrent as manifested in the fact that we often catch the same set of offenders,” said a senior police officer in Aluva. Seizure and destruction of illegal tobacco products is the only feasible action. For instance, a packet of banned chewing tobacco procured from Tamil Nadu at as little as Rs. 10 is sold here at Rs. 100. Thus a vendor who is fined Rs. 200 for an offence will make it up with the sale of a mere two packets,” the officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/civic-body-cracks-whip-on-illegal-tobacco-kiosks/article33976066.ece

03 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fishers against blue economy draft policy||Fishers in the State have risen as one against the draft policy framework on India’s blue economy, which envisages using marine resources for sustainable development. Fishers’ unions cutting across political divisions will meet here on Saturday to discuss the fallout of the policy framework, which contains “extremely dangerous recommendations” for the fisheries sector. The recommendations come close on the heels of a proposal for a national fisheries policy, which does not address the needs of traditional fishers, said Charles George of the Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedhi. He added that the policy favoured big capital, while it appeared to be balanced against local fishers, who eke out a living from traditional fishing. Fisheries experts and scientists as well as leaders of Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Federation and National Fish Workers’ Forum will participate in a national symposium on the issue. “The new policy is favourable to capital-intensive enterprises, which will ultimately act against the interests of lakhs of fishermen,” said Mr. George. Fishers’ unions have called upon the government to empower traditional fishing communities to take up deep-sea fishing instead of allowing capital-intensive investments in diverse areas. Rumblings against the policy by fishers followed the loud protest against a major pact between a State government agency and a US company for building deep-sea trawlers. The Memorandum of Understanding between the Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation and the US company was withdrawn following protests by fishers’ unions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fishers-up-in-arms-against-blue-economy-draft-policy/article33976055.ece

Plastic banners and decorations, PVC boards and thermocol arches will not be allowed. All kinds of synthetic decorations and campaigning material should be avoided.

In Poonjar, the Kerala Janapaksham (Secular) [(KJ(S)] has already announced the candidature of P.C. George, MLA, in the upcoming Assembly elections and kick-started electioneering. Graffiti and posters seeking votes for the veteran legislator have surfaced in different parts of the constituency while Mr. George has embarked on a door-to-door interaction programme. “Meetings at the booth level are on while I have also begun reaching out to voters at a personal level. The response has been too good and the party is hopeful of raising its lead to around 35,000 votes this time,” said Mr. George. The focus of the next phase of campaign, according to him, would be decided during a meeting of the party secretariat in Kottayam on Wednesday. The meeting, to be attended by key office-bearers of the party, will also announce the stance of the KJ(S) on various issues ahead of the upcoming elections. With the United Democratic Front already shelving an earlier proposal to take Mr. George on board, Poonjar is likely to witness a gritty four-way fight once again. There are, however, some reports about the KJ(S) holding discussions with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. In Pala, Mani C. Kappan, MLA, who seeks re-election as United Democratic Front candidate, has got to work with posters and graffitti works. As part of reaching out to the voters, he is slated to hold a series of meetings with the voters from Wednesday onward. The programme, according to Mr. Kappan, seeks to draw up guidelines for the development projects to be implemented in Pala over the next five years. “As many as 100 rounds of discussions on development-related issues will be held across the 13 local bodies in Pala as part of the programme, which will continue till March 16,” he said. The Left Democratic Front, though yet to announce its candidate in the all-important constituency, too has shifted to the electioneering mode with a rally led by the Kerala Congress (M) chairman Jose K. Mani. With Mr. Mani likely to be fielded as the LDF candidate, Pala is bracing for a high-voltage contest this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/poll-fever-grips-pala-poonjar-as-early-birds-do-rounds/article33975728.ece

The reason — a series of paintings on the walls of the building at the gate of Valiyangadi, the city’s commercial hub. The pictures depict the history of coconut trade in the region in detail. Together with its aquamarine blue roof, the building has turned an eye-catcher. The credit for Coconut Bazaar’s new look goes to St+Art India, a street art foundation that works for the reclamation of urban public spaces for art and to make art a democratic medium across the country. The group is known for the creation of the country’s first art district in Lodhi Colony, Delhi. “The St+Art India takes up such projects across the country. This time, they are doing similar works in Kasaragod, Kochi, and Thiruvananthapuram in the State”, said Maneef Mohammed, partner of Long House, art and theatre hub and marketing agency, that works from Coconut Bazaar. Long House was chosen by many as the preferred location for an art project in Kozhikode when St+Art India conducted a survey. But since the organisation was not interested in working on indoor spaces, the frontage of the Coconut Bazaar was chosen for the project, said Mr. Mohammed. The work covering about 75 metres was planned almost a year ago, involving artists from different parts of the world. However, it did not take off due to the lockdown. Later, a Kerala-based students’ art group ‘Trespassers’ was chosen to complete the project. It took eight artists six days to finish the work, he added. Tourism potential The street art work, probably the biggest in the district, is an addition to the beautification projects being carried out along the Kozhikode beach to increase its tourism potential.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/coconut-bazaar-gets-makeover/article33975635.ece

Though the strike seemed like a hartal during the earlier hours of the day, a lot of private vehicles took to the roads later on. Most commercial establishments remained open, even though the customer turnout was low. Though offices were open, the attendance was slightly low. Private buses, autorickshaws, and taxi cabs stayed off the road. Very few KSRTC services operated. As a result, a lot of people were stranded at bus stands and railway stations. Organisations such as the Helping Hands Charitable Trust had deployed volunteers on motorbikes at railway stations and bus stands to help those in need. Wholesale business at the Palayam vegetable market was affected as fresh stocks did not arrive due to the strike. Activists under the banner of the combined trade unions took out a march to the Income Tax Office in the city in protest against the fuel price hike. In Wayanad The dawn-to-dusk strike was partial in Wayanad too. As the Sulthan Bathery taluk was exempted from the strike owing to a festival at the Mariyamman temple at Manikuni, the strike did not affect normal life there. However, the strike led to a hartal-like situation in other parts of the district with shops, educational institutions, and business establishments remaining closed. Attendance was low in government offices and financial institutions. Only 32 out of 160 employees turned up for the duty at the Collectorate, District Collector Adeela Abdulla told The Hindu . Long queues of vehicles were seen on the Kerala-Karnataka and Kerala-Tamil Nadu borders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/motor-strike-partial-in-kozhikode-wayanad/article33975643.ece

The filmmaker was there to launch the work on a renovated autism centre coming up on the premises. The media contingent, however, was more interested in his response to the rumours about his possible Left Democratic Front candidature from the Kozhikode North constituency for the upcoming Assembly polls. “As of now, they are just rumours. The CPI(M) has a well-defined organisational structure. If there is any such move, the party will announce it after their due procedure,” Mr. Ranjith said. Apprehensive The filmmaker said he was initially apprehensive about the idea. “I was not sure if I deserve the candidature. Then somebody pointed out that I was similarly doubtful while directing my first movie. It was actor Mohanlal and film producer Antony Perumbavoor who encouraged me to work on a mainstream commercial film,” he said. Mr. Ranjith, however, said if people around him were keen on the candidature, he would jump into the fray. “Also, the CPI(M) needs to decide on it. Let us see if there is such a move,” he said. Asked if the party had reached out to him, Mr. Ranjith said,“ Yes. But I haven’t fully okayed the idea.” He was also all praise for A.

03 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||A snapshot history of the IFFK||An exhibition of photographs being held at Priya Theatre Complex here chronicling the evolution of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) has become a runaway hit with cinema lovers of Palakkad and neighbouring districts. Actor Sajitha Madathil, who curated the exhibition titled Mela@25 in association with Kerala State Chalachitra Academy vice chairperson Bina Paul, was upbeat to see many students curiously photographing the exhibits for their academic purpose. “It’s definitely going to serve a better purpose for them,” Ms. Sajitha told The Hindu . ‘Loud and bold’ The exhibition is a pictorial chronicling of the 25-year-old history of IFFK. “We were particular about telling history through pictures, especially as we see a lot of history being rewritten for vested interests. These pictures can speak loud and bold,” said Ms. Sajitha. Endorsing the thinking of Ms. Sajitha and Ms. Bina, youngsters have been pouring in to the latest editions of the IFFK. It is not IFFK history in full, but it throws light on the IFFK over the last 25 years. The photographs of IFFK signages and boards displayed at the entrance give a clear picture of the festival’s evolution from its old-fashioned style to the modern ambience. “These pictures are testimony to the change the IFFK has undergone over the last 25 years,” said Ms. Sajitha. The beginning and the landmarks of the IFFK have been documented to evoke curiosity especially in the young generation. Begun in 1994 in Kozhikode under the banner of the Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC), the IFFK became an annual pride of the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy from 1999. Since 2001, Thiruvananthapuram has been the permanent venue of the IFFK. Another section gives a pictorial essay about the evolution of delegate passes from handwritten ID cards to modern-day moulded plastic cards. Photos of films reels used in the early years of the IFFK have been reminiscent of the cumbersomeness and delays caused by the reels. “It talks a lot about the transition to digital era,” said Madhu Janardhan, one of the festival conveners. Dignitaries The photos of dignitaries who attended the festival over the years, the festival books, covers and daily bulletins, open forums and awards can all take back the visitors to previous editions of the IFFK. One section speaks in detail about the IFFK awards, including the lifetime achievement award instituted in 2009.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-snapshot-history-of-the-iffk/article33976190.ece
03 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||PM’s intervention sought to end farmers’ agitation||As many as 196 important personalities have signed a memorandum demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi intervene to end the government stand-off with the farmers. The signatories demanded that Mr. Modi, who described himself as being ‘just a call away’ for the people, initiate meaningful talks with the farmers. They demanded that false cases slapped against the agitating farmers be withdrawn and facilities such as water supply and electricity and Internet connections be restored. The signatories included poet K. Satchidanandan; activist G. Haragopal; writers Kanchan Kumar, Katyayani Vidmahe, Afsar, B.R.P. Bhaskar, Rahul Purakayastha, and A.K.Prabhakar; former High Court judge P.K. Shamsuddin; social worker J. Devika, and Porattam activist M.N. Ravunni. The signatories also included journalists, academics, professionals, rights activists, freedom fighters, lawyers and artists from across the country. The memorandum titled ‘The Clarion Call’ requested the Centre to withdraw the farm laws with potential to break the backs of the farmers and the public distribution system. It also asked the government to withdraw all ‘war moves’ against the farmers. The expressed sadness over the way the U.P. government treated the farmers peacefully protesting against the new farm laws. “Their struggle is being confronted by snapping electricity and Internet connections and blocking drinking water supply. The removal of waste is also blocked. One can well imagine the awful conditions that will be prevailing in those places where lakhs of peasants have been squatting since two months, along with their families,” it said. “Hurdles have been put up in all the roads from the villages to the struggle centres, fixing spikes, digging trenches, and laying down layers of barbed wire, literally erecting road-fortresses. This apart from the thousands of police and paramilitary personnel deployed there,” the signatories said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pms-intervention-sought-to-end-farmers-agitation/article33976151.ece

03 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) moves forward with candidate selection||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] field for the Assembly elections seemed largely set on Tuesday. CPI(M) district units spent the day engrossed in finalising the panel of potential candidates. Ideally, the CPI(M) State committee wanted a blend of experience, youths, and broad electoral appeal to inform candidate selection. However, the rules did not always seem to permeate the grading process. The CPI(M) has to contend with reports of discord trickling in from some regions reportedly. In Palakkad, the proposal to consider Jameela Balan, Law Minister A. K. Balan's wife, from Tharoor, a Scheduled Caste reservation constituency, purportedly raised eyebrows in the local CPI(M). Some felt Ms. Jameela's nomination could open the party to criticism of favouring relatives of leaders. Moreover, a few CPI(M) leaders from the SCs allegedly felt the party had given them the short shrift. The BJP had increased its vote share in the constituency by nearly 8% in the 2016 Assembly elections. In contrast, the CPI(M) had witnessed roughly a 5% erosion of votes. So some have argued for a grassroots-level candidate to stem a possible BJP surge. Rajesh in Thrithala? By some accounts, the CPI(M) might field M.B. Rajesh in Thrithala to wrest the constituency from V.T. Balaram of the Congress. Incumbent MLAs P. K. Sasi and K. Unni are likely to contest again from Shoranur and Ottappalam respectively. Left Democratic Front convener A. Vijayaraghavan might contest from Malampuzha. Actor Mukesh (Kollam), Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma (Kundara), P.Aisha Potty (Kottarakara), Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan (Ponnani), Health Minister K. K. Shylaja (Mattannur), Veena George (Aranmula), U. Jinesh Kumar (Konni) and Raju Abraham (Ranni) are the other names heard on the grapevine. Talks progressing Seat-sharing talks in the LDF are also progressing. The CPI is likely to cede Kanjirappally and Irikkur to the Kerala Congress (M). The Janata Dal (S) might get Kovalam, Thiruvalla, Chittur and Angamaly. The LJD is likely to get Koothuparamba,Vadakara and Kalpetta. The Janadhipathya Kerala Congress will have to settle for Thiruvananthapuram and possibly Changanassery. The Nationalist Congress Party is seeking Elathur, Kuttanad and a third seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-moves-forward-with-candidate-selection/article33975733.ece

03 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Medical college doctors on the warpath||The faculty in government medical colleges across the State, who have been on the warpath against the government’s denial of pay revision arrears due to the doctors, are intensifying their agitation. The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA) said on Tuesday that the doctors would observe a Statewide “betrayal day” on Wednesday and hold protest marches at all government medical colleges. In Thiruvananthapuram, they would march to the office of the Director of Medical Education and stage a dharna, mindful of all COVID-19 protocols. Indefinite protest From Wednesday, medical college doctors would go on indefinite work-to-rule and boycott VIP duties, pay-ward duties, non-COVID dutries and non-emergency meetings as well as all additional duties not linked to patients or academic activities. The KGMCTA said that all days from March 3 would be observed as “Black Days” On March 10, doctors would protest in front of the Secretariat. The KGMCTA said if the Government still remained indifferent, doctors would go on a day’s token strike on March 17, boycotting OP clinics, elective surgeries, and academic activities, while sparing emergency services and COVID-19 care. The KGMCTA said the pay revision of medical college doctors should have been implemented in 2016 and yet, even the government order (GO) on pay revision was delayed till 2020. The doctors were asking for the pay arrears rightfully due to them from that period. It was only after the doctors started an agitation that the government even initiated discussions with the doctors. During discussions, it was minuted that the doctors had to be given pay revision arrears from July 1, 2017. Yet, when the GO allowing pay revision arrears was issued, that too in the 11th hour just before the election code of conduct was to be declared, the arrears was allowed only from July 1, 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/doctors-plan-stir/article33975711.ece
03 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Ordinance for more freedom to autonomous colleges in place||Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has promulgated an Ordinance that synchronises the laws governing autonomous colleges and universities and also provide the former greater freedom in the State. The University Laws (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance, 2021 is expected to reduce conflict that had existed between the University Laws (Third Amendment) Act, 2014 and the University Acts of Kerala University, Calicut University, Mahatma Gandhi University, Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kannur University, and the National University of Advanced Legal Studies. While the amendment is mostly derived from recommendations submitted by the Kerala State Higher Education Council, the government slightly diverged by deciding to abolish the existing Autonomy Approval Committee chaired by the Higher Education Minister that was mandated with processing applications submitted by colleges for autonomy. Official sources pointed out that the move was necessitated by the implementation of the UGC (Conferment of Autonomous Status upon Colleges and Measures for Maintenance of Standards in Autonomous Colleges) Regulations, 2018 which had minimised the scope of role of the State government. While the move is bound to ease the procedure for seeking autonomous status and nudge more eligible institutions in the direction, universities are bound to have a greater role in recommending autonomous status and through representation in various panels including the Board of Studies and Governing Body. With the Autonomy Approval Committee being nullified, colleges must submit applications to the universities, the Syndicates of which will constitute a five-member expert committee within seven days to assess whether the institution satisfies various eligibility criteria. The Vice Chancellor will then have to either forward the report to the UGC to recommend autonomy within 30 days or reject the application, following which the college can reapply only after one year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ordinance-for-more-freedom-to-autonomous-colleges-in-place/article33976185.ece
03 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Senior citizens respond well to vaccination||The good response to COVID-19 vaccination from senior citizens was evident on Tuesday too as several of them opted to do walk-in registration and vaccination at public hospitals. The Health Department is yet to release any official data on the number of senior citizens and those in the 45-59 age group with comorbidities in the State who managed to secure registration/vaccination, either through the CoWIN portal or app or directly by seeking walk-in registrations. Reports from the capital district said on Tuesday, of the 2,604 COVID vaccination shots administered at various sites, 1,225 were for senior citizens. First doses On Tuesday, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja and Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan received their first dose at Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital. Minister Kadannappally Ramachandran also received the vaccine at Kannur. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is expected to receive the vaccine at Thycaud Women and Children Hospital here on Wednesday. Health officials said they were racing against time to get the 3.30 lakh poll officials vaccinated and that they had to finish the administration of the first dose by March 6, so that they can be given the second dose before the polling day on April 6. The administration of the second dose to health workers, first dose to those health workers who had missed out on the initial registration opportunity, and the first dose to front-line workers was also being taken up simultaneously, posing huge human resource and logistics challenges to district health administrations. They said unless mass vaccination camps were organised across districts, the process of vaccinating poll officials before the deadline could not be completed. The Health Minister said here that though over four lakh persons were administered the vaccine in the State so far, serious adverse events were not reported. Over 1,000 vaccination sites were being prepared in districts, apart from which mass vaccination camps would be held in districts. She said that it was all the more important for Kerala that everyone took the vaccine as soon as possible, as the State has a sizeable population of susceptible people. She cautioned that the full protective cover of the vaccine would kick in only 28 days after the second dose was administered. Hence, those who have received a single shot should continue to wear masks and maintain COVID-19 protocols.  Of the 2,604 COVID vaccination shots administered in the capital district, 1,225 were senior citizens||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/good-response-to-vaccination/article33975710.ece

Hibi Eden, MP, will inaugurate the protest meeting, while CPI(M) leader K. Chandran Pillai will preside over it. The South railway station and the land on which it is located have been proposed to be handed over to private entrepreneurs as part of efforts by the Railway Land Development Authority (RLDA) to renovate the station. The first phase of the project comprises a Rs. 229-crore initiative that will see both the eastern and western sides of the station being developed over a period of three years. The 48 acres on which the present railway station facilities are located will be handed over to a private company, which will take up the development of the station, which includes construction of commercial complexes. The company will be allowed to keep the land and facilities for 60 years. However, the unions said a project for the expansion of the station had been prepared by railway engineers themselves. While the Railways have the capability to develop the station, there is no need for the authorities to approach private parties, they maintained. The Railways, the unions said, should not surrender prime land in the middle of the city to private companies. Bids invited Meanwhile, the RLDA has invited bids for the redevelopment of the Ernakulam South railway station on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer basis. The RLDA is a statutory authority under the Ministry of Railways with a mandate for development / redevelopment of stations and commercial development of vacant land parcels near them. The railway authorities, when contacted, refused to comment on the protest by the unions and the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unions-to-protest-against-south-station-renovation/article33976058.ece

03 March 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rebel trouble for YSRCP, TDP in Anantapur||The ruling YSR Congress Party is facing a Herculean Task in getting its leaders to withdraw nominations from the 50 wards in Anantapur Municipal Corporation elections, for which Wednesday 3 p.m. is the deadline for withdrawal. In an interesting turn of events, 10 of the 40 wards in Dharmavaram municipality saw only one candidate left in the fray after the deadline for withdrawal on Tuesday. All the 10 are from YSRCP and there was no commotion or any hectic activity. The Telugu Desam Party had “protected” its candidates in Dharmavaram by holding a camp elsewhere in the district, but on Tuesday, some of them came to Dharmavaram and withdrew their nomination. On Tuesday afternoon, the YSRCP in-charge for municipal elections and former Kurnool MLA S.V. Mohan Reddy released the names of all the 50 contestants in the corporation, but there are 150 nominations filed with a 1:3 ratio in Anantapur. While only a few of them have withdrawn their candidature, hectic deliberations with several groups are internally on, and Anantapur Urban MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy too is trying his best to make them agree to withdraw their nominations. Candidates’ list A look at the list of candidates of the YSRCP shows only five sitting corporators renamed for this election, while due to change of reservation in three cases spouses have been given tickets like Kogatam Bhaskar Reddy, a two-time corporator and a contender for mayor’s post. His wife was a corporator earlier, and former mayor Rage Parasuram’s wife Bandi Naga Mani is in the race from Ward No. 2. The YSRCP has given ticket to some engineering graduates and the focus is on bringing in youth and hence the average age of contestants is 35 years, said Mr. Venkatarami Reddy. The party has given tickets to nine persons from Minorities and seven from BCs in the general quota also with many of the Kuruba, Valmiki, Vaddera, and other communities fully represented. Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party has given four tickets to the CPI, one to the Indian Muslim League, and issued B Forms to 45 of its candidates in the Anantapur civi cbody and there is ‘rebel trouble’ for them with different groups with the party seeking ticket for their followers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rebel-trouble-for-ysrcp-tdp-in-anantapur/article33976127.ece

03 March 2021||Harish Gilai,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sanitation a far cry in Kobbarithota||Despite being one of the oldest localities in the city, Kobbarithota area is plagued by congested lanes, poor sanitation and health issues. Law and order problems give nightmare to the residents. The area is located in ward 34 (earlier 29) and is under Zone IV of the GVMC. A few years ago, locals used to complain about lack of toilets and open defecation. But, thanks to Swachh Bharat initiative, several community toilets are constructed and almost all residents of the area have toilets in their houses. However, sanitation needs to be improved in the area. Overflowing drains and garbage dumped across streets are a common sight in the locality. “Many dump their household wastes in drains and they overflow when it rains. Dogs freely roam in the colonies,” said a resident. K. Subbarao, an auto-driver from the locality, alleged that a number of people were falling sick due to seasonal diseases. Common among the seasonal diseases are malaria and dengue cases he said. Poorna, a youth from Kobbarithota, said that they have been living in the locality since many years. “Several leaders from various political parties approach us for votes and they have promised to provide pucca houses at some other location. But so far it has remained a dream,” he said. “The area is very congested. Some people cannot even park their vehicles before their houses. Electric wires just hang over our heads. Apart from all these, air pollution haunts us,” he said. Crime rate Due to close proximity of houses, a large number of COVID cases reported in the area. “A number of people were affected with the coronavirus and many have died,” locals recall. What makes Kobbarithota different from other localities is the crime. Many youth and men from this locality were arrested by the police in several cases. The police had conducted cordon and search operations several times in the area. During the cordon and search operation conducted in September 2019, several suspects were detained. “Due to lack of proper parental guidance, a number of youth from this locality addicted to ganja and other vices. To meet their expenses, they take to crime. Despite action, many still continue to involve in offences,” said A. Suresh, a mechanic (name changed). He said that officials should conduct counselling for the youth in the locality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sanitation-a-far-cry-in-kobbarithota/article33976219.ece

03 March 2021||Nivedita Ganguly,ANDHRA PRADESH||NSTR reported increase in tiger numbers, says official||From a consistent rise in the number of tigers at Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve (NSTR) and rescuing the king cobras in North Coastal Andhra Pradesh to minimising man-animal conflict across the State, the Forest Department has been focussing on several areas to address wildlife conservation. On the eve of World Wildlife Day, Rahul Pandey, Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), AP, spoke to The Hindu highlighting some of the key initiatives and projects in the State. “Among one of the major wildlife conservation initiatives, the NSTR has reported a continuous increase in tiger numbers. During 2020-21, 63 individual tiger pictures were captured in camera traps. We have to put the figure in statistical tool to ascertain the overall number. This itself is a heartening news, considering the numbers were less than 40 in 2014,” said Mr. Pandey. Undertaking active surveillance by using sensor-based camera traps, 24 X7 patrolling by the personnel and engaging the local community have helped in their conservation efforts. The Forest Department’s King Cobra Conservation Programme in association with Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society in North Coastal A.P. has yielded good results and brought down response time. “In the past three years, we have rescued about 25 king cobras,” Mr. Pandey added. Threatened by rapid destruction of their natural habitat, king cobra, the world’s longest venomous snake, has been listed as ‘vulnerable’ in the IUCN Red List since 2010. King cobra predominantly feed on other snakes and plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance. “Our aim is to engage with local partners and bring down the response time as well as create awareness,” he said. The Olive Ridley Conservation Project is another significant initiative of the AP Forest Department which has recorded close to 30 lakh hatchlings being released into the sea till May 2020. “There are around 80 hatcheries in the State with 31 of them in North Coastal region. The A.P. coast is a sporadic nesting ground of these turtles. Incidentally, the past one year has seen lesser incidences of Olive Ridley deaths in North Coastal A.P.,” said Mr. Pandey. The other major wildlife conservation project managed by the Forest Department is the ongoing plan for upgradation of infrastructure in Indira Gandhi Zoological Park in Visakhapatnam, which is one of the 15 zoos selected by the Central Zoo Authority to create infrastructure on par with international standards. The Forest Department is also focussing on minimising man-animal conflict in Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and Chittoor where incidences of straying of wild elephant is reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nstr-reported-increase-in-tiger-numbers-forest-official/article33976168.ece

03 March 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Farmers’ unions decide to intensify stir in south India||Farmers’ unions that are spearheading a protracted struggle against the three new farm laws have decided to intensify their agitation to cover the southern parts of teh country as well. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting held at the farmers’ protest camp on the outskirts of New Delhi in the last week of February, said All India Khet Mazdoor Union State general secretary Ch. Venkateswarlu, who recently led a farmers’ delegation to the Tikri border. “A series of rallies will be taken out across the south India, starting with a massive march in Bengaluru later this month. We are determined to intensify the agitation,” Venkateswarlu told the media here on Tuesday. Peaceful agitation After the violence during the tractor rally in New Delhi on the Republic Day, the farmers have taken all precautions ensure that there is no violence, he said, adding that struggle will be continued in a peaceful manner till the goal is achieved. “An intensified agitation needs to continue for a longer duration, given the adamant attitude of the Centre, which is on a spree of privatising even the profit-making public sector units including insurance companies, railways and banks,” said Mr. Venkateswarlu. After the Red Fort incident, more farmers including women from remote villages from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar pradesh have been camping on the outskirts of New Delhi in three shifts a day with a do-or-die resolve, said Progressive Organisation for Women State General Secretary B. Padma. “As many as 245 farmers have died during the more than 95-day stir. The farmers’ camps which used to be in an area of about 25 sq.km before January 26 have spread to 45 sqkm. Women are now in the forefront of the struggle,” said Ms. Padma, who returned after camping in Shahjahanpur. Food security AIKMS State Executive Member C.S. Sagar said people are gradually realising that corporatisation of agriculture would spell a doom for not only for farmers but also agricultural labourers and consumers as well. “The nation’s food security will be at stake once the corporate sector has a grip over the farm sector,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/farmers-unions-to-intensify-stir/article33975602.ece
03 March 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Political scene hots up ahead of civic polls in Ongole||Rebels gave sleepless nights for official candidates of different political parties, especially the ruling YSR Congress Party, on the penultimate day for withdrawal of nominations for the March 10 elections to the Ongole Municipal Corporation. Only 11 candidates withdrew their nominations on Tuesday leaving 464 candidates in the fray for the 50 divisions in State Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy’s home Assembly constituency of Ongole. Rebel trouble was more for the YSRCP, which had an edge over other parties in the elections to the urban local body formed in the year 1876, as only 7 of YSRCP candidates withdrew their nominations. Heightened suspense prevailed as the Minister and his son B. Praneeth Reddy burnt midnight oil to convince the rebels to withdraw from contest by Wednesday, the dateline for withdrawal of nominations, by promising to accommodate them suitably later. “Everything will fall in line in time,” said YSRCP city unit president S.Venkat Rao. Mayoral candidate Suspense over the YSRCP Mayoral candidate ended as Dara Padma, daughter of former MLA Dara Sambaiah did not enter the fray, bettering the chances of the party women’s wing leader Gangada Sujatha for the coveted post. A candidate each belonging to the Telugu Desam Party and the Jana Sena Party withdrew their nominations on Tuesday.

03 March 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Film shoot stopped at Erramatti Dibbalu||A film shooting was stopped on Tuesday at the coastal red sand dunes, which is popularly known as Erramatti Dibbalu, near Bheemunipatnam. The site was declared as geo-heritage site by the Geological Survey of India in 2014 and as the protected site by the State government in 2016. Officials from the Departments of Tourism and Revenue reacted immediately and stopped the shooting, after video of the shooting that was uploaded on the social media by environmentalists Sohan and Jaishri Hatangadi had gone viral. Senior officers from the Revenue and Tourism Departments said that the film unit under the banner Lucky Media had obtained permission for the shooting from Bheemunipatnam Mutually Aided Co-operative Building Society, a layout that lies adjacent to the heritage site, from February 28 to March 2. “But they trespassed into the heritage site and we inspected and told them to leave immediately,” said Bheemunipatnam Tahsildar Easwar Rao. The revenue officials also confirmed the claim of the villagers from Nerellavalasa village, a village adjacent to the heritage site, that an earthmoving equipment was used to flatten some of the dunes to pave the way for the film crew and material. “This is a serious violation and it needs to be investigated and strict action should be initiated. It was surprising to see men and material be moved right into the core area,” said D. Rajasekhar Reddy, Adviser to Geo Heritage Cell of INTACH and former professor of Geology, Andhra University. According to him, every heritage site has a core area and a buffer zone of at least 200 metres around the core site. “In this case both were encroached by heavy machinery and authorities concerned need to take care that such things are not repeated, as the site is a very fragile geo-heritage site,” said Prof. Reddy. Visakhapatnam has recorded geological connection from the present day to 1500 millennia. The last major climate shift took place about 18,500 years ago, which was called the Glacial Maximum or the ice age. This unique natural formation of Erramatt Dibbalu, is part of the continuous evolution of the earth since millions of years and it represents the late Quaternary Geological age or the last ice age, said the professor. It is a unique geo-heritage site, and only two such sites are present in the world — one in Sri Lanka and the other in Chennai. Mr. Sohan Hatangadi said that the site needs to be fenced and guards are to be deployed. Entry for tourists should be through designated gates. Locals also should be educated to serve as protectors of the site, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/film-shoot-stopped-at-erramatti-dibbalu/article33976170.ece

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Mr. Narayana said in view of the changing political scenario in the country, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would be washed out in elections in Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Assam. Elections will begin in the five States from March 27 and the results will be out on May 2. The alliances against the BJP in those States would form governments, he claimed. The BJP leaders were deeply involved in corruption, he alleged. Referring to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant privatisation, Mr. Narayana extended support to the State bandh on March 5. All political parties have to join the issue and put up a united struggle, he said. Local body polls Referring to polls to local bodies, he sought to know why Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was afraid of local bodies elections if Rajanna Rajyam was being implemented in letter and spirit. Why was the YSRCP craving for unanimous polls? Why were there attacks on Opposition parties' candidates and leaders? he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-will-face-drubbing-in-assembly-elections-narayana/article33976198.ece

03 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu to kick-start roadshows tomorrow||Close on the heels of the Tirupati airport incident, TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu has decided to participate in roadshows in Kurnool, Chittoor, Tirupati, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Guntur. He will kick-start them from Thursday as part of the party’s election campaign for municipal elections. The exact schedule is yet to be announced, but tentatively he will start his roadshows from Kurnool. Mr. Naidu's decision assumes significance in the wake of his detention at Tirupati airport on Monday. The police told him that he cannot enter the temple town owing to the model code for the ongoing municipal elections. The roadshows in Tirupati and Chittoor are likely to pass through the areas where he was supposed to stage a sit-in. He is likely to raise a few issues, including steep rise in property taxes, alleged intimidation by YSRCP leaders, alleged false cases foisted against the TDP leaders, kidnapping of TDP candidates, forcible withdrawal of nominations, role of volunteers in the electioneering. Mr. Naidu, interacting with the party leaders via teleconference on Tuesday, stressed on the need to put up the fight against intimidation. The TDP would take legal action to ensure that no official would dare to take wrong decisions, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-to-kick-start-roadshows-tomorrow/article33976139.ece

03 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Steel plant divestment only in consultation with stakeholders’||The move to privatise Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) will be taken forward only in consultation will all its stakeholders, who included its employees, BJP Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasaimha Rao has said. Addressing the media on Tuesday, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that employees were the main stakeholders and the “BJP promises to take care of them.” “The employees may also have a stake in the deal,” he added. Stating that it would take at least one year for privatisation of the VSP as it was listed after 34 other PSUs, he said it would be done in transparent manner. Reiterating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s view that “the government has no business to do business,” Mr. Narasimha Rao said privatisation was for the benefit of the VSP. “The Centre intends to have a role only in respect of strategic industries and that it will not interfere in non-strategic units,” he said, and citied as example how private airlines were doing good compared to the government-run airlines. He also said that privatisation of industries was not based on whether they were making profit or loss. Dig at YSRCP govt. Taking a dig at the State government, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that on the one hand it was welcoming POSCO to set up a plant in Krishnapatnam and on the other it was opposing VSP privatisation for political mileage. Meanwhile, members of the Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Committee condemned Mr. Narasimha Rao’s statement that industries would prosper after privatisation. Committee chairman Ch. Narasinga Rao asked Mr. Narasimha Rao whether the BJP was ready for a debate over the VSP issue. “It is a conspiracy hatched by the BJP to handover VSP to private people instead of allotting it captive mines,” he alleged. On Mr. Narasimha Rao’s statements that China had prospered after privatisation, Mr. Narasinga Rao said that about 90% of sectors come under the government’s purview in that country. The government there had complete grip over the 10% industries in the hands of the private people, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/steel-plant-divestment-only-in-consultation-with-stakeholders/article33976142.ece

Andhra Pradesh has one major port in Visakhapatnam, five functional State ports and 10 other notified State ports with world class facilities that handle more than 170 million tonnes of cargo per annum, second only to Gujarat. The State shared 4% of total Indian exports and aimed at reaching 10% share by 2030, said Mr. Jagan. To further unlock this potential offered by the long coastline, the State government had undertaken development of three greenfield ports at Ramayapatnam, Machilipatnam and Bhavanapadu on an innovative model that mitigated all risks associated with greenfield port development, thereby making the port operation a risk-free proposition for the private sector. After the development of the port by the government, the operator of the port would be selected on competitive bidding basis ensuring maximum revenue realisation for the government, he said. These all-weather, deep-drafted ports were all set to be operational by 2023, creating an additional capacity of at least 100 million tonnes of cargo per annum in the short term, with a potential to grow leaps and bounds in the long term, Mr. Jagan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/time-ripe-to-unlock-the-potential-of-blue-economy/article33976136.ece

03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A year of dilemmas, risks and sacrifices||The State government doffed its hat to the healthcare workers (HCWs) of Gandhi Hospital here, which had been turned into an exclusive COVID-19 facility during the peak of the pandemic, and acknowledged their unwavering efforts, commitment and immense sacrifices with a ‘Felicitation of Corona Warriors’ programme on Tuesday. The date March 2 holds significance for HCWs of this government hospital as it was where Telangana’s first COVID patient underwent treatment. In a packed hall at Gandhi, Health Minister Eatala Rajender, Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy, hospital superintendent M. Raja Rao, and former superintendent P. Shravan Kumar took turns to recall services rendered by doctors, nurses, para-medical staff, sanitation workers, patient care providers and support staff during challenging times. They narrated the dilemmas, threats and discrimination that the COVID warriors had to face. The Minister talked about how HCWs put duty before everything else and stayed away from their families for days on end. Some sanitation workers and patient care providers were debarred by neighbours from entering their own houses and had to take shelter on the hospital premises. Salary issue He assured sanitation workers and patient care providers that their demands for salary raise would be addressed. He urged doctors to undertake research to understand reasons for deaths of COVID patients. Dr Shravan, who was the hospital superintendent during the initial phase of the pandemic, said that after the first COVID case was admitted, they brainstormed on how to care for the patient while staying safe. He added that doctors from Pulmonology department also rose to the occasion during the trying times. Dr Raja Rao, the current superintendent, discussed the long procedure followed to discharge a COVID patient because of which people were stuck at the hospital for several weeks post recovery, apart from guidelines followed for admission of COVID suspects, handling of patient bodies, and treatment of COVID-positive pregnant women and those battling serious ailments. He read out list of names across sections, appreciating them for their dedication. He said the hospital had the distinction of treating over 30,000 COVID patients back to health. Though he planned to address the gathering for only 10 minutes, his speech lasted for over 25 minutes. Dr Ramesh Reddy said though they made anticipatory arrangements to attend cases, they were taken aback when the first case was detected. He stressed that people should not forget the services of medical personnel who served during the pandemic, fought and died of the infectious disease. HCWs and members of NGOs who donated medical resources and food were felicitated on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-year-of-dilemmas-risks-and-sacrifices/article33976027.ece
03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Discoms blamed for delay in fixing tariff||Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC) has blamed it on the two power distribution companies (discoms) for the inordinate delay in determination of retail supply tariff to all categories of consumers including Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB or Water Board) since FY2019-20. The observation was made by the Commission in its recent order on the two discoms’ plea to review/withdraw the revised tariff made applicable to the Water Board, through order dated July 18, 2020 of the Commission following a letter written by the Government to it on June 26, 2020, with retrospective effect from FY2018-19 till a final view is taken by it on tariff for FY2019-20, FY2020-21 and true up for FY2018-19. In its February 25 order providing relief to the Water Board, the ERC has turned down the pleas of the two discoms for revising the tariff in HT-V(B) category, as given to Hyderabad Metro Rail, extended to the Water Board by the Government and for advising the Government to reimburse the revenue loss incurred by them on account of implementing the revised tariff. “On one hand the applicants (discoms) do not choose to file the necessary petitions for determination for retail supply tariff so that tariff for the other public utility service (Water Board) is crystallised, on the other they are seeking rollback of the tariff extended without there being any statement on the withdrawal of the decision taken by the Government in August 2018,” the Commission said in its order on the first plea. The discoms argued that if the government wishes to grant any subsidy to any consumer or class of consumers in the tariff determined by the ERC, it has to pay the required amount in advance to compensate the revenue loss expected to be suffered by them (discoms) with the subsidy. Further, they have pointed out that the determined tariff could not be amended except in case of changes through fuel surcharge adjustment formula. In case the Government plans any subsidy it shall be done with provision of explicit subvention. However, the Water Board has requested for continuation of the revised tariff perpetually and they were pursuing with the Government for provision of necessary subvention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/discoms-blamed-for-delay-in-fixing-tariff/article33976035.ece
03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||ML Jaisimha Sports Foundation formed||Jaisimha Cricket Academy has been transformed into ML Jaisimha Sports Foundation on the eve of the 82nd birth anniversary of the great cricketer. “This Trust has been started to keep Jaisimha’s legacy alive and make his dream of providing free coaching in all sports to talented young sports persons who cannot afford it,” Vidyuth Jaisimha, said on Tuesday. “Our first initiative is to provide free coaching to 30 deserving young underprivileged cricketers, 15 boys and 15 girls in the under-15 and 19 years age groups. This was Jaisimha’s dream,” Jaisimha’s elder son Vidyuth said. “The cricketers will initially be from the State of Telangana and will commence once permission is granted by the Government during this pandemic,” he added.

03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Leading through a crisis with resilience||For the Health department, the first few weeks of COVID-19 pandemic was marked by endless meetings, which often ran late into the night. The fact that it was a new infectious disease and research was just launched into it threw many challenges at the medical fraternity and senior officials of the department. State of healthcare in focus As COVID patients and suspects were admitted only to State government hospitals, there was heavy focus on the state of the health facilities, their infrastructure and medical services provided. A few in-patients uploaded videos to highlight conditions that needed improvement while healthcare workers (HCWs) went beyond the call of duty to care for patients abandoned by their families. Amid all this, officials had to plan treatment protocols and bolster infrastructure. Minister shifted office Since there were multiple issues to deal with, Health Minister Eatala Rajender shifted his office to the State Health campus in Koti to coordinate closely with officials.  Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy said, as a medical professional, it was his first tryst with a pandemic and that all steps were taken to improve infrastructure as well as strength of doctors, nurses and patient care providers as the number of patients started swelling. Early detection and treatment has helped control the virus spread and save thousands of lives, he added. The Directorate of Public Health (DPH) headed by G. Srinivasa Rao dealt with COVID testing and contact tracing. When people were hesitant to step outside of their homes, DPH staff went around collecting swab samples, and visiting suspects and patients in home isolation to collect details of their contacts. HCWs succumbed Over 30 HCWs from the DPH and DME wing died of COVID while hundreds of others battled and recovered from the infection. Dr Srinivasa Rao and his colleagues used to attend video conferences with the Union Health Ministry where changes in testing strategies, contact tracing and other crucial aspects were discussed which had to be communicated to the ground-level staff. To pull off the work, the staff had to work relentlessly. However, their workload has not lessened as the DPH is involved in administering COVID vaccine to HCWs and frontline workers, senior citizens and people in the 45-59 year age group with co-morbidities. Along with that, they have to keep a close watch on any possible surge in COVID cases.  Early detection and treatment has helped control the virus spread and save thousands of lives. K. Ramesh Reddy, Director of Medical Education||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/leading-through-a-crisis-with-resilience/article33976028.ece
03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Video-KYC for digital SB account opening launched||The Telangana Grameena Bank (TGB) and Andhra Pradesh Grameena Vikas Bank (APGVB) have launched Digital Savings Account opening, for new customers, through a video-KYC (know your customer) process. The two regional rural banks were selected by State Bank of India to implement the pilot project of the video-KYC, which eventually is to be offered at all 14 RRBs sponsored by SBI. SBI Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara, who virtually launched the facility on Monday, appreciated the efforts of RRBs and application service provider C-Edge Technologies in implementing video-KYC feature. The RRBs possessed the skill sets and were nimble-footed with an ability to adopt new technologies. Launch of such facilities was a reflection of their progressive thinking. He complimented chairmen of the RRBs and expressed confidence that the banks will change the complexion of rural economy and make the parent bank proud. A release said the Video KYC application used technology tools such as facial recognition, Dynamic Verification code, AI enabled OCR, geotagging as mandated by RBI directives to make the KYC process safe and secure. SBI Managing Director (IB, T&S) Ashwini Kumar Tewari, CGM (A&S) Devendra Kumar and GM (RRB) A&S M.N.Aravind Kumar as well as APGVB chairman K.Praveen Kumar and TGB chairman V.Arvind participated in the programme. Mr.Arvind said with this initiative TGB and APGVB would become the first among RRBs across the country in adopting the state-of-art technologies having full security features for zero contact on-boarding of customers on a par with commercial banks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/video-kyc-for-digital-sb-account-opening-launched/article33976036.ece
03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Nirmala Sitaraman’s intervention urged||Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar has urged Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman to instruct banks in the State to achieve the revised target of sanctioning of 28 lakh Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) loans in a time-bound manner. Telangana is a newly formed State and hence, it requires fair share of Mudra loans sanctioned by banks for its small businesses and unemployed. The PMMY is intended to promote self-employment and to support small business persons by providing financial assistance up to Rs. 10 lakh through banks without insisting for any collateral security. 24 crore helped The scheme helped over 24 crore people throughout the country till the end of March 31, 2020. But the percentage and number of PMMY beneficiaries in the State was much lower when compared to the national average. In a letter addressed to the Union Minister, Mr. Vinod Kumar reminded her his previous communication bringing to her notice that lakhs of unemployed and small business persons of the State were deprived of availing of the benefits under the PMMY and were unable to attain the national average of people availing Mudra loans. He recalled his request for giving additional target of sanctioning 30 lakh Mudra loans to eligible borrowers in the State. Banks, however, had not taken any steps to fulfil the shortfall of previous years and were still reluctant in sanctioning Mudra loans in the State. Small business persons like vegetable vendors were totally neglected in the sanction of Mudra loans as a result of which not a single Mudra loan was sanctioned in thousands of villages. “Not even one per cent of population is covered by the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana loans in many districts of Telangana as on date,” he lamented. Only 10.62 per cent of the State population was covered under the scheme as against 17.86 per cent of the population across the country availing the facility. In view of this, he requested the intervention of the Union Minister for doing justice to lakhs of eligible poor, unemployed and small businesses in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nirmala-sitaramans-intervention-urged/article33976038.ece
03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Plea to take up settlement along with land survey||As the stage is being set for the launch of the survey of lands across the State through digital mode, experts are suggesting that the government initiate settlement process simultaneously to avoid legal complications. The government should enact a comprehensive new survey act replacing the 1923 Act in vogue and constitute a dispute redressal mechanism like tribunals for taking cognizance of the objections raised by the land owners on fixing of boundaries so that they could be resolved expeditiously. The replacement of the old legislation was mandatory as it reportedly has several lacunae that need to be rectified for taking up a fool-proof survey of the lands. The last time land survey was taken up in Telangana was in 1930s, almost 90 years ago, while in practice survey would be conducted once every thirty years or so. Though the government had contemplated to launch land survey along with the Land Record Updation Programme taken up three years ago, it could not materialise. The survey was necessitated as there was mismatch between the land registered with the authorities concerned and the actual field situation. There was also absence of village maps, field measurement books of tippons and sethwars considered to be parent records of all details pertaining to lands. In this background, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao during a recent review meeting announced the government’s resolve to launch digital survey of lands to end land-related disputes once and for all. The Revenue department has commenced the exercise to gather information on the modalities adopted by States lime Bihar, Odisha and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh which conducted land survey. Andhra Pradesh, for instance, deployed drone technology envisaging exact demarcation of boundaries so that extent of land of each holder could be fixed exactly. The exercise is aimed at finalising the modalities before inviting expression of interest from the interested parties. “Conduct of survey alone will not suffice. The government should take up settlement simultaneously so that the consent of land owners for the boundaries fixed through the survey is obtained,” Nalsar adjunct professor and land issues expert Sunil Kumar told The Hindu . He said simultaneous conduct of survey and settlement exercise would give sanctity to the records that would be generated and this would pave the way for the enactment of the much desired title guarantee legislation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/plea-to-take-up-settlement-along-with-land-survey/article33976042.ece
03 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Telecom mobile towers in TS complying with norms’||The Department of Telecom (DoT) has tested 4,245 base tansceiver units (BTS)/ mobile towers of various telecom service providers (TSPs) between June 2020 and February 2021 and found 4,244 BTSs to be compliant with safety norms. “We have come across only one mobile tower slightly beyond the norms, which was also subsequently complied within the norms,” said Director Arvind Kumar on Tuesday. The check was taken up following “growing public concern about possible health hazards from electro-magnetic field (EMF) exposures from mobile phones or their base stations”, he explained. The department has taken strict measures for regulating EMF emission from a mobile tower within the safe exposure limits. “It is very important to note that our emission standards are 10 times more stringent than that of the existing limits prescribed by International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Our telecom towers are also far better than the standards adopted by developed countries like the USA, Canada, Japan and Australia,” he asserted. “The fact is mobile towers are safe in Telangana”, he claimed. ‘ Detailed information can also be provided by mail on paying a nominal fee. DoT-Hyderabad is also conducting an online EMF awareness programme on March 3.

Mr Owaisi was speaking at the AIMIM’s 63rd foundation day of the party in Darussalaam. “You were the Chief Justice. Are you saying that the poor of India should not have hopes of getting justice from courts? Are you saying that corporates will get justice because of the crores that they have, and the poor, Muslims will not get justice?” he said, adding that the job of judiciary was to dispense justice and not run the economy. “When you sat there, what did you do to unshackle the judiciary? Nothing.” Touching upon the questions raised about the AIMIM’s Bihar legislators at meeting with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the Hyderabad parliamentarian said that the development of Seemanchal region was the agenda. He threatened to organise a chakka jam in case the development of the backward region was ignored. Reiterating his support for the farmer agitation, Mr Owaisi said that his party stood with the families of those who had lost their lives. He demanded that the Centre withdraw the farmer laws.

03 March 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||RRR proposal creates tension||K. Venkata Reddy is a farmer from Kandi village. He has about one-and-a-half acre land near the mandal headquarters. The recent announcement by the Centre that an in-principle green signal was given to Regional Ring Road (RRR) has put him in confusion. He does not know whether he should feel happy or worried about the proposed major road project. The same is the situation of hundreds of farmers in the district. No one knows what will be their fate a year down the lane. The land rates have already skyrocketed and they are expected to go up further with the announcement and there are many who are interested in investing now and ready to wait. “Here the open market rate is about Rs. 2 crore per acre if the land parcel is facing the highway. In the interior areas the cost is varying between Rs. 1 crore and Rs. 1.5 crore depending on the accessibility to the road. However, there is no official communication so far regarding land requirement,” said an officer on condition of anonymity. In the combined Medak district, Sangareddy, Kandi, Narsapur, Shivampet, Nacharam, Gajwel and Jagadevpur were expected to be linked by RRR. Surveys were reported to have been conducted for the mega road project to include Toopran, but now it has been replaced with Masaipet and the realignment has been taken up allegedly to benefit some influential persons. Residents of Narsapur area are also worried as survey was reported to have been conducted at three places in the past but nothing was finalised. There was an impression among the residents the RRR will pass about 10 kilometres away from the revenue divisional headquarters town but on one was sure. “The land acquisition programme for canals is on and farmers are on agitation mode and in the recent past they have held protest demonstrations before the government officials. Acquiring land and making paltry payment will make the farmers poorer,” said Bhikshapati, a resident of Narsapur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rrr-proposal-creates-tension/article33976173.ece

A ‘digilocker’ database has also been created to facilitate students to access their records.” Academic records and marksheets of those who have graduated since 2017 have already been transferred to the digilocker database, senior DU officials said. Elaborating on the digilocker database, D.S. Rawat, Dean (Examinations) of the varsity said, “It is a database where one can keep all academic documents. We have already transferred marksheets of those who graduated in the last three years. It got done around two weeks ago.” Data for those who graduated between 2017-2019 have been readied for issuance of digital degrees, added Mr. Rawat. Clear backlog “Undergraduate and postgraduate digital degrees for those three years will be released soon. The data is ready. The printing of degrees of those who graduated in 2017 are also ready. Printing for the other two years are almost done and will be sent to colleges subsequently. This will help in clearing the backlog which has been accumulating over a long period of time,” said Mr. Rawat. Adding that PhD degrees cannot be issued digitally due to the different thesis titles, Mr. Rawat said, “Our aim is that by the time the 2021 convocation arrives, we are ready with both the digital and printed degrees for that batch. It will eliminate the delay that students usually face in receiving their degrees.” New forms for exam registration, seeking information like enrolment numbers, will also be issued in the upcoming semesters to ensure that anomalies in data collection can be rectified before the degrees are issued, officials said. Will avoid lapses “Earlier, we used to take data from colleges and at times there were a few lapses. However, in the new forms, students will have to fill out their enrolment numbers as well as their names in Hindi. The university usually requires these two things from respective colleges. The admit cards and marksheets issued will also have the same details. The fact that students will have to repeat this process every semester, by the time they graduate and degrees are issued, the process will ensure that all the details are correct and rectified if required,” explained Mr. Rawat.  Digilocker database is where one can keep all academic documents. We have already transferred marksheets of those who graduated in the last three years   D.S.

03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong. protests soaring oil, cooking gas prices||The Delhi Congress on Tuesday protested against the soaring oil prices, alleging that the Central and State governments are not taking any steps towards a tax cut. The party said a major part of the petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices goes into Excise Duty, collected by the Central Government and VAT (Value Added Tax), imposed by the Delhi government. Delhi party chief Ch. Anil Kumar led the demonstration, which was also joined by Indian Youth Congress, outside the BJP headquarters on Rouse. To show the burden of rise in price of cooking gas on household budgets, the party workers carried cylinders on their heads. “After the latest price hike of cooking gas, a 14.2 kilogram domestic LPG cylinder will cost Rs. 819 in Delhi up from Rs. 794. Similarly, the price of a 19 kilogram commercial LPG cylinder has been hiked by Rs. 95 to Rs. 1,614 per cylinder. The last LPG price hike came less than a week ago when it was increased by Rs. 25 last Thursday,” the party said. The workers also questioned why AAP was silent when the common man was facing the burden of increased fuel prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cong-protests-soaring-oil-cooking-gas-prices/article33975764.ece

03 March 2021||NEW DELHI/Ghaziabad,||Ghazipur border opens briefly||The Delhi police on Tuesday closed the Ghazipur border hours after it reopened a part of NH-9 — for vehicular movement — where the farmers have been protesting against farm laws for over three months. Sources said that district police took a call on opening the route in an attempt to ease out traffic from Delhi to Ghaziabad side but installed the barricades again. The route opened around 5 a.m. and shut again around noon because of chaos that ensued. The stretch has remained closed since January 26 when violence broke out during the farmers’ tractor parade on Republic Day, leaving several, including police officers injured. It was open for traffic in the first two months, barring a few days. ‘Welcome step’ The protesting farmers welcomed the opening of the lane. “It is a welcome step. We appeal to the administration to keep it open,” said Dharmendra Malik, media incharge of Bhartiya Kisan Union. He said that for the first two months of the protest, this lane remained open for traffic without any hassle. Besides, the lane on which the stage is erected, there is space left for the movement of ambulances going from Uttar Pradesh towards Delhi, he said. “However, after January 26, it was closed, causing problems to the public.” Apart from Ghaziabad residents, the opening of the expressway will provide relief to people travelling from Delhi towards Meerut and Hapur. At present, they have to take a detour through Apsara or Anand Vihar borders. It leads to traffic snarls during office hours. Ramanand Kushwaha, Superintendent of Police (Traffic), Ghaziabad said the decision to open and close the expressway lane was that of the Delhi police. The Ghaziabad administration had nothing to do with it, he said.

03 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Akali Dal seeks loan waiver for farmers||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday raised the issue of farmer suicides in Punjab on the second day of the Assembly’s budget session, demanding a complete farm loan waiver as promised by the ruling Congress government before coming to power in 2017. SAD MLAs demanded that a two-day discussion should be held on farmer’s issues. The main Opposition, the Aam Aadmi Party, raised the issue of delay in the election of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). AAP MLA and Leader of the Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said that the government was responsible for the delay in the SGPC elections, which he alleged was ‘hand in glove’ with the Shiromani Akali Dal. Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, talking to reporters, said the Congress government’s failure to implement the loan waiver had resulted in increase in farmer suicides. “Indebtedness had increased because the people believed in the Congress’ promise and many did not pay their instalments,” said Mr. Majithia. He alleged that the State government has failed to take up the issues of farmers with the Central government. “The Congress government on its part had failed to impress upon the Centre to release a special package for the State so that it could do the much needed diversification and rejuvenate agriculture practices. This includes revamp of the canal irrigation system and intensive micro irrigation systems besides water management and rainwater harvesting”, Mr. Majithia said.  Repair of roads Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh during the question hour assured the House that work on repair of damaged link roads across the State was moving on fast track and would be completed within the next one year. Responding to a question, he said that repair work on 34,977 kilometres of State’s link roads would be completed by April-end and work on another 6,162 kms would be completed in the next financial year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/akali-dal-seeks-loan-waiver-for-farmers/article33976000.ece
03 March 2021||Ghaziabad,||Now, Samajwadi Party to hold kisan panchayats in west U.P.||After the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), the Congress and the Aam Admi Party (AAP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) will also hold kisan panchayats in western Uttar Pradesh, starting with Tappal in Aligarh on March 5. It will be followed by panchayats in Kasganj and Mathura. Though the SP workers have their lent support at the Ghazipur protest site and its local leaders have shared the stage with Jayant Chaudhary at RLD’s panchayats in the region, the party didn’t hold its own panchayats. Observers find the late entry of the leading opposition party of the State in the panchayat trail baffling. When RLD’s panchayats started with Shamli on February 5, many felt that the SP was giving space to its electoral partner in the region to flex its muscles. Sources in the RLD say perhaps Jayant Chaudhary’s well-attended panchayats in Basti and Lakhimpur Kheri in the eastern and central parts of the State have pushed the senior partner to show its worth in the western part of the State. “However, common sense says the SP should hold panchayats in its strongholds in eastern Uttar Pradesh to give voice to the farmers’ discontent,” said a senior RLD leader. “You have to give credit to Jayant for taking the lead in picking the farmers mood early. When he was on the ground, the SP leadership was only tweeting,” he added. On record, Girish Yadav, district president of Aligarh unit of the SP, said, “Our senior leadership was not getting permission to hold panchayat. As soon as the administration granted us permission, we are holding a panchayat in Tappal.” He said local RLD leaders had been invited and that there was no divide between the two parties in the region. “Elections are still some time away. At present, the idea is to address the concerns of farmers,” he said. ‘Local aspirations’ Both parties tried to play down the posters and whatsapp messages circulating in Aligarh where Jayant Chaudhary had been projected as the Chief Minister in 2022. “These are local aspirations. Everybody knows the SP is the contender for the top post but the RLD would play an important role in taking it there,” said Sunil Rohata, spokesperson of the RLD.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/now-samajwadi-party-to-hold-kisan-panchayats-in-west-up/article33976003.ece
03 March 2021||Ghaziabad,||Body of minor exhumed from pit in Bulandshahr||The body of a minor girl was exhumed from a pit in a field in Anoopshahr area of Bulandshahr on Tuesday, police said. Senior officers suspect that it could be a case of sexual assault leading to murder. A suspect is absconding while his father has been taken into custody. The deceased went missing six days back mysteriously from the front of a house where she apparently went to have water. The family members of the vicitm had registered a complaint in Anoopshahr police station. Santosh Kumar Singh, SSP Bulandshahr, said the complaint registered on February 28 mentioned that the 13-year-old girl went missing when she went to cut grass in the field with her mother and two sisters. “After having food, she walked around 100 metres to have water but didn’t return. Her sisters called for her but could not find her. They first thought that she might have returned home and kept looking for her.” Next day, Mr. Singh said, when they came here, they found a young man in a drunken stupor. “As this was the spot where the girl was last seen, the police team checked it thoroughly and found at one place the soil was loose. “When it was dug, the body was found. It has been sent for post-mortem. Prima facie, it seems a case of murder. The young man is missing. We have detained his father. We have changed the section from 363 to 302 (murder) of IPC,” he said. District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar said prima facie it seemed sexual assault, the administration would provide relief under Rani Laxmibai Mahila and Bal Samman Kosh.  No breakthough Meanwhile, in the alleged murder and rape case of a Dalit minor girl in Akrabad area of Aligarh, no breakthrough had been achieved so far. SSP Muniraj G camped at the village throughout the day. “We have found some vital evidence and would soon solve the case,” he said.

Mr. Pawar made the statement after Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis raised the issue through an adjournment motion. MLAs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had earlier staged a protest over the power connections of farmers being disconnected. The BJP leaders claimed that people across the State were very angry over the inflated electricity bills. “Farmers have already suffered big losses due to the lockdown and heavy rainfall. Now, they are facing a crisis owing to cutting of power supply. Lakhs of people are receiving notices,” Mr. Fadnavis said. Alluding to Power Minister Nitin Raut, Mr. Fadnavis said instead of providing relief to consumers, power tariffs were being raised. “Small shopkeepers could not do business during the lockdown. Now you are asking them to pay bills. From where are they going to pay it? So, there is a big problem,” he said. Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole too called for stopping the ongoing drive of disconnecting the power supply of defaulting consumers. “The practice of issuing the average of past electricity bills to consumers has to be stopped. The Power Department should take an actual meter reading before issuing bills to consumers,” he said. In response, Mr. Pawar said, “I would like to submit on behalf of the State government that the drive of disconnecting the electricity supply of farmers or other domestic consumers will be stopped immediately until the issue raised is discussed within the House.” The minister said other decisions with regard to the issue will be taken after MLAs are satisfied with the outcome of the discussion. The State government had earlier said agricultural power consumers have dues of over Rs. 45,000 crore and domestic users owe over Rs. 2,778 crore. The Power Department then announced a drive to cut the power connections of users with unpaid bills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/will-stop-cutting-power-connection-of-defaulting-consumers-ajit-pawar/article33975696.ece

03 March 2021||Yangon,||Myanmar security forces fire on protesters||Myanmar security forces fired live rounds and tear gas at protesters again on Tuesday, leaving at least three people critically injured as regional powers rebuked the junta over its deadly crackdown. The country has seen weeks of mass protests demanding the military release civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the February 1 coup. Soldiers and police have steadily stepped up their use of force, deploying tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and, increasingly, live rounds. Sunday was the bloodiest day since the military takeover, with the United Nations saying at least 18 protesters were killed across the country. AFP independently confirmed 11 deaths. Another rally turned violent on Tuesday, in the northwestern town of Kale, where security forces opened fire on protesters, according to medics. “About 20 people were injured in a crackdown by police and soldiers in Kale,” said a rescue worker. A doctor who treated the patients in a hospital confirmed the number of people in a critical condition. “One was hit in his thigh and he’s now under operation. Another one got hit in the abdomen and he requires blood transfusions... Another one got hit in the chest,” he said. The bloodshed came on the same day as the funeral was held in the commercial capital of Yangon for a 23-year-old student who died on Sunday. The mourners sang a revolutionary song as the coffin carrying Nyi Nyi Aung Htet Naing moved through a sea of thousands to an altar. Some climbed trees to catch a glimpse of the procession. “No mercy, just bullies — dead bodies are here and there,” the mourners sang in unison as they flashed a three-finger salute. “Oh, the brave heroes who died for democracy.” Protests also continued in Yangon on Tuesday. In San Chaung township, hundreds of police came out in full force. “They used tear gas and were shooting as well,” said one resident. More than 1,200 people have been arrested, charged and sentenced since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group, of which about 900 are still behind bars. International rebuke The unrest continued as Foreign Ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc held a virtual meeting, which included a Myanmar representative. Ahead of the talks, some regional powers broke with diplomatic traditions and issued harsh rebukes to Myanmar’s military. “To use lethal force against civilians and unarmed demonstrators, I think it is just not acceptable,” Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said. After the meeting, Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi expressed concern over rising violence and deaths as well as frustration over a lack of cooperation from the Myanmar regime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-security-forces-fire-on-protesters/article33975396.ece
03 March 2021||NEW YORK,||Cuomo harassment charges leave Democrats in a fix||Democrats across the country celebrated New York Governor Andrew Cuomo as the face of governing competence as President Donald Trump fumbled his administration’s response to the exploding pandemic last year. Now, the Democratic Governor is struggling through a sexual harassment scandal that’s testing the limits of his party’s support as Democrats grapple with one of the first political headaches of the post-Trump era. So far, few Democrats have come to Mr. Cuomo’s rescue. But they haven’t explicitly condemned him, either. Both of New York’s Democratic U.S. Senators have publicly embraced the State Attorney General’s nascent investigation into Mr. Cuomo’s behaviour. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday described the allegations as “deeply troubling and deeply concerning.” And on Monday, President Joe Biden, a longtime ally of Mr. Cuomo, declined to stand behind the embattled Governor. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the President supports the state Attorney General’s probe. She noted that Mr. Biden requires people to be treated with civility and respect in his administration. “The President’s view has been consistent and clear,” Ms. Psaki said when asked about Mr. Cuomo. “Every woman coming forward should be treated with dignity and respect.” While Democrats across the country are not rallying behind Mr. Cuomo, few are calling for him to step down. For now, Rep. Kathleen Rice is the only Democrat from New York’s congressional delegation to explicitly call for Mr. Cuomo’s resignation. That’s in contrast to the treatment of former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, who ultimately bowed to pressure from within his own party to step down in 2018 after facing accusations of sexual impropriety from several women. At that time, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was the first Democrat to call on Mr. Franken to resign. On Sunday, Ms. Gillibrand called the allegations against Mr. Cuomo “serious and deeply concerning” and called on State A-G to conduct “a transparent and thorough investigation with subpoena power.” GOP’s muted approach Republicans highlighted the relatively cautious response from some Democrats, although the GOP’s criticism of Mr. Cuomo directly was somewhat muted given the long list of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Trump. Mr. Cuomo acknowledged for the first time on Sunday that some of his behaviour with women “may have been insensitive or too personal,” and said he would cooperate with a sexual harassment investigation led by the State’s Attorney General.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/cuomo-harassment-charges-leave-democrats-in-a-fix/article33975391.ece
03 March 2021||Washington,||Khashoggi killing: U.S. tells Saudi Arabia to take action||The U.S. on Monday pressed Saudi Arabia to take further measures after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi as Washington faced growing criticism that it did not directly target Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. President Joe Biden on Friday released an intelligence report that found that Prince Mohammed approved the 2018 killing of Khashoggi, a U.S.-based contributor to The Washington Post who was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he was strangled to death and dismembered. The report — classified under former president Donald Trump, a close ally of the Saudis — found that seven of the 15 members of the hit squad that flew to Istanbul came from the Rapid Intervention Force, which it said “exists to defend the Crown Prince” and “answers only to him.” “We have urged Saudi Arabia to disband this group and then adopt institutional, systemic reforms and controls to ensure that anti-dissident activities and operations cease and cease completely,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said. “We have made crystal clear — and will continue to do so — that the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi 28 months ago remains unacceptable conduct,” Mr. Price said. ‘Lift ban on activist’ He also called on Riyadh to act on other fronts, including lifting a travel ban on Loujain al-Hathloul, an advocate for women’s right to drive in the ultra-conservative kingdom who was provisionally freed in January after nearly three years in jail. The Biden administration imposed sanctions on the Rapid Intervention Forceand said it was banning entry into the U.S. of 76 Saudis. Mr. Biden has sought to “recalibrate” Saudi alliance and has already said the U.S. will end support for offensive operations in Yemen. But the administration stopped short of personally targeting the 35-year-old crown prince — the de facto leader as well as Defence Minister. Asked why no action was taken against the Prince, also known by his initials MBS, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the U.S. does not typically sanction foreign leaders. But she hinted that Prince Mohammed was not permanently off the hook.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/khashoggi-killing-us-tells-saudi-arabia-to-take-action/article33975400.ece
03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘National consensus govt. is in the interest of Nepal-India ties’||Forming a national consensus government in Kathmandu is in the interest of Nepal-India relation, said former Nepal Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai here on Monday. In an interview with The Hindu , Mr. Bhattarai said a national consensus government will be able to amend the Constitution of Nepal to make it more representative and hold more effective dialogue with India on difficult issues. “Earlier in 2008 when the Maoists joined the peace process and had a comprehensive peace agreement with the parliamentary parties, we had an understanding to form a consensus government. Unfortunately, it broke down. As a result, parts of the peace process was left unfinished. Secondly, the Constitution we made has not been owned by large sections of the people like the Madhesis and the Janjatis. With a national consensus government we can speak in unified voice with India and find a solution to the boundary dispute as well,” said Mr. Bhattarai, arguing that he and other leaders of various political formations will begin discussion for a new government once Parliament convenes on March 7. Mr. Bhattarai said Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli has not shown respect to the ruling of the Supreme Court which reinstated the lower house of the Nepalese Parliament (Pratinidhi Sabha) on February 23. No-confidence vote “Prime Minister Oli has refused to resign and if he continues with this position, then Parliament will move a no-confidence motion to remove him.” He said there are four political formations in Nepal at present. The first two are led by the two factions of the Nepal Communist Party of Mr. Oli, and his rivals party co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Madhav Kumar Nepal. The other two formations are led by the Nepali Congress and the Janata Samajvadi Party (JSP) of Mr. Bhattarai. Mr. Bhattarai said his party is calling for the amendments in the Constitution to make it more representative. “Nepal is a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual state. My party JSP is open to amendments. Almost one-third of our population is not adequately represented in the Nepali Congress and the Nepal Communist Party. But in my party, we have made that possible. I fully agree with the Madhesis. If we have a national consensus government, then we can complete the peace process and we can also amend the Constitution.” Mr. Bhattarai said that in near future, Nepal may even discuss the Hindu culture of the country at a political level but asked not to conflate monarchy with Hinduism. “Hinduism and monarchy are two different things. Monarchy is an autocratic outdated system whereas Hinduism is a culture and religion. If people have some reservation about culture and religion, then that can be discussed under our Constitution. In a democracy, people have the right to decide what they want. But Nepal will not go back to monarchy. Monarchy is part of the medieval ages and the Nepalese people cannot think of it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/national-consensus-govt-is-in-the-interest-of-nepal-india-ties/article33975394.ece
03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||India, Japan back in Sri Lanka port project||The deal had been signed by the former Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe government. The February 1 decision came amid mounting opposition from port worker unions and sections of the clergy to “foreign involvement” in the country’s national assets. The Rajapaksa government has offered India and Japan the WCT as an alternative, allowing higher stakes. In the ECT project agreed upon earlier, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) was to hold majority 51%, but in the WCT proposal, India and Japan will be accorded 85% stake, as is the case in the nearby Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), where China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited holds 85%, the government said. Asked how authorities had convinced the unions of foreign investment at another terminal in the same port, Mr. Rambukwella said their opposition was specific to the ECT, which was partially in use. The terminal’s further development, which is now to be undertaken by the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA), is aimed at augmenting operations at an estimated cost of upto $700 million. The West Container Terminal, however, has to be built from scratch, requiring a much higher investment. The WCT is adjacent to the China-run CICT and just a couple of kilometres away from the China-backed Port City being built on reclaimed land, making it a strategically desirable spot for India, whose concerns over China’s presence in Sri Lanka are well known. Colombo’s alternative offer also comes at a time when Sri Lanka is seeking support at the ongoing UN Human Right Council session, where a resolution on the country's rights record will soon be put to vote. The government recently wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Asked if the two developments were linked, Mr. Rambukwella said they were “two different areas — one is commercial, other one, more of international relations.” On the resolution, he said: “I think India would stand with the right group, and take correct measures to support us.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-japan-back-in-sri-lanka-port-project/article33975419.ece
03 March 2021||Islamabad,||‘Pak. needs legislation to meet FATF benchmarks’||Pakistan will have to make further legislation on at least two counts to meet three outstanding benchmarks of the 27-point action plan of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog FATF before the new June deadline, a media report said on Tuesday. The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to COVID-19 pandemic. The new deadline was set by the watchdog last month. Pakistan has been scrambling in recent months to avoid being added to a list of countries deemed non-compliant with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations by the FATF, a measure that officials here fear could further hurt its ailing economy. The Dawn newspaper reported that the government will have to submit an updated report within a month to the FATF on the progress on legislation and other steps to be taken to address the outstanding concerns. It was observed that Pakistan had made progress over the past two years. The additional legislation has to cover some weaknesses in the existing framework that limited the authorities from taking action, including imposing sanction or apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them, within certain deadlines. The three outstanding action points include demonstrating that Terrorism Financing (TF) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities and demonstrating that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. Thirdly, Pakistan has to demonstrate effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists, specifically those acting for or on their behalf, the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-needs-legislation-to-meet-fatf-benchmarks/article33975397.ece

Scores of Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters invaded the town of Dikwa in Borno State, dislodging troops from the military base and torching the humanitarian hub, a military source said. “We have 25 staff sheltering in the bunker which is under siege by the militants... but so far no staff has been affected,” a source said. Military reinforcements, including fighter jets and a helicopter gunship, had been deployed to help repel the attackers, the source said. A spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres confirmed only that there was a “security incident”, but gave no further details. Nigeria’s military has battled an insurgency by the Islamist group Boko Haram that has devastated the northeast, killing at least 36,000 people.

The research, posted as a pre-print and yet to be peer-reviewed, estimated the effect of both the COVID-19 vaccines on laboratory confirmed symptomatic disease in individuals aged 70 years or older in England. The researchers, including those from Public Health England (PHE), compared the rate of hospitalisation and deaths in confirmed COVID-19 patients aged over 80 who were vaccinated more than 14 days before testing positive, with unvaccinated cases. Data suggests that in the over 80s, a single dose of either vaccine is more than 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation, around 3 to 4 weeks after the jab, PHE said in a statement. Evidence for the Pfizer vaccine suggests that it leads to 83% reduction in deaths from COVID-19, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pfizer-oxford-shots-effective-for-elderly/article33975401.ece

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||The anatomy of a spring ceasefire||In the wake of registering 5,130 ceasefire violations in 2020, guns on either side of the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) fell silent on the intervening night of February 24-25, 2021. The February ceasefire has triggered widespread speculation about its durability, significance and implication for bilateral relations in general. The announcement by the two Director Generals of Military Operations (DGsMO) came as a surprise to many, and yet, it underlined the simple fact that all statesmen/women recognise while in office: countries cannot be run by rhetoric alone. More so, this announcement is also a recognition in New Delhi and Islamabad that they cannot afford to let violence spiral out of control given its inherently escalatory nature as events in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019 highlighted. Peace feelers Notwithstanding the surprise factor in the development, there have been some indications about a possible thaw in the relations between the traditional rivals. Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa stated in early February that “It is time to extend hand of peace in all directions”, and on the Indian side, the Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said around the same time that “with our continuous engagement with Pakistan, we will be able to prevail over them (for border peace)... as unsettled borders help no one”. India allowed the use of its airspace by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s special aircraft to fly to Sri Lanka and just a day before the ceasefire announcement, and upon his arrival in Colombo, Mr. Khan said, “Our only (sic) dispute is Kashmir and it can only be resolved through dialogue.” Clearly, the two sides were setting the stage for the announcement. Significance of the ceasefire What makes the February ceasefire significant is the fact that this agreement is different from the routine ceasefire assurances that the two sides made till January 2021. Twice in 2018, for instance, the two sides had agreed to uphold the ceasefire agreement when ceasefire violations were on the rise. But what makes the February 2021 ceasefire different is its two distinct features: one, this was a joint statement by the two DGsMO, and that unlike the previous declarations, the recent agreement mentions a specific date, i.e., the night of February 24-25, to begin the ceasefire. In that sense then, the February ceasefire is arguably one of the most significant military measures by India and Pakistan in over 18 years to reduce violence along the LoC in Kashmir. Coming in the wake of over 5,000 ceasefire violations in 2020 (the highest in 19 years since 2002) the agreement is path-breaking from a conflict management point of view. Interestingly, the November 2003 ceasefire agreement was also announced in the wake of a high level of violence through 2002 and 2003. The ceasefire is also significant because this helps New Delhi to defuse what was becoming a growing concern for the decision makers in New Delhi: an ugly two-front situation and a feeling of being boxed in by an inimical Pakistan and an aggressive China. It is easy to talk about a two or ‘two-and-a-half’ front situation for domestic grandstanding, but dealing with it is neither easy nor practical. That the Indian Army had to redeploy forces from the western border with Pakistan to the northern border with China is indicative of the serious material challenges it could throw up. The best way to deal with the two front challenge then, New Delhi could have reasoned, was to defuse at least one front. The LoC was a natural candidate. Given that the back channel process started much before the recent India-China disengagement on the LAC, New Delhi must have decided to defuse the western challenge from Pakistan first. And it worked. A brief history The history of India Pakistan ceasefire pacts and war termination agreements is both complex and instructive. The Karachi agreement of 1949, which ended the first war between newly formed India and Pakistan, was the first ceasefire agreement between the two countries which, signed under the good offices of the United Nations, created the India Pakistan boundary in Kashmir called the Ceasefire Line or CFL. The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was mandated to monitor the ceasefire along the CFL. The 1965 India-Pakistan war also ended in a ceasefire, but since status quo ante bellum was restored after the Tashkent Agreement, the CFL in Kashmir remained unaltered. However, the India-Pakistan war of 1971 would change that. The December ceasefire which ended the 1971 war was enshrined into the Simla Agreement the following year. But unlike 1965, status quo ante bellum was not restored by the Simla Agreement, a decision that would have important implications for bilateral relations. The Suchetgarh Agreement of 1972 delineated the ‘line of control’ in Jammu and Kashmir which resulted from the ceasefire of December 1971 thereby renaming the CFL as the LoC. By this smart move, Indian negotiators not only changed the nomenclature of the India-Pakistan dividing line in Kashmir and the physical alignment of the border in Jammu and Kashmir, but also made the UNMOGIP presence in Kashmir irrelevant. Recall that the UN force was mandated to ensure a ceasefire on the CFL, but there was no CFL after 1972, and, more so, the UN was not even a party to the Simla Agreement unlike the Karachi Agreement. Let us cut to the present. The 2003 agreement between the DGsMO, communicated through a telephone call between them, was a reiteration of the December 1971 war termination ceasefire; Technically, therefore, even the February 2021 ceasefire too is a reiteration of the 1971 ceasefire agreement. A form of intent And yet, a ceasefire does not observe itself — it requires a clearly articulated and mutually-agreed upon set of rules and norms for effective observance along with an intent to observe them. The February ceasefire is an expression of such an intent, but without the rules and norms to enforce it. The Simla Agreement or the Suchetgarh Agreement do not have those rules either. The Karachi Agreement, on the other hand, has clearly laid down provisions on how to manage the CFL which, of course, was overtaken by the LoC. Ironically, therefore, armed forces deployed on either side of the LoC in Kashmir often have to resort to the strictures enshrined in the long-defunct Karachi Agreement to observe the ceasefire mandated by the Simla Agreement. This needs to change. Now that the two DGsMO have declared a joint ceasefire, the next logical step is to arrive at a set of rules to govern that ceasefire. An unwritten ceasefire, experiences from conflict zones around the world show, tend to break down easily and trigger tensions in other domains. Return to the back channel What is also significant to note about the ceasefire agreement between the two DGsMO is that this was preceded by weeks, if not months of, high-level contacts through the back channel. For sure, major agreements of this kind cannot be finalised by army officers especially given the vitiated atmosphere surrounding India-Pakistan relations. More crucially, the fact that this ceasefire has political blessings makes it more durable. Interestingly, the 2003 ceasefire was also preceded by discreet parleys between the heads of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of India. The 2003 CFA led to a sustained period of back channel talks on Kashmir which, by mid 2007, had almost finalised a deal to resolve the Kashmir conflict. My research on the 2004-2007 back channel talks shows how discreet conversations between high-level interlocutors appointed by the heads of governments were able to make unprecedented progress on the mother of all India Pakistan conflicts, Kashmir. What is also evident from that period is that one key reason why the CFA held at least till 2008 was because there were parallel talks, along with holding fire on the LoC, on other outstanding bilateral issues, principally Kashmir. While whether the 2021 CFA would prompt talks in other areas is unclear as of now, I doubt the ability of piecemeal agreements to create durable stability bilaterally unless followed by progress in other domains.

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||The myth of the apolitical campus||In 2020, following nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 and the proposed National Register of Citizens there was a chorus to keep students out of politics. In December 2019, at the height of the agitation, Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said political parties should keep educational institutions out of their politics. This is despite the fact that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s own student wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, conducted rallies and meetings in support of the new law. The political elite of the Congress too advised students to depoliticise after independence, Professor Ghanshyam Shah writes in Social Movements in India . Today, several colleges and universities in India have rules mandating that campuses be apolitical spaces where students should focus on studies. Students participating in protests on these campuses are liable to be suspended or dismissed. Recently, following the arrest of climate activist Disha Ravi, this idea surfaced once again. Reports stated that parents are worried about their children’s social media posts on contentious issues and participation in protests. The concern possibly stems from a fear of the government and its frequent attempts to crack down on dissenters, a belief that the rough and tumble of politics is not suited for the young, the association of protests with lawlessness, and often a combination of these. Idea of education In India, 18-year-olds are allowed by law to drive cars, marry (if they are women), and in some States, drink. Most important, they are allowed to vote. Ironically, while campaigns are held before every election to increase voter turnout, especially among the youth, young adults are routinely advised to stay away from politics. How can they be expected to make an informed choice at the ballot box if they are not allowed to freely express their opinions on issues that concern them, or participate in protests, which is their democratic right? Many see students who focus solely on academics as role models, achievers and good citizens, and student protesters as rebellious, unruly, and bringing their institutions into disrepute. Such convenient categorisation ignores the very purpose of education and the conceptualisation of a campus. In Tagore’s words, an educational institution should not be “a dead cage in which living minds are fed with food that’s artificially prepared”. Institutions are not merely spaces where knowledge is imparted to passive recipients; they are spaces where there is debate, discussion and contestation of ideas. Moreover, it is fallacious to say that educational institutions are apolitical spaces when administrations and curricula, especially in the social sciences, are changed by the government of the day. We saw this in the case of Delhi University dropping A.K. Ramanujan’s celebrated essay, Three Hundred Ramayanas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation, from the history syllabus in 2011 and in the more recent case of the CBSE removing 30% of the syllabus for students of Classes 9-12, including portions on federalism, citizenship and secularism. It is not participation in protests alone that politicise the youth; it is equally the education they are — or are not — imparted.  Being apolitical, according to the dictionary definition, means to not be interested in politics or connected with a political party. While many citizens fall into this category, it is impossible for us, even the youth, to not have political views. To illustrate: A child who has grown up near a river into which sewage and industrial waste were continuously dumped may grow up fighting for clean water and air. He may not be a supporter of the BJP or the Congress or the regional parties, his knowledge of their ideologies and policies may be limited, but he may still attend a protest against the government’s inability to tackle pollution. Like him, many of us have views on how to tackle inequality, what model of development is appropriate and just, who should be taxed and by how much, food habits, rights and their restrictions, and so on. Much like sending WhatsApp forwards, expressing our views to family and friends, and posting on social media on politics, these views make us political. As Turkish-British writer Elif Shafak once said in an interview, “Wherever there’s power, there’s politics.” However, only those privileged across the categories of gender, ethnicity, caste, class, religion and social status can afford to remain silent on many of these issues. The luxury for some of being “apolitical” comes from the fact that they are not the targets of contentious policies — they, their families and communities are unaffected by unfair citizenship laws, agricultural policies, caste discrimination on campuses, bans on certain food, displacement from their lands, and so on. Some studies such as Ross (1969) also note that privilege is the reason why some students also participate in agitations: they protest because they are protected by wealth and influence. Social and economic privilege is why some may not have reason to protest; it is equally the reason why many can afford to speak out. Result of sustained demands Over the years, across nations, it is sustained demands by citizens that have earned us many of the precious rights we enjoy today, including the eight-hour workday, women’s right to vote, and equal pay. We also see around us the consequences of turning a blind eye to some of these protests. Reni village in Uttarakhand, which was the centre of the Chipko movement in the 1970s, bore the brunt of the landslide that killed 62 in the region recently. Many of the women who live in Reni now were children when they hugged the trees protesting against commercial logging. Scientists have time and again questioned the model of development in the region, including massive dam projects and rampant deforestation. When a government passes laws with little deliberation and discussion with the stakeholders concerned, it is but natural that people, many of whom elected that government to power, will protest. From Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam in Hong Kong to Greta Thunberg in Sweden and Disha Ravi in India, it is the youth who seem fearless and outspoken, and willing to take risks. In the past, too, it is the youth who spearheaded many movements in India, such as the anti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu. In India, Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees us the right to free speech, the right to assemble peaceably without arms, and the right to form associations. The right to protest is a manifestation of these rights. For the youth, the stakes are even higher in speaking out: policies and laws concern not only the rights, lives and livelihoods of citizens today, but have far-reaching implications for the future of the nation too. radhika.s@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-myth-of-the-apolitical-campus/article33975384.ece
03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||The Survey as policy with ideological overtones||The Economic Survey 2021 (https://bit.ly/2OfqfVQ) does not seem to be a policy document derived straight from the empirical data of the economy or the social compulsions embedded in it. On the contrary, the Survey rings with policy postulates based on strong ideological overtones. Of interest would be Chapter 4, captioned ‘Inequality and Growth: Conflict or Convergence?’ which is ostensibly “an effort to identify the correct policy objective for India”. Need for desirable outcomes Following the COVID-19 pandemic, India has fallen into the vortex of a ‘once-in-a-century crisis’ as the Survey forcefully puts it. It projects a V-shaped growth of recovery and reiterates the call of the Economic Survey  2019-20 for “ethical wealth creation by combining the invisible hand of markets with the hand of trust”. Given the great truth that trust is broken more in an unequal society, (on this, see Wilkinson and Pickett cited in the chapter), it is unrealistic to abstract from the crony capitalism and corruption that dominate the political society and proceed from there to ethical wealth production (which indeed is an important instrumental value). It is hoped that market-mediated growth will take the country to desirable socio-economic outcomes that include not only reducing poverty but also a wide spectrum, ranging from infant mortality to mental illness. A silence on poverty Even so, concerned scholars remain confused at the silence of the Survey on the nature and magnitude of poverty which is a multi-dimensional phenomena of deprivation, confounded much worse by the pandemic crisis. The graphic picture of migrant families trudging home hundreds of kilometres away from the cities in the wake of the lockdown seems forgotten. At the same time, Chapter 1 of the Survey documents elaborately the structural reforms (achievements include the controversial three farm laws) to take the economy and the people forward. Scholarly estimates on the increase in the extreme poverty under the pandemic in India have ranged from 400 million (a study by King’s College London) to 620 million ( The Hindu , OpEd article, July 7, 2020). Oxfam’s study on the Virus and Inequality (https://bit.ly/3rcAF7p) points out that while it took nine months for the top 1,000 billionaires to return to pre-COVID-19 times, it will take over a decade for the poorest class to resume normalcy. Interestingly, India’s stock exchanges have scaled unprecedented heights in mocking disregard to the informal sector already in deep distress following the demonetisation episode. Anyone familiar with the vast literature on economic growth and inequality will find the claims of the Economic Survey, that unlike in advanced countries, in India economic growth and inequality converge in terms of their effects on socio-economic outcomes, as simply outrageous. Because the 44 figures of correlations and regressions occupy more than two-thirds of the space of the chapter and form the ‘scientific’ base to substantiate the arguments, I may probe further into them. Correlation between two real scalar variables x and y does not measure any type of relationship between x and y. The measure of variance (square of standard deviation) in x is the square of a measure of scatter or dispersion or spread in x. Faulty conclusions Correspondingly, the joint dispersion or joint scatter in the couplet (x,y) is measured by covariance between x and y. A scale-free covariance is the correlation where degenerate variables are excluded. Hence, correlation can only measure joint scatter in (x,y) and it cannot measure any type of relationship between x and y. Also, correlation as a measure of joint scatter can make sense only when the variables involved have a joint distribution in the statistical sense. All the conclusions of the chapter by computing correlations are faulty. Another set of analysis is based on fitting linear models, calling them as “linear regression”. In the regression models used, variables are selected according to convenience and linear models are fitted and t-statistics are computed without checking for the validity; all sorts of conclusions are made. Such misuse of statistical tools is a dangerous game, certainly in a democracy, which as J.S. Mill famously said is a government by discussions. Discussions are relevant and truthful only when they are well-informed and reliable. Social justice is an intrinsic value of universal relevance. Box 1 of Chapter 4 that goes to justify the poverty and inequality trade-off in totalitarian China is obviously introduced to support the inegalitarian policy options. Thomas Piketty (2020), referred to in the chapter, tells us that inequality increased much more sharply after 1980 in India than in China. This is conveniently forgotten. A sidelining Although the works of great thinkers on justice and equality such as John Rawls, Piketty and Wilkinson and Pickett are mentioned, they are sidelined. It is concluded that “poverty alleviation through growth must be central to economic strategy”, rather than inequality because “in India, economic growth and inequality converge in terms of their effects on socio-economic indicators”. This is untenable. Rawls’ A Theory of Justice (1971), treats justice as fairness which is the basic core of democratic traditions the world over. The chapter refers to the idea of “original position” of equality of Rawls but fails to note that it will have to be judged by the whole theory of justice. The book, The Spirit Level , by the two doctors Wilkinson and Pickett, based on 50 years of research has the meaningful subtitle, ‘Why equality is better for everyone’, ought to have been discussed further because they argue that inequality breeds mistrust, mental illness and many such outcomes, which needs to be reduced for human well-being. Instead of dismissing it, a discussion on Piketty’s Capital and Ideology is certainly warranted for three valid reasons: it is a well-documented historical study on inequality which comes to the striking conclusion that “inequality is neither economic or technological, but ideological and political”; India is elaborately studied; it discusses a wide range of policy issues relevant for a democratic society facing the COVID-19 pandemic like universal basic income, progressive taxation of income, carbon emission, property and inheritance, universal access to fundamental goods such as health, education and housing and so on. The Economic Survey has all the right to suggest what it considers relevant. But democracy demands informed debate especially when it comes to economic inequality which has been admittedly growing exponentially in India. Legitimising it by policy think-tanks is indeed questionable.

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||The path to peace in Ethiopia||The cataclysm in Ethiopia’s Tigray region and the country’s humanitarian crisis give rise to concerns of long-term regional deterioration. Without a clear framework for peace-building, post-conflict reconstruction and transitional justice, the country is at risk of drastically postponing both political and economic recovery. This has implications not only for Ethiopia but also the entire Horn of Africa region which is already plagued by low-level conflicts, uneven economic development, border disputes, continued food insecurity, climate change, a precarious political situation, and a dire refugee crisis. The conflict The breakdown in the already strained relations between the federal government in Addis Ababa and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF)’s leaders in Tigray has resulted in the national crisis. In 2018, anti-government protests by the marginalised Oromo population forced the TPLF to step down, resulting in the election of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and his subsequent crackdown on Tigrayan politicians for corruption and human rights abuses. Internal conflict in Ethiopia has resulted in the death of 52,000 people and the displacement of over 2 million, over 60,000 of whom have taken refuge in Sudan’s eastern border. This has triggered an influx of Sudanese and Eritrean military personnel near Ethiopia’s northern frontier. The complex process of developing a post-conflict reconstruction framework requires a comprehensive analysis, one that compels immediate coordination between the federal, regional and local governments, independent and partial adjudicators, civil society and victims’ and community groups. The various levels of government need to be responsible for two roles: first, the generation of effective regional security architecture for uncomplicated jurisdictions; and second, a narrowed scope and mandate for the Reconciliation Commission and its independent committee of facilitators. Independent mediators and adjudicators can further assist in framing post-conflict models. Currently, Ethiopia is attempting to tackle its domestic emergency. This phase includes securing a military conflict-free environment, addressing increased displacement, allowing access to basic needs assistance for citizens at risk of famine, and strengthening humanitarian capacity in conflict-ridden areas. The part that requires more attention, given that it has been more than four months since the initiation of military conflict in Tigray, would be the medium- and long-term phases. This would mean examining how Ethiopia’s response in rebuilding trust and consensus in state institutions will impact its political, economic and security stability. Internally, the federal government would be urged to consider steps in effectively building frameworks for accountability, transparency and power distribution for inclusive national systems of governance. This is particularly important for combating the contentious nature of Ethiopia’s ethnic federalist system and its lack of non-partisan platforms for political dialogue. This would help build an environment that promotes the establishment of trust and cooperation among its largest and historically conflicted Oromo, Amhara and Tigrayan groups, further preventing a relapse into a state of emergency. Cities in the Northern Gondar Zone, such as Welkait, which have been under the contested control of TPLF forces for decades, will require socioeconomic transitional institutions for effective post-conflict recovery. In Welkait’s case, this includes initiating healing dialogue among Amhara and Tigrayan groups, establishing efforts to integrate the cities’ education, currently only taught in Tigrigna, and economy into the rest of the neighbouring Amharic-speaking region. Taking a long-term view A lack of transitional processes will result in a return to violence in not only the Tigray region but also in other regions where there are rising ethnic tensions. This threatens to derail the economic progress made over the last few decades. The best way to prevent the same chain of events that led to the 2010 post-election violence in Côte d’Ivoire is to begin structuring a post-conflict environment that promotes a peaceful transition. The focus of regional and international media has been heavily geared towards Ethiopia’s immediate alleviation of humanitarian strains. But meeting short-term security and humanitarian needs, although extremely important, should not be the sole focus of a sustainable recovery agenda. It is imperative to recognise a broader view and develop successful post-conflict reconstruction policies before stability is beyond reach.

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Recalibrating relations with EU||The Atmanirbhar Bharat programme and the Budget 2021-22 have set the tone and tenor to bolster supply chains and achieve self-reliance. A self-reliant India, however, cannot be economically insular. Realising the vision of a self-reliant India would entail localising an increasing share of value added along supply chains through investments and phase-wise reduction of import tariffs with strategic partners such as the European Union (EU). Export potential India has an untapped export potential of $39.9 billion in the EU and Western Europe. The top products with export potential include apparel, gems and jewellery, chemicals, machinery, automobile, pharmaceuticals and plastic. India benefits from tariff preferences under the EU’s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for several of these products. In fact, India is among the major beneficiaries of the EU’s GSP, with exports under the GSP valued at nearly $19.4 billion in 2019, accounting for nearly 37% of India’s merchandise exports to the EU. However, there are several products where India has export potential in the EU, but these have “graduated” or are at the brink of “graduation” under EU GSP. Product graduation applies when average imports of a product from a beneficiary country exceed 17.5% of EU-GSP imports of the same product from all beneficiary countries over three years. India’s exports of products such as textiles, inorganic and organic chemicals, gems and jewellery, iron, steel and their articles, base metals and automotives are already out of the ambit of EU-GSP benefits. There is also a likelihood of losing EU-GSP benefits in other categories such as apparel, rubber, electronic items, sports goods and toys due to product graduation. In apparel, India’s exports to the EU were valued at $7 billion in 2019, of which nearly 94% was under EU-GSP, indicative of the impact that the graduation may have on apparel exports. Meanwhile, India’s competitors in apparel exports such as Bangladesh would continue to receive tariff benefits in the EU under Everything but Arms Initiative. Another competitor, Vietnam, concluded a free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU in 2019. In light of the declining preferential access and the plausible erosion of competitiveness in the EU market, there is clearly a need to deepen trade and investment ties with the region. Approach to FTAs India’s negotiation for a Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement, which commenced in 2007, is yet to materialise due to lack of concurrence in areas like automotives and dairy and marine products. India’s cautious approach to FTAs derives from its past experience of an unequal exchange of benefits in several FTAs signed by the country. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the benefits from FTA for domestic producers is warranted, with due consideration to the impact on sensitive sectors, and possibility of inclusion of safeguards such as sunset clause on concessions for some items. Further, there should also be provisions for aspects such as investment and non-tariff measures (NTMs). China has already negotiated a comprehensive agreement on investment. India also needs to negotiate on investment-related aspects with the EU to enhance bilateral investments and foster stronger value chains, especially in technology-intensive sectors in which the EU has a comparative advantage. As far as NTMs are concerned, India faces as many as 414 NTMs in the EU, in a wide array of sectors. FTAs have some institutional arrangements for NTMs. India should critically review the availability of such arrangements in its negotiations, as also their operationalisation and effectiveness. Post-Brexit EU finds itself in the midst of a growing need for recalibrating ties with its partner countries. Forging stronger ties with the region through a mutually beneficial agreement could help strengthen Indian manufacturing and revitalise the flailing exports.

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to the future||After two quarters of a sharp contraction, India’s economy is estimated to have rebounded out of a ‘technical recession’ to record feeble growth in the October-December 2020 period, with GDP rising by 0.4% and GVA by 1%. The overall numbers are not surprising. Just as the short-notice pandemic lockdown and the subsequent case surge took the wind out of mobility and economic activity in the first half of the fiscal year, the ‘unlocking phase’ that was largely complete by late September, brought back a semblance of normalcy, with pent-up and festival demand spurring spending, and helping reboot production lines. Agriculture remained the resilient bulwark in the third quarter as well, with farm GVA rising by 3.9% after being the sole sector to clock growth in the preceding two quarters. Manufacturing and construction resurfaced from a collapse to expand 1.2% and 6%, respectively. Both these sectors had been under stress even before the pandemic, posting contractions starting from the second and third quarters of 2019-20. Despite the Centre’s push on government spending, public administration, defence and other services contracted 1.5% last quarter. However, investment demand is estimated to have rebounded, with fixed capital formation posting positive momentum after several quarters, driven perhaps by public spending. Most worryingly, retail, trade, hotels, transport and communication contracted by 7.7%. Despite the Q3 uptick, the second advance estimates of national income for the year project an 8% contraction in the GDP, wider than the – 7.7% estimated in January. This may partly be due to the NSO revising the first quarter’s GDP shrinkage to 24.4%, from the 23.9% calculated earlier. The latest numbers also may be taken as an indicator at best, with the NSO stressing that the estimates are likely to undergo ‘sharp revisions’ as the pandemic affected data collection. Like the growth rate for 2019-20 was revised from 4.2% to 4% in January, the real GDP growth for the third quarter of the last fiscal has been scaled down to 3.3%, from 4.1%. The base effect may well have helped nudge India’s growth into positive territory, but it is an important psychological barrier to cross. Growth numbers alone may still not be capturing the tumult faced by swathes of informal and micro-enterprises, nor do they reflect a recovery in the job market. The continuing stress in employment- and contact-intensive services sectors is a worry, and the government must consider support measures. The second wave of infections in industrial hotspots such as Maharashtra, and the risk of infections rising in poll-bound States, do not bode well either for services or the fragile recovery in manufacturing. A smooth and expeditious roll-out of the vaccine, with the private sector drafted in to achieve scale, is an imperative to help India navigate the bumps ahead more deftly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/back-to-the-future/article33975370.ece
03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Reviving the Iran deal||U.S. President Joe Biden’s attempts to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), better known as the Iran nuclear deal, have not seen any breakthrough with both sides waiting for the other to blink. The Biden administration says it would return to the deal if Iran starts complying with its terms. Tehran, on the other side, asks the U.S., which unilaterally quit the deal under the Donald Trump administration in May 2018, to return to the agreement first and lift sanctions on Iran. The EU’s efforts to organise direct U.S.-Iran talks were also unsuccessful as Tehran reportedly rejected the offer. Iran has also accelerated its nuclear programme. This game of chicken continues as the clock is ticking. Iran will elect a new President in June. Hassan Rouhani, who bet his presidency on the deal — only to be repudiated by Mr. Trump — cannot stand in a third consecutive election. There is no guarantee that a moderate like Mr. Rouhani would be elected this time. And it is not a secret that there is considerable opposition among the hardliners, a powerful constituency, towards any kind of engagement with the U.S. Mr. Biden’s best bet is to get the nuclear agreement back on track before Mr. Rouhani leaves office. To be sure, Mr. Biden has moved with a sense of urgency after assuming power. He appointed a special envoy for Iran, showed signs of rebalancing ties with Saudi Arabia, and sent clear signals to Tehran about America’s desire to get back to the deal. But these actions do not seem to be enough to rebuild the trust after the acrimonious Trump years. Some of Iran’s concerns are genuine. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, Iran had cooperated with the U.S. in the war against the Taliban. But once the Taliban were driven out of power, the Bush administration branded Iran as part of an “Axis of Evil” along with Iraq and North Korea. As President Barack Obama offered diplomacy, the Iranians grabbed the opportunity, leading to the signing of the JCPOA in 2015. And Iran was fully compliant with the agreement when Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of it. So Iran would seek some consistency in U.S. policy. But Iran is also in a tough spot. Hit by sanctions and a devastating COVID-19 outbreak, its economy is bleeding. It had violently cracked down on protests in 2019-20, the embers of which are still burning. Its regional operations took a hit after Qasem Soleimani was assassinated by the U.S. in January 2020. Its assets in Syria are under repeated air strikes by Israel. Last week, the U.S. had also bombed pro-Iranian militants in Syria. Both sides are under pressure. Both sides need the deal — the U.S. wants to scuttle Iran’s nuclear programme and Iran wants relief from sanctions. They should stick to the diplomatic path for a breakthrough.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/reviving-the-iran-deal/article33975371.ece

Principal Garvie lectured on “Political Idealism” after which, in response to the students’ calls, Lord Reading spoke. He declared, that the political idealists who had most influenced him were Gladstone, Morley, and Campbell-Bannerman. Political idealism found a modern expression in a re-interpretation of the French watchword, namely, “Liberty, Justice and Love”. There would be no justice without love. As Lord Chief Justice, justice appealed to him. Love meant power to put oneself in other sinners’ position.

A striking parallel in the political sphere is the growing trend of parties in power to blame the Constitution for their own poor record of service to the people. Armed with all the vast powers vested in them by the Government and the enormous resources of the nation at their beck and call, these men and women at the helm dissipate both through either personal aggrandisement or pointless policy exercises during most of their tenure. And when the day of reckoning draws near, they raise a hue and cry that but for the fundamental rights or some other provision in the Constitution they would have ushered in a just social order to ensure the welfare of the people and equality of opportunity for all. To lend some credence to such a politically profitable stand, they assiduously bring about confrontations with the judiciary, so that it can be made out that the verdicts of the judiciary striking down some ill-conceived (and often undesirable) pieces of legislation or executive acts and the provisions of the Constitution on which the verdicts are based are the causes for their own dismal inadequacy. The people are by now familiar with the plans of some parties for amending the Constitution in the name of social justice and their cries for a “committed judiciary” as also of the dangerous consequences of such attempts to undermine these bedrocks of individual liberty and the democratic freedoms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/social-justice-and-the-courts-from-an-editorial/article33975381.ece
03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Exports dip 0.25% after rising for 2 months, imports grow 7%||India’s merchandise exports dipped 0.25% in February to $27.67 billion dollars, while imports of goods rose almost 7% to $40.55 billion. The trade deficit widened by 25.8% from February 2020 to $12.88 billion, as per preliminary data released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry on Tuesday. Within the trade basket, exports of items excluding petroleum, and gems and jewellery rose 5.65%, while imports of such items rose 7.4%. Exporters blamed the marginal dip in exports in February — following two straight months of growth — to container shortages across the country and supply disruptions in the last week of the month due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in certain States. Oil meals, iron ore The biggest surge in exports was recorded in other cereals (542%), followed by oil meals (244.1%) and iron ore (167.8%). However, petroleum product exports fell 27.1%, followed by declines in several employment-intensive sectors such as leather (-21.6%), gems and jewellery (-11.2%) and readymade textile garments, whose shipments contracted 8.5%. “Rising exports from China have led to a shortage of containers in the region as most of the empty containers are available only for exports from China as the shipping lines and container companies are being paid hefty premiums for bringing empty containers back to China,” said Sharad Kumar Saraf, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO). Mr. Saraf urged the Centre to address long-pending demands of exporters urgently, including the notification of the rates under the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products to remove uncertainty and allow new contracts to be taken up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/exports-dip-025-after-rising-for-2-months-imports-grow-7/article33975360.ece

They added that if the crisis prolonged, about 20,000 MSME plastic units would be forced to close down. Industry bodies said large petrochemical companies, including PSUs, had exponentially increased raw material prices by 40-155% in the last 8-10 months. The associations have urged the Centre to direct Indian Oil, GAIL, OPAL, Haldia Petrochemicals and MRPL to streamline supply of raw materials at fair prices. Several industry associations have urged the government to ban the export of the raw materials for one year and allow import of raw materials not produced in the country. “The industry is facing acute shortage of polymers, the main raw material for plastic goods production, which has varied applications,” said Chandrakant Turakhia, president of the All India Plastics Manufacturers Association. “The increase in raw material costs and its acute shortage in market is leading to escalation in project costs and is adversely impacting the cost competitiveness of MSMEs,” said Arvind Mehta, chairman, governing council of The All India Plastics Manufacturers Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rising-polymer-raw-material-prices-hit-msme-plastic-units/article33975355.ece
03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘No TDS when Indian firms pay to use foreign software’||The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that tax deductible at source is not applicable to Indian companies for amounts paid to foreign software manufacturers and suppliers for use or re-sale of computer software through end-user licence agreements (EULA). In a relief for Indian buyers, a three-judge Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman said the consideration paid by them for use or sale of computer software cannot be considered a payment of “royalty for the use of copyright in the computer software”. The 223-page judgment by Justice Nariman would have an effect on software majors such as IBM India, Sasken Communications, Sonata Information Technology, Rational Software Corporation India and Samsung Electronics. The judgment was based on cross appeals filed by the Revenue authorities and assessees alike on the question as to whether money paid by Indian buyers to foreign, ‘non-resident’ software suppliers amounted to royalty and, thus, tax was deductible at source under Section 195 of the Income Tax Act. Justice Nariman reasoned that payment of royalty is made only for exclusive use of copyright of a work. Here, the computer software is sold in the form of a CD to an Indian buyer under a non-exclusive licence. Again, the Indian buyer only receives the right to use the software. He does not get any copyright on the software. Hence, the amount paid for a computer software from a foreign manufacturer does not qualify as royalty for which tax should be deducted at the source.  “The end-user does not get any of the rights that the owner continues to retain... It is wrong to say that when a copyrighted article is sold, the end-user gets the right to use the intellectual property rights embodied in the copyright which would therefore amount to transfer of an exclusive right of the copyright owner in the work,” Justice Nariman explained. “An obvious example is the purchaser of a book or a CD/DVD, who becomes the owner of the physical article, but does not become the owner of the copyright inherent in the work, such copyright remaining exclusively with the owner,” Justice Nariman wrote.   The buyer of a book becomes the owner of the physical article, not of copyright||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/no-tds-when-indian-firms-pay-to-use-foreign-software/article33975367.ece

03 March 2021||MUMBAI,||Private investment missing, notes RBI article||Only private investment is ‘missing in action’ at a time when all engines of aggregate demand are starting to fire to boost economic growth, according to a Reserve Bank article. Observing that there is little doubt today that a recovery based on a revival of consumption is underway, the RBI, in the recent article, said, “the jury leans towards such recoveries being shallow and short-lived.” Rekindle animal spirits The key to whet the appetite for investment, it said, is to rekindle the animal spirits, a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities. “All engines of aggregate demand are starting to fire; only private investment is missing in action,” the article’s authors led by RBI Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra wrote. The article in the RBI’s February Bulletin, further observed that “the time is apposite for private investment to come alive”. Fiscal policy, with the largest capital-expenditure (capex) Budget ever and emphasis on doing business better, has offered to crowd it in. “Will Indian industry and entrepreneurship pick up the gauntlet?,” they asked. The Indian economy is estimated to contract by 8% during the current financial year on account of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The economy is expected to stage a V-shaped recovery in the next fiscal year and record a double-digit growth. Muted credit offtake Authors of another article — Sectoral Deployment of Bank Credit in India: Recent Developments — said muted credit offtake in the recent past needed to be seen in the context of economic slowdown coupled with the COVID-19 linked lockdown.

03 March 2021||KOLKATA,||Vijender Singh training with gusto||Looking forward to his first professional boxing bout in almost a year-and-a-half, Vijender Singh is training with former India teammate Jai Bhagwan and a bunch of raw talent from hinterland Haryana for a fight to be held on a cruise ship in Goa on March 19. Vijender, the reigning WBO Oriental Super Middleweight and WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight champion, last fought against former Commonwealth champion Charles Adamu of Ghana in November 2019. Overcoming the odds The former Worlds and Olympics bronze medallist, who has an unbeaten 12-0 record in pro boxing, has beaten the odds posed by the pandemic to return to the ring. “This time I am sparring and training with young boxers from Bhiwani, Faridabad and Jhajjar. Jai Bhagwan, an Arjuna awardee who boxed with me, became my coach as no one could come from outside. He is a friend and has spent a lot of time with me in the National camp. He knows me better than other coaches,” Vijender told The Hindu on Tuesday. “I am doing more hard training than what I used to do in the UK or the USA. The young boxers are travelling in a vehicle for an hour to train with me (in Gurugram). Today we had an eight-round sparring. We start our training at 11 o’clock. I spar for two rounds with someone, three rounds with another boxer and three more with another. “In the UK it was different. We used to go somewhere to fight with some boxers. There the variety was less, but here the variety is more — super heavy, heavy, cruiser and smaller weights… I miss my coach Lee (Beard) and team, though. But we hope to do some magic.” Vijender, 35, said there was no dearth of motivation for him. “If Mike Tyson or Evander Holyfield can do it (for a very long time), why can’t I? Mary Kom is still fighting. It’s more of a positive attitude. “After this, we may go to the US or somewhere else in May or June. Nothing is confirmed yet, but I know what’s happening in my career,” said Vijender.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vijender-singh-training-with-gusto/article33975504.ece
03 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||It will be a spinning track, says Rahane||Ajinkya Rahane has emphasised time and again that he prefers to be aggressive with his mindset rather than be overly expressive on the field. But the India vice-captain briefly belied his soft-spoken image when questioned about his lack of consistent runs in home Tests. Asked to elaborate on his ‘slump’ during an interaction with the media on Tuesday, Rahane shot back immediately: “I was expecting this question and thankfully you asked. You need to check your facts. You know my contribution to the team. Whenever the team has needed runs, my runs are there, so you need to focus on your stats and come up with a right question.” Since the start of 2019, Rahane averages 43.44 overall (17 Tests), 43.80 at home (eight Tests), 64.85 in wins (11 Tests), and 54.62 in home wins (seven Tests). Since the start of 2020, he averages 27.75 overall (nine Tests), 17 at home (three Tests), 47.33 in wins (four Tests), and 28 in home wins (two Tests). Not a concern But Rahane stressed that the lack of recent runs isn’t a concern for him. “You know I am a team man, everyone knows that. When the team needs me to score in a situation, I have always done that. I am not too concerned about it. As a player, I am always looking to learn and grow,” he said. Despite the furore over the pitches, especially in the British press and by former England cricketers, Rahane confirmed that the pitch at Motera for the series-decider will assist turn. “The wicket will be similar to the third Test and the second Test that we played in Chennai. It will be a spinning track,” he said. “Pink ball made a difference, it was coming on to the bat much quicker. That’s an adjustment that we had to make. But as I said, the pitch will be similar to the one for the last two Tests.” India needs to avoid losing the last Test to ensure a berth in the World Test Championship final against New Zealand at Lord’s in June. Rahane, who like Ishant Sharma is presently a one-format player for India, echoed the pacer’s sentiments about the importance of winning the WTC final. “Ishant was spot on. Winning the Test Championship final will be like winning the World Cup. Having said that, the focus is on playing this Test and winning this game,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/it-will-be-a-spinning-track-says-rahane/article33975477.ece
03 March 2021||KOZHIKODE,||We used our resources well: Yohannan||It took Kerala just 8.5 overs to smash 149 runs off a stunned Bihar attack at the KSCA Stadium in Bengaluru last Sunday. The nine-wicket victory, achieved with 41.2 overs to spare, has fetched Tinu Yohannan's boys a place in the knock-out phase of the Vijay Hazare Trophy one-day tournament — for the first time in eight years. The coach sounded rather happy as he spoke to The Hindu over phone on Tuesday afternoon. Great effort “Yes, this was a great effort by the boys,” he said. “I could not have asked more of them.” Kerala did exceedingly well, despite being denied the services of its two main pace bowlers, Basil Thampi and K.M. Asif, who were both injured. And of course, Kerala was also handicapped by the absence of its bowling spearhead for the last several seasons, Sandeep Warrier, who has moved to Tamil Nadu. “Given those circumstances, I thought we could utilise the available resources rather well,” said Tinu. “S. Sreesanth ensured the absence of Thampi and Asif didn't impact our bowling.” The veteran seamer, on a comeback trail after serving a seven-year ban for his alleged role in the IPL spot-fixing scandal, took 13 wickets from five matches. “He bowled really well, much better than he did at the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament,” said Tinu. “It was nice to see him using the conditions at Bengaluru to swing the ball.” Pat for Jalaj He also praised Jalaj Saxena, the ever-reliable off-spinning all-rounder, and the other professional Kerala has retained for the season — Robin Uthappa, the opener who could take a lot of credit for the team's great run. Uthappa's sequence at Bengaluru, where he has played most of his cricket, went thus: 107, 81, 100, 0 and 87 not out. “Robin was brilliant, and he is the main reason we qualified,” said Tinu. “When he hits a purple patch, he can be unstoppable.” The India Test seamer-turned-coach is also delighted with the performances of the team's new kids — Vatsal Govind and K.G. Rojith. “Vatsal's 95 against Karnataka (in our only defeat in the tournament) should give him a lot of confidence; he is one batsman who could serve Kerala for a long time,” said Tinu. “I thought all-rounder K.G. Rojith also did a good account of himself, especially as an all-rounder.” In the quarterfinals, Kerala will meet Karnataka in New Delhi on March 8.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-used-our-resources-well-yohannan/article33975625.ece
03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||The best know that for a champion there is no home ground||After leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani claimed 16 wickets on a turner in the Chennai Test of 1988, rival skipper Viv Richards had a message for India. “Come to the West Indies,” he said, “we’ll show you.” It wasn’t just a vague threat, as it turned out. England skipper Joe Root is unlikely to say anything similar. But if he is thinking it, can you blame him? Virat Kohli would, of course, claim the Ahmedabad wicket for the third Test was a very good one to bat on. He is contracted to the Board of Control for Cricket in India. And naturally R. Ashwin would take offence at any suggestion that the Indian spinners needed assistance from it. Indian television commentators beholden to the BCCI aren’t going to bite the hand that feeds them. Michael Vaughan calling India’s victory a hollow one because of the “awful pitch” is par for the course too. Partisanship apart, the question is, did India overdo it? If there were to be a greater variety in the tracks prepared for the series, one would not have minded so much. For then the teams would face different challenges, have to use different strategies, and spectators get to appreciate the richness of the game and understand that usage ‘Test’ cricket is not accidental. Everybody is right about Ahmedabad. Yes, it favoured spin too early; yes, it was a test of technique and temperament; yes, the spinners didn’t have to try too hard on it. But isn’t that what an international player signs up for? The unfamiliar, the difficult? The argument that it was the straight ball that earned wickets is disingenuous and reflects a mentality that sees each wicket-taking delivery as a stand-alone without reference to what went before. The straight ball was dangerous because the ones preceding either spun extravagantly or threatened to. Decades ago, Wilfred Rhodes, the only bowler with 4000-plus First Class wickets said: “If the batsman thinks it is spinning, then it is spinning.” ‘Spin’ is not a bad word in cricket, although teams loaded with pace and swing sometimes give that impression. The spinner is an artist, using flight, change of pace, and a host of variations to fool the batsman into playing the ball that is not there or inadvertently nicking one that changes its mind and alters course. Hit the spot! Ahmedabad called for just one strategy. Hit the same spot and let the track do the rest. This Axar Patel did extremely well. In the second innings, off-spinner Ashwin seemed to rebel against this unidimensional approach. He flighted, he undercut, he changed the angle, the pace, the trajectory. Perhaps he didn’t think there was challenge enough. As the journalist Tunku Varadarajan tweeted, Ashwin was using a super computer when an abacus would do! The pitch at the new stadium in Ahmedabad wasn’t as terrible as the one in Sabina Park, Kingston, in 1997-98 where a Test was called off after England batted just 10.1 overs against the West Indies. Nor was it a bowlers’ graveyard where teams barely complete the first innings in five days and everybody claims Test cricket is dying. Anything between these two extremes is fair. However you looked at it, the two-day Test was a riveting game, packing into six sessions the excitement and drama usually spread over 15. One of the many charms of cricket is the range of the natural conditions in which it is played. The weather, the type of grass on the field, the slope, the possibility of dew, the light, all influence the course of a match. Before overcoming the opposition, a team has to deal with the conditions. Chennai is nothing like Nottingham, Perth cannot be mistaken for Karachi. For the champion there is no home ground. Just the other day, India were facing a sharp pace attack in Australia, and had been dismissed for 36. They won that series — batsmen took blows on the bodies and to their egos — and then had to deal with the heat and dust of Chennai and Ahmedabad. Even home conditions need getting used to sometimes. Not rocket science If a visiting team lacks the skill to play spin bowling, then they can expect to find wickets that aid spin, especially in the subcontinent. The reverse is also true. A team which plays spin well but has an imperfect record against swing or pace can expect to get wickets that minimise their strengths and exaggerate their weaknesses when they tour. This is hardly rocket science. The temptation to funnel the blame outwards from shortcomings within is natural. To their credit, England have not complained about the state of the wicket, whatever those far away from the action might have said. Viv Richards has said there has been too much “moaning and groaning” about the Ahmedabad wicket. “Too much” is right, but a certain amount is justified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-best-know-that-for-a-champion-there-is-no-home-ground/article33975467.ece
03 March 2021||Liverpool,||Everton boosts its top-four bid||Everton boosted its bid to earn a top-four finish in the Premier League as Richarlison sealed a 1-0 win against struggling Southampton on Monday. Carlo Ancelotti’s side won for the first time in six home league games thanks to Richarlison’s early goal. Everton’s last success at Goodison Park had come against Arsenal just before Christmas but ending a run of three consecutive home league defeats lifted it to within two points of fourth-placed West Ham. The seventh-placed Toffees have a game in hand on West Ham, as well as Liverpool and Chelsea, who occupy the places directly above them. Fresh from beating Liverpool 2-0 to secure its first victory over its Merseyside rivals at Anfield since 1999, Everton is firmly in contention to qualify for the Champions League via a top-four finish.  Dramatic decline After leading the top flight in November for the first time since 1988, Southampton has gone into a dramatic decline that leaves it just seven points above the relegation zone. Real Madrid’s chances of chasing down LaLiga leader Atletico Madrid were dealt a blow on Monday as it needed a late Vinicius Junior equaliser to secure a 1-1 draw with Real Sociedad. It could have been worse for Zinedine Zidane’s side, with Vinicius’ finish in the 89th minute preventing what would have been a damaging defeat after a weekend in which both Atletico and Barcelona had won. Atletico’s victory over Villarreal on Sunday put it six points clear of Real Madrid, an advantage that is now five ahead of next week’s Madrid derby at the Wanda Metropolitano. Atletico also has a game in hand. The result ends Real Madrid’s run of five consecutive wins while Portu’s brilliant header for Real Sociedad early in the second half was also the first goal conceded by the reigning champion in five games.  The results: Premier League: Everton 1 (Richarlison 9) bt Southampton 0.   LaLiga: Real Madrid 1 (Vinicius Jr. 89) drew with Real Sociedad 1 (Portu 55).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/everton-boosts-its-top-four-bid/article33975524.ece

03 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bopanna partners Aisam again||The chance to get a wild card as former champions in Dubai united Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi, but their destination has changed to Acapulco, Mexico. Relieved to be back home after weeks of inaction, the 40-year-old Bopanna said that he had talked to Aisam in Australia in setting up a temporary partnership. Last team “We asked for a wild card for Dubai, and our second option was Acapulco. Eventually, we didn’t want to take the risk of waiting for the wild card as it is hard for the organisers to commit in advance, owing to much demand. We are literally the last team entering in Acapulco. So, we decided to take it,” said Bopanna. With Bopanna ranked 40 and Aisam 49, it is hard for them to get into the big events. That forces them to plan literally week by week. The Dubai event has $2,048,855 prize money, while Acapulco has $1,204,960. Bopanna’s coach Scott Davidoff is already in Dubai. Bopanna had also planned to take his family to Dubai and be with them till he gets into the tournament bubble. Now, the travel logistics have to be reworked, keeping in mind all the COVID protocols in different countries. After Acapulco, Bopanna will be playing in Miami. The Indian Wells event, prior to Miami, is not being held this time. “I may still go to Dubai now, with family. I have to plan with my wife,” said Bopanna. The tournaments in Dubai and Acapulco are scheduled for the third week of the month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bopanna-partners-aisam-again/article33975518.ece

Sathiyan will open his campaign against Commonwealth Games silver medallist Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri in the World Table Tennis Contender tournament in Doha on Wednesday. Sharath Kamal, who is drawn to meet Sathiyan in the quarterfinals, plays a yet-to-be-named qualifier in the first round. Looking ahead to his campaign, Sathiyan told The Hindu , “I’m excited to play my first international singles match after a year. I think I have not played him (Quadri) in a competition. It will be a tough match, for sure. But I’m high on confidence after the National title and will put my best foot forward. I will discuss my strategies with my coach, Raman Sir.” Sathiyan and Sutirtha Mukherjee advanced to the mixed doubles main draw to play the French pair of Emmanuel Lebesson and Yuan Jia Nan in the opening round, but Sharath and Manika Batra crashed out in four games after they came together for their second round of the qualifying phase. Sathiyan and Sharath open their men’s doubles campaign against Argentina’s Gaston Alto and Horacio Cifuentes. Meanwhile, Manika and Sreeja Akula tumbled at the last hurdle of the qualifying rounds. Ranked 63rd, Manika beat 124th-ranked Sofia-Xuan Zhang (Spain) and 98th-ranked Irina Ciobano (Romania) in straight games but met her match in Gana Gaponova. The Ukrainian won 11-5, 11-6, 12-14, 11-5 for a place in the main round. In contrast, Sreeja gave a far better account of herself by beating two higher-ranked players and moving within winning a game of reaching the main draw. Ranked 150th, Sreeja exceeded expectations when she blanked 74th-ranked Vega Pauline (Chile) 11-5, 11-9, 11-6 and then packed off 87th-ranked Orawan Paranang (Thailand) 11-5, 11-5, 11-6. However, in the final qualifying round, 123rd-ranked Maria Tailakova (Russia) rallied to beat Sreeja 11-9, 5-11. 6-11, 11-6, 11-5.  I think I have not played him (Quadri) in a competition.

He has completed 1,000 runs in just nine matches playing for Secunderabad Nawabs in the A1-Division (three-day) league championship. The opener, who admires K.L. Rahul, is delighted at the achievement. “All I hoped was to do well and come up with big scores. Making six centuries with 151 being the highest, besides three fifties, is something I would love to remember,” said Takshith, who is playing his second season for Nawabs. Training at the Daniel’s Cricket Academy for the past three years, the 19-year-old is now gunning for bigger glory.  “If selected in the Hyderabad under-19 team, I would love to be as consistent as I am now and then achieve the first target of playing Ranji Trophy,” he said. “I know the road ahead is really tough but I am willing to work hard.” Takshith is keen to work on the flick, which he mostly doesn’t play for the fear of losing his wicket. “I am comfortable with drives and pulls,” said the young talent who never played for Hyderabad in any age group till now.

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Crawley expects batting to get easier in fourth Test||England opener Zak Crawley expects batting to be easier in the fourth Test, even if the wicket is similar to the one that was used in the previous game. Crawley felt that the return to the red ball should make a slight difference. “I think if it is the same pitch, I do think, it will be slightly easier. I feel the pink ball was a bit harder and therefore skidded on quite quickly, which is why Axar [Patel] got so many wickets, lbw and bowled,” said Crawley. Massive threat “I think he still has that ball in his armoury for sure and it will be a massive threat but it might not skid on with the same pace as the pink ball.” Sharing his thoughts on how the pitch is likely to behave, Crawley said, “I think it will be a very similar pitch this week and why wouldn’t it be? They played very well on the last two pitches that turned.” When asked if England can square the series, the 23-year-old exuded confidence, saying, “There's definitely a way back. We have already won one Test match. It is going to require us to get a good first-innings lead and require us to bat well. “The bowlers did well to bowl them out for 145. If we can replicate that, and get a nice lead in the first innings, we will put them under pressure,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/crawley-expects-batting-to-get-easier-in-fourth-test/article33975479.ece
03 March 2021||Y.B. Sarangi,||Bengal’s dismal showing to be reviewed||Following the state team’s dismal showing in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Bengal cricket is in soul-searching mode. Bengal, the Ranji Trophy runner-up last season, could not progress beyond the group stage in two domestic events held this season. It finished second in its group in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy after securing three wins in five matches. It managed the fifth spot after winning just two of the five Hazare engagements. In the Hazare Trophy, Bengal’s top run-getter Abhimanyu Easwaran (219) is 53rd in the National list, while the state’s top wicket-taker Shahbaz Ahmed (eight) is 41st. Disappointed Bengal selection committee chairman Shubhomoy Das was disappointed. “The players we banked on did not even perform 50% up to their potential. The main nucleus of the team did not perform,” Shubhomoy told The Hindu . Meanwhile, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has decided to do an “in-depth post-mortem” of the Vijay Hazare performance. “It is absolutely important to find out the reasons for this kind of show and address the issues,” CAB president Avishek Dalmiya said. Detailed plan “We are also chalking out a detailed plan to roll out Vision 2025 as a continuation of Vision 2020… This time the focus will also be on age group cricket and harnessing and developing young talent to create a robust supply line and strong bench strength.” Association secretary Snehashis Ganguly said: “The CAB has left no stone unturned to see that the players get enough pre-season practice… We need to analyse what is going wrong.” Bengal coach Arun Lal said, “a set of do’s and don’ts will be given to the players on behavioural expectations and maintaining fitness standards ahead of the next season.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bengals-dismal-showing-to-be-reviewed/article33975652.ece

The CM also assured that his government would make all necessary arrangements for the safety of players amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “I am surprised at the exclusion of Mohali Cricket stadium for the upcoming IPL season. “I urge and appeal to @BCCI and @IPL to reconsider their decision. “There is no reason why Mohali can't host IPL and our government will make all necessary arrangements for safety against #Covid19,” the CM tweeted. The Punjab Cricket Stadium (PCA) at Mohali has been the home base of Punjab Kings franchise. Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai have been shortlisted as potential venues but the BCCI is yet to take a final call on the matter.

Punjab's daily COVID-19 count has been relatively low and on Tuesday, 635 new cases were recorded which pushed the active tally to 4853. The 2020 IPL was held in the UAE in empty stadiums but there is a possibility that the upcoming edition at home will allow spectators with the COVID situation improving drastically.

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Power of Maya||The section of the story of Dhruva's vision of the Lord and his return to the kingdom is presented as a conversation between Vidhura and Maitreya in the Bhagavata Purana. Maitreya explains that though Dhruva beheld the Lord, the sole granter of mukti, he could not think of mukti at that moment. In a discourse, Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal drew attention to the fact that this situation reflects the predicament of every jivatma caught in the powerful sway of Maya. Though it may be possible to catch glimpses of the eternal truth in the course of each one's spiritual attainment, it is not potent enough to lead us out of samsara. Dhruva had secured the Lord's feet in a short period, when it had taken even sages like Sanaka and others several births of life-long celibacy, concentration and meditation. With an uneasy mind, Dhruva analyses his folly of seeking worldly ambitions from the Lord, instead of eternal bliss. How foolish to have accepted the short lived felicities when he should have cut asunder all worldly bonds? All such worldly advantage is futile, like a treatment given to a dead man. The Lord, the soul of the entire universe, is the destroyer of samsara. So Dhruva knows that he is no different from the beggar who goes to an emperor and begs for chaff. What is to be learnt is that Dhruva is also bound by his karma and desire. A somewhat parallel situation is found in the Katopanishad which features the story of another young boy Nachiketas. He wishes to learn esoteric truths from Yama, who tests him before imparting the knowledge by offering the boy all the riches and worldly enjoyments. Nachiketas declines all this and establishes that the superior power of renunciation alone can win over the influence of Maya. Desire is the hurdle to salvation and ties one to samsara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/power-of-maya/article33975461.ece

03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A QR-coded garden||If you are in Kochi’s Maharaja’s College and are curious about any one of the 100-odd species of trees on the 25-acre campus, all you need to do is to whip out your phone and scan the QR code on the tree to get details such as its botanical name and properties. The trees have been ‘inventoried’ by the Botany Department of the college as part of a project to create a digital garden. As part of the digital garden project, the trees now have boards with their names and a QR code, which when scanned would lead to a link to the college website with information about the garden. The college is known for its lush foliage and shady trees, some almost as old as the college itself which was founded in 1875. “The trees are part of the heritage of the college. Besides, the digital garden is part of our [the college] green initiative. We have been conducting a green audit to assess our carbon footprint and find ways of reducing it. Digitising the flora also becomes an authentic database,” says Jameela Fathima, assistant professor (Department of Botany) and co-ordinator of the digital garden project. The trees and plants were last audited in 2013-14. This time round, the inventorying was done in less than three months. The Botany Department collaborated with the Centre for Biodiversity Conservation, University of Kerala, for inputs on how to go about the project. The college worked with A. Gangaprasad and Akhilesh S.V. Nair of the Thiruvananthapuram-based organisation behind the digital garden of Raj Bhavan (Thiruvananthapuram). Ever-changing information “The taxonomy of plants and trees changes often, so documenting is done often. Trees on campus have been identified and named, but since taxonomy changes based on the new things we learn about trees or plants, the names also change and this is a means of keeping updated,” Jameela says. The species have been enumerated, not individual trees.The smaller plants have also not been documented. Due to the pandemic, the participation of students was kept at a minimum but the college plans to get students involved in the next phase. “Taxonomy is a subject for them, so this would be hands-on training,” she says. Usually documenting fauna takes longer than the two months that were spent on this project. The trees are studied over the course of a few seasons so that a tree is studied during its various stages — flowering, bearing fruit, and shedding. The experience of the Centre for Biodiversity Conservation with their other projects made the work easy in terms of the protocols to follow. Plans include publishing a book with these findings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-qr-coded-garden/article33975668.ece
03 March 2021||March 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Dining out||Vegans in India no longer have to struggle, when picking a place to eat out or prepping a fun meal of burgers and desserts. The food and beverage industry is increasingly making an attempt to include more vegan options in menus — and this time, there is more than just salads with nuts, millet cookies and nutmilk shakes. From vegan biryani and vegan burgers on restaurant menus to non-dairy cream and ice creams on supermarket shelves, vegan diners finally have options. This should not be considered a trend — molecular gastronomy was a trend, veganism is a way of life. In Hyderabad, when Karachi Bakery opened a dining place called 45Avenue, it was the mock meat burger, vegan cookies and salads that were discussed most. In India, vegans took a while to add mock meats to their plates. Hyderabad-based chef Pranit Konark, who worked extensively to create the ideal mock meat burger, says: “To each his own. The need for variety and exploring newer vegan food options led people to experiment at home and create veg meat with jackfruit and the like. These are especially targeted at people who are meat eaters and giving the vegan diet a try.” Roma Roy Choudhury, founder of Bengaluru-based Evolved Foods, a plant-based food company, says she was the first person in India to serve Seitan in 2018, through her previous venture House of Seitan, in Bengaluru. Seeing the positive response to this vegan wheat meat, she went back to the drawing board to develop products like Alt Protein (a plant-based protein) and Alt Meat under the Evolved Foods banner. Roma says, “With people now looking consciously at alternatives, whether it is driven by thoughts of clean eating or contributing to help the environment, or even experimenting with something different in a playful way, I feel the time is right to offer the product as an ingredient so people can easily incorporate it in their cooking and daily diet.” Evolved Foods has now launched two variants that can be substitutes for paneer and chicken. Roma, who holds a vegetarian and vegan nutritionist dilpoma, wants to reach out to non-vegetarians as well. Just making options easily available for consumers is the first step towards introducing people to new kinds of food. Aarti Gill, co-founder of plant-based nutrition brand OZiva, says the flexetarian food habit of Indians makes it easier. Aarti says, “Plant-based foods are healthy, no doubt, but we must let the consumer reach out on their own. When the complicated part of ‘trying a new food’ is taken out, you will quickly find a consumer drawn towards it. Our products are made in such a way that they can be consumed without putting in much effort.” Hyderabad-based nutrionist Sridevi Jasti, however, says that the meat-like feel is only needed for the transition phase. A believer of holistic eating habits, Sridevi is all for plant-based foods and says, “The pandemic taught us well. The body needs right food and not the junk we keep feeding it. If we know how to make use of plants and nuts, we shouldn’t need to rely on any meat or dairy products.” Sweet tooth Understanding the market and the need for vegan cakes, Feranoz Pattisserie in Hyderabad developed a delectable vegan chocolate cake made of sponge and frosted with Belgian chocolate. And those who thought vegans can’t enjoy a cup of hot chocolate, have not tried the vegan hot chocolate by Delhi-based Colocal, a bean-to-bar chocolatier brand and café. Colocal founder Sheetal Saxena takes pride in saying that the brand’s entire chocolate range is dairy and preservative-free. “So, making a hot chocolate without milk is hardly a challenge. All we have to do is substitute dairy with nut or soy milk. A lot of people avoid dairy for health reasons, which is why we offer a vegan option when it comes to the chocolate-based drinks,” says Sheetal. Still not convinced about the rise in veganism? A quick super market run demonstrates that while vegan cheese is still not easy to access, tofu varieties are on a par with the quantity of paneer sold in most big cities. Meanwhile, No Beef is making vegan cheese a reality in Hyderabad. Founder Yajushi Jabakh says she finds herself busy preparing vegan cheeses and vegan dairy all the time. Right now, No Beef makes three cheeses — yellow cheese ideal for dips and sauces, garlic and herb cream spread, and vegan mozarella. “To go with the cheeses, we also do a home pizza kit for vegan get-togethers. The products are all preservative-free and lab tested,” adds Yajushi. Stressing on the importance of veganism in India, Henk Schouten, CEO of Schouten Europe, says average Indian diet lacks adequate protein and eating meat is not the only solution. Henk Schouten recently launched Tempeh Today, a food he claims is protein-rich, produced in high-tech small fermentation units. This Dutch innovation, he claims, is a future-proof contribution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/dining-out/article33975664.ece
03 March 2021||New Delhi,||Plea challenges cap on relief for families of minors killed in riots||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the city government to respond to a plea by two parents, who lost their minor sons during the north-east Delhi riots last year, challenging the maximum compensation cap of Rs. 5 lakh for death of minors. The petition, also filed jointly by CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat, highlighted that the Delhi government’s assistance scheme for riot victims’ prescribes different compensation amounts to the families of deceased adults and minors. Families of deceased minors receive Rs. 5 lakh, which is half of what the families of deceased adults receive. Delhi govt. told to reply “The difference in compensation is arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution since it fails to recognise the full value of the ‘death of minors’,” read the petition filed by advocate Karuna Nundy. Justice Prathiba M. Singh asked the Delhi government and other concerned authorities to respond to the petition within four weeks and posted the case for further hearing on April 26.  One of the petitioners, Ram Sugarat, lost his 15-year-old boy Nitin Paswan to the communal violence. Nitin had gone out on February 26 to buy some ‘chowmein’ from a nearby streetcart in Gokulpuri. When Nitin didn’t come home, Mr. Sugarat reported him missing at the Gokulpuri Police Station. He was later informed that his son was in the emergency room of GTB Hospital, where he was lying unconscious. “His face had blood on it and he had a two-inch injury on the back of his head, which had been bleeding profusely. On inquiring about the cause of the injury, Mr. Sugarat was told that his son had been hit by a tear-gas shell. Nitin died lated that day,” the plea stated. The second petitioner, Rihana Khatoon, lost her 17-year-old son Amaan during the riots. Ms. Khatoon said that on February 25, Amaan had gone to get some milk from a nearby dairy in Jafrabad. When he didn’t return home, she called up Amaan but received no answer. Later, a group of people came to her house and informed Ms. Khatoon that her son had been shot and was taken to a government hospital. She found her son unconscious and bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound in the side of his head. “Ms. Khatoon was told that her son had been shot by someone on the roof of the Jafrabad metro station around 3 p.m.,” read the petition. Amaan died the next day. Ms. Karat, who has been working extensively to help riot-affected families, said she had written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on January 6, 2021, highlighting the difference in compensation amounts. Ms. Karat said she has not received any reply nor has any action been taken pursuant to the letter.  The difference in compensation is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution since it fails to recognise the full value of the ‘death of minors’ Plea filed by two parents who lost their minor sons||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/plea-challenges-cap-on-relief-for-families-of-minors-killed-in-riots/article33975682.ece
03 March 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi riots: court takes cognisance of sedition charge against 18 people||A Delhi Court on Tuesday took cognisance of sedition charge against 18 persons, including former JNU students — Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Devangana Kalita, and Natasha Narwal — and others in connection with the north-east Delhi riots. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat gave the order after noting that the “requisite sanctions under Section 196 Cr.P.C. against all 18 accused persons has been received”. The court took cognisance of the offences under sections 124 A (sedition), 153-A (promoting enmity on the grounds of religion, language, caste etc), 109 (abetment) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. The judge also directed that a copy of the supplementary chargesheet and accompanying documents be supplied in a pendrive to all the 18 accused persons, who have also been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The accused in the case are United Against Hate member Khalid Saifi, former Congress Councilor Ishrat Jahan, suspended AAP councilor Tahir Hussain, Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students — Asif Iqbal Tanha and Safoora Zargar —, are Meeran Haider, Gulfisha, Shafa Ur Rehman, Shadab Ahmed, Tasleem Ahmed, Saleem Malik, Mohd Saleem Khan, Athar Khan and Faizan Khan. Except Ms. Zargar and Mr. Faizan Khan, who are on bail, all other accused in the case are currently lodged in jail. During the hearing, the counsel appearing for Ms. Kalita contended that media already has a copy of the chargesheet before even the accused person has got them. The counsel submitted that there has been a media trial pursuant to which she has been prejudicially affected. This issue was also raised by Mr. Khalid, Mr. Imam and Mr. Khalid Saifi.  ‘Investigation not fair’ The counsel further alleged that “the investigation is not fair and not all video clips have been investigated”. On the other hand, the special public prosecutor (SPP) argued that there have been various media report “trying to create their own narrative, against the police”. The SPP said the investigation in the case is still going on till all the perpetrators are apprehended and all evidence collected. Medial trial “During the proceedings, an important question of media trial was raised. It is indubitably true that every accused has the fundamental right to free and fair investigation as also trial,” the court said. “Media reporting particularly on the social media remains charged up all the time...There is a world of difference between an accused and a convict...There should, at least, always be a disclaimer when reporting, whether it is the version of the police/prosecution or the accused instead of presenting as if it is the order of the court,” the judge said. “Labeling the police as completely unfair or the accused as a convict itself, is not a healthy sign and which impacts the process of criminal justice system,” the court added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-riots-court-takes-cognisance-of-sedition-charge-against-18-people/article33975680.ece
03 March 2021||JAIPUR,||Strengthen BJP cadre in Rajasthan: Nadda||BJP national president J.P. Nadda on Tuesday called upon the leaders and office-bearers of the party’s Rajasthan unit to strengthen the cadre and do an introspection about their productivity and contribution to the organisation. A self-analysis would enable the BJP leaders to remain relevant and take everyone along, he said. Amid reports of growing factionalism in the party, Mr. Nadda addressed a meeting of the newly constituted State executive here and tried to bring the rival camps together ahead of the by-elections in four Assembly seats. The party in the State has witnessed a divide with the supporters of former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje alleging that she was being sidelined. Mr. Nadda affirmed that the BJP was a cadre-based party and reminded the leaders of the need to win the confidence of party workers which would increase their acceptance. “Politics is a field in which you are required to remain relevant... You must develop leadership qualities and make the maximum contribution to the party,” he said. BJP State unit’s functionaries, central office-bearers from the State, members of the core group, district unit presidents, heads of different BJP cells and MLAs and Mayors attended the meeting. Ms. Raje also shared the stage at B.M. Birla Auditorium with the senior party leaders. Ms. Raje’s supporters have voiced their discontent several times during the last few weeks and demanded that she be declared the BJP’s Chief Ministerial face in the 2023 Assembly election. About 20 MLAs of her camp had written to State chief Satish Poonia recently complaining of not being allowed by the Leader of the Opposition to speak during the ongoing budget session. ‘Reforms beneficial’ Mr. Nadda defended the Centre’s agriculture sector laws and accused the Congress and other Opposition parties of misleading the farmers. He claimed that the reforms initiated by the BJP-led government would change the fortune of farmers. He also targeted the State government alleging that it had failed on all fronts, including law and order, women’s security and public welfare. Earlier, party workers gave a grand welcome to Mr. Nadda at several locations en route from Sanganer airport to the meeting venue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/strengthen-bjp-cadre-in-rajasthan-nadda/article33975677.ece

03 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Don’t destroy crops, Haryana CM tells farmers||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Tuesday urged farmers not to destroy their crops as part of their ongoing agitation as they were being “misguided”. “In a democracy holding a peaceful protest is everyone’s right, but right now the farmers are being misguided to take such kind of drastic steps, which are eventually going to push them on the receiving end,” he said here at a press conference. “I urge my farmer brothers to refrain from taking such decisions which will not only affect the common man but also bring a bad name to them,” he added. Liquor complaints Mr. Lal said a one-member committee of Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan has been constituted to analyse the recommendations submitted by various committees constituted to probe liquor complaints, including deaths on account of consumption of spurious liquor across Haryana, smuggling and illegal stocking. “Special Investigation Team and Special Enquiry Team were formed. The members of these committees have separately submitted their recommendations to the government and now the Chief Secretary would take strict action against those found guilty,” he said. He said excise revenue has doubled during the BJP regime. Separately, Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said Governor Satyadev Narayan Arya has given assent to the Bill providing 75% reservation in the private sector to job seekers from the State. “Now the doors of employment opportunities for the local youths have been opened.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dont-destroy-crops-haryana-cm-tells-farmers/article33975678.ece
