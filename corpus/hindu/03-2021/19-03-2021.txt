19 March 2021||New Delhi,||SC to hear plea against sale of electoral bonds||Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde agreed with advocate Prashant Bhushan on Thursday to urgently hear a plea by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms to stay the sale of a new set of electoral bonds on April 1, before the Assembly elections in crucial States such as West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Responding to an urgent mentioning made by Mr. Bhushan via videoconference, Chief Justice Bobde said the matter would require a detailed hearing and posted the case for March 24. Mr. Bhushan said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Election Commission had both said that the sale of electoral bonds had become an avenue for shell corporations and entities to park illicit money and even proceeds of bribes with political parties. “Every time there is an election, the sale is opened. Every time this happens, we have moved the Supreme Court to stay it,” he submitted. “But hasn’t stay been refused earlier?” Chief Justice Bobde asked. “Not so, but parties had been asked to submit records in sealed cover... But a proper stay has to be considered. There are two documents from the RBI and the Election Commission that say the electoral bonds scheme is detrimental to democracy,” Mr. Bhushan replied. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta informed the Chief Justice that Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal would be appearing in the case. “His submissions in the Maratha quota case will start today [March 18] and he may finish it by Wednesday [March 24],” Mr. Mehta said. “Surely, he will find time in a matter like this!” Chief Justice Bobde retorted. The NGO, also represented by advocate Neha Rathi, voiced serious apprehensions about the sale of electoral bonds before elections. ‘Illegal sale windows’ “Data obtained through RTI has shown that illegal sale windows have been opened in the past to benefit certain political parties... There is a serious apprehension that any further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming State elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam would further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies,” the NGO submitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-to-hear-plea-against-sale-of-electoral-bonds/article34104134.ece
19 March 2021||COLOMBO/NEW DELHI,||‘India has assured Sri Lanka of support’||India has assured Sri Lanka of its support at the UN Human Rights Council, Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Jayanath Colombage has said, just days before member countries vote on a new resolution on the island nation’s rights record. India’s Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment on the Sri Lanka Foreign Secretary’s statement. Sources in the government told The Hindu that no decision on the vote had been “conveyed” yet, while Mr. Colombage said Sri Lanka “greatly appreciates” India’s position, “being the superpower they are”. The state-run Daily News on Thursday reported the senior Foreign Ministry official’s remarks, made at a recent “digital dialogue” hosted by Sri Lanka’s Media Centre for National Development, a month-old initiative aimed at publicising the government’s efforts locally and internationally. Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva usually invoke sharp responses from nationalist forces within Sri Lanka’s Sinhala Buddhist majority, who see the process as “targeting” their country and “interfering with its sovereignty”. The Rajapaksa government, whose core support comes from Sinhala Buddhist nationalists, has “categorically rejected” the UN Human Rights chief’s latest report, while accusing the Council of being “politically motivated”, even as a “core group” comprising the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, North Macedonia, Malawi and Montenegro tables the new resolution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-has-offered-support-to-sri-lanka/article34104130.ece

Speaking to The Hindu , the party’s national general secretary Kailash Viajayvargia said the State has everything, from skilled manpower to locational advantage. What is lacking is political will. Before Independence, West Bengal was among the most prosperous, today, it is one of the most backward States. There has been a politicisation of bureaucracy and the police administration. They are hand in glove with criminals and the mafia.

The senior IPS officer is facing charges of sexual harassment made by a woman IPS officer. The suspension of the officer, who had been in compulsory wait, comes a couple of days after the Madras High Court wondered why the former Special DGP, accused of having made sexual advances towards a woman Superintendent of Police, had not yet been suspended. The government had earlier suspended the then Chengalpattu Superintendent of Police soon after transferring him to the Commercial Crimes Investigation Wing. He was accused by the complainant of intercepting her car while she was going to meet the Home Secretary and the Director-General of Police to file a complaint and of forcing her to talk to the accused officer. The government was left with no other option after the court observed that a person facing harassment charges must be suspended before an inquiry was opened. Besides an internal inquiry committee, headed by a senior woman IAS officer, the Crime Branch-CID has registered a case against the former Special DGP, the former Chengalpattu Superintendent of Police and others. “The officer has been suspended on the basis of inquiries and also on the observations made by the Madras High Court,” a senior police officer told The Hindu .

19 March 2021||MALAPPURAM,||Move on Sabarimala only after consensus: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said any further moves on Sabarimala will be made only after consulting different stakeholders in the wake of the final judgment from the Supreme Court. Addressing the media at Manjeri during his electioneering in the district on Thursday, the Chief Minister indirectly endorsed the expression of regret by Minister for Devaswom Kadakampally Surendran over the incidents caused by women’s entry into Sabarimala. However, it is clear why some persons are displaying an exceptional interest in the matter of Sabarimala during the election time. He said the Sabarimala issue would be dealt with only when the Supreme Court issued its final verdict. “The government will implement the verdict by taking all sections into confidence,” he said. He criticised the media for highlighting the statements of R. Balashankar, former editor of the RSS mouthpiece Organiser , about a tie-up between the CPI(M) and the BJP. “The Left Democratic Front does not need any help from any communal forces,” he said. The Chief Minister lashed out at the Opposition for raising unnecessary and silly issues to divert the attention of the media and the people. “Are you not listening to the BJP veteran O. Rajagopal’s statement about the Congress-League-BJP alliance in Kerala,” he asked. “Are you not ashamed to go after Mr. Balashankar?” He alleged that there was a strong bond between the United Democratic Front and the BJP in the State. According to him, the UDF failed the State by helping the BJP deny Central aid for Kerala. The Chief Minister wondered why the UDF was supporting the Centre in attacking the State government. Thin line “Even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who criticises the Centre for using its agencies to target the opponents, is trying to find fault with the Central agencies for not being aggressive with Kerala and its government,” he said. Addressing an election rally later at Areekode, the Chief Minister said the parting line between the Congress and the BJP was becoming thinner and thinner. “The difference between the Congress and the BJP has vanished in other States. Kerala too will witness this phenomenon soon,” he said. Mr. Vijayan praised the LDF government for completing difficult projects like the GAIL pipeline and National Highway expansion, among other things. K. Bhaskaran, convener of the LDF Eranad election committee, presided over the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/move-on-sabarimala-only-after-consensus-cm/article34104066.ece
19 March 2021||New Delhi,||Rajya Sabha passes Bill to raise FDI limit in insurance sector||The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Insurance Amendment Bill, 2021 that increases the maximum foreign investment allowed in an insurance company from 49% to 74%, amid criticism from the Opposition parties on the clause enabling “control and ownership” by foreign investors. The Opposition parties unsuccessfully tried to stall the house demanding that the Bill not be moved in a haste and instead be sent to a standing committee. They marched into the well of the House after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved the Bill. The House was adjourned four times. The debate started at 3.30 p.m., when the Opposition relented reluctantly to have a debate instead of continuing with the protests. Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma questioned the very justification and intent for such a bill. He asked when the government has majority in both Houses why was it in a hurry to pass the Bill ducking due parliamentary scrutiny that the Opposition was demanding. He said the insurance companies hold the people’s money in trust and that this Bill broke it. He also accused the government of violating the assurance given in 2015 that “Indian ownership and control” would remain. Mr. Sharma said, “We are not opposed to the policy of disinvestment, but is it disinvestment or leapfrogging towards privatisation and embarking on grand clearance sale of national assets built assiduously over the years.” He also flagged that the big insurance firms are not in shortage of capital and that the Bill differed from the government motto — “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. DMK MP Tiruchi Siva pointed out that none of the insurance firms had managed to get FDI even up to the present limit of 49% and questioned the justification to increase the limit. Replying to the debate, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman assured the House that the policy holder’s money will not leave Indian shores and have to be compulsorily invested here. She argued that more FDI would mean greater competition and thus better negotiated premiums for the end user. Countering the key criticism by the Opposition parties on handing over “control and ownership” to foreign firms, Ms. Sitharaman said it came with safeguards. The key management personnel would have to be Indians and therefore would be governed by the Indian laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rajya-sabha-passes-bill-to-raise-fdi-limit-in-insurance-sector/article34104081.ece

19 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka govt. hospitals to ready 1,000 beds soon||With a second wave of COVID-19 outbreak imminent and three more clusters detected in Bengaluru on Thursday, the State government is gearing up to keep hospitals equipped. As many as 1,000 COVID beds would be readied in government hospitals and government medical colleges in the next 15 days, said Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar. Addressing presspersons on Thursday after a meeting with senior Health officials and heads of all government hospitals and medical colleges, the Minister said he had asked all hospitals to keep beds ready on a mission mode. This apart, nearly 1,000 beds would also become functional from Monday in three COVID care centres that were being set up in Bengaluru. A total of 200 ambulances, one in each ward, would be set aside exclusively for COVID patients. “I have told our officials and healthcare staff that none of us should take leave for the next 50 days. Our officials will have a separate round of discussion with private hospitals this week to ensure that they are also prepared,” Dr. Sudhakar said, adding that heads of respective institutions would be held accountable for any lapse. The State’s COVID war room would start operating round the clock as it was during the first outbreak and the government would monitor the situation using real-time data through the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. All the applications that were developed to monitor the situation when the pandemic hit the State would be optimally used. Shortage of doctors and paramedical staff would also be addressed and a decision had been taken to recruit resident doctors and paramedical staff on a temporary basis. Reiterating that surveillance measures would be stepped up in the border districts, the Minister said the Chief Secretary has had a meeting in this regard with officials in those districts. The focus would be on Bengaluru Urban, Bidar, and Kalaburgi that have a high caseload. Emphasising on vaccine coverage, the Minister said inoculations would be ramped up and a target of vaccinating three lakh people daily had been fixed. “If we vaccinate senior citizens and people above 45 years with comorbidities, who are most vulnerable, we can ensure this population is protected in case of a second wave,” the Minister said. He said that the government was more confident now as it had the experience of handling the outbreak in the last one year. “There was lack of information and awareness when the pandemic hit us last year. We are also armed with a vaccine now,” he added.  Vaccine wastage: officials to be accountable  Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Thursday said vaccine wastage, which has been pegged at over 6% in Karnataka, will be monitored on a daily basis and officials would be accountable for every vial. Heads of individual institutions would be held accountable at centres where the wastage was high. “We have asked heads of hospitals with vaccination centres to file a report on vaccine usage and wastage on a daily basis,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-govt-hospitals-to-ready-1000-beds-soon/article34104060.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP, Oppn. spar over events in J&K||The discussion on the supplementary demands for grants for Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry in the Lok Sabha became the site of an intense debate between the ruling BJP and the Opposition on the events in J&K since August 5, 2019, the reading down of Article 370. National Conference MP Hasnain Masood termed the ending of the special status of J&K and reducing its status to a Union Territory as a fire that had been lit by the present government. He termed the District Development Council (DDC) polls in J&K as a referendum on the move and pointed out that the BJP had got only 3% vote in the polls. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman responded to the charge stating that the DDCs were not a referendum but a demonstration by the people of the Union Territory of their faith in the democratic institutions and the administration’s ability to maintain law and order. “The DDC polls saw voters come out in large numbers, 51% polling percentage was recorded in these polls, not just in urban areas but in rural areas too. That is a sign of the faith that people have in democratic institutions and law and order,” she said. Jamyang Tsering Namgyal of the BJP hailed Prime Minister as a “yug purush” for realising the dream of ideologue Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who had opposed special status to J&K. Anumula Revanth Reddy (Congress) said the incidents of ‘crossfire’ have risen in the past 16 years in the Union Territory and accused the government of slapping criminal cases on local journalists for writing critical pieces. Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said B.R. Ambedkar, besides Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, were opposed to Article 370. And it was only a temporary provision, he said. Sougata Ray of the Trinamool said J&K’s Statehood should be restored and alleged that peace has not been brought to the Valley. He also criticised the role of former Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, saying she often fought the elected government there. The Budget for Puducherry was also part of the debate. Bhartruhari Mahtab of the BJD said he looked forward to the day when J&K and Ladakh are accorded statehood||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-oppn-spar-over-events-in-jk/article34104607.ece
19 March 2021||Pune,||‘Vaccine export curbs may hit U.K.’||With India, and particularly Maharashtra, witnessing a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases, the United Kingdom’s vaccination programme could hit a roadblock as the Indian government is temporarily staying exports to address the increased vaccination demands in India. Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Serum Institute of India (SII), which is manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told the U.K.’s Telegraph newspaper that the situation was solely dependent on the Indian government and had nothing to do with the Serum Institute. ‘Nothing to do with SII’ “It is solely dependent on India and it has nothing to do with the SII. It is to do with the Indian government allowing more doses to the U.K.,” Mr. Poonawalla said. According to the paper, Mr. Poonawalla confirmed that five million doses of the Oxford vaccine had already been delivered to the U.K. early this month. The Telegraph quoted a source stating that the second batch of five million doses that the SII is due to give the U.K. will only be delivered once it was approved by the Indian government, which is deliberating on how to combat the renascence of the pandemic. Of India’s 2.35 lakh-odd active cases, Maharashtra contributes to more than 60%, with the State reporting an average daily spike of more than 15,000 cases for the past one week to take the active case tally beyond 1.50 lakh cases. Eight of the 10 most-affected districts, including Pune and Nagpur, are from Maharashtra. Remarking that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government’s emphasis was on ramping up its vaccination drive, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said he had written to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan that the State needed 2.20 crore doses from the Centre for the drive. This translates to a requirement of 20 lakh doses per week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-export-curbs-may-hit-uk/article34104090.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC transfers COVID-19 vaccination case to itself||The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed suo motu proceedings before the Delhi High Court on the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and transferred the case to itself. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said a similar case concerning the vaccination drive was already pending in the Supreme Court, and the case from the Delhi High Court could be heard along with it. Vaccine makers Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech argued that vaccination was an “all- India” issue and needed to be heard by the Supreme Court for a final decision. Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta agreed with the vaccine makers to have the cases pending in High Courts, including the Bombay High Court, to be transferred to the Supreme Court. The Bench issued notice on a plea by vaccine makers to transfer a vaccination-related case from the Bombay High Court too. Earlier in March, the two companies were asked by the Delhi High Court to reveal their capacity to manufacture vaccines on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. ‘Commercial war’ Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the companies could not be made to run from one High Court to another, responding to questions about daily production and revealing details of their vaccines. Senior advocate Harish Salve, for the Serum Institute, said there was a “vaccine commercial war” brewing. Disclosure would harm interests. He said courts should not ideally enter into this domain. The Delhi High Court had on March 5 asked the companies to “disclose the daily off-take of the vaccines from their respective institutes and how much excess quantity of the vaccine is lying unutilised”. It had wanted the companies to indicate “whether they can scale-up their capacities, if the need arises”. It had also questioned the government’s rationale behind keeping a “strict control over the class of persons who can be presently vaccinated”. “Under the present arrangement, persons above the age of 60 years and those falling in the age group of 45-60 years with serious co-morbidities alone can receive the vaccinations. The rationale for such a classification should also be disclosed,” the court had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-transfers-covid-19-vaccination-case-to-itself/article34104097.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Raise CAA, S-400 deal with India’||Saying the Indian government is moving away from democratic values, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez, has written to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin asking him to raise concerns about democracy and India’s purchase of the S-400 Russian missile defence system during his visit to New Delhi. Mr. Austin is expected to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and senior national security officials between March 19 and 21 when he is in New Delhi. “I would like to see the U.S.-India partnership grow, but we must acknowledge that the partnership is strongest when based on shared democratic values and the Indian government has been trending away from those values,” Mr. Menendez said in the letter dated March 17. “I also expect that you will raise the administration’s opposition to India’s reportedly planned purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system,” he wrote. Among his concerns, Mr. Menendez cited crackdown on journalists and critics of the government, its handling of the farmers’ protests and the use of sedition laws, and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). “The Indian government’s ongoing crackdown on farmers peacefully protesting new farming laws and corresponding intimidation of journalists and government critics only underscores the deteriorating situation of democracy,” Mr. Menendez says. “Moreover, in recent years, rising anti-Muslim sentiment and related government actions like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the suppression of political dialogue and arrest of political opponents following the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, and the use of sedition laws to persecute political opponents have resulted in the U.S. human rights group Freedom House stripping India of its ‘Free’ status in its yearly global survey,” he says. CAATSA sanctions India’s purchase of S-400 for just under $5.5 billion could attract sanctions under a 2017 law, the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The Trump administration’s repeated message was that sanction waivers are not automatic and decided on a case-by-case basis. Congress forced the Trump administration’s hand in December last year by requiring it to sanction Turkey for purchasing the S-400. In 2018, China was sanctioned for purchase of Russian equipment. While India is not a treaty ally of the U.S. and is increasing its purchase of U.S. arms — mitigating circumstances as per U.S. law — the Menendez letter suggests that sanctions are still, at least in theory, an option as India is expected to take delivery of the S-400 later this year. It reads: “India’s planned purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defense system is also a matter of concern. I recognize that India is not a U.S. treaty ally and has historical ties with the Soviet and Russian militaries. However, if India chooses to go forward with its purchase of the S-400, that act will clearly constitute a significant, and therefore sanctionable, transaction with the Russian defense sector under Section 231 of CAATSA.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/raise-caa-s-400-deal-with-india/article34104105.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||‘In West Bengal, there is a syndicate raj, goonda raj, mafia raj’||Kailash Vijayvargiya , national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has been the party’s observer for West Bengal for the past six years. He is considered one of the architects of the BJP’s meteoric rise in West Bengal. Mr. Vijayvargiya speaks about the BJP’s prospects and challenges in the Assembly polls. Edited excerpts:  Where does the BJP stand in West Bengal in the the run-up to the Assembly polls? The BJP is all set to form the next government in West Bengal. The people of West Bengal are going to choose between two governments — one at the Centre and the other in the State. The people are also aware that there are two different leadership models at the Centre and in the State. On the one side, there is the leadership of Narendra Modi, under whom in the past six years not a single Minister has been accused of corruption. The schemes of the Centre are reaching beneficiaries and there is transparency. There are no middlemen in the implementation of these schemes — complete transparency is maintained. On the other hand, we see the way [implementation of] the State government’s schemes is riddled with corruption. Everywhere there are syndicates operating. People in West Bengal have to give commission for getting the benefits of every scheme. When did you realise that the BJP could emerge as an important force in West Bengal? In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP got 17% of the votes. This gave us the impression that the people of the State were ready to support the BJP provided we could present the party as an alternative to the people of the State. Since then, we ran a number of campaigns asking people to associate with us through missed calls. The lists were screened and we started adding more and more beneficiaries. In the 2018 panchayat election in West Bengal, people were not allowed to contest and exercise their franchise. And in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the anger of the people was reflected when the BJP won 18 of the 42 seats. The Trinamool Congress claims that it has ushered in overall development in the State. What kind of development? Can Mamata- ji give one example of what she has achieved in Bengal? The State government has not been able to showcase its achievement in the past two terms. Before Independence, Bengal was one of the most prosperous States in the country. Today, it is among the backward States. From the Left regime to the Trinamool Congress regime, Bengal has only seen setbacks in all sectors. In the 1970s, Bengal accounted for 24.8% of the industrial output in the country; today it stands at a meagre 2.3%. Along with different spheres of cultural activity, West Bengal has made a contribution in the field of spirituality with figures like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. But today, their followers are not feeling safe. There has been a politicisation of bureaucracy and the police administration. They are hand in glove with criminals and the mafia. What has happened in the past 10 years is a syndicate raj , goonda raj and mafia raj . We have to keep in mind that West Bengal is a border State and crucial to internal security. A huge danger is also posed by illegal infiltrations. There is enough evidence to prove that cattle smuggling continues. It is being said that the BJP has used defections as a political tool and now that many Trinamool Congress leaders are with the BJP, the party has become the Trinamool’s B-team. When a river merges with the sea, the river loses its identity and becomes a part of the sea. The BJP is the biggest party in the world and those joining the BJP are becoming a part of the party. Those joining have to contribute to the party. Mukul- da was the second most important person in the Trinamool Congress when he joined the BJP. In the initial days, he was sitting in the second row, not in the first row. The same has been the case with other leaders who joined us. What alternative is the BJP offering? What do you mean when you say that the BJP will make the State ‘Sonar Bangla (golden Bengal)’? West Bengal has immense potential in every sector. There is immense scope of industrial growth. After Mamata- ji drove away the Tatas from Singur, no industrialist has dared to invest in the State. We are promising industrial growth and upgradation of infrastructure and quality education. West Bengal has access to the sea and the ports here can be utilised to their optimum capacity. There are also coal mines here. We have everything in the State, from skilled manpower to locational advantage. What is lacking is political will. Another issue that we are going to ensure is to enforce the sanctity of borders and stop all illegal activity. In 2011, people voted the Trinamool Congress to power because they wanted to remove the CPI (M). Today, the people of the State want development and therefore there is such support for the BJP. The people of West Bengal know that development can only be ushered in under the leadership of Narendra Modi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-west-bengal-there-is-a-syndicate-raj-goonda-raj-mafia-raj/article34104025.ece
19 March 2021||Kolkata,||PM takes a dig at Trinamool slogan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday took on the Trinamool Congress election slogan “ Khela hobe ” (the game will be played), and said that it was “ Khela sesh ”  (game over) for Mamata Banerjee. Using the Trinamool election slogan of “ Khela hobe ”, Mr. Modi, who addressed a public meeting in Purulia, said, “Didi  is saying ‘ Khela hobe ’. The BJP is saying ‘ Chakri hobe ’ (there will be jobs). Didi is saying ‘ Khela hobe ’. The BJP is saying ‘ Unnayan hobe ’ (there will be development)...”. The Prime Minister raised the issue of water scarcity in Purulia and said that while the Trinamool Congress government was busy playing its own games, it had done nothing to solve the water crisis in the region. He said the region continued to be one of the most backward regions of the country without any industrialisation. Mr. Modi said the way in which the Trinamool Congress government worked was evident from the manner that it could not complete the Purulia piped water supply project in eight years. “Year after year, they could not complete a bridge and now, before elections, they are talking about development,” Mr. Modi said. Water scarcity During his half an hour speech, the Prime Minister made several references in Bengali and said the TMC government was responsible for not dealing with water scarcity and the migration of youth. “Didi has never considered the backward [classes], Dalits and tribals stakeholders of development. The culture of cut-money, commission and tolabaji (extortion) has affected the tribals and backward [classes] most,” he said. Accusing the Trinamool Congress of patronising the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), Mr. Modi said that the policies of the Mamata Banerjee government had created a “new breed of Maoist”. “For political gains, the government of Didi has encouraged the violence of Maoists,” the PM said. The Prime Minister also accused Ms. Banerjee of pursuing “appeasement politics” and said such politics was responsible for infiltration. He made references to the Chief Minister’s statement on the Pulwama attack and the Batla House encounter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-takes-a-dig-at-trinamool-slogan/article34104079.ece
19 March 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Many teaching institutes substandard’||With as many as nine million teachers in around 1.5 million schools in India, the quality of education imparted to aspiring teachers is equally important. For education in our schools to improve, teaching has to improve. This is the crux of the first volume on teachers and teacher education, comprising four papers on the subject, that was released by Azim Premji University on Thursday. It is the first volume in a series on ‘Issues in Education’, said the university in a press release. Together, the four papers explore the landscape of Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) in the country, corruption in private TEIs, the support system needed for teachers and the problem of those who are on contract. Corruption flagged The first paper — ‘Mapping the Landscape of Teacher Education Institutions in India’ — found that of the 17,503 TEIs in India, more than 90% are privately owned, stand-alone institutions, offering single programmes localised in certain geographies. Four States, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, account for 54% of all TEIs in the country, said the researchers. Only 12 States/UTs have at least one TEI in each district. Equally worrying is the level of corruption, which is the focus of the second paper, Corruption in Private Teacher Education Institutions. According to the researchers, there are many substandard, dysfunctional TEIs functioning as ‘commercial shops’. According to the researchers, TEIs deliberately neglected basic curricular requirements. “Classes are neither conducted seriously nor taken seriously by students,” said the authors of the paper. Almost all private TEIs allowed students with shortage of attendance to appear for examinations. More than 60% allowed students who had not completed their school internship to appear for examinations. At least 70% TEIs had an average student attendance below 80%.  The fourth paper in the series tackles the increasing prevalence of contract teachers, who are recruited for short periods on inadequate salaries with little or no benefits. This, the authors stated, had caused long-term damage to not just the teaching profession, but has also affected student learning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/many-teaching-institutes-substandard/article34104056.ece
19 March 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Deposits returned to 3,243 investors in IMA scam case’||In a relief to a small section of investors in I Monetary Advisory (IMA) Group of Companies, the Competent Authority (CA) on Thursday told the High Court of Karnataka that it has returned either full or partial amount of their deposited sum to 3,243 investors by way of bank transfer. The amount to be returned, with the permission of a special court, was capped at a maximum of Rs. 50,000 as the total amount available with the CA is only Rs. 5.3 crore, and has distributed Rs. 4.92 crore to the 3,243 claimants starting from the lowest amount claimed, the CA informed the court. These aspects were disclosed in the status report, submitted before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice M.G. Shukure Kamal during the hearing on PIL petitions through which the court is monitoring the progress of the investigation of criminal cases and process of providing relief to investors under the provisions of the the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments (KPIDFE) Act, 2004. With this, some of the claimants would have received the total amount deposited by them with the IMA and some partial amount up to Rs. 50,000 of their total deposits, government advocate Vijayakumar A. Patil told the Bench. Following this, the Bench observed that perhaps this is the first case in which the investors/ depositors are getting back at least a portion of their deposited amount under the provisions of the KDIDFE Act. Meanwhile, senior IAS officer Harsh Gupta, the Special Officer and Competent Authority under KPIDFE Act for IMA and other scam cases, said in the report that wrong details of bank accounts were found in 15,000 claims when test transfer of Rs. 1 was made to the accounts of claimants to verify the account details. Errors in claims While the errors in 12,000 of 15,000 have been rectified, the errors in the remaining 3,000 claims can rectified only after the claimants provide correct details of accounts, the report stated adding that only 300 claims were rejected for want of proper documents of the total 65,258 claims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/deposits-returned-to-3243-investors-in-ima-scam-case/article34104058.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Don’t stereotype women in court rulings, SC tells judges||The Supreme Court on Wednesday forbade judges from making gender-stereotypical comments like “good women are sexually chaste”, women who drink and smoke ‘ask’ for sexual advances or presume that a sexually active woman consented to rape while hearing cases of sexual offence. A Bench of Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and S. Ravindra Bhat stopped judges from trying to mandate marriage or compromise between a molestor and his victim. The Bench, in a judgment, proscribed judges from granting bail to suspected sexual offenders on the condition that they perform “community service” or apologise to their victims. The Supreme Court forbade the accused from getting in touch with the survivor. The court said the victim should be immediately notified if the accused is given bail in a sexual offence case. She should be given a copy of the bail order within 48 hours. The 24-page verdict, authored by Justice Bhat, set aside a Madhya Pradesh High Court order granting bail to a suspected molestor provided he visits his victim at her home and ‘allows’ her to tie a rakhi on him. “Using rakhi tying as a condition for bail, transforms a molester into a brother, by a judicial mandate,” Justice Bhat wrote. In a scathing verdict, Justice Bhat said judgments and orders continue to reflect “entrenched paternalistic and misogynistic attitudes” even after 70 years as a Republic. “A woman cannot be herself in the society of the present day, which is an exclusively masculine society, with laws framed by men and with a judicial system that judges feminine conduct from a masculine point of view,” Justice Bhat quoted Henrik Ibsen in exasperation. Judges should not fall into the trap of stereotyping. A judge’s address is not limited to the parties in a case but extends to the broader legal community of other lawyers, judges, legal academics, law students and indeed the public at large, Justice Bhat warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-stereotype-women-in-court-rulings-sc-tells-judges/article34104078.ece
19 March 2021||KOLKATA,||2 BJP candidates decline nomination||In a major embarrassment to the Bharatiya Janata Party, two candidates announced by the party on Thursday for the Assembly polls from Kolkata have refused to contest on the party’s ticket. Shikha Mitra Chowdhury, wife of the former West Bengal Pradesh Congress president Somendranath Mitra, was named by the party for the Chowringhee seat. She, however, said she was not consulted before the party made the announcement. “I am not contesting on BJP ticket anyway. I come from a Congress culture and I cannot join the BJP,” she said. Another BJP candidate chosen for the Kashipur-Belgachia constituency, Tarun Saha, said he had not joined the BJP and had not sent any request for candidature. Mr. Saha is the husband of the local Trinamool Congress MLA Mala Saha. In another development, the BJP changed its candidate for the Alipurduar seat, eminent economist and former Chief Economic Adviser to the Government of India Ashok Lahiri, with the party’s general secretary in Alipurduar district, Suman Kanjilal. There were reports of BJP offices being attacked in certain parts of the State and party supporters coming out airing their grievances publicly against the newly announced candidates. Protests were reported in Durgapur, Malda and North 24 Parganas. During the day BJP announced 156 candidates for West Bengal. They included prominent party leaders like Mukul Roy, Rahul Sinha and Shamik Bhattacharya. Interestingly, the list does not include West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/2-bjp-candidates-decline-nomination/article34104084.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Arvind resigns from Ashoka University||Former Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Arvind Subramanian resigned from Ashoka University on Thursday, days after noted columnist and political commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta’s exit. In his resignation letter, Dr. Subramanian said he had been “devastated” by “the circumstances involving the ‘resignation’ of Professor Pratap Bhanu Mehta” two days earlier. ‘Troubling feeling’ “That someone of such integrity and eminence, who embodied the vision underlying Ashoka, felt compelled to leave is troubling,” he wrote. “That even Ashoka — with its private status and backing by private capital — can no longer provide a space for academic expression and freedom is ominously disturbing. Above all, that the university’s commitment to fight for and sustain the Ashoka vision is now open to question makes it difficult for me to continue being part of Ashoka,” he added. Professor Mehta’s letter provides insight into the reasons behind his departure. “After a meeting with the university’s founders, it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the university may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politics that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens, is perceived to carry risks for the university. In the interests of the university, I resign,” he wrote to University Vice-Chancellor Malabika Sarkar. He added that “a liberal university will need a liberal political and social context to flourish” and expressed hope that the university would play a role in securing that environment. “In light of the prevailing atmosphere, the founders and the administration will require renewed commitment to the values of Ashoka, and new courage to secure Ashoka’s freedom,” he wrote. In a virtual town hall meeting attended by over a thousand students, faculty and alumni on Thursday evening, Dr. Sarkar said she was not part of the conversations between the university’s founders and Prof. Mehta before his resignation. ‘Still a safe space’ “The trustees have said they did not ask him to resign,” she said, adding that she believed the university remained a “safe space”. She added that she had asked Prof. Mehta to rescind his resignation on Thursday morning, but he would not do so. Ashish Dhawan, chairperson of Ashoka’s Board of Trustees, did not respond to The Hindu’s request for comment. Earlier, in a solidarity statement, the faculty said they were troubled by the “plausible” scenario that Prof. Mehta’s resignation was a direct consequence of his role as a public intellectual and critic of the government. Chilling precedent Even more troubling is the possibility that our university may have acceded to pressure to remove Professor Mehta or to request and accept his resignation,” said the faculty statement, adding that it would “set a chilling precedent for future removals of faculty, curtailing our sense of who we are as researchers and teachers.” The University’s Student Government and Alumni Council also gathered signatures for a solidarity statement, demanding transparency from the administration and founders. Historian Ramachandra Guha, who is a former member of Ashoka’s Academic Council had tweeted, “In its journey thus far, Ashoka University had shown much promise. They may have frittered all that away by the spinelessness of their Trustees, who have chosen to crawl when asked to bend.” In a report, Ashoka’s student newspaper, The Edict , quoted a source claiming that Ashoka’s founders endorsed the resignation, “motivated by an understanding that if Prof. Mehta resigned, the university’s efforts to acquire a new plot of land to expand the campus would get much smoother. Additionally, formal recognition for the fourth-year PG diploma, Ashoka Scholars’ Programme, was also hinted at being part of the deal.” V-C refutes charges However, Dr. Sarkar refuted these allegations, saying that the university had already acquired the land several years ago, and that permissions for the four-year programme were also under way. The students demanded an independent inquiry into Prof. Mehta’s ouster.

19 March 2021||Special Correspondent,||‘Govt. welcomes dissent on social media’||Union Communications and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Thursday that climate activist Disha Ravi’s arrest was based on law and order and it is under judicial process. He added that the House should consider “should some people abuse social media internationally to defame India to promote secessionism”. Replying to a question by Congress member G.C. Chandrashekhar regarding Ms. Ravi’s arrest for editing a ‘toolkit’ about the farmers’ protest, Mr. Prasad said, “India is proud to have nearly 140 crore social media users. LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook are free to do business in India. They have empowered ordinary Indians. The government welcomes dissent. The issue is not of use of social media, the issue is of abuse and misuse of social media ... Internet is a powerful invention of the human mind, but it should not become the monopoly of a few. And we have taken a position, any attempt to create imperialism of Internet by a few companies is not acceptable.” He said the government welcomes criticism on social media, but “some people who sermonise and do not provide their identity ... then these guidelines ensure that social media companies will ask them to voluntarily verify their identities”. The Ministry recently released the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which specify that “due diligence” should be followed by all intermediaries, including social media intermediaries.   Mr. Prasad also said his department works in close coordination with the Election Commission. “The Election Commission has set up a dedicated cell to weed out fake news, fake media designed to influence (voters),” he said, adding that Cambridge Analytica has been banned and a CBI probe is going on against the U.K.-based data analytics firm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-welcomes-dissent-on-social-media/article34104093.ece

Mr. Singh, a 1986 batch Indian Police Service officer who was appointed this week as the DG, said 13 persons had been provided protection by the CRPF in West Bengal. “The pre-poll deployment in West Bengal is 725 CRPF companies... 495 companies have reached there, the rest are on their way. We only provide support to the police there,” the DG said, adding that the operational strength of each company was 72 personnel. The 3.25-lakh Central police force is deployed for internal security duties in Jammu and Kashmir, Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected areas and during elections. Addressing a press conference on the occasion of the force’s 82nd raising day, Mr. Singh said, “Threat assessments are done by the State authorities in areas and they decide deployment on that basis.” West Bengal Assembly polls will be held in eight phases for 294 seats beginning March 27. “We provide support to the State authorities so that peaceful and successful elections could be held under the directions of the Election Commission. We are committed to peaceful, free and fair elections. We provide support, we do not gather intelligence,” he said. In all, the CRPF is providing security cover to 69 persons including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, industrialist Mukesh Ambani and actor Kangana Ranaut. When asked about a recent video where a CRPF personnel was seen opening the door of Ms. Ranaut’s car in Mumbai, the DG said, “I am yet to get details but the motive behind opening the door is important. Doing it out of courtesy is not in mandate, important that it is done part of security.” He said 80 CRPF personnel had died due to COVID-19 so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-50000-personnel-deployed-for-bengal-polls/article34104019.ece
19 March 2021||BENGALURU,||CD case: Key suspect releases video, claims innocence||Even as the Special Investigation Team (SIT) is on the lookout for the suspects in the Ramesh Jarkiholi CD case, Naresh Gowda, the prime suspect, released a video claiming that he had nothing to do with the case and there was a conspiracy to implicate him. In the video Gowda claimed that he knew the woman in the CD as she had approached him stating that she had been cheated by the former Minister and sought help. “I told her to get evidence and we have had a few conversations. This does not mean that I plotted anything,” he said. Gowda said he would appear before SIT in the next few days. “The police are treating the people who helped the woman as criminals and harassing them and their families, instead of investigating the allegations against Ramesh Jarkiholi,” he said. The police instead of helping the woman were treating her as an accused, he charged. Meanwhile, social activist Bhimappa Gundappa Gadada filed a petition with the Cubbon Park police seeking action against Ramesh Jarkiholi. He sought to know why no action had been taken based on the woman’s statement. Earlier, SIT officials searched the house of the woman and a house in Basaveshwaranagar where the prime suspect was staying. Sources in SIT said they had found cash, SIM card, electronic gadgets and some other things from her house. Upon searching the house of the prime suspect, the officials found a laptop, a pen drive and receipt of gold purchased. The officials are now looking into his source of income from which he could buy gold and also organise his daughter’s naming ceremony in a grand manner, the sources said. The SIT team, which was in contact with the Belagavi police and the family members of the woman after they lodged a case of abduction, has taken up the investigation in that case too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cd-case-key-suspect-releases-video-claims-innocence/article34104624.ece
19 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘National security threat perception is real’||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday termed the national security threat perception real, saying there was a perceptible increase in drone movement from across the border since the farmers’ protests started gathering traction in October 2020. He said he had met Union Home Minister Amit Shah amid the agitation to discuss this grave issue and to ask him why Central forces could not be provided with adequate equipment to locate and shoot down the drones. “The Khalistani cells in Punjab were dormant but they are being fed with weapons via the drones to activate them to create trouble,” he said. “Any breach of the Punjab border is a breach of national security,” said Capt. Amarinder. “While a large number of weapons have been seized near the borders, what is the cause of worry is those that have not been caught,” he said. Detailing about the arrests and seizures since his government took over in March 2017, the Chief Minister said as many as 333 modules of terrorists and gangsters have been busted while 3,472 militants-gangsters have been arrested. “Ten drones had been picked up, in addition to 2,000-odd weapons (including rifles, revolvers, pistols, etc.), hand grenades, RDX and other explosives, walkie-talkies and satellite phones. As many as 11,000 rounds of ammunition have also been seized. These are not small numbers for a small State like Punjab,” he said. Asked about former Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s rehabilitation, the Chief Minister said “everyone wants him to be part of our team”. He said he would also be happy to have Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Dhullo as part of the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/national-security-threat-perception-is-real/article34104317.ece
19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Telangana budget outlay is Rs. 2.3 lakh cr.||Finance Minister T. Harish Rao on Thursday presented to the State Assembly budget of Telangana for 2021-22 with a targeted outlay of Rs. 2.30 lakh crore which is at least Rs. 48,000 crore more than the proposals for 2020-21 and revised to Rs. 64,000 crore recently. Turning its back to a bad year induced by pandemic, the budget reflected the government’s resolve to mop up Rs. 1.76 lakh crore through revenue receipts (excluding borrowings) which is Rs. 59,000 crore more than the revised estimates of last year. The revised receipts fell short of budget estimates by Rs. 26,000 crore in 2020-21. The capital receipts in the coming year were contemplated at Rs. 53,850 crore, including open market loans of Rs. 47,500 crore. A revenue surplus of Rs. 6,743 crore and a fiscal deficit of Rs. 45,509 crore are targeted in 2021-22 wherein a new scheme named CM Dalit Empowerment Programme is proposed with an allocation of Rs. 1,000 crore. The government decided to provide each MLA and MLC with Rs. 5 crore for development of their constituencies. The government also decided to provide an incentive of Rs. 30,000 per acre as subsidy for oil palm farmers. Taking into account, the future drinking water needs of Hyderabad, the government planned to take up a new project to bring water to the city from Sunkesula near Nagarjunasagar. An amount of Rs. 5,225 crore is proposed towards crop loan waiver and Rs. 14,800 crore for the investment support scheme for agriculture `Rytu Bandhu’. Electricity subsidy was proposed for barbers’ saloons. Toilets for women were proposed in police stations and universities. Interest-free loans will be extended to women self-help groups to the extent of Rs. 3,000 crore. Irrigation sector will get Rs. 16,931 crore and social security pensions Rs. 11,728 crore. The targeted expenditure on double bed room houses of government was Rs. 11,000 crore. The government noted that financial assistance to enable people construct double bed room houses in their own land was proposed last year but it had to be postponed due to economic crisis on account of the pandemic. The budget presentation by Mr. Rao expected the per capita income of the State to grow by 0.6 % this year compared to 2020-21. The government hoped to generate revenue receipts of Rs. 1.76 lakh crore from share of Central taxes to the tune of Rs. 13,990 crore (in 2020-21 it was Rs. 11,731 crore), tax revenue of Rs. 92,910 crore (76,195 crore), non-tax revenue of Rs. 30,557 crore (Rs. 19,305 crore) and grants-in-aid of Rs. 38,669 crore (Rs. 10,525 crore).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/telangana-budget-outlay-is-rs-23-lakh-cr/article34104062.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||India, Pak. should bury the past and move forward: Bajwa||Resolution of the Kashmir dispute in a ‘peaceful’ manner is necessary to tap the potential of Asian connectivity, said the Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Thursday. Delivering a speech at the first Islamabad Security Dialogue, the Pakistani Army chief said it was time for both India and Pakistan to bury past differences. “Stable Indo-Pak relation is a key to unlock the untapped potential of South and Central Asia by ensuring connectivity between East and West Asia. This potential, however, has forever remained hostage to disputes and issues between two nuclear neighbours. Kashmir dispute is obviously at the head of this problem. However, we feel it is time to bury the past and move forward,” General Bajwa said. The comment adds to the momentum generated by recent indications that there has been some back channel communication among certain officials on both sides. Thursday’s comments are of particular importance as they come a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan argued for greater trade between India and Pakistan saying India can use regional peace to access Central Asia. Mr. Bajwa said Pakistan is located in an important region to “connect civilisations”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-pak-should-bury-the-past-and-move-forward-bajwa/article34104100.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC agrees to hear petition on Rohingya ‘detained’ in Jammu||The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to urgently hear a plea to release and protect over 150 Rohingya refugees reportedly “detained” in Jammu. Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde agreed to hear the application filed by a member of the Rohingya community, Mohammad Salimullah, represented by advocates Prashant Bhushan and Cheryl d’Souza, on April 25. Mr. Bhushan made an oral mention before the CJI for an early hearing. Solicitor General (S-G) Tushar Mehta said the averments made in the application were “factually wrong”. Mr. Salimullah is already a petitioner in the Supreme Court against the deportment of Rohingya refugees. “This follows the Union Minister Jitendra Singh’s statements two months ago that the Rohingya (identified as Muslim refugees by the government) would not be able to secure citizenship. These refugees have been illegally detained and jailed in the Jammu sub-jail, which has been converted into a holding centre with the IGP (Jammu) Mukesh Singh stating that they face deportation back to Myanmar following verification by their embassy,” the application said. It added that official documents from the office of Deputy Commissioner of Jammu show there were 6,523 Rohingya in Jammu.  India is bound to adhere to the principle of non-refoulement — or not sending refugees to a place where they face danger — through customary international law, the application contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-agrees-to-hear-petition-on-rohingya-detained-in-jammu/article34104102.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||LS passes supplementary demand for grants||The Lok Sabha on Thursday passed the supplementary demand for grants (second batch for 2020-21) but not before significant concerns raised by Opposition leaders on the government’s disinvestment and asset monetisation plans, and rising fuel prices. Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur clarified specifically in the context of the Life Insurance Corporation of India that it was not being privatised and only an Initial Public Offering was being planned. This was in response to Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule’s concerns that eight Ministries had been lined up in the asset monetisation plan and the government’s stake in LIC was also being diluted. “I understand a certain amount of disinvestment is the need of the hour, considering that we are in the global game. But aggressively? Why is the government in such a hurry for eight Ministries...which are all in a lucrative business and also LIC...That is a concern,” she said. Margani Bharat of the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) asked the government not to go ahead with the privatisation of the Vizag Steel Plant, that is, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) and suggested that it could instead be merged with the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL). He said that RINL had clocked Rs. 200 crore profit before COVID-19 and suggested that the Centre and the Andhra Pradesh State government could work out a way to turn it profitable again. The Union Cabinet approved the strategic sale of RINL in January. Congress MP from Odisha Saptagiri Ulaka said that although the government was “hell-bent” on disinvestment and had set high targets, there were no takers for even Air India. The government estimates to raise Rs. 32,000 crore from public sector undertaking (PSU) stake sales in the current fiscal. For the next financial year, the target is pegged at Rs. 1.75 lakh crore. Vinayak Raut of the Shiv Sena said that rising prices of petrol and diesel have made the common man’s life difficult.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ls-passes-supplementary-demand-for-grants/article34104082.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Workers call for implementation of policy on migrants, demand relief||A group of hawkers, sex workers, domestic workers, rescued bonded labourers and other unorganised workers gathered at Jantar Mantar here on Thursday — almost a year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19, setting off a crisis for migrant workers — to demand that the government fulfil its promises. “Sex workers had no resources to survive the lockdown as they live on daily earnings,” said Kusum, from the All-India Network of Sex Workers at the protest organised by the Working People’s Charter. She demanded a one-time income support of Rs. 10,000 for all unorganised workers.   Chandan Kumar, national coordinator of the Working Peoples’ Charter, said though the NITI Aayog had come up with a draft policy for migrant workers, it was yet to be implemented. Nirmal Agni, general secretary of Bandhua Mukti Morcha, said workers would come together to protest on the eve of the lockdown anniversary on March 23, if the government failed to implement the policy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/workers-call-for-implementation-of-policy-on-migrants-demand-relief/article34104098.ece
19 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Sabarimala being used for electoral gains: CPI||The Sabarimala issue now exists as a problem only in the minds of some people who are trying to use faith for electoral gains, CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran said here on Thursday. Participating in Janavidhi 2021, organised by the Kesari Memorial Journalists Trust, Mr. Rajendran pointed out that the review pleas on the Sabarimala issue had been referred to a nine-member larger Bench of the Supreme Court and it was advisable to wait for the decision. Replying to the Nair Service Society stand on the matter, Mr. Rajendran said the NSS had fought the case and lost. “'There is no point in mobilising the people and blaming the government instead of seeking legal options after losing the case in the Supreme Court,” he said. Since the unfolding of the events that followed the 2018 Supreme Court verdict, no problems were reported in Sabarimala either in 2019 or 2020. Devotees conducted the pilgrimage peacefully although their numbers were fewer in 2020 due to COVID-19. Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran, who is contesting from Kazhakuttam, is not responsible for the controversy cropping up again ahead of the elections, he said. The situation is conducive for a Left Democratic Front victory in the State, Mr. Rajendran said. The Opposition is unable to find candidates to fight the elections in many constituencies, Mr. Rajendran alleged. On the prospects in the Nemom constituency in Thiruvananthapuram, Mr. Rajendran said O. Rajagopal of the BJP had won in 2016 after United Democratic Front votes ‘flowed out.’ “If they are planning to dam the flow this time, well and good,” he said, adding that the LDF will win in Nemom. Opportunists On the decision of Left workers, including those of the CPI, joining the BJP, Mr. Rajendran said opportunists will go anywhere.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sabarimala-being-used-for-electoral-gains-cpi/article34104068.ece

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||‘India has assured Sri Lanka of support’||The Rajapaksa government, whose core support comes from Sinhala Buddhist nationalists, has “categorically rejected” the UN Human Rights chief’s latest report, while accusing the Council of being “politically motivated”, even as a “core group” comprising the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, North Macedonia, Malawi and Montenegro tables the new resolution. Colombo has also been reaching out to member countries during the past weeks, pitching its version of Sri Lanka’s post-war realities that the UN resolutions seek to address. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, among other leaders, seeking support at the 47-member Council, where Colombo anticipates a hostile resolution. Mr. Rajapaksa spoke to Mr. Modi over telephone last week, reportedly following up on the letter sent earlier. China has officially declared its support to Sri Lanka. All eyes are on India’s vote, not only because of its “influence” in the Council, but also because of its own tensions with Colombo, following the Rajapaksa government’s recent decisions on strategic projects involving India and China. Given India’s pressing geopolitical concerns in the island nation, and stated support for Tamil aspirations, it remains to be seen how New Delhi will approach the vote scheduled on March 22. The only official intervention made by India so far on Sri Lanka at the ongoing 46th session of the Council in Geneva, was the statement by Permanent Representative (PR) of India Ambassador Indra Mani Pandey, who spoke of India’s “consistent position” resting on two pillars of support to Sri Lanka’s unity and territorial integrity, and an “abiding commitment” to Tamil aspirations for “equality, justice, peace and dignity”. “These are no either-or choices,” the PR had said, calling for the full implementation of the 13th Amendment. Apart from reminding Sri Lanka of its several pending commitments and failed promises on delivering truth, justice, and promoting reconciliation, the latest resolution calls for power devolution through the 13th Amendment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-assured-support-to-sri-lanka/article34104073.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||SC to hear plea against sale of electoral bonds||“Data obtained through RTI has shown that illegal sale windows have been opened in the past to benefit certain political parties... There is a serious apprehension that any further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming State elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam would further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies,” the NGO submitted. It said the scheme had “opened doors to unlimited political donations, even from foreign companies, thereby legitimising electoral corruption at a huge scale, while at the same time ensuring complete non-transparency in political funding”. The application reminded the court that both the central bank and the poll panel had objected to the electoral bond scheme. The government notified the scheme on January 2, 2018. It defended the scheme in court, saying it allowed anonymity to political donors to protect them from “political victimisation”. The Ministry of Finance’s affidavit in the top court had dismissed the Election Commission’s version that the invisibility afforded to benefactors was a “retrograde step” and would wreck transparency in political funding. The government affidavit had said the shroud of secrecy was a product of “well thought-out policy considerations”. It said the earlier system of cash donations had raised a “concern among the donors that, with their identity revealed, there would be competitive pressure from different political parties receiving donation”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-hear-plea-against-sale-of-electoral-bonds/article34104075.ece
19 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka to open retail jewellery outlets||In a pioneering step, the State government is planning to open jewellery retail outlets and promote the yellow metal with ‘Brand Karnataka’ image. Karnataka, which is the only State in the country that produces gold, is planning to open jewellery shops to sell gold coins with the State emblem, Gandaberunda, in partnership with private jewellers. Murugesh R. Nirani, Minister for Mines and Geology, said, “The State government is planning to produce gold jewellery on the lines of State-run Mysore Silks and Mysore Sandalwood Soaps which have a huge market and reputation among customers. Gold bars will also be sold in the retail outlets”. The government’s plan is also to produce and sell gold coins with Gandaberunda (mythical two-headed bird) embedded on them, aimed at attracting more customers since the yellow metal produced by the State is guaranteed for purity, said the Minister. “This landmark initiative will help the government generate more revenue and employment opportunities. Since gold is one of the most popular investment choices of the people, the government’s venture is expected to achieve great success,” Mr Nirani told reporters after meeting with jewellers’ association and jewellery designers here at the Vikasa Soudha on Thursday. The State government is planning to set up a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) exclusively for jewellery in Kalyana region for the overall development of the region. Setting up of SEZ will prompt industrialists to make investments in the region and thereby push economic growth and employment opportunities. A jewellery park is also on the cards. The government is planning to modernise the Hutti Gold Mines and enhance its capacity with a view to double the State’s gold production.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/state-government-planning-to-open-jewellery-retail-outlets/article34104278.ece

19 March 2021||New Delhi,||SC stays ban on teachers contesting elections||The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed a Kerala High Court decision barring aided school teachers and non-teaching staff from contesting Assembly elections or engaging in political activities. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the Kerala government while staying the High Court verdict in February. The High Court had declared Section 2 (IV) of the Legislative Assembly (Removal of Disqualifications) Act of 1951, which allowed aided school teachers to become legislators, as unconstitutional. Petitioners in the High Court had challenged the 1951 law, saying their participation in politics would affect the quality of education. They had argued in the HC that since Kerala Government Servants Conduct Rules prohibits government school teachers from taking part in political activities, the rule should extend to aided school teachers also. The government had however contended in the High Court that as per a government order issued in 1967, the teachers of aided schools had political rights. There were no Rules or Act prohibiting them from not participating in political activities or contesting polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-stays-order-barring-teachers-as-contestants/article34104054.ece

Raghunath on Thursday filed his nomination to contest against Chief Minister and Left Democratic Front candidate Pinarayi Vijayan in the Dharmadam constituency in the Assembly elections. He submitted his nomination papers even though the Congress was yet to officially announce its candidate in the constituency. Mr. Raghunath filed his nomination soon after Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee working president K. Sudhakaran declined the KPCC and party high command request to contest against Mr. Vijayan and backed him. Mr. Sudhakaran took the decision after an hour-long meeting at his office with the district leaders. He told mediapersons that the KPCC and the high command had requested him to contest from Dharmadam. However, local Congress leaders contended that if Mr. Sudhakaran contested in the constituency, it would not benefit the Congress campaign. Political agenda He said the political agenda of the United Democratic Front was to win the five constituencies in the district. For this he had to actively work in all the five segements. Mr. Sudhakaran seemed acutely aware that Mr. Vijayan had a head start in the electioneering. “Moreover, there is not enough time left for even primary preparation in Dharmadam,” he added. Mr. Sudhakaran said the DCC had informed the high command and the KPCC to name Mr. Raghunath as the candidate in Dharmadam. Mr. Raghunath’s name had come up even before the Congress toyed with the plan to back the Walayar mother who has already announced her candidacy. Meanwhile, Mr Raghunath told The Hindu that he decided to file the nomination after getting the nod of the State leadership and the high command. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran later told The Hindu that Mr. Sudhakaran’s desire for a face-off with Mr. Vijayan had dissuaded the KPCC from searching for an alternative candidate. Mr. Sudhakaran’s nominee would be the party's standard-bearer against Mr. Vijayan, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/c-raghunath-to-take-on-pinarayi/article34104375.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Roads to be freed of toll booths in a year: Gadkari||Separately, the Minister also expressed concern over the number of accidents and asserted that road accidents had taken away more lives in 2020 compared with the COVID-19 pandemic. “I want to assure the House that within one year, all physical toll booths in the country will be removed. It means that toll collection will happen via GPS. The money will be collected based on GPS imaging [of vehicles],” Mr. Gadkari told the Lok Sabha during Question Hour, responding to a question by Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali. He said 93% of the vehicles were paying toll using FASTag — a system that facilitates electronic payment of fee at toll plazas seamlessly — but the remaining 7% had still not adopted it despite paying double the toll.  He also made a statement in the Lok Sabha on the government’s new scrapping policy which, he claimed, would reduce pollution, improve fuel efficiency, and increase government’s revenue collection from the sale of new vehicles. The new policy provides for fitness tests after the completion of 20 years in the case of privately owned vehicles and 15 years in the case of commercial vehicles. Any vehicle that fails the fitness test or does not manage renewal of its registration certificate may be declared as an End of Life Vehicle. All government vehicles and those owned by PSUs will be de-registered after 15 years. The government will implement the policy in a phased manner, Mr. Gadkari said. The policy will kick in for government vehicles from April 1, 2022. Mandatory fitness testing for heavy commercial vehicles will start from April 1, 2023, and for all other categories of vehicles, including personal vehicles, it will start in phases from June 1, 2024 . To encourage owners to take their old vehicles to scrapping centres, the government has announced several incentives, including advisories to the States to give up to 25% rebate in road tax for personal vehicles and up to 15% rebate for commercial vehicles. The government will also offer waiver of registration fees on the purchase of new vehicles. The Minister said the Centre would issue an advisory to automakers to offer 5% rebate for those who buy a new vehicle after producing a scrapping certificate. The Ministry has proposed that commercial vehicles be de-registered after 15 years in case of failure to get the fitness certificate, and a private vehicle will be de-registered after 20 years if its fails fitness certification. There are 51 lakh light motor vehicles older than 20 years and 34 lakh light motor vehicles older than 15 years, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/roads-to-be-freed-of-toll-booths-in-a-year-gadkari/article34104074.ece

19 March 2021||MUMBAI,||Probe in TRP case can’t go on forever: HC||The Bombay High Court hearing the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation case said on Thursday that investigating agencies must stop investigation at a reasonable point. The court, commenting on the delay in the probe by the Mumbai Police, said an investigation cannot go on forever. “The Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation, State police, all should act with reasonableness, objective assessment. They should not appear to be another form of trouble.” The Bench was hearing a plea filed by ARG Outlier Media Private Limited Group, Republic TV and Arnab Goswami seeking to quash the FIR registered by the Mumbai Crime Branch. Only ‘suspects’  Senior advocate Ashok Mundargi, appearing for the channel and the Group that owns the channel, reiterated that even after two chargesheets, Mr. Goswami and other employees were only “suspects” and not “accused”.“The investigation is going on for the last three months ... We don’t see anything that has surfaced on record to array the petitioners as accused,” it said. “At which point will the officer say there is reason to believe that there is reason to arrest? “If the State is really reasonable, the State should say, ‘we will complete our investigation within say 30 days’. That is how reasonableness is shown.” The court went on to say economic offences were not like committing murder, where agencies must take time to complete the investigations. They could not hold people as accused and claim they have evidence. The arguments will continue on March 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/probe-in-trp-case-cant-go-on-forever-hc/article34104103.ece

On March 9, the board had issued a circular to all the mosques and dargahs in the State not to use loudspeakers between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., saying the ambient noise level around many mosques and mausoleums have “deleterious effects on human health and the psychological well-being of the people.” This order had drawn criticism.

19 March 2021||B. Tilak ChandarMadurai,TAMIL NADU||Nothing has changed here since last elections||Since the last Assembly elections, nothing much has changed in terms of civic infrastructure or amenities in Madurai East constituency which is mostly made up of suburbs with a mix of rural character but with urban ills. After last elections, residents of Vandiyur, Anaiyur, Kadachanendal, Tirumogur, and Othakadai thought the poll promises of protected drinking water, better sanitation and other basic amenities would be fulfilled soon. But nothing much has changed for the better. Residents of urban pockets such as Mahalakshmi Nagar say some civic improvement works were taken up. But they are very little and not uniform throughout the segment. Some areas in a few wards are lucky enough to get drinking water and drainage facilities, but a majority of the places are left out. People across the constituency demand better roads that are well-illuminated at night. “The Moondrumavadi-Iyer Bungalow double road has made commuting easy. But, come night, the whole road is pitch dark. In the absence of street lights, it is dangerous to take the road at night, and it is also accident-prone,” says A. Rama Subbiah, a resident. Bad roads and poor drainage facilities are issues that need to be looked into immediately in the interior areas, the residents say. Taking up patch work on potholed roads will not be a lasting solution. Most of the interior roads in the extension areas must be relaid, they say. R. Jayaprakash of Kannanendal says lack of proper inlets/outlets to the channels leads to water stagnation. The Public Works Department should have looked into the issue, but it has not. Dumping of garbage and setting them afire, crematorium in a residential area and uncared for waterbodies are the key issues in Othakadai, says a resident, A. Joseph Jerry. Othakadai lies on the busy Madurai-Melur road, the main link from the city to the Chennai highway. Many residential areas have sprung up along the Tiruvadavur road. So it is also beset with congestion and other traffic-related issues, says autorickshaw driver S. Murugan. Sitting MLA P. Moorthy of the DMK says, “There is no denying that these are problems prevalent in the extension areas of Madurai East. But they will be addressed one by one, as in urban pockets.” Being an MLA from the Opposition party, it was difficult to bring development works. The focus will be on generating employment. “There is no government college here. I will push for one,” he says. IT corridor Contesting against him are former MP R. Gopalakrishnan of the AIADMK. He says he will try to turn Madurai East into an Information Technology hub. “The elevated road project on New Natham Road was undertaken with a view to linking it to an IT hub, as in Bengaluru. This project will bring in employment and development,” he says and adds that he would also address the issue of maintenance of waterbodies. Makkal Needhi Maiam has fielded I. Muthukrishnan and Naam Tamilar Katchi I. Latha.  The elevated road project on New Natham Road was undertaken with a view to linking it to an IT hub, as in Bengaluru R.

19 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||GCC’s COVID-19 work affected||Public health officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation have been drafted for election work, affecting the COVID-19 containment work and vaccination programme in the city. Of the 28,500 employees identified for election work in the 16 Assembly constituencies of Chennai district, 102 are sanitation inspectors and 52 are sanitation officers. Health inspectors, who are on contract for COVID-19 containment activities, have also been drafted for election work, according to sources. Sanitation inspectors said they had participated in election training in Chennai district and were not exempted from the election work even after the public health activities got affected by the announcement of the election. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash, however, said public health employees would be exempt from election duty. Senior officials said the Corporation would ask neighbouring district election officials to exempt sanitation inspectors and officers from election duty in the Assembly constituencies like Maduravoyal. The Chennai district election office, headed by Mr. Prakash, covers 16 constituencies in the old city limits. Election work in constituencies on the periphery is handled by officials of the neighbouring districts. According to data shared by public health officials, the number of COVID-19 cases getting reported in Chennai has been rising for the past one week, with nearly 400 cases getting reported on Wednesday. Lax follow-up A few people who contracted the disease told The Hindu that the follow-up by Corporation officials, which was done diligently earlier, had become less reliable and patchy now. “My wife and I tested positive five days ago. We had fever and related symptoms and got tested through a private lab. After the results came positive, we were expecting calls from the Corporation but did not receive any,” said a person from Velachery. This is in sharp contrast to the containment and contact-tracing work that was done last year during the peak of the epidemic, he pointed out. “We did teleconsultation with a doctor from a private hospital, who prescribed some medication and advised us to quarantine ourselves,” he said. Another person from Mandaveli, who tested positive in the beginning of March, shared a similar experience. “There has not been a single call from the Corporation. As I had mild symptoms, I quarantined myself at home for 14 days. I thought that someone would visit and paste a sticker outside my home as they used to do before. Now, I am not even sure if Corporation officials know that I have tested positive,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gccs-covid-19-work-affected/article34104660.ece
19 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Two ex-Mayors lock horns in Saidapet||The Saidapet Assembly constituency will feature a unique battle this election as two former Mayors AIADMK’s Saidai Duraiswamy and DMK’s Ma. Subramanian are in the fray. The former Chief Minister and DMK President M. Karunanidhi had contested and won from the Saidapet constituency twice. While residents appreciate the initiative on tree planting and better maintenance of storm-water drains, concerns regarding water supply and flooding persist. The area was among the worst hit during the Chennai floods of 2015. “Since storm-water drains seem to be cleared regularly, there is less water stagnation than before. But many streets face acute water shortage during summer and rely on supply through lorries,” said Vishnu Ram of West Saidapet. Stray cattle is another concern for the residents there. At Arasu Pannai First and Second Street, which houses several families of daily wage and contract labourers, both piped water and drainage facilities remain a dream. Their water supply begins through lorries even before summer and each household gets only four pots of water a day, said Lourdhe Mary, a resident. “While work began on laying a drainage system recently, it was abruptly stopped. We have just one public toilet here,” said S. Gunaseelan. Mr. Subramanian, MLA, says among his plans for the constituency, if elected again, are to ensure around 600 families in Thideer Nagar are given houses in the area instead of being relocated, modernisation of the Saidapet market, to bund strengthening along the Adyar river, and skill-based classes like tailoring for women from low-income families. Vexed problems Acknowledging the vexed issue of water shortage in the area, Mr. Subramanian said that so far, the residents were being supplied with water in tankers. “As the DMK manifesto states, we will work on supplying water through taps for all households if elected and focus on conservation and maintenance of water sources,” he said. Mr. Duraiswamy said there was a need to look beyond providing basic amenities and that focus was needed on four areas — employment, health, food and education. “Apart from Amma Unavagams, facilities where the poor can parcel and take food home and training programmes for competitive exams for students in the constituency will be looked at. I have always believed in being accessible and will start an MLA helpline where residents can submit their complaints through WhatsApp or calls,” he said. Also in the fray this year is Sneha Mohandoss, founder of Foodbank India, from Makkal Needhi Maiam. The young candidate said that in an area that houses people from across income groups, the concerns of the poor who reside along the Adyar have been ignored. “I have met and worked with many of these residents in the past and the lack of infrastructure for them needs immediate attention,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-ex-mayors-lock-horns-in-saidapet/article34104669.ece

19 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Only clusters of COVID-19 cases, no large-scale outbreaks: Health Secretary||There is clustering of COVID-19 cases and no large-scale outbreaks in Tamil Nadu, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said on Thursday. Shortly after inspecting the COVID-19 Care Centre (CCC), readied by the Greater Chennai Corporation at Athipattu, he said, “The cases are on an increasing trend in districts, such as Chennai, Coimbatore, Chengalpattu and Tiruvallur. Specifically, in some areas, we have cases among families. On Wednesday, there were clusters of cases in 56 families. We are seeing COVID-19 cases in groups. So, if there are three to four cases in each family, we will have nearly 200 cases. This is the challenge now, and in general, there is no large-scale outbreak.” E. Theranirajan, dean of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said the hospital was receiving patients in clusters. “For instance, there were seven residents of a hostel in Villivakkam who had tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. There are clusters of cases including in families.” To keep the clusters under control, micro containment areas are being set up where there are more than three positive cases in a residential locality. In micro containment areas, no one would be allowed to leave the area, the positive patients should be taken to the hospital and their contacts tested, Mr. Radhakrishnan said. “People need to be careful. If anybody has symptoms, they should get tested at a hospital,” he added. At the Athipattu CCC, each of the four blocks had nearly 1,000 beds. In total, there are 4,580 beds. “A total of 110 rooms were allotted for doctors and so there are 1,026 rooms in all. The Greater Chennai Corporation has put in place the required facilities, including geysers, reverse osmosis plants, 186 CCTV cameras and four control rooms,” he said.  Care centres in districts He added that the CCCs were being readied in every district to support the respective government medical college hospital. Despite the election-related work, routine COVID-19 awareness programmes are going on, he said. All Collectors were told not to reduce efforts to create awareness on preventive measures, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-clusters-no-large-scale-outbreaks/article34104206.ece
19 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. hospitals get ready for surge in COVID-19 cases||With the number of fresh COVID-19 infections steadily rising in the city, the government hospitals are in a state of preparedness. The infrastructure created was in place and the hospitals are gearing up to add more facilities and manpower in case of a surge. The major government medical college hospitals set up exclusive COVID-19 facilities last year. As the number of fresh cases started to decline, the hospitals resumed their regular activities such as elective surgeries and outpatient services since October 2020. In the last 10 days, the number of cases had been rising in Chennai. However, hospital authorities said the treatment facilities were intact. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Tower 3 continues to be an exclusive COVID-19 facility with three floors of 120 beds each. Of these, 40 to 50 beds were allotted for intensive care units. “We have four wings on each floor, two each for ICUs and two for patients in need of oxygen and high flow nasal cannula. The hospital’s COVID-19 bed strength is 1,618,” E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, said. On an average, the COVID-19 outpatient department received 150 to 160 patients a day while there were 184 in-patients — 111 who had tested positive for COVID-19 and 73 persons with suspected symptoms of COVID-19. “On an average, we are admitting 10 to 20 COVID-19 positive patients a day,” he said. Doctors and staff nurses were adequately posted. Well prepared The Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, has 258 in-patients. Of them, 178 were positive for COVID-19. “We are in a state of preparedness. We did not dismantle the infrastructure created for COVID-19. Already, 550 beds were allotted for COVID-19. We have 300 beds in place and will increase [their number] as and when required. We have COVID-19 facility in Tower 2, while two floors in Tower 3 are available. We activated our operation theatres and all other non-COVID activities. If needed, we might slowly de-escalate non-COVID activities,” R. Jayanthi, dean of the hospital, said. The vaccination was running simultaneously at four sites, covering 500 people a day, she said. She said that people should strictly follow COVID-19 norms such as masking, maintaining physical distancing and hand hygiene to prevent cases from rising while all those eligible should get vaccinated. P. Balaji, dean of Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, said the COVID-19 bed strength was 1,200. “The dedicated block continues to function with 600 beds now. We held meetings with our staff , including professors and nurses, on how to be ready if there was a surge in cases. We have an adequate stock of personal protective equipment,” he said. The hospital had 60 patients with COVID-19. At the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, dean P. Vasanthamani said the construction of a new block was under way. “We have 180 beds in a new block for COVID-19 patients. If needed, we are planning to step up the facility,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-hospitals-get-ready-for-surge-in-covid-19-cases/article34104671.ece
19 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Move to shift ChildLine to Ministry of Home Affairs draws flak||The proposal to shift Childline 1098, the national helpline for children, from the administrative control of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (WCD) to Ministry of Home Affairs, has drawn flak from child rights activists in Tamil Nadu. ChildLine 1098 is an initiative for rescuing and assisting children in distress. It is operated by the ChildLine India Foundation, which is a nodal agency of the Ministry of WCD. However, Union Minister Smriti Irani, on Monday, said that after this shift, police personnel, instead of social workers, would handle the calls made to 1098. The Union Minister said that the move was intended to make the State as the interface and to preserve data sensitivity. Following a report on this in The Hindu , Dharmapuri MP S. Senthil Kumar, also raised objections about the move in the Parliament. He said that children would have inhibitions speaking to the police and wanted the helpline to remain with Ministry of WCD. “If police handle the call, confidentiality will be at stake. Children and even adults are already wary of the police. They will not call and pass on the information,” said Girija Kumarbabu, child rights consultant. Ms. Kumarbabu added that the caller would be frightened if his/her identity would be revealed by the police to the suspects involved in the case. “This move is not in the best interests of children,” she added. Most often the information about children in distress is made by the child himself/herself or their friends. Though the officials claim that the move aims at preserving data sensitivity, child rights experts feel that there will be no transparency in data. “It is ideal to know where we stand as a nation in terms of child safety. For this data transparency is needed. If police are involved, the accurate data may be fudged,” said A. Devaneyan, a child rights activist from Thozhamai. He said there is a need to have public/private partnership in handling calls too. “Police are trained to maintain law and order. The conditioning of a policeman and a social worker is different. Social work is a practice based profession and is a core part in curing societal illnesses. This cannot be learnt through crash courses,” he added. Reacting to the claim by officials from the Ministry of WCD that they would build an ecosystem such that after a complaint was registered, the call could be handled by NGOs, he said that handling the callers should be done sensitively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/proposal-to-bring-childline-under-ministry-of-home-affairs-draws-flak/article34104674.ece
19 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC sets free man sentenced to death for rape||The Madras High Court on Thursday set aside the conviction and death sentence imposed on a youngster for having allegedly raped and murdered a 13-year-old girl. The court ordered that L. Ashok Kumar, who was 22-years old, at the time of occurrence of the crime within Thiruporur police station limits (now in Chengalpattu district) in 2017, should be released forthwith unless his presence was required in connection with some other case. Justices P.N. Prakash and V. Sivagnanam were saddened to note that the police had done a shabby investigation in a serious case booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act of 2012. The prosecution had also concealed important material evidence before the trial court. Therefore, they directed the State government to inquire into the lapses in the investigation and initiate suitable action against the negligent persons. Rs. 5 lakh compensation The judges also directed the government to pay a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh to the victim’s family as reparation not only for the failure to protect the child but also for failing to bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice. Sending a note of advice to the prosecutors, the judges said they must not turn out to be persecutors and attempt to grab a conviction through suppression of material facts which may tilt the balance in favour of the accused. Authoring the verdict, Justice Prakash pointed out that the entire prosecution case was based on circumstantial evidence. The mother, elder brother and elder sister of the victim had reportedly seen the appellant run from their house in a suspicious manner at about 7:30 p.m. on July 23, 2017. Later, the trio went into the house and were shocked to find the victim dead on the floor with her dress disheveled around a pool of blood. Later, the police visited the spot, took the blood found near the private parts of the victim in a cotton swab and sent it for DNA profiling. Shockingly, the report revealed that the blood was that of a different male and not that of the appellant. Hence, they buried the report during trial and did not mark it as a piece of evidence. The defence counsel too failed to note this and bring it to the knowledge of the Chengalpattu Mahila Court. Further, they also took note that there were several injuries on the body of the appellant when he was produced before a Judicial Magistrate for being remanded to judicial custody, but the police had claimed that he sustained those injuries because of a fall when he attempted to flee. They also found several other infirmities in the prosecution case and commended Additional Public Prosecutor K. Prabakar for conducting the case fairly before the High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-sets-free-man-sentenced-to-death-for-rape-and-murder/article34104812.ece
19 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK never fulfilled its promises, says Stalin||Accusing Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami of copying the DMK’s manifesto, its president M.K. Stalin on Thursday said people would know whether those promises would be fulfilled [by the AIADMK] or not. Campaigning for DMK candidate T.G. Govindarajan in Gummidipoondi and Sriperumbudur Congress candidate Durai Chandrasekar, he alleged that the AIADMK failed to fulfil the promises made in the 2011 and the 2016 Assembly polls. “The AIADMK promised mobile phones for everyone. Has anyone received it? It promised that monthly cable TV tariff would be reduced to Rs. 70. Has it been done? What happened to the promise of mono-rail in Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore?” he asked. Recalling the AIADMK’s promise in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll that NEET would not be allowed in Tamil Nadu, he said the ruling party was not even clear about the status of the resolution adopted in the Assembly against NEET. “The AIADMK government is not ready to question the Centre. It remains subservient to the BJP government and running a slave government in Tamil Nadu,” he alleged. Mr.Stalin said earlier he had predicted victory for the DMK alliance in 200 seats, but he was now confident that it would win in all the 234 seats. Later, campaigning at Pudukottai, he accused Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam of “betraying” their leader and former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa by giving a green signal to projects and policies that she did not approve of. He listed out the promises to be implemented for Pudukottai district once the DMK was voted to power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-never-fulfilled-its-promises-says-stalin/article34104248.ece

Stalin, alleging that he has let election strategist Prashant Kishor to manage the affairs of the Dravidian party. “After a long time, a farmer has become a Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu (referring to Edappadi Palaniswami). His government has to continue for sure. Mr. Palaniswami has been delivering good governance for farmers, workers and also there is safety for women,” he said launching his campaign from Gummidipoondi for PMK’s candidate M. Prakash. ‘Simple, accessibe’ “You have to think more about who should not come to power. On the one side there is Palaniswami. On the other side, there is Stalin who is desperate to come to power. Palaniswami comes from an agriculture background and has come up through hard work. He is very simple and accessible. While Stalin is not accessible,”the PMK leader claimed. “Only those who know administration should become Chief Minister. Stalin does not know how to run his party and has roped in Prashant Kishor. How will he rule Tamil Nadu?,” Dr Anbumani Ramadoss asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmer-palaniswamis-govt-must-continue-says-anbumani-ramadoss/article34104201.ece

Dhinakaran said on Thursday. “The people want a genuine Amma [Jayalalithaa] government to be formed. This can be fulfilled only by the AMMK-led front, which represents the alternative force”, Mr Dhinakaran claimed, launching his campaign in the southern part of the city and canvassing votes for his party’s candidate for Velachery constituency, M. Chandrabose. Repeatedly invoking the slogan of “change” in his speech that lasted about 13 minutes, the AMMK leader said that the DMK was “daydreaming” about capturing power in the State as it was dependent upon arithmetic strength of the coalition led by it. But, several of the party’s allies were “very weak,” he contended. The ruling party, which was reliant on “money bags,” was under the notion that the people would “forget its mistakes,” Mr. Dhinakaran alleged, adding that the present government was not a “genuine Amma government” and it could last four years because of its “collusion” with the DMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ammk-led-front-represents-alternative-force-dhinakaran/article34104173.ece

On the sidelines of a conference here on Thursday to explain the salient features of the approval handbook of 2021-22, Anil D. Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the All India Council for Technical Education, told media persons that standard tests similar to SAT and GRE which assess students for higher education abroad may be used to evaluate candidates opting for various programmes, including professional and liberal arts courses. The way forward is to test the aptitude of candidates for a course and not proficiency in a subject, he said. The National Testing Agency (NTA) that developed testing pattens for NEET and JEE is “gradually expanding” its ambit, he said. Core knowledge “In our country we have to slowly move ahead and start testing aptitude for core knowledge — be it for engineering, pharmacy, arts. Such a person will outperform,” he said. Though NTA had no such test yet, it could use globally-available standard tests for assessment, Mr. Sahasrabudhe added. The AICTE had introduced 14 courses to provide students a choice, he explained. Mr. Sahasrabudhe said the changes were introduced keeping in mind the National Education Policy that would be implemented shortly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aptitude-tests-may-be-the-way-forward/article34104336.ece

Justices P.N. Prakash and V. Sivagnanam, however, ordered that the convict J. Yasar Arafat must undergo imprisonment for a minimum period of 25 years without any remission since he had committed a crime against a defenceless woman, who was of the age of his mother, just to rob her of the gold ornaments. The judges pointed out that the convict was 22-years-old when he murdered the woman on February 13, 2013. Differing with the view taken by the trial court that it was a rarest of rare cases warranting imposition of death penalty, the Division Bench said: “This is yet another run-of-the-mill case of murder for gain and nothing more or nothing less… It is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant went about sadistically dismembering a living person. The post-mortem certificates clearly show that Saroja’s death had occurred due to strangulation of her neck and all the other injuries have been found to be post-mortem and not ante-mortem ones.” Further, pointing out that there was no other material to show that the appellant had an intrinsic criminal propensity and would be a menace to society, the judges said they were unable to persuade themselves to confirm the death sentence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-commutes-death-sentence-in-murder-case/article34104224.ece

19 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||SIMA seeks removal of duties on cotton, VSF||The Southern India Mills’ Association has appealed to the Central Government to immediately remove the 10% import duty on cotton and anti-dumping duty on Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF). Ashwin Chandran, chairman of the association, said in a press release viscose fibre imports attract 0.103 $ to $ 0.512 a kg anti-dumping duty. The recent budget introduced 10% import duty on cotton. Supply chain “This has greatly impacted the supply chain of both domestic and international markets and also spiralled domestic Indian ELS, organic and contamination free cotton prices that are already under acute shortage,” he said. Mr. Chandran said that both the high value added market segments account around Rs. 1.5 lakh crore business size and employ over two million people. The value chain of VSF and superfine cotton cater to international brands that have retail presence in the domestic market too. The capacity utilisation of the spinning and powerloom clusters in Erode alone has been affected to the tune of 30%. Import threat The price crisis is used as an opportunity by neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. And, the threat of imports looms large. The industry is facing acute shortage of VSF fibre and there is no question of dumping and causing injury to the domestic market. For cotton, India is mainly dependent on the American PIMA and Egyptian GIZA and other ELS cotton for the domestic and international markets apart from the home grown DCH cotton. The textile industry has been mixing the imported cotton with the indigenous cotton, as the availability of Indian cotton is not even 20%. Mr. Chandran pointed out that the DCH cotton was costing around Rs. 52,000 a candy of 355 kg in October last year and Rs. 65,000 in January 2021. It increased to Rs. 73,000 after the levy of 10% duty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sima-seeks-removal-of-duties-on-cotton-vsf/article34104222.ece

The arrested were junior engineer K. Rajendran and line inspector D. Venkatachalam alias Elango. According to DVAC sources, B. Kanagaraj from Annur had applied for service connection for the farmland in the name of his wife by remitting a one-time payment of Rs. 2.75 lakh a few weeks ago. However, the service connection was not allotted while those who had applied after Mr. Kanagaraj were given similar connections. When enquired, Rajendran demanded a bribe of Rs. 15,000 and asked Mr. Kanagaraj to hand over the money to Venkatachalam. A case was registered following a complaint filed by Mr. Kanagaraj with the DVAC. He was given chemically treated currencies valued Rs. 15,000 which he later handed over to Venkatachalam at Vadakkalur office. The DVAC team, who were waiting outside, rushed to the office and caught Venkatachalam red-handed. Rajendran, who was at Annur office, was called to Vadakkalur after Venkatachalam told the officers that the bribe was accepted on the instructions of the senior officer.

19 March 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Over 3,000 textile shops down shutters in Erode||Urging the Central and the State governments to take steps to control the price of yarn that has gone up by over 30% in the past few months, members of Erode Cloth Merchants Associations downed shutters for a day here on Thursday. Shops are located at Kongalamman Kovil Street, Eswaran Kovil Street and market areas in the city in which 95% of the textile products are sold across the country while the rest is exported to a few nations. Its president K. Kalaiselvan said that yarn price is increasing frequently affecting their business severely. “The price of yarn is on the upward trend for many months now as we are unable to sell our products”, he said. Over 3,000 shops in the city were closed on Thursday resulting in loss of business transactions to the tune of Rs. 50 crore and affecting over 40,000 daily earners and workers, including loadmen and vehicle drivers. Mr. Kalaiselvan wanted both the governments to intervene and regulate the yarn price and also fix the price once or twice in a month. “We cannot take orders from customers as the yarn price keeps changing everyday”, he said. Since textile shops were closed, the usually busy streets where the shops were located wore a deserted look for the day. Business was also affected in tea shops and eateries while loadmen also lost their livelihood for the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-3000-textile-shops-down-shutters-in-erode/article34104226.ece

The tour has been organised through Sri Shakthi Space Mission Quiz of Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore. S. Sivaranjani took part in an online quiz organised by the institute and secured a position among many others from across the country. She was ranked fifth among the 100 chosen to take part in the study tour. She was able to answer the questions in the quiz due to setting up of a space club in her school. Science teacher P. Dhanapal created the club to train the students for the quiz. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Dhanapal said he taught physics, chemistry, mathematics and space technology to 30 students who volunteered for the club. “The entire course was conducted online and instructions on how to take part in the quiz was given.” In the preliminary examination, 15,000 students across south India took part, while in the final round, they were short-listed to 250.

19 March 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||Vote to AIADMK is vote to BJP, warns Udhayanidhi||“Every vote to the AIADMK is a vote to the BJP; it is a vote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” DMK youth wing leader Udhayanidhi Stalin warned the public while campaigning for Congress nominee for Uthangarai Assembly constituency S. Arumugham on Thursday. Also campaigning for DMK candidate D. Mathiazhagan for Bargur constituency, he alleged that the AIADMK was a slave to the BJP, and that it would be run by the latter. He urged the public to remember the misery caused by demonetisation. “Do not forget the long queues in front of ATMs and lives lost waiting in queues.” On the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Centre’s dues to the State, Mr. Udhayanidhi said the BJP Government owed Tamil Nadu Rs. 15,000 crore towards GST reimbursement, but it claimed lack of funds. “Mr. Modi has money to construct a new Parliament building at Rs. 20,000 crore, but no money for flood relief,” he added. On the hike in LPG prices and NEET for medical seats entrance, Mr. Udhayanidhi said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami would have understood people’s pain only if had become the Chief Minister with people’s votes. On the proposal to introduce entrance exams for nursing courses, he said it was an attack on the poor’s access to education. Mr. Udhayanidhi rejected the AIADMK’s claim that the State ranked high in the safety index for women by referring to three incidents: the Pollachi sexual assault case that involved an AIADMK functionary, the alleged sexual harassment of a senior woman police officer by special DGP Rajesh Das, and the persisting ‘mystery’ in the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa “This was the government that shot dead Sterlite protesters in broad daylight. It is time to send this government home,” Mr. Udhayanidhi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vote-to-aiadmk-is-vote-to-bjp-warns-udhayanidhi/article34104230.ece

I have not amassed wealth or taken ill-gotten money home. Being with our founder and general secretary Vaiko, I have learnt to be loyal to the people and helped the needy whenever they approached him.” Recalling how he lost in 2011 in the election by a meagre 52 votes, Mr. Boominathan said he expected to win comfortably this time as the people were tired of corruption and malpractice in the AIADMK rule.

Mr. Boominathan said he was well aware of issues faced by residents of his constituency since he was one among them. Earlier, DMK functionaries Pon Muthuramalingam and Velusamy, Karthikeyan of the Congress and Pandiammal of Viduthalai Chiruthai Katchi spoke.

19 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Justice hurried is justice buried, says HC||Justice delayed is justice denied. Also, justice hurried is justice buried, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed on Thursday while ordering the Additional District and Sessions Judge I, Madurai, to conduct the trial in the case of custodial deaths of traders P. Jayaraj and J. Benicks in Sattankulam and dispose of it in six months. Justice K. Murali Shankar observed that speedy trial was one of the basic objectives of the criminal justice delivery system and the Supreme Court in catena of judgments elaborated on the importance of speedy trial in not only safeguarding the rights of the accused, but also of the victims. Generally, a trial would only mean a fair trial and similarly a speedy trial would only mean a speedy fair trial. The basic norms which ensure justice could not be overlooked in achieving the goal of speedy justice and one had to balance the consideration of speed and justice, the judge said. A direction given for a speedy trial, however, did not mean that the trial had to be conducted at lightning speed by throwing the fundamentals of criminal jurisprudence to the wind. The trial judge was required to ensure that all the rights given under the Code of Criminal Procedure to both the accused and the prosecution were protected and safeguarded and all the opportunities available under the code were afforded to both the parties during the trial, the judge said. Taking note of the fact that the case was a sensitive one, the judge observed that the trial court should be cautious with the parallel trial conducted by the media. The trial court was duty-bound to decide the case uninfluenced by the opinion of others, the judge said. The court was hearing the petition filed by Selvarani, wife of P. Jayaraj and mother of J. Benicks. She sought a direction to the trial court to conduct trial in the case in an expeditious manner as she apprehended that the accused police personnel could influence witnesses and tamper with evidence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/justice-hurried-is-justice-buried-says-hc/article34104954.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||Sterlite case listed for hearing on August 17||The Supreme Court on Thursday listed the hearing of an appeal filed by Vedanta Ltd. against the Madras High Court’s refusal to re-open the Sterlite Copper smelting plant at Thoothukudi on August 17. Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, the lead judge on the Bench, retires on August 12. The date for the next hearing was fixed in an oral mentioning made before the Bench. The court had earlier refused a plea by Vedanta to stay the High Court verdict of last year. The plant was closed in May 2018 following an order by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. Protests against the plant saw 13 people die in police firing. Vedanta had argued that the High Court decision to keep the plant closed was a “retrograde step”. Instead of being self-sufficient in copper, a situation had been created due to which India now imported $2 billion worth copper from China. On December 2 last year, the Supreme Court declined a proposal by Vedanta to operate the plant for 30 days under the supervision of an expert committee appointed by the court. The company had mooted the idea so that the court could ascertain whether the plant was complying with pollution norms. Vedanta had said its plant met 36% need for copper in the country and it was not in public interest to keep it closed. Tamil Nadu government had argued that the proposal was only a “ruse to open” a plant which had been polluting the area for over 20 years. Slag was dumped at 11 places in Thoothukudi. Senior advocate for Vedanta A.M. Singhvi had said the plant, established in 1995, was upgraded periodically with the best available technologies. Its overall asset value was Rs. 3,630 crore. The factory employed 4,000 people directly and another 20,000 indirectly. The closure of the plant had affected the lives of two lakh dependents. Senior advocate for the local residents Colin Gonsalves had termed the plant as a “persistent polluter and a chronic defaulter”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sterlite-case-listed-for-hearing-on-august-17/article34104675.ece
19 March 2021||Puducherry,TAMIL NADU||‘A personal decision based on various factors’||Former Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, in an interview with The Hindu, says his decision not to contest in the April 6 Assembly election was a personal one and taken in consultation with the Congress leadership. Edited excerpts:  You led the Congress government in Puducherry when your party had plunged into a crisis, with Ministers and legislators quitting. But now you are not contesting in the election. Won’t this impact your party’s prospects? From the time the Congress came to power in 2016, the Central government had tried to create hurdles to the functioning of the government by stalling funds for welfare and development works. The previous Lt. Governor [Kiran Bedi] adopted a confrontational approach by interfering in the day-to-day administration. At the fag end of my tenure, a few [BJP] leaders from Delhi and Bengaluru landed in Puducherry and toppled the government. They succeeded by murdering democracy and using nominated legislators appointed by the Centre. People are aware of these things. It is the Pradesh Congress Committee [PCC] that is contesting in the election. The fact that I’m not contesting will not have any impact on the election. Even the National Democratic Alliance [NDA] has not announced its chief ministerial candidate. Was it the party’s decision or your personal decision not to contest? It was my personal decision taken in consultation with the [party] high command and other leaders. The decision was based on various factors. It is absolutely necessary that we carry on with the election management. It was a collective decision. My service will be required in all the constituencies and I will be doing the campaign along with Lok Sabha member V. Vaithilingam as a team. We will campaign for the victory of the alliance. Our objective is to stop the BJP from coming to power. The Opposition’s allegation is that during your tenure, you behaved more as a spokesperson of the Congress rather than as a Chief Minister. Your power struggle with Ms. Bedi and the open criticism of the Centre had hampered governance. Your comments? During my tenure as the Chief Minister, I had the dual responsibility of defending my government and my party, as the head of the government and as a Congress worker. It was my duty to criticise the Centre if its polices were not acceptable to the people or government servants. I had to oppose its policies as West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee does. An example of this would be the privatisation of the Puducherry Electricity Department by the Centre, which was opposed by our employees. I had to take a stand and I stood with the employees. Personally, I had very good regard for Ms. Bedi. But as the Lt. Governor, she was undemocratic and autocratic. The Centre was fully supporting her and ignoring the elected government. Therefore, I had no other option but to oppose her and the Centre’s negative attitude to the elected government. Our government was able to implement various projects with great difficulty. How do you assess the functioning of Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan? Some of the decisions taken by Ms. Soundararajan proved that our fight with Ms. Bedi was genuine and right. We were fighting with Ms. Bedi for the clearance of Cabinet decisions and welfare schemes. The Lt. Governor recently cleared the financial assistance for SC students, the pending salaries of government-aided school teachers and the midday meal scheme. I will appreciate Ms. Soundararajan if she clears all the other pending welfare schemes. You were personally involved in the seat-sharing talks with the DMK. Many of your party functionaries are unhappy that you have surrendered more seats to the Dravidian party, though their strike rate in the last Assembly election was less than the Congress’s... It is a fact that I took part in the seat-sharing talks. With the DMK bargaining very hard, we were left with no alternative. It was a hard decision taken by the Congress leadership. We know our workers are unhappy. They are not willing to canvas votes for the DMK, but we will convince them because the victory of the alliance is a necessity for the Union Territory. But the Congress is the major partner in the alliance. The BJP was almost a non-entity in the Union Territory till recently. The party has suddenly become a contender. Why do you think the BJP is so serious in capturing Puducherry? They want to expand the presence of their party by engineering defections in other parties and enrolling those people in the BJP by using the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate [as tools for intimidating opponents]. They want to come to power with the help of these agencies. There have been voices within the Congress that want an organisational overhaul. Many leaders have backed or criticised the move by joining the group of 23 dissenters (G-23). You have refrained from making any comments. Would you like to clarify now? People never revolted against the leadership. What they did was vent their grievances, which is quite natural in every political party. Yes, of course, there is a demand for organisational restructuring and it is being done.  Some of the decisions taken by Ms. Soundararajan proved that our fight with Ms. Bedi was genuine and right||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-personal-decision-based-on-various-factors/article34104190.ece

One more death was recorded in Karaikal, taking the toll to 674. Puducherry accounted for 62 new cases, Karaikal 12 and Mahe seven. No new infections were reported from Yanam. The new infections were detected from testing of 1,353 swab samples. A 69-year-old woman died at the General Hospital in Karaikal after developing COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. With this, the total deaths in Karaikal rose to 70. The toll in Puducherry stood at 549, Yanam 45 and Mahe 10. The number of active cases jumped to 276, which included 125 hospital admissions and 151 patients in home isolation. S. Mohan Kumar, Director of Health, urged the public to continue maintaining safety protocols, including mask-wearing, washing of hands and social distancing, amid reports of a second wave of infections worldwide, and in several States such as Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. “The threat of COVID-19 is far from gone even while the country has initiated a mass vaccination programme. Any complacency will undo all the exacting efforts that went into keeping the first wave of infections under control,” Dr. Mohan Kumar said. Moreover, the mutant strain has been reported to be more severe in intensity, he pointed out. He also advised target sections of the population to volunteer for vaccination and not be misguided by false reports about safety. The cumulative tally in the Union Territory rose to 40,201 and the total patients recovered to 39,251. The test positivity rate was 5.9%, case fatality rate 1.68% and recovery rate 97.80%.

19 March 2021||PUDUKOTTAI,TAMIL NADU||Chief Minister, Deputy CM betrayed Jayalalithaa, alleges Stalin||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday accused Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam of “betraying” their leader and former Chief Minister late Jayalalithaa by giving green signal to projects and policies that she did not approve of. Campaigning in support of candidates of DMK and its allies contesting from the six Assembly segments in the district, Mr. Stalin said as long as Ms. Jayalalithaa was alive she was against the Goods and Services Act, UDAY Scheme, Food Safety Act and NEET. However, after the demise of Ms. Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK government gave the green signal to all these, thereby “betraying” their leader, Mr. Stalin said. Alleging that Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Paneerselvam were “slaves” to BJP, Mr. Stalin said the AIADMK government supported the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, Triple Talaq Bill and the new farm laws. Urging voters to defeat the AIADMK and BJP, Mr. Stalin appealed to them to ensure the victory of the DMK in all 234 Assembly seats in the coming election.

19 March 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||Green corridor project the key factor||The ruling alliance’s stern decision to go ahead with the Salem-Chennai green corridor project will be one of the key factors that will affect the results in the Yercaud Assembly constituency. The reserve constituency (ST) has seen three elections between 2011 and 2021 including a by-election in 2013 and candidates of AIADMK won from the constituency. Besides the hill station, the constituency also includes areas like Vazhapadi and Pethanaikenpalayam where agriculture and brick kilns are major industries. The Salem-Chennai green corridor project faces stiff opposition from the region. Approximately 15 km of the corridor passes through the constituency and landowners here are firm that they will never part away their lands for the project. Farmers and landowners, who will be affected by the project, have passed resolutions against the BJP and AIADMK. S. Narayanan, one of the opposing farmers, said the farmers were hurt due to the government’s action. The farmers in the region have demanded that the government should offer free seeds and other input elements for agriculture. Flowers like Oleander and jasmine are grown in the region and florists have been demanding a scent manufacturing unit. Tapioca and millets are also grown here. The farmers demanded a cold storage facility to stock vegetables so that they could get better prices and manufacture value-added products to improve their income. Tourism in the hill station was severely affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. The public have been demanding measures to improve tourism in Yercaud. People living in a few hamlets here, especially those within the plantations near Killiyur waterfalls, have been seeking road connectivity for long. Residents have also demanded development of Salem-Aroor road, one of the important roads connecting districts like Chennai, Tiruvanamalai, Vellore and Kanchipuram. The DMK has fielded C. Tamizhselvan who won in 2006-2011, but lost in 2011 and 2016 to the AIADMK candidates. The AIADMK has fielded incumbent G. Chitra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/green-corridor-project-the-key-factor/article34104242.ece

19 March 2021||SIVAGANGA,TAMIL NADU||DMK to ‘expedite’ probe into death of Jayalalithaa||The DMK president M K Stalin said that he would expedite submission of the report of the Justice Arumughasamy Commission probing the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and bring out the ‘truth.’ Speaking at an election rally here at Tirupattur Assembly constituency on Thursday in support of DMK and alliance candidate including K. R. Periakaruppan, Tamilarasi (DMK), Maangudi (Congress) and Gunasekaran (CPI), he said that though the DMK had differences of opinion with the AIADMK and its leader Ms. Jayalalithaa, the DMK had condoled her death and expressed its grief with the party functionaries and the cadre when former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa died. The AIADMK government had established the one-man commission to probe into the death of their late leader. However, the leaders including Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam had conveniently blamed the DMK (Karunanidhi and Stalin) as responsible for the death. The commission had summoned Mr. Panneerselvam and for reasons known only to him (OPS), he had evaded appearance. So, Mr Palaniswami should speak in a responsible manner and not mislead the people for the sake of levelling charges. Posing a few questions to the gathering on the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities now and in the DMK regime, Mr Stalin said that the AIADMK government had done nothing to reduce the price. All of Mr Palaniswamy’s announcements were done to woo the voters after the election dates were announced. The DMK president said that the DMK will prioritise issues such as public grievances redressal, jobs for the deserving people, reservation for womenfolk and would bring down the prices of essential items. In an emotional appeal, he said that as the son of (Kalaignar) Karunanidhi, who had ruled the State for five times, ‘I expect your support this time’ and reminded the electorate to cast their votes without fail on April 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-to-expedite-probe-into-death-of-jayalalithaa/article34104811.ece

19 March 2021||Srivilliputtur,TAMIL NADU||New faces face the battle here||Srivilliputtur constituency comprises Srivilliputtur town and panchayat unions of Srivilliputtur and Watrap. Besides, it has got few town panchayats like Watrap, Mamsapuram, Sundarapandiam, S. Kodikulam and W. Pudupatti. Agriculture, weaving and milk sweet (paalgova) production are major occupation in the constituency. Creation of a new taluk with Watrap as headquarters and bringing a Government Arts and Science College to the town in the fag end of its term are the major achievements of the AIADMK government. Other achievements of the sitting MLA, M. Chandraprabha, of the ruling party are creating a new Road Transport Office and a new depot for TNSTC. Daily water supply is still a distant dream as it is supplied only once a week. The demand to renovate Andal Temple tank has been a non-starter, says Naam Tamilar Katchi candidate B. Abinaya (27). Both the Dravidian parties have been promising to execute Azhagaranai water scheme. “But it still remains a promise. I will strive to implement the scheme to fulfil the drinking water needs,” she said. Similarly, the bus stand in the town is in a highly congested area. Even the Madurai-Kochi highway runs through the East Car Street of the town. A by-pass road promised for years was yet to fructify. Stating that she was pained to see the Cooperative Spinning Mill, where her grandfather had worked, to remain closed for more than two decades, Ms. Abinaya vouches to revive it. R. Tamaraikani had held this seat for five times – four times on AIADMK ticket and once as an Independent. Though Ms. Chandraprabha has remained non-controversial and had done her bit for the development of the constituency, the denial of seat for the sitting MLA has been a shock for her supporters. The party ticket has gone to E.M. Manraj, son of a couple who had long association with the AIADMK. Mr. Chandraprabha’s supporters were further wounded after the party started ignoring her in election works. Meanwhile, the seat has gone to Congress party on behalf of the Secular Progressive Alliance. The national party had last won from here in 1962. It has fielded a new face, P.S.W. Madhava Rao, a native of Watrap, who has his business in Chennai. The Communist Party of India, which has a good base, has won from here twice in 2006 and 2011. The party is disappointed over not getting this seat. While the strength of Secular Progressive Alliance looks good on paper, the outcome of the polls will depend on how well Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (S. Sangeetha Priya), Puthiya Tamilagam (Santhi), Makkal Needhi Maiam (K. Guruviah) and NTK reach out to the voters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-faces-face-the-battle-here/article34104211.ece

19 March 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||At IIM-T, a place to read, work and have fun||In the era of digital disruption, there is much more to library than just gathering bookish knowledge; it is a place not just to read, but also work, live and have fun, just like home.

For school and college students stepping into the LRC, the ambience would be homely, lively, purposeful, and memorable... all at once. “It is a place to learn, unlearn and re-learn. As the 21st century progresses librarians are facilitating to connect communities and users with knowledge and knowledge creators. It is where students need to develop an emotional connect,” he said. There is a wide range of learning spaces waiting to trigger the 'feel good' factor and the longing to remain there for hours at a stretch. 'Brain bubbles' are where students debate about their learnings in small cabins through digital presentations for mutual intellectual progress. Semi-cubic ‘Silent Rooms’ are designed for those who need to concentrate on work. The Young Learners Centre at the Learning Resource Centre of Indian Institute of Management - Tiruchi is replete with a variety of books meant for children of school-going age. There is also a Meditation Corner to develop concentration, emotional positivity, and a calm observation of the true nature of things, the Chief Knowledge Officer said. The other features include cafe for refreshments, relaxation zone to sleep/relax, and Language Lab to learn new languages.

19 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||‘Delay’ in distribution of poll duty order||Former MLA and DMK’s candidate for Radhapuram Assembly constituency M. Appavu has complained that more than 50% of the polling personnel could not apply for ‘postal ballot facility’ as distribution of formal ‘election duty order’ was deliberately delayed. Speaking to reporters after submitting the petition to Collector and District Election Officer V. Vishnu on Thursday, he said around 2,000 polling personnel including teachers from government and government-aided schools had been involved in the poll work in the Radhapuram constituency and sessions were held to train them to ensure hassle-free polling on April 6. However, formal ‘poll duty order’ had been given to only 50% of these personnel while others had been asked to report for training sessions through WhatsApp messages. “The polling personnel can apply for postal ballot facility for them only after attaching the copy of the ‘poll duty order’. Since 50% of the polling personnel have not been given the formal order, they cannot apply for the postal voting facility. They have been forced to apply for the same without the copy of the order, which will certainly lead to rejection of their application. I suspect that it is being done to prevent teachers from casting their votes in the Assembly polls. The Election Commission should inquire this serious issue and take immediate steps for giving the order to the polling personnel without further delay so that they can apply for the postal ballot facility,” he said. Receiving the petition, Mr. Vishnu assured that he would look into the complaint immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delay-in-distribution-of-poll-duty-order/article34104216.ece

19 March 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Coonoor to witness a close contest||The constituency of Coonoor is set to witness a close battle between former DMK Minister K. Ramachandran and AIADMK’s Nilgiris district secretary Kappachi D. Vinoth. Mr. Ramachandran who successfully contested the seat in 2011 is being fielded against Mr. Vinoth after the DMK lost the last election in 2016 narrowly to the AIADMK’s A. Ramu by a difference of less than 4,000 votes. With the thinking being that the loss in 2016 was influenced by their choice of candidate, a non-Badaga, the party has opted for Mr. Ramachandran. Most residents in the constituency are dependent on farming and find work as estate or plantation labourers. Aside from a lack of employment opportunities, voters have called attention to the need for upgrading the town’s ageing infrastructure, primarily the Coonoor bus stand and the government hospital. S. Manogaran, a Coonoor-based activist and president of the Coonoor Consumer Protection Association, said that the need to upgrade the bus stand and the hospital is a long-standing demand for the town’s residents. “Both facilities simply do not have the required infrastructure, nor have they been modernised to support the number of people that use the services,” he said. Lack of water, especially during the summer season, is another major issue for Coonoor residents, most of whom have to purchase water from private water suppliers during peak tourist season. “The town is still dependent on the Ralliah Dam for its drinking water supply. The water from this dam alone is inadequate to meet the requirement of the entire town,” said R. Ramesh, another resident. While drinking water is a concern, the town’s perpetual problem of dealing with its sewerage is not just for the Nilgiris but for surrounding districts of Coimbatore and Erode. “As the sewerage from the town, as well as agricultural run-off is released directly into the Coonoor River, it is polluting the Bhavani River downstream. In the next decade, the problem is only going to become worse, and there needs to be a water treatment facility set up for the town,” said an ecologist from Coonoor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coonoor-to-witness-a-close-contest/article34104688.ece
19 March 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Conservationists flay move to capture elephant||With forest department officials confirming that they are attempting to once again capture a wild elephant accustomed to living in close proximity to humans in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), activists and conservationists have questioned the rationale behind the move, citing a claim from local experts that the animal poses no significant threat to humans in the region. On Sunday, forest department officials confirmed that they were in the “advanced stages” of getting the approval of setting up a kraal (elephant shelter used to tame captive elephants) in Vazhaithottam in the buffer zone. “We had earlier tried to lure Rivaldo into the Theppakadu Elephant Camp by providing him with food. However, he managed to escape and the option of capturing him by using kumkis and tranquilisers is very risky,” said a top forest department official. Now, the plan was to tame Rivaldo in Vazhaithottam. “We plan to set up the kraal there itself as that is his main habitat,” said the official. However, the renewed efforts of the forest department to capture Rivaldo has been met with stiff resistance from conservationists, who assert that it poses no risk to humans. The forest department wants to capture the elephant, citing the death of another elephant in the region, which died after owners of an illegal resort threw a burning object at it. However, this is no reason to capture a wild elephant that has no antecedents of problematic interactions with humans, said a conservationist from the Nilgiris. In their 2016 paper, titled “Can a Wild Asian Elephant Change Its Interaction Patterns With Humans,” published in Gajah , authors Jean-Philippe Puyravaud, Shanti Puyravaud and Priya Davidar, who have had interactions with the elephant for the last 15-years, argue that Rivaldo can be weaned from interacting with humans if concerted efforts are taken by the forest department to stop locals from feeding it. Between 2013 and 2015, the researchers recorded the elephant’s visit to the area. Their findings point to the visits becoming shorter in 2015 due to people ceasing to feed the animal. “The trend we report here needs to be validated with further studies,” they note. The authors also point out that following an injury to his trunk, Rivaldo was fed with fruits and medication by the forest department. After the feeding stopped and the injury healed, the animal almost stopped venturing into human habitations in search of food. “However, weak implementation of the ban on feeding wildlife, and motives such as profit, superstition and sensationalism has resulted in continuous feeding, encouraging Rivaldo and some of his companions to venture into village interiors,” they note.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/conservationists-flay-move-to-capture-elephant/article34104221.ece

19 March 2021||VEDARANYAM,TAMIL NADU||DMK chief ‘repeatedly lying’ on NEET issue, says Palaniswami||Accusing DMK president M.K.Stalin of “repeatedly lying” on the NEET issue, AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Thursday that the people were well aware of the Opposition leader’s “duplicity.” The DMK, as an alliance partner, chose to go along when the Congress government introduced NEET in 2010, to safeguard its position (in the then Union government). Later, it was advocate Nalini, spouse of senior Congress leader Chidambaram, who argued the case in Supreme Court for retention of NEET, he said The AIADMK had all along been opposed to NEET and made it possible for 435 students of government schools to secure entry into medical colleges and to avail of free education owing to the implementation of 7.5 % reservation in admissions. “The DMK leader cannot deceive people by uttering lies for political gains,” he said while campaigning at Vedaranyam for Handlooms and Textiles Minister O.S. Manian. Referring to the methane extraction issue, Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK government had thwarted the project initiated by the DMK by declaring the entire delta region a Protected Agricultural Zone after farmers feared that they would lose their cultivable land. The waiver of agricultural loans and jewel loans by the government has benefited over 14 lakh farmers, he said. “In the AIADMK, it was possible for a farmer to become the Chief Minister whereas the DMK was a corporate set up where Mr. Stalin is the chairman and his son Udayanidhi Stalin, Kanimozhi and Dayanidhi Maran are directors. Can any farmer become a Chief Minister in a DMK regime?” he asked. The DMK has no achievements whatsoever to lay claim to, Mr. Palaniswami said. Later, campaigning for party candidates in Nagapattinam, Poompuhar and Sirkazhi and alliance partner PMK in Mayiladuthurai, the Chief Minister said the DMK had a poor track record in governance, citing the acute power shortage during its 2006-2011 tenure. Mr. Stalin would never be able to fulfil his dream of becoming the Chief Minister, he said. The Godavari-Cauvery project would ensure bountiful water and bring in agricultural prosperity in the delta region including the tail-end areas, Mr.Palaniswami said. Tamil Nadu has proved to be a model State in several aspects including water management, agricultural productivity, education and healthcare, he said seeking to counter Mr. Stalin’s charge of leadership failure under the present AIADMK regime. The start of 11 new medical colleges would result in 600 students of government schools studying medicine next year owing to the 7.5 % reservation enforced by the State government, Mr. Palaniswami said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-repeatedly-lying-on-neet-issue-cm/article34104168.ece

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Srirangam yearns for lost VIP status||Nourished and nurtured by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa until a few years ago, Srirangam constituency yearns for similar attention from officialdom yet again. The stagnation is all too perceptible after a period of hectic development activity when officials of every department vied with each other to come up with one project or the other for Srirangam under the late Chief Minister when she was elected from the constituency in 2011. Minister for Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare S.Valarmathi, who reaped the benefits in two successive elections, first in the by-election held in 2015 in the aftermath of the verdict on disproportionate wealth case against Jayalalithaa, and later in the 2016 Assembly elections, has now been replaced apparently due to the party’s poor performance in the recent local body election in a constituency known to be an AIADMK stronghold.  Safe seat? Srirangam is still perceived a safe seat for the AIADMK — the constituency has returned AIADMK candidates nine times since 1977. The DMK was able to achieve a breakthrough only once in 1996. In 1989, Y. Venkateswara Dikshithar of Janata Party, backed by the DMK, tasted success. With just six wards of Tiruchi Corporation and a few suburbs accounting for the urban segment, a large part of the constituency is spread over rural areas. Contrary to popular belief, brahmins do not form the dominant vote bank in Srirangam; Mutharaiyars and Dalits constitute the majority in the constituency. A dispute between Ranganathaswamy Temple administration and a section of residents over ownership of properties around the temple remains a dominant poll issue. A large number of property owners with title deeds are not able to sell or pledge their properties ever since the temple authorities claimed ownership rights on over 300 acres. Former Minister and AIADMK candidate Ku. PA. Krishnan, who is seeking to rejuvenate his political career, has asserted that he has a solution in mind to the issue and would seek to implement it once elected. DMK’s M.Palaniyandi, who lost to Ms.Valarmathi by a margin of about 14,400 votes in 2016, too has promised to strive for a solution. And so has former Mayor of Tiruchi and Ammal Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam candidate Sarubala R.Tondaiman, who could possibly queer the pitch for AIADMK. But residents have grown weary. “At the time of election, every candidate promises to find a solution to the issue. We are tired of it. We hope that whoever is elected in this election will be able to keep up the promise,”says B. Hemanathan, president, Arangama Nagar Nala Sangam – Srirangam Adimanai Urimai Meetpukuzhu, a committee of residents of Srirangam who have taken up a series of agitations for the cause. Besides the land dispute, absence of a bus terminus in the temple town, which attracts devotees and tourists right through the year, rankles the mind of voters. “Even a small pilgrim town such as Viralimalai has a good bus terminus; but Srirangam with all its claim to fame, is yet to get one. Jayalalithaa had announced establishment of a bus terminus in the town but it is yet to see the light of the day,” says S.N. Mohan Ram, president, Srirangam Makkal Nala Sangam. A section of residents has also been mooting construction of a check dam across the Kollidam, between Vadukku Vasal and Nochiyam, to shore up the water table and drinking water sources for the town. The existing underground drainage scheme in the town has fallen into repair at many places and sewage water is backing up into houses in places such as Sathara Veedhi and Veereswaram, complains Mr. Mohan Ram. “Encroachments along the arterial road from Amma Mandapam to the Rajagopuram too need to be cleared. Mounds of garbage at many public places make for poor sanitation in the town,” he says. Floriculturists have long been seeking a perfume extraction unit. Summing up, Mr. Mohan Ram says: “The constituency got so many schemes under the former Chief Minister. But after her, most of the projects have fallen through or have not been implemented properly.” This, in essence, remains a common plaint of voters in Srirangam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/srirangam-yearns-for-lost-vip-status/article34104185.ece

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||LGBTQI community seeks quota in employment and education||The political parties who are contesting for the upcoming Assembly elections have failed to focus on the welfare of LGBTQI (lesbians, gays, bi-sexual, transgenders, queer and intersex) in their election manifestos, say members of the LGBTQI community. Reservation in education and employment, a separate welfare board for the community and establishing rehabilitation homes, were some of the demands highlighted by the LGBTQI people. No politician has made any announcements about the LGBTQI community in their election manifestos, says Gopi Shankar, South Representative of the National Commission for Transgender Persons. “Their understanding about the LGBTQI community is also very minimal,” he adds. Anjana* (name changed on request), from rural Madurai, says there is a need to establish shelter homes or rehabilitation centres for the protection of members from LGBTQI community. “In most of the cases, the members of the LGBTQI community have no support from their family members and are asked to leave home. Hence, there is a need for establishing rehabilitation centres where the LGBTQI members can take shelter,” she says. Concurring with this viewpoint, Priya Babu, the head of Transgender Resource Centre, says there is a need for establishing reservation for the LGBTQI community in education and employment. Solu, a transgender physiotherapist of the School Education department, says only 10% of educational institutions accept students from the LCBTQI community. “One of the main ways to sensitise the public is to compulsorily have a syllabus about the LGBTQI community in schools and colleges,” she adds. Only introducing reservation in education and employment will ensure that transgenders are not forced into sex work or begging, says Bharathi Kannamma, a transgender activist. Ms. Babu emphaises that the Transgender Welfare Board is not active. “There is a need to engage the members of the transgender communtiy to make the board more active in implementing welfare schemes for the community,” she adds. Ms. Anjana also says a special helpline must be launched to provide help for the LGBTQI members who are in distress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lgbtqi-community-seeks-quota-in-employment-and-education/article34104803.ece

The new, affordable spray micro-irrigation technology will be ideal for cultivation of onion, ground nut and vegetable crops in Perambalur district. Rain hose is flexible with a pattern of drip holes made with nano-punching technology to ensure uniform flow of water, S. Somasundaram, Associate Professor and Head, Cotton Research Station, Veppanthattai, said. With the new technology, a small amount of water can be applied more frequently; better control of leaching reduces fertilizer application and helps to maintain optimum irrigation, thereby resulting in maximum yield and good quality of produce, Mr. Somasundaram said. Automation of the system results in faster and healthier growth of plants and crops. The initial investment is much lesser than drip and sprinkler irrigation. The rain hose ensures uniform and high flow rate of water with the right operating pressure and discharge rate, suiting closely spaced and shallow-rooted crops like onion, groundnut, vegetable crops and leafy vegetables, he said. There will be no clogging problem and it will sit every type of soil. The easily portable rain hose will cut down labour cost and filtration is not required, Assistant Professor Sakthivel added. According to Saravanan, a farmer who used the technology, it is quite user-friendly. Rain hose is effective for plants of around 1.5 feet height in the absence of high wind, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/scientists-bat-for-rain-hose-technology/article34104179.ece

A sense of alarm has sunk in after the district administration on Monday instructed them to expedite the process of completing portions to the maximum possible extent before month-end. Officially, a requirement for their buildings to conduct the Assembly elections next month was cited as the reason. “Though there has been no clear-cut information from the government on resumption of in-person classes after the election, speculation over possible restriction has gained momentum,” a principal of an aided college said, requesting anonymity. Teachers themselves are inclined to the idea of resuming online classes for completion of theory portions after the election. “More or less, over 50% of the theory component can be completed through in-person classes for even semester from the latter part of November. The next two weeks will be utilised to complete 20% more portions and finishing the rest through online classes will not be a problem,” K.T. Tamil Mani, Associate Professor of English, Nehru Memorial College, Puthanampatti, said. The teachers, in general, feel that safety precautions are necessary at this juncture since students have become complacent about social distancing and are moving about in groups oblivious of the risk of contracting the viral infection. Also, they are conscious about their own vulnerability due to the age factor. “We do insist that students wear masks in classes and we also stock them in case of necessity. But, as teachers, we face the discomfort of teaching with masks on, and there is also a need for display of expression, which is not possible with them,” David Livingston, Zonal Secretary, Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers' Association, contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/caught-between-polls-and-portions/article34104164.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||‘Do not elect one corrupt party to defeat another’||Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) president Kamal Haasan told voters on Thursday that it would be unwise to elect one corrupt party to defeat another. Citing reports that 33 % of the sitting MLAs in the State faced criminal cases, Mr. Haasan appealed to voters not to be confused in electing the right candidates. “What you choose against corruption should not be another corruption,” he said while campaigning for Rajkumar, the party’s candidate for Mettupalayam constituency. Both of the AIADMK and DMK repeated new lies every five years. According to Mr. Haasan, Income Tax raids were among the attempts to tarnish the party as it continues to uphold honesty as its capital. “Such tricks will not work with MNM. I have the courage to condemn and punish if anyone in my circle does such crimes. That’s why I have come to this [politics],” he said. On the human-animal conflict affecting farmers in the region, Mr. Haasan accused the Government of not taking measures to tackle the problem, as such works did not involve a ‘commission’. Earlier, speaking to presspersons in Coimbatore, he claimed that he had been facing various obstacles from the ruling dispensation “for two to three years.” Campaigning for his party candidate at Sathyamangalam in Bhavanisagar (Reserved) Assembly constituency, he said many spoke on the poverty line for years, which was created only by them. He said that once his party came to power, a scent factory would be established at Sathyamangalam and pollution in Bhavanisagar Dam’s canal would be stopped. He stressed the need for executing the Sathyamangalam – Mettupalayam railway line and the widening of the Dhimbam Ghat Road. He also promised to improve the livelihood of tribal people.

19 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Unregulated privatisation will affect economy’||Members of various trade unions and associations in the insurance sector held protests in front of LIC office in Belagavi on Thursday, against what they called sale of LIC and other public sector undertakings to the private sector. Members of LIC Class 1 officers association, LIC SC/ST Welfare Association, Insurance Employees Union, LIC Pensioners Association and other associations gathered in front of the LIC Belgaum Divisional Office and shouted slogans against the Union government’s move to announce the Initial Public Offer and the decision to increase Foreign Direct Investment to 74%. They demanded that the government drop these plans now and sanction the wage revision plan for employees with immediate effect. They said that these plans were nothing but an outright sale of public assets built with the savings and taxes paid by the general public. S.K. Kulkarni, union leader, said that bank unions and insurance unions were protesting against such regressive moves across the country this whole week. He said that indiscriminate and unregulated privatisation would destroy the country’s economy. The NDA-led Union government is not only selling efficient and profit-making PSUs but also those that would provide financial and other services to the poor at affordable prices. If this vacancy is created, there will be no way to fill it. Private corporations that think of nothing but their profits will not bother to provide services to the common man, he said. P.A. Joseph, leader of the LIC Pensioners Association, said that reckless privatisation of LIC and other important PSUs would destroy the social security network of citizens in the country. He said that there was a need to create awareness about such initiatives of the government. Leaders N.Y. Yankannanavar, M.S. Kulkarni, Chandrashekar Bolgundi and others led the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/unregulated-privatisation-will-affect-economy/article34104261.ece

19 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Betterment fee to be slashed||In what will come as a relief to property owners, the Urban Development Department (UDD) has sought to amend the Karnataka Planning Authorities Rules, 2020, that prescribe a hefty betterment fee for development in the city. The UDD wants to reduce the betterment fee. A draft notification published recently seeks to reduce betterment charges from the range of 0.5% - 1.5% of the market value of the property to the range of 0.2% - 0.5%. The draft is open for filing objections, and will be notified in April, sources said. This comes after widespread opposition to hefty betterment fees prescribed in Karnataka Planning Authorities Rules, 2020, which for the first time had decided that the fee should be a function of market value of the property while earlier it was a fixed amount. Moreover, the way the notification of the Rules was worded had created chaos, prompting the commissioners of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to seek several clarifications from the State government. The UDD has issued a series of clarifications and directions to prevent properties being charged betterment fees multiple times, amending its earlier order that had led to confusion in the city. The way Rules, 2020 was worded, the civic body was forced to serve notices for betterment fee for the entire extent of the property during extension or renovation, even for properties that had already paid the fee. This, along with increased charges, resulted in property owners seeking to expand or renovate existing properties being served notices to the tune of several lakhs of rupees. K. Ramkumar, a resident of Girinagar, for instance was served a notice for a betterment fee of Rs. 2.19 lakh as he sought to add a room to his house built on a 40X60 site. He had already paid the betterment fee when he built the house several years ago. UDD gives clarity The UDD has now said that the betterment fee has to be charged for the whole extent of the property for the first development and later only to the extent of the built-up area being added. This will essentially prevent the betterment fee from being levied multiple times, civic sources said. The UDD has also directed the BDA to declare a “core area”. This will include areas that existed before the enactment of Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961 “for relaxing the collection of the fee, cess and surcharges within such an area”. However, properties seeking relief under Akrama-Sakrama will not be given this relaxation. This means that Mr. Ramkumar will no longer have to fork out another betterment fee. “It was ridiculous that the civic body issued a notice to pay Rs. 2.19 lakh to add a room to my house. I have been corresponding with the BBMP protesting the unfairness of the whole process for several months now. The UDD order and clarification have come as a relief. But policy making divorced from ground reality created chaos for over a year,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/betterment-fee-to-be-slashed/article34104636.ece
19 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No to vaccination points in old age homes, care facilities||The Centre has ruled out the possibility of COVID-19 vaccination centres (CVCs) in old age homes and long-term care facilities, as CVCs have to meet certain requirements to provide safe vaccination. This has irked authorities of old age homes and other long-term care facilities. The Centre’s “No” follows a request from Karnataka seeking permission to set up CVCs beyond health facilities (such as old age homes, long-term care facilities, apartment complexes and identified polling booths) to ramp up vaccination coverage among the elderly. In a letter dated March 17 addressed to Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare), Vandana Gurnani, Union Additional Secretary and Mission Director, National Health Mission (NHM), has said that CVCs should have adequate space for vaccination, adequate cold chain arrangements for vaccine storage, arrangements for management of Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI). Complex issues “These facilities would then also need to be registered on CoWIN to enable session planning, reporting of AEFI and allocation of vaccines. Based on the analysis done from Co-WIN, it is observed that out of 460 private health facilities empanelled under Ayushman Bharat - Arogya Karnataka (AB-ArK) in the State, only 55 are registered on Co-WIN,” the letter stated. “Covering all these centres would surely make the vaccination services more accessible to the target population with special consideration for the elderly. In view of the above, it would be advisable that the State may consider limiting the vaccination services to health facilities as permitted by the Centre,” said the letter, adding that instead people could be brought to CVCs in special vehicles. This has angered representatives of old age homes and other long-term care facilities, who said they will continue to urge the government to organise vaccination camps in their premises considering the implications on the lives of more than 2,00,000 elders residing in such homes in the country. Risks involved “There are 4,000 long-term elder care facilities and old age homes in India. Most of the inmates live with co-mmorbidities, dementia, mental disorders, and are bedridden. There are not only logistical challenges but also serious health concerns for such elders if they have to visit hospitals for vaccination. Such homes cannot be compared with apartment complexes,” said S. Premkumar Raja, secretary and trustee of Nightingales Medical Trust (NMT). Cold chain On the cold chain issue, he said, “In our country, vaccines such as DPT, BCG, Measles, which also need to be kept at temperatures of 2-8 degrees are administered successfully at the village level by nurses. If that was possible, the same can be replicated for Covishield or Covaxin,” he said. Mobile vaccination units are equipped with all facilities and faculty, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-to-vaccination-points-in-old-age-homes-care-facilities/article34104641.ece
19 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Scam’ in nursing, paramedic colleges plunges House into chaos||Karnataka’s Legislative Council plunged into a logjam on Thursday evening with Janata Dal (Secular) members, who suspected a “scam” in approving new nursing and allied health colleges in the State in 2020, insisting on setting up a House committee to probe into the irregularities. Rejecting the demand, the ruling party committed to a probe by the government, resulting in fracas. JD(S) members alleged that there was a scam in according approval to 47 nursing colleges and 45 allied health colleges and said RGUHS rules had been thrown to the wind. Earlier, while BJP member N. Ravikumar, who raised the issue, said the newly approved nursing and allied health sciences colleges were not in order, Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar announced that the government would probe the matter and place it before the House for consideration. However, JD(S) members seized the moment and demanded a House committee to probe the issue since there were multiple allegations of irregularities. For over an hour, the House business was affected as JD(S) members trooped to the well raising slogans and mediation by Council Chairman Basavaraj Horatti between the government and the JD(S) also failed to end the logjam. Meanwhile, the Congress, which has boycotted six Ministers, including Dr. Sudhakar, urged the Chairman to consider the demand of the JD(S) members. During discussion, JD(S) member Marithibbe Gowda said, “Rules of RGUHS have been violated in terms of recommending affiliation. There are no infrastructure and faculty, and bogus documents have been provided to secure approval.” He cited an instance in Kundapur where two colleges had the same building address. He also said there were about 30 nursing colleges in Bidar where students from Kerala come only for examination. Another JD(S) member Appaji Gowda said, “The biodata of faculty have been commonly used by different colleges.” Another member K.T. Srikante Gowda said it was not a political blame game. “As many as 90% of nursing colleges do not have good infrastructure. Our demand for probe is to cover all colleges and is in the interest of people,” he said. Dr. Sudhakar in his reply said, “Though 101 applications were received for nursing colleges, only 47 had been approved, and out of the 70 applications for allied health sciences, 45 had been approved by the high-powered committee headed by the Principal Secretary.” He also acknowledged that the numbers had been brought down from 60 for nursing and 52 for allied health sciences that the RGUHS had recommended. Nursing and paramedical staff shortage was profound during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. He said a task force had been set up to review infrastructure, and report had been sought in three months. Not satisfied with the answer, the JD(S) members came to the well despite an appeal by Mr. Ravikumar, who had raised the issue, to accept the Minister’s reply. Eventually, Mr. Horatti adjourned the proceedings till Friday.    RGUHS rules have been violated in terms of recommending affiliation. There are no infrastructure and faculty, and bogus documents have been provided to secure approval. Marithibbe Gowda,JD(S) member   Though 101 applications were received for nursing colleges, only 47 had been approved, and out of the 70 applications for allied health sciences, 45 had been cleared.

19 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Monkey menace: Govt. plans sterilisation drive in Malnad||With monkeys raiding agricultural fields continuing to be a major concern in Malnad, the Forest Department  is all set to take up a programme to sterilise monkeys to control the rise in their population in Thirthahalli and other taluks in Shivamogga district. In reply to a question of Araga Jnanendra (BJP), Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, who replied in the absence of Forest Minister Aravind Limbavali, said the Forest Department had trained 12 veterinary doctors for sterilisation of male monkeys. Equipment had been purchased to catch monkeys. All those caught would be taken to the veterinary college for sterilisation and kept under watch for two to three days before being released into the forest again. It was decided to purchase a mobile van fitted with medical equipment for sterilising monkeys. “This programme would be taken up in the entire district of Shivamogga,” Mr. Shettar said. Mr. Jnanendra said department officials had not shown interest in setting up a “monkey park” in the district though Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had proposed to sanction Rs. 6 crore for the purpose 18 months ago. Poor compensation H.K. Kumaraswmy (JD-S), K.G. Bopaiah (BJP) and several other members demanded revision of the policy formulated in 2009 for providing compensation for crop loss that occurs because of wild animals such as monkeys, elephants, and deer. Mr. Bopaiah said in Kodagu district alone, an amount of Rs. 1.3 crore had not been provided to farmers who had lost crops because of wild animal menace. Members said the department pays compensation of Rs. 500 per acre which was negligible compared with the cost of cultivation and prevailing prices of food crops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/monkey-menace-govt-plans-sterilisation-drive-in-malnad/article34104392.ece
19 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Many teacher education institutions sub-standard: Study||With as many as nine million teachers in around 1.5 million schools in India, the quality of education imparted to aspiring teachers is equally important. For education in our schools to improve, teaching has to improve. This is the crux of the first volume of a study on teachers and teacher education, comprising four papers on the subject, that was released by Azim Premji University on Thursday. It is the first volume in a series on ‘Issues in Education’, said the university in a press release. Together the four papers explore the landscape of Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) in the country, corruption in private TEIs, the support system needed for teachers and the problem of those who are on contract. The findings are an eye-opener, especially given the imbalance in private versus public TEIs. For instance, the first paper -- ‘Mapping the Landscape of Teacher Education Institutions in India’ -- found that of the 17,503 TEIs in India, more than 90% are privately owned, stand-alone institutions, offering single programmes localised in certain geographies. Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, account for 54% of all TEIs in the country, said the researchers. Equally worrying is the level of corruption prevalent, which is the focus of the second paper, Corruption in Private Teacher Education Institutions. There are many sub-standard, dysfunctional TEIs functioning as ‘commercial shops’, said the press release. The study stated, “A quantitative mapping of corruption in the form of violation of very basic institutional, curricular and programme parameters by private TEIs shows that 26 out of 29 private TEIs studied did not have the required number of teacher educators and adopted deliberate corrupt practices to hide this issue.” The researchers say TEIs deliberately neglected basic curricular requirements. “Classes are neither conducted seriously nor taken seriously by students,” said the authors of the paper. Almost all private TEIs allowed students with shortage of attendance to appear for examinations. More than 60% allowed students who had not completed their school internships to appear for examinations. At least 70% TEIs had an average attendance of students that was below 80%. The paper goes on to state that most of the TEIs the authors studied did not have basic instructional facilities. For instance, curriculum laboratories were not available in more than 50%, while 30% did not have libraries, computer labs or seminar halls, the release stated. The fourth paper in the series tackles the increasing prevalence of contract teachers, who are recruited for short periods on inadequate salaries with little or no benefits. This, the authors stated, has caused not just long-term damage to not just the teaching profession, but has also affected student learning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-teacher-education-institutions-sub-standard-study/article34104639.ece
19 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Another month to resume full production at Wistron||Apple’s contract manufacturer Wistron Corporation may take at least another month to restart full production at its Narsapura plant in Kolar district, according to sources. iPhone manufacturer Wistron had on March 11 announced the resumption of its operations in Karnataka, almost three months after its workforce resorted to violence on December 14, 2020, for non-payment of salaries and overtime wages. However, as of now, only people working in one shift are involved in phone assembling and production activities while workers deployed on the other two shifts are currently under training. They are engaged in learning and self-learning because the rest of Wistron’s assembly/ production lines are yet to become operational,” said a source. “Currently, only one production line is active and we are making 500 to 600 iPhones a day, instead of the usual number of over 3,000 units. Other lines are yet to be set up fully and therefore full production might take place only after a month to six week’s time,” the source added. Meanwhile, State labour ministry officials will visit Wistron plant to assess the situation after the company resumed operations. Employee information State Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar told The Hindu: “I have asked my officials for a detailed report on Wistron’s current status. They will visit the plant to assess the company’s production readiness and also to gather employee information such as how many people have joined, how many more are expected to come on board and by when.” According to reliable information, Wistron has already allowed over 6,000 of its contract workers to return to work, after cross-verifying their credentials and backgrounds while another 2,000 people have also completed the required screening and now waiting for a re-joining date. “Some 1,000 people who were part of rioting have lost their jobs. However, all women employees have been taken back. Also, we feel safe and protected now as the management seems more responsible. We are also given proper conveyance and canteen facility,” said a woman employee of Wistron. Wistron currently operates three eight-hour shifts with no over-time, as against two 8-hour shifts and 4-hour compulsory overtime duty that was the practice earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/another-month-to-resume-full-production-at-wistron/article34104387.ece

BJP member Hartal Halappa drew the State government’s attention to poor cell phone connectivity owing to the absence of towers and difficulties experienced particularly by students and farmers. Mr. Halappa, who raised the issue during the Zero Hour in the Assembly, said students of primary and high schools, who were in large numbers, had not been able to attend online classes owing to poor internet connectivity. Farmers too had not been able to avail of facilities offered by government schemes. Many families were not able to avail of rations in the PDS shops since they were not receivingOTP on their cell phones after the “point of sale” system was introduced by the Department of Food and Civil Supplies, he said.For instance, more than 50% of the geographical area in Sagar constituency had not been accessible to cell phone usage owing to absence of towers, he said t. Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri said in his constituency, Sirsi, too more than 50% of the geographical area was not reachable by cell phone owing to absence of towers. Mr. Halappa said many benefits under schemes of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj and Agriculture departments had been denied to farmers for no fault of theirs owing to poor connectivity. Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said the government would hold talks with private players to install towers on a cost-sharing terms. Cost of each tower ranges from Rs. 30 lakh to Rs. 50 lakh.  Benefits under RDPR and Agriculture department schemes had been denied to farmers for no fault of theirs owing to poor connectivity.

Ramesh Kumar on Thursday suggested to the State government to examine the possibility of setting up hi-tech slaughterhouses to explore the export potential for meat. Participating in a debate on the State Budget in the Assembly, Mr. Ramesh Kumar pointed out that there was a huge demand for pork and beef in foreign markets. This would help farmers to earn remunerative incomes, he said. Making it clear that he was not against the religious beliefs and the holy status given to the cow, he urged the authorities to understand that such beliefs were towards the native cows. But cross-breed cows were being reared for commercial purposesand their male calves were a burden for farmers since it was a costly affair to look after them. He pointed out that the anti-cow slaughter legislation had banned their slaughter too. Pointing out that the State had different agro-climatic zones, Mr. Kumar demanded that every district or region should have an agricultural prices commission.  ‘Buy cows’ Earlier, BSP member N. Mahesh urged the government to formulate a scheme to buy “non-productive cows” from farmers to ensure that growers were not adversely impacted owing to theimplementation of the anti-cow slaughter legislation. He demanded that the government pay farmers while getting non-productive cows as the legislation had barred their sale for slaughtering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/consider-setting-up-hi-tech-slaughterhouses/article34104396.ece

Some 19 lakh tonnes of iron ore was imported to the State in the last five months from other States and that led to huge revenue erosion and job losses, it said. FIMI said the concurrent restrictions on the trade of iron ore in Karnataka was suppressing the growth of the sector with significant deleterious effects on the industry ecosystem and also on the state exchequer. The apex body sought the intervention of both the State government and the Ministry of Mines into the issue. According to FIMI, Karnataka had witnessed iron ore imports of some 4 lakh tonnes from the eastern part of India, covering 1,620 km, through South-East Railway in October 2020. “We have raised our concern with the Principal Secretary Mines & Small Scale Industries, Government of Karnataka in November 2020. But since then almost 15 lakh tonnes of iron ore have been imported to the State. Also, transportation of iron ore across such long-distance is environmentally unfriendly,” noted the trade body. The rest of India was exporting iron ore, under the EXIM [olicy of the Union government, thereby ensuring fair revenue to the exchequer including foreign exchange as well as overall growth of the nation by using the railways, port facilities etc. As per data available, other parts of the country exported 10.34 million tonnes of fines and 1.16 mmts of lumps in 2019, said FIMI. The buyers have the freedom of trade and the right to purchase iron ore either through e-auction or from other states or via imports. But the current scenario has created a skewed market, disadvantageous to sellers in Karnataka as they can only sell to end-users within the State, the mining trade body lamented.  We have raised our concern with the Principal Secretary Mines & Small Scale Industries, Government of Karnataka in November 2020. But since then almost 15 lakh tonnes of iron ore have been imported to the State.

19 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bypolls: Cong. names two candidates; JD(S) one||On Thursday, the Congress announced candidates for two Assembly seats where bypolls will be held on April 17, while the JD(S) announced for one seat. The Congress announced names of Mallamma, wife of the former MLA late Narayan Rao, and Basavanagoud R. Turvihal for Basavakalyan and Maski Legislative Assembly constituencies, respectively. Mr. Turvihal quit the BJP and joined the Congress recently. In the 2018 Assembly polls, Mr. Turvihal, who was contesting on the BJP ticket, lost to the then Congress candidate Prathapgouda Patil by a slender margin. Mr. Patil later joined the BJP and this caused the byelection. The party high command also named the candidature of Ashok Managuli for the Sindagi constituency but the Election Commission of Indian has not yet announced the bypoll here. Mr. Ashok Managoli, son of the former MLA late M.C. Managoli. M.C. Managuli of the JD(S) died in January. State Congress leaders are expected to meet on Saturday to finalise the candidate for the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency byelection. Meanwhile, setting to rest speculation over fielding candidates for the byelections, Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Thursday announced that the party would contest in Maski and Basavakalyan, while decision on contesting in Belagavi bypoll would be made in a couple of days. He announced Syed Yasrab Ali Qadri, a former Congressman, as the party candidate in Basavakalyan. Candidate for Maski would be announced in a day or two. Confusing signals had come from the JD(S) over the last two months, with party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda stating that the party would not contest elections while Mr. Kumaraswamy had maintained that the party was yet to decide.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bypolls-cong-names-two-candidates-jds-one/article34104393.ece

19 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Decide on Baig’s properties: HC||The High Court termed as “erroneous” the approach of the State government that it has to wait till the Central Bureau of Investigation submits the final report on the investigation into IMA scam case to decide whether to attach the properties of R. Roshan Baig, former MLA, who is arraigned as one of the accused in the case. It was informed to the Bench that the CA had written to the government on requirement of attaching properties of Mr. Baig, and the government in turn had sought a report from the CBI on Mr. Baig’s role in the scam. However, the CBI said it would be able to provide details only on completion of the investigation. When government counsel Vijayakumar A. Patil said the government will have to wait till the CBI submits its final report to decide on attachment of Mr. Baig’s properties, the Bench disagreed with the stand and directed the Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) take a decision on attachment under Section 3 of the KPIDFE Act by April 16. The Bench said the properties may not be in existence if the government waits till CBI’s report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decide-on-baigs-properties-hc/article34104275.ece

19 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||LIC officers, employees oppose IPO, hike in FDI||Opposing the Union government’s decision to list Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) in the stock market through an IPO, the decision to increase FDI limits in the insurance sector to 74% from 49% and privatise one public sector general insurance company, the employees and officers of LIC observed a one-day strike in Dharwad on Thursday in response to a nation-wide strike call. LIC employees, officials and also former employees staged a demonstration in front of the divisional office of LIC in Dharwad and vehemently opposed the Union government’s move. Raising slogans against the Centre, they said that selling shares of LIC was nothing but snatching savings of commoners and filling the coffers of a few. The speakers addressing the protestors said that LIC belonged to the people of India and hence, the sale of its shares would mean depriving the people of “their jewel”. They said that LIC had grown a lot in the last 64 years from an initial investment of Rs. 5 crore by the government in 1956. Mentioning the contribution of LIC in nation building, they said that at present LIC’s assets had crossed Rs. 32 lakh crore. They said that LIC had been a lifeline 24 x 7 not only for the government but also for the share market and many a company had survived in the market thanks to LIC. Disinvestment in such an institution would mean a lethal blow to the country as it was only LIC which had penetrated rural India, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lic-officers-employees-oppose-ipo-hike-in-fdi/article34104268.ece
19 March 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Insurance staff take to the streets in Kalyana Karnataka||As part of a nation-wide strike called by the Joint Forum of Trade Unions in LIC opposing the Union government’s decision to list LIC in the stock markets through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the insurance sector to 74% from 49%, over a thousand employees working in different branches of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) in Kalyana Karnataka boycotted their work and joined the protests on Thursday. Organised under the banner of the Insurance Employees Union (IEU), the employees staged demonstrations outside their branches in Raichur, Kalaburagi, Hosapete, Koppal, Ballari, Sindhanur and other places. “As proposed in its recent budget, the Union government has decided to list LIC in the stock markets through an IPO and increase FDI in the insurance sector to 74% from 49%. Both the decisions are not in national interest as they would definitely speed up the process of privatisation of the insurance sector,” Gururaj, a representative of LIC Class I Officers Union, said in Raichur during the agitation. “The very purpose of establishing LIC was to raise resources for faster industrialisation of the country by collecting small savings in the form of premiums while giving utmost security to the policyholders. LIC has been very successful in meeting these objectives. Disinvestment in LIC is the first step towards privatisation. Therefore, LIC IPO would defeat the very objectives of its creation,” M. Ravi, president of Insurance Employees Union, said. M. Sharangouda, A. Sridhar, V.H. Gugawad, Salauddin, Sharanabasava and other leaders spoke, opposing the government’s move. In Ballari, hundreds of employees, including Class I officers, development officers and agents, working with a local LIC branch boycotted their work to stage a demonstration outside their branch in the morning. “LIC has nearly 35 crore individual policyholders. Its total investments in the Indian economy have been over Rs. 30 lakh crore. It has been promoting social welfare through investments in infrastructure and social sectors. It has paid a cumulative dividend of Rs. 28,000 crore to the government since 1956 and Rs. 2,698 crore in 2019-20. If it is listed in the stock markets, it will no longer remain a permanent resource that has been contributing to the welfare of the people and development of the country as it will have to be profit-oriented to satisfy its shareholders. It will have to target big policies which bring greater profits and, in the process, small size policies which the poor, vulnerable and lower-middle classes purchase will no longer be attractive. The social objective of providing insurance cover to the weaker sections of society will receive a setback,” said D.V. Suryanarayan, convenor of Insurance Employees Union at LIC Branch 2 in Ballari. Abdul Khadeer, Pratap Kumar, Shashidhar, Dattatreya and other leaders were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/insurance-staff-take-to-the-streets-in-kalyana-karnataka/article34104265.ece

The JSS Mahavidyapeetha has provided 10,000 sq. ft of land on long lease to IRI for establishing the Centre. In this regard, a memorandum of understanding between IRI and JSS Mahavidyapeetha was signed here on Thursday. JSS Mahavidyapeetha Executive Secretary C.G. Betsurmath and R. Mukhopadhyay, Chairman, Governing Council, IRI, Mysuru, exchanged the documents in the presence of Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami of Suttur Mutt and other top officials of the Mahavidyapeetha. The centre has been established at an estimated cost of Rs. 60 crore. IRI has decided to dedicate the Centre of Excellence to D. Banerjee, who is known as the Father of Indian Rubber Industry. The centre is aimed to be empanelled with RSDC, NSDC, and Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship as a premier institute of skill development of rubber sector in the country, a release from IRI said here. “The centre will not only generate employment but also produce a large number of entrepreneurs who in turn would generate further employment and contribute to MSME segments. Besides producing skilled manpower, the centre is also planned to provide rubber product development, consulting and testing services to the rubber industry in order to become self-sustainable in future,” the IRI said. The construction of the 32,000 sq. ft building for the Centre of Excellence is already completed. The building consists of a 225-seater auditorium, two training halls, library, rubber processing lab and various testing labs, including a data analytic lab. The testing facilities will cater to the needs of meeting skill requirements of emerging legislations and regulations in automobile and tyre industries including fuel efficiency and safety. It will function as a nodal centre for skill development and training in the rubber sector in the southern region besides offering diploma and PG diploma in rubber technology in association with RTC, IIT Kharagpur and expanding to neighbouring countries including Sri Lanka and Thailand. Course soon The centre will soon start a B. Voc course in rubber technology in association with JSS Science and Technology University and Rubber Skill Development Council. It will be jointly conducting short-term courses, workshops, seminars and conferences with the Department of Polymer Science and Technology, JSS S and T University, Mysuru, and other universities and institutes of national importance, the release said. Quoting data from All India Rubber Industries Association (AIRIA), IRI said India has 63 tyre companies and around 4,300 large, medium and small-scale rubber units producing thousands of rubber components for various applications. The rubber industry in India currently employs around 6 lakh people in the organised sector. Consumption low The per capita rubber consumption in India is only around 1.3 kg as against the global average of 6 kg per capita (the per capita consumption in the U.S. is 12 kg, 16 kg in Japan and 3.5 kg in China). According to Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association, India produces around 180 million tyres ranging from two-wheelers (2 kg) to earthmover tyres (about 3,500 kg) besides cycle and rickshaw tyres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/boost-for-rubber-technology-research/article34104383.ece
19 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||DC warns of a second peak||As the COVID-19 cases have started seeing a rise again every week, the Mysuru district administration has stepped in to contain the pandemic from spreading like the way it did last year, urging the people to cooperate for successfully fighting the contagion. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri said more cases are being reported especially from rural areas, demanding mandatory wearing of face masks and maintaining social distance. The people in villages have to take precautions seriously and comply with the guidelines. They should not neglect symptoms and immediately undergo test in case they are suffering from fever, cold, cough and headache, she said. Urging the citizens above 60 years and those aged between 45 and 59 with co-morbidities to take the vaccine, she said the new guidelines issued by the government over the fresh scare have to be complied with strictly at all the places of tourist importance which have reported surge in visitors. COVID-19 can spread faster in “super spreader” events such as jatra, marriages, and festivals and in places where there is high density of public. Therefore, the people must stay away from crowds for keeping the pandemic at bay. The number of COVID-19 cases rose by 60 between the last week of February and second week of March. If there were 127 cases between February 26 and March 4, the number rose to 185 between March 5 and 11. This number is on the rise with each passing day, necessitating the need for carrying out awareness drives and testing, Ms. Sindhuri said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dc-warns-of-a-second-peak/article34104381.ece

The plan is to air 13 programmes of 30 minutes duration each and the recording is expected to commence in due course following the completion of the script. B. Shivaram Shetty, project director, CESCK, said they expect the programme to be aired sometime in April/May. He said there was a perception that classical Kannada pertained to a bygone era but the CESCK wants to drive home the point that it is also contemporary. The programme ‘Kannada Nudi Bimba’ intends to highlight the world view and the traditional knowledge base using various sources drawn from folk, inscription etc. CESCK conducted a two-day workshop on the traditional knowledge system, which concluded on Wednesday. Mr. Shetty said experts from various fields took part in the workshop in which they identified 13 broad themes including the evolution of the language and the world view as enshrined in Kannada literature, folk music, folk dance, and traditional lifestyle. The subject experts discussed the broad contours of the programme and the sources from which the contents will be gleamed to be reflected in the script, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cesck-to-popularise-classical-kannada-through-air/article34104272.ece

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Hit-and-run turns out to be a case of murder||The Whitefield traffic police, who were probing what appeared to be a hit-and-run incident that took place on January 21, uncovered the murder of 58-year-old man. The victim’s wife and son had allegedly paid a taxi driver to run over him and make it look like an accident. According to the police, a property dispute was the motive. The deceased, Subbarayappa, an agriculturalist, was on his way to meet a client on his motorcycle. A vehicle rammed his two-wheeler on an empty stretch on Narige Road in Gunjur, Whitefield. Subbrayappa was thrown off the seat on to the road, and died. The accident site was in an isolated place with no CCTV camera. “The road has many bad patches and humps. However, during a spot inspection, the police suspected that something was fishy. A special team, led by Inspector S.R. Manjunath, was formed to probe the hit-and-run case,” said M. Narayan, DCP, Traffic (East). When the police examined footage from CCTV cameras further down the stretch, they saw an SUV without a registration number. The team was able to identify the vehicle on the basis of a sticker of a rental company. They traced the car rental company, identified the car, and accessed its GPS system. “We confirmed that the vehicle was at the accident site at the time the victim died,” said a police officer. The police learnt that a person named Anil Kumar had booked the vehicle for a few days, but his phone was switched off. On analysing call record details, they learned that Anil had called Subbarayappa on the pretext of buying his agricultural produce. “It was a trap laid by Anil to get Subbarayappa to come to that isolated stretch of road,” said the police. The special team discovered that, after the accident, Anil had borrowed a phone from a passer-by and called Subbarayappa’s wife Yashodhamma. “When questioned, she denied having anything to do with the hit-and-run. By then, we had tracked down Anil who claimed that he was offered Rs. 6 lakh by Yashodhamma and her son G.S. Devraj to kill Subbarayappa,” said a police officer. “Devraj had filed a complaint stating that his father had been killed in an accident.” Anil claimed to have taken an advance of Rs. 4.4 lakh from the mother and son, and enlisted the aid of Nagesh and Dhanush to kill Subbarayappa. He claimed that he got the idea from an advocate. He got the damaged car repaired at a workshop. He paid Rs. 57,000 to get the front portion of the vehicle repaired. “On further questioning, the wife and son confessed to the crime stating that Subbarayappa had an affair. The family thought that he would bequeath his property to his lover. Hence, they decided to eliminate him,” said a police official. Anil, Yashodhamma and Devraj have been arrested and handed over to the Whitefield police. Nagesh and Dhanush are absconding, said the police who are also investigating the advocate who reportedly advised Anil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hit-and-run-turns-out-to-be-a-case-of-murder/article34104629.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Three new clusters detected||Three new clusters have been detected in Yelahanka zone, taking the total number of active clusters to five. However, contact tracing is proving to be a nightmare as one family visited a temple despite being asked to remain in home isolation. Among the new clusters, seven residents of an apartment in Vidyaranyapura ward have tested positive for COVID-19. The first positive case was detected on March 8 after a person returned from Kerala and developed symptoms. As a precautionary measure, BBMP health officials had advised other residents to stay indoors, even though they all initially tested negative. However, one family went to ISKCON temple on March 9. The four family members developed symptoms on March 14 and tested positive the next day. On March 17, two more residents tested positive. “We have intimated our counterparts in West zone. They will have to inform ISKCON authorities. It is very difficult to trace the secondary contacts, who may have visited the temple the same day as the family,” a health officer said. In the second new cluster, seven members of a family, including a 9-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man, tested positive on Thursday. The whole family, residents of BEL Layout in Doddabommasandra ward, had attended a wedding in R.T. Nagar on March 2. Later, they got to know that one of the attendees had tested positive. On learning this, the family got tested at the PHC in Thindlu, following which one person tested positive. The other members were asked to be remain in home isolation. Two persons, including the 87-year-old man, have been admitted to a private hospital. The third new cluster was detected in Chikkabommasandra in Yelahanka Satellite ward. The health officer said two persons tested positive on Wednesday. Health officials from M.S. Palya PHC visited the area for contact tracing and found that the duo were residents of a duplex along with seven other persons – 6 on the first floor and 3 on the ground floor. Four of them received positive confirmation messages on Thursday.

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Poor response to online ticket booking||In the first week of December 2020, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) introduced online ticket booking services for air passengers. However, the response to the service has been lukewarm. On an average, 80 people are booking tickets online each day to travel in Vayu Vajra buses. While the number of users is low, BMTC officials are hoping that it will increase gradually. “Currently, around 5,000 people travel in Vayu Vajra AC buses every day,” said a BMTC official. A majority of the passengers prefer to purchase tickets from the conductor. Due to COVID-19, BMTC has reduced the number of Vayu Vajra AC services. “We are currently running around 70 buses to the airport. Prior to the lockdown, we were operating 120 buses,” said an official. Other than providing online booking services, the BMTC had plans to collaborate with taxi aggregators to provide first-mile and last-mile connectivity for passengers. For the most part, people are wary of travelling in air-conditioned buses, especially with the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases and predictions of the dreaded second wave on the horizon. Demand for air-conditioned Vajra services in city limits remains poor. The BMTC is operating only around 80 buses on once-popular routes, such as Kadugodi, Attibele, Sarjapur and Outer Ring Road. “For AC buses operating in city limits, occupancy is only 30%. Considering the higher operational cost involved in running AC buses, including fuel cost, we are operating services as per demand. If demand increases, we will run more buses,” an official said. The BMTC has more than 800 AC buses, but a majority have been off the road for nearly a year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/poor-response-to-online-ticket-booking/article34104648.ece

Roshan Baig, former MLA, who is arraigned as one of the accused in the case. It was informed to the Bench that the CA had written to the government on requirement of attaching properties of Mr. Baig, and the government in turn had sought a report from the CBI on Mr. Baig’s role in the scam. However, the CBI said it would be able to provide details only on completion of the investigation. When government counsel Vijayakumar A. Patil said the government will have to wait till the CBI submits its final report to decide on attachment of Mr. Baig’s properties, the Bench disagreed with the stand and directed the Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) take a decision on attachment under Section 3 of the KPIDFE Act by April 16. The Bench said the properties may not be in existence if the government waits till CBI’s final report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decide-on-baigs-properties/article34104633.ece

The IPO offer was announced in the Union Budget and it was also proposed to increase the Foreign Direct Investment from 49 per cent to 74 per cent in the insurance sector. The employees said this would amount to privatisation of a public sector insurance company and described it as an ‘anti-people’ move. The justification offered by the government that it would bring in ‘discipline’ lacked merit as many private sector entities in the insurance and banking sector have collapsed in recent times. They also sighted the meltdown in the world economy and the crash of private entitiesdespite which the public sector institutions in India fared well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lic-employees-oppose-disinvestment/article34104385.ece

Our officials will have a separate round of discussion with private hospitals this week to ensure that they are also prepared,” Dr. Sudhakar said, adding that heads of respective institutions would be held accountable for any lapse. The State’s COVID war room would start operating round the clock as it was during the first outbreak and the government would monitor the situation using real-time data through the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. All the applications that were developed to monitor the situation when the pandemic hit the State would be optimally used. Shortage of doctors and paramedical staff would also be addressed and a decision had been taken to recruit resident doctors and paramedical staff on a temporary basis. Reiterating that surveillance measures would be stepped up in the border districts, the Minister said the Chief Secretary has had a meeting in this regard with officials in those districts. The focus would be on Bengaluru Urban, Bidar, and Kalaburagi that have a high caseload. Emphasising on vaccine coverage, the Minister said inoculations would be ramped up and a target of vaccinating three lakh people daily had been fixed. “If we vaccinate senior citizens and people above 45 years with comorbidities, who are most vulnerable, we can ensure this population is protected in case of a second wave,” the Minister said. He said that the government was more confident now as it had the experience of handling the outbreak in the last one year. “There was lack of information and awareness when the pandemic hit us last year. We are also armed with a vaccine now,” he added. On vaccine wastage Dr. Sudhakar on Thursday said vaccine wastage, which has been pegged at over 6% in Karnataka, will be monitored on a daily basis and officials would be accountable for every vial. Heads of individual institutions would be held accountable at centres where the wastage was high. “We have asked heads of hospitals with vaccination centres to file a report on vaccine usage and wastage on a daily basis,” the Minister said.  Emphasising on vaccine coverage, Minister K. Sudhakar said inoculations would be ramped up and a target of vaccinating 3 lakh people daily had been fixed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-hospitals-to-ready-1000-beds-in-a-fortnight/article34104276.ece

Thomas Isaac has said. Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, Dr. Isaac said the investigation against KIIFB would not have much lifespan and it would end with the polls. “The Enforcement Directorate is planning to arrest some top officials. We will face such moves legally and by rallying people,” he said. Central institution Dr. Isaac said while the Enforcement Directorate was targeting KIIFB, the Centre was floating Development Finance Institution (DFI). “Although a KIIFB model financial institution, the DFI, however, will not come under the ambit of the Central Bureau of Investigation and other Central investigation agencies. It is being formed as a public sector enterprise but the Union Finance Minister has already revealed that the DFI will be privatised in three years. The Union government will only have a stake of 26% in the DFI in future. As the Centre excludes the DFI, which is set to be privatised, from the purview of agencies investigating corruption, it should clarify the intention behind targeting KIIFB, which is completely under the Kerala government,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kiifb-targeted-with-an-eye-on-assembly-polls-says-isaac/article34104355.ece

19 March 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Barometer of popularity for KC factions||Thodupuzha is one of the two constituencies in Idukki where the Kerala Congress (following the merger of the P.J. Joseph faction with the P.C. Thomas faction), for the United Democratic Front, is in direct contest with the Kerala Congress (M), which is now in the Left Democratic Front. The other one is the Idukki constituency in the district. In Thodupuzha, P.J. Joseph is in the fray after gaining a record margin in the last Assembly elections. His main rival K.I. Antony of the KC(M) is a novice in the constituency. Mr. Joseph had won from the constituency nine times and in the 2016 elections he was part of the undivided Kerala Congress (M), which was a constituent of the UDF then. After the death of founder leader K.M. Mani, the KC(M) had split along factional lines with one faction led by P.J. Joseph and the other by Jose K.Mani. The latter faction, now legally recognised as KC(M), broke away from the UDF and is now part of the LDF. Thodupuzha, a key constituency in the low range of Idukki, is keenly watched as to how voters will receive the two Kerala Congress groups contesting from rival fronts. It is also a prestigious constituency for the LDF with a sizeable number of farmers forming the electorate. National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate Shyamraj is also in the fray in the constituency. If the results of the last Lok Sabha and local body elections are considered, the Assembly segment has a tilt towards the UDF. Thodupuzha is an agrarian constituency where Mr. Joseph has pockets of support. However, with the KC(M) in the rival front, things are unpredictable now. In the 2016 Assembly elections, Mr. Joseph won from Thodupuzha with a margin of 45,587 votes. The LDF candidate got 30,977 votes. The NDA also performed creditably securing 28,845 votes. However, the UDF had a lead of 37,116 votes in the Assembly segment in the last Lok Sabha elections. The LDF got 47,319 votes and the NDA 15,223 votes. However, in the local body elections last year, the UDF lead came down to 6,424 votes. The LDF is pinning hopes on the declining margin of the UDF. It hopes the momentum it gained in the local body polls will stand it in good stead in the Assembly polls. The NDA is also a major factor as it has considerable influence in the constituency, especially in municipal areas of Thodupuzha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/barometer-of-popularity-for-kc-factions/article34104351.ece

She filed the nomination papers to contest against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. She said her decision to contest was not to win the election, but it was an opportunity to ask the Chief Minister why justice was denied to her. The people of Dharmadam should know about the injustice meted out to her and the hardships she faced, she said. The mother asked why the officers who had been found guilty of sabotaging the case were still being protected. The Central Bureau of Investigation taking over the case was the result of her strong protest, she said. To a question whether she would seek support from other parties, she said the Walayar strike committee would take a decision on this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/walayar-mother-alleges-threat-to-life/article34104363.ece

Soon after filing the papers, Mr. Joseph began campaigning by visiting religious leaders and prominent persons in the segment. The Congress ‘A’ faction, which is against his candidature, kept off the campaigning. The constituency is traditionally allocated with the Congress ‘A, which proposed Sony Sebastian as the candidate. However, the party decided to nominate Mr. Joseph, said to be a confidant of Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal. Senior Congress leaders K.C. Joseph, the outgoing MLA of Irikkur, and M.M. Hassan, UDF convener, held discussions with the Congress (A) leaders, but failed to placate them. The party is now banking on Oommen Chandy, who will arrive in Kannur on Friday, for conciliatory talks. Mr. Chandy will also hold talks with K. Sudhakaran, State Congress working president, who had put the blame of the controversy on Mr. Venugopal. On Tuesday, the Congress ‘A’ leaders had organised a separate convention at Sreekantapuram and decided to ask the high command to field Mr. Sebastian in the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sajeev-joseph-files-papers-despite-protests/article34104364.ece
19 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Mobile vaccination units soon||Mobile vaccination units will begin functioning soon in the district to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to people over the age of 60. The units are expected to be rolled out in about two days, said Dr. M. G. Sivadas, nodal officer for vaccination. Training sessions are under way for health workers who are part of the units. Five mobile teams have been readied. Each team will comprise a doctor, nurse, and a junior health inspector. The mobile teams will first cater for residents of all old age homes in the district. There are around 146 such homes, Dr. Sivadas said, and of them, around 25 are large ones with around 30 to 40 residents. The drive will then be expanded to different pockets of the district with the help of residents’ associations. Over 6 lakh people in the district are over 60 years of age, and nearly 1 lakh among them have already taken the first dose of the vaccine. The district administration aims to administer the vaccine to all people over 60 in one month. Mass camps A total of 126 vaccination centres are currently running. Of these, 75 are government-run, and 51 are at private hospitals. Mass vaccination camps have begun functioning at Piravom, Angamaly, Pachalam, Amrita Arts and Science College, and the YMCA Hall on Chittoor Road. New camps will begin soon at Fort Kochi and Muvattupuzha, Dr. Sivadas said. The mass vaccination camps will be expanded to more local bodies in the district. No adverse events following immunisation have been reported in the district, after the second phase of vaccination began with people over 60 and people over 45 with co-morbidities being vaccinated, he said. 206 recoveries Ernakulam recorded 184 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, and 6,730 samples were sent for testing. Two health workers and a police officer tested positive. Fifteen people tested positive from Thripunithura, 12 from Palluruthy, nine from Thrikkakara, and eight each from Kalamassery and Rayamangalam. The source of infection could not be traced in two cases. With 206 recoveries on Thursday, the active caseload is 2,866. A total of 10,565 people remain in quarantine. While 27 patients are admitted at the Government Medical College Hospital, 26 are at PVS Hospital, nine are at the Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital, and 141 patients are at private hospitals. As many as 2,319 people are recovering at home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mobile-vaccination-units-soon/article34104787.ece
19 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||HC directive on varsity postings||The Kerala High Court has held that while making appointments to temporary posts of university assistants, either through contractual appointment or on daily wage basis, universities should give preference to candidates included on rank lists prepared by the Public Service Commission (PSC) for the sanctioned posts of university assistants. The court on Thursday made it clear that the notifications calling for applicants to such temporary posts should clearly indicate that due preference would be given to the candidates included on a current rank list. The court ordered that they would have no claim whatsoever on any regularisation or permanent absorption solely based on such engagement. In Cusat The orders were passed on an appeal by C.V. Biju of Koothattukulam who had figured on the rank list prepared by the PSC for appointment to the post of university assistants in various universities. He had challenged the contractual appointments in the post of assistants in universities. He contended that though there was a valid rank list in force, the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) had created 42 temporary posts of university assistants. The appeal was against the single judge’s verdict dismissing his plea.  The court pointed out that the rank list in which the petitioner had found a place had already expired. However, some of the temporary posts of university assistants were created when the rank list was valid. The university took the stand that appointment through the PSC was applicable only for the sanctioned posts and the temporary posts were filled through contract appointments. The court also directed the university to accommodate the petitioner in the temporary vacancy that would arise on April 21, 2021, or thereafter, in the university.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-directive-on-posting-varsity-assistants-on-contract/article34104298.ece
19 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Cong. banks yet again on Satheesan in Paravur||Paravur has always favoured the Congress. But winds of change have swept across the segment on a few occasions, as the CPI, the second biggest constituent in the Left Democratic Front (LDF), won it five times. It was kind of family affair for the Communist Party of India (CPI), when it won the seat through N. Sivan Pillai for the first time in 1957. On two more occasions, the CPI leader won the seat for his party in 1982 and 1987 before handing down the mantle to his son, P. Raju. Following in the footsteps of his father, Mr. Raju won the seat twice, in 1991 and 1996. Incidentally, it was a young congressman, V.D. Satheesan, whom Mr. Raju trounced in the 1996 polls, when the CPI won the seat last. The next five years witnessed the resurgence of the Congress in the constituency led by Mr. Satheesan, who worked at the grassroots levels to retain the seat. In what could be considered as a case of sweet political revenge, Mr. Satheesan defeated Mr. Raju in 2001. Since then, Mr. Satheesan has not looked back. Failed attempts Efforts by the Left Democratic Front to end the winning streak of the Congress and Mr. Satheesan never succeeded. Attempts by the CPI to win back the constituency through Panniyan Raveendran, one of its popular leaders, too failed. Mr. Raveendran had to concede defeat in 2011, as he fell 11,349 votes short of his political rival, who had by then established himself in the constituency. Five years ago, Mr. Satheesan repeated his success story in the constituency by defeating Sarada Mohan, daughter of the late CPI veteran P.K. Vasudevan Nair. Impressive margin What made the fourth straight victory of Mr. Satheesan impressive was his winning margin, which he doubled when compared to the 2011 polls. The last Assembly elections witnessed Mr. Satheesan emerging victorious by a margin of 20,364 votes. With the stage set again for a political battle, the Congress High Command did not have to think twice before field Mr. Satheesan as its candidate in Paravur, which consists of Chendamangalam, Chittattukara, Ezhikkara, Kottuvally, Puthanvelikkara, Varapuzha and Vadakkekara panchayats. Local leader Though there were reports that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] may demand Paravur from the CPI, eventually, it remained with the later. After much deliberations, the CPI has named its local leader, M.T. Nikson, a trade union leader of the AITUC, to take on Mr. Satheesan. In the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the seat went to the BDJS, which has fielded A.B. Jayaprakash, the district president of the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-banks-yet-again-on-satheesan-in-paravur/article34104797.ece
19 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Candidates lay emphasis on development projects||Development was the buzzword. While T.J. Vinod, sitting MLA and UDF candidate in the Ernakulam Assembly constituency, sought votes for a major urban transport project linking road, rail and water transport, LDF’s Shaji George was worried about the marginalised sections and those who were left out of development projects. At the same time, Padmaja S. Menon, the NDA candidate, urged voters to reject both LDF and UDF, who, according to her, had failed to address the development needs of the city. Coming together at a meet-the-candidates programme organised by the Ernakulam Press Club here on Thursday, the three also shared their dreams about the constituency. Mr. Vinod said his priority during the last one-and-a-half years as legislator was to complete the projects initiated by his predecessor, Hibi Eden. He also listed the development projects implemented in the constituency under various schemes, including those funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The opposition was not to KIIFB as such but foreign funds raised by the board, said Mr. Vinod. Mr. George, who raised the issue of drinking water scarcity in some parts of the constituency, especially Cheranalloor, felt that an effective public transport system was needed for meeting the travel needs of thousands who commute to the city for work. There are several colonies in the city which have never featured in the development map. An inclusive development model needs to be developed for Ernakulam, he felt. Ms. Padmaja said the Centre was willing to convert Kochi into a world-class city by developing infrastructure, including roads. The UDF and LDF legislators never evinced interest in the development needs of Ernakulam. Given a chance, the NDA will effectively address all issues plaguing the constituency, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/candidates-lay-emphasis-on-development-projects/article34104791.ece

The vessels were intercepted on the basis of reliable information. A Dornier aircraft, usually used for extended maritime surveillance, which operated from the Southern Naval Command tracked seven fishing boats 90 nautical miles south west of Minicoy Islands during the past eight days. The aircraft passed regular inputs to Navy and Coast Guard personnel, who in close coordination with Lakshadweep Administration conducted a swift operation, intercepting three boats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ak-47-ammunition-seized/article34104291.ece

The recipient of the heart suffered from dilated cardiomyopathy, and the transplant surgery at Lisie Hospital was successful, and the heart was beating without external help. The team performing the surgery was led by Dr. Jose Chacko Periappuram, cardio thoracic surgeon. The 18-year-old, a native of Kayamkulam who was being treated at a hospital outside the State, had recently arrived seeking treatment at Lisie Hospital, a hospital spokesperson said. The patient was immediately registered for transplant and did not have to suffer through a long wait, the spokesperson added. The donor, a 25-year-old native of Kanyakumari, was injured in an accident and was declared brain-dead at KIMS Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, on Wednesday evening. Lisie Hospital was informed of the declaration and the possibility of transplant through the Kerala Network for Organ Sharing (KNOS). A four-member team left for the capital from Kochi at 10 a.m. on Thursday, and the procedure to harvest the heart began around 3 p.m. This is the third time in around a year that a helicopter rented by the State government is being used to transport a harvested organ for transplant. It was carried out once in May and again in July last year. The helicopter landed at Hotel Grand Hyatt helipad at Bolgatty at 6.15 p.m., and the harvested heart was taken to the hospital through a green corridor set up by the police. The ambulance, for which a separate track on the road and police escort were arranged, arrived at the hospital in just 3.5 minutes, said K. Laljy, Assistant Commissioner of Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brain-dead-persons-heart-flown-in/article34104789.ece
19 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kerala society needs more enlightenment||The Left Democratic Front (LDF) by far has the determination and sense of purpose to fight the twin evils of fast-spreading communalism and unbridled powers enjoyed by multinational companies. Talking to The Hindu at his residence here, Prof. Sanoo said the Congress is wallowing in casteism, while the BJP leaves none in doubt about its communal agenda. Prof. Sanoo laments that the increasing communal hatred and religious consciousness undermine the progress made by the State through the Sree Narayana movement, while multinational companies are monopolising even thoughts. The biggest armour of freedom is the ability to think and the multinational companies are taking control of it through money power. Guru’s influence He says the BJP could not make much progress in the State so far because there lived a man here who spread the idea that the goodness of man is more important than his religion, though that idea has seen a setback of late. “May be the Kerala society is not so enlightened as it is made out to be. Take for instance the case of Emergency and how in the ensuing election the tormentors still won despite facing a campaign in which the clandestinely run torture centres and the extrajudicial killing of Rajan were exposed. Even then there were people, including writers, who justified the horrors of the Emergency,” says Prof. Sanoo.  Prof. Sanoo, who successfully contested as a Left-backed Independent candidate from the Ernakulam Assembly constituency beating A.L. Jacob of the Congress by a handsome margin in 1987, feels that he may not have ventured into an election adventure had it been proposed in the current socio-political climate. “Politics then was fought on ideals and was not communal. I could garner votes beyond religious and political affiliations. At a time when the LDF was accused of politicising everything from literature and culture, I felt it was my responsibility to give a cultural spin to politics,” says Prof. Sanoo. He says that while casting vote is a democratic duty, equally important is to elect non-corrupt and efficient candidates capable of working logically and cohesively for the betterment of the nation and the constituency. However, Prof. Sanoo is outright dismissive when asked whether E. Sreedharan, the former principal adviser to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation who on retirement had joined the BJP, qualified as a suitable candidate on account of his image as efficient and not corrupt. “With all due respect to Mr. Sreedharan, one has to say he would be better off restricting himself to his area of expertise and that his choice is not right,” he says while drawing on the allegory of how a man, despite his virtues, would still be wrong and unacceptable if he were to back a barbaric custom such as Sathi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-society-needs-more-enlightenment/article34104348.ece

The arrested was identified as Fazil, 31, of Thrissur. He was nabbed after kilometres-long chase while trying to flee with a car stolen from Angamaly Junction. The car had been parked with the key still in ignition. The owner raised an alarm on seeing his car being driven away. The highway police, who happened to pass through the area then, gave the accused a chase. He then tried to escape after abandoning the car near the KSRTC complex, and the police personnel pursued him. The accused scaled the wall of the KSRTC bus station and entered the government hospital premises and hired an autorickshaw from the stand and fled towards Kalady. The police followed him in another autorickshaw and their vehicle. They eventually intercepted the accused, who took to his heels, but was overpowered. A team comprising Sub Inspectors T.K. Joshy and C.T. Shaiju, Assistant Sub Inspector O.A.

This itself suggests that the case has not yet been settled,” he pointed out.

19 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Acid test for party chiefs in watershed polls||In a charged electoral atmosphere, the State chiefs of mainstream political parties that are leading the three coalitions are in a way facing an acid test in the State’s Assembly polls. Incidentally, all three of them — Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran, CPI(M) State acting secretary A. Vijayaraghavan and BJP State president K. Surendran — were at the helm in the three-tier local body elections in December 2020 as well. Perhaps, the outcome of the polls would change the fate of the organisational structure of the Congress and the BJP, going by the past history of these parties. Aftermath of 2016 polls Congress leader V.M. Sudheeran resigned as KPCC president in March 2017 after the Congress-led UDF was routed in the 2016 Assembly polls. Similarly, Kummanam Rajasekharan, who was the State BJP president from 2015 to 2018, was unceremoniously asked to step down and apparently exiled to take up the gubernatorial post in Mizoram. The intervention of the RSS leadership helped him return to State politics. Only Mr. Ramachandran was a party chief during the Lok Sabha polls of 2019, while Mr. Vijayaraghavan took charge after Kodiyeri Balakrishnan went on medical leave. But Mr. Balakrishnan’s detractors had alleged that the move was a politically motivated decision aimed at damage control following the arrest of his younger son in a Bengaluru drug case. Likewise, deliberations within the BJP central leadership for long resulted in Mr. Surendran coming into the picture in February 2020. This again after the undignified removal of the then party chief P.S. Sreedharan Pillai a few months after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The sequel played the same tune — he was made Governor of Mizoram. Holding an advantage Unlike his counterparts, Mr. Vijayaraghavan enjoys the muscular machinery of the CPI(M) and the rainbow coalition of ruling Left Democratic Front that resulted in it comfortably surviving the three-tier local body polls last year. And he will continue to have that advantage in the Assembly polls too. On the other hand, Mr. Ramachandran faces a seemingly difficult task as the Congress camp is marred by serious operational shortcomings. But the active presence of party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi will possibly give momentum to the campaign of the Congress-led coalition. In the case of Mr. Surendran, who is for the first time in the BJP contesting two Assembly seats, his stint demands higher expectations as the BJP central leadership wants the party to win enough number of seats to influence the formation of the next government. The BJP will have to cash in on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And among these three party chiefs, he is the only one in the electoral fray.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/acid-test-for-party-chiefs-in-watershed-polls/article34104338.ece
19 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Surveillance teams step up checks in rural areas||Besides aggressively covering urban areas, the static surveillance team and special flying squads constituted as part of poll surveillance have improved their presence in village areas to prevent possible chances of illegal money transfers, and distribution of gifts and other valuables. Instead of camping at a particular spot, the squads are changing checking points frequently to cover the maximum area. A member of the static surveillance team said the police were providing good field support to intensify checks. Other than State and national highways, the squad would also cover rural pocket roads for surprise checks, he said. Following the Election Commission’s stringent guidelines, no valuables or cash found in the absence of valid documents during such inspections would be given back without the screening of a district-level special committee. At the same time, those carrying relevant documents would be able to clear the proceedings at the spot. Static surveillance team members said there were arrangements in place to ensure the speedy release of seized valuables or cash on the production of relevant documents by the owners concerned. If financial malpractices or unaccounted transfers were found, the details would be handed over to the GST squad, they added. The members of the flying squad said banking transactions were also being closely monitored. The officials said those carrying out legal financial transactions for property registration or purchase would not have to worry as the enforcement action would not affect them. All records related to the transactions should be kept for verification as verbal claims would not be taken into account for any proceedings, they added. In Kozhikode, the checking squads have so far seized Rs. 31.53 lakh during inspections held in various constituencies. The total amount seized on Wednesday was Rs. 4.30 lakh. According to officials, the majority of the cash holders were found not carrying any document to prove the source of money. Till the submission of documents, it would be treated as “unaccounted” money, they said.

19 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Silver screen stardust in focus this poll season||A jinx was finally broken in the general elections of 2014. Actor Innocent’s spectacular victory at Chalakudy was perhaps the first in Kerala for a film star with no political legacy to boast of. Even when other southern States such as Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh elected popular stars as Chief Ministers, Malayalis preferred to view cinema and politics separately. They loved their stars yes, but perhaps not enough to make them MPs or MLAs just for their stardom. Even Innocent’s landmark win over P.C. Chacko, then of the Congress, came as an Independent candidate supported by the Left Democratic Front. But his huge popularity as an actor also counted: in the previous elections, Congress candidate K.P. Dhanapalan had won the constituency by a margin of more than 70,000 votes. Innocent did what the late fellow actor Murali could not. The national award winner had contested from Alappuzha in the 1999 Parliament elections as CPI(M) candidate, but lost to V.M. Sudheeran of the Congress. Two years later, K.B. Ganesh Kumar, then of the United Democratic Front, won from Pathanapuram in the Assembly elections, and then three more times, but that evidently had to do more with his political legacy — as R. Balakrishna Pillai’s son — than stardom. In the previous Assembly elections, his main opponents were both actors – Jagadeesh (Congress) and Bheeman Raghu (BJP). That year’s elections also saw actor Mukesh winning from Kollam on the CPI(M) ticket. Innocent’s victory seemed to have lent confidence both to cine-stars and political parties. Joining Mukesh, who is contesting from Kollam again this time, in the fray are his tinsel town colleagues Dharmajan (from Balussery for the Congress), Suresh Gopi (Thrissur, BJP) and Krishnakumar (Thiruvananthapuram, BJP). Besides, playback singer Daleema Jojo, who shot to fame for her voice resembling that of veteran singer S. Janaki, is the CPI(M) candidate for the Aroor seat. New faces No previous elections in Kerala have had as many stars as contestants as this time, while some have also joined political parties ahead of the campaign. Devan, who could not make much of a headway after floating his own party, has joined the BJP, while Ramesh Pisharody, who has formed a successful comic act along with Dharmajan, has joined the Congress(I). Before long, Edavela Babu and director Major Ravi, who had been a vocal supporter of the BJP earlier, were spotted at the Congress’s State-wide rally spearheaded by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala. Actor-scenarist Sreenivasan and director Siddique have joined the advisory board of corporate-backed political party Twenty20, which is now debuting in the Assembly elections. Kerala has indeed come a long way since the days when the world record-breaking yesteryear star Prem Nazir chose not to contest polls despite joining the Congress. At that time, a senior Congress leader had said: “He is a nice man. But if we field Nazir in a Kerala election campaign, it will backfire on us.” Three decades on, no political leader is likely to air such a conclusion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/silver-screen-stardust-in-focus-this-poll-season/article34104344.ece
19 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||A young blood up against battle-hardened veterans||After a long period, the prestigious Kozhikode North Assembly constituency is witnessing a three-cornered contest this time, thanks to the profile of the three candidates — two-time Mayor of Kozhikode Thottathil Raveendran of the CPI(M), BJP State general secretary M.T. Ramesh and K.M. Abhijith of the Congress. Affable and accessible, Mr. Raveendran had an impeccable record as chairman of the Guruvayur Devaswom Board. Mr. Ramesh is a familiar face of his party in Kerala’s political space, while Mr. Abhijith, perhaps the youngest contestant in this election at 26 years of age, is the dynamic State president of the Kerala Students’ Union. In the last two elections, the CPI(M)'s popular legislator A. Pradeepkumar seemed invincible since his successful and maiden electoral run in the constituency, the erstwhile Kozhikode I, against Congress leader A. Sujanapal in 2006. Since then, Kozhikode city has seen massive development activities, metamorphosing it from an overgrown town to an aspiring metropolis. Thus, the spadework for Mr. Raveendran's campaign has already been done in the constituency. And if he wins, certainly, the credit goes to Mr. Pradeepkumar, whom the party had considered to field for the fourth time in a row. But then, the CPI(M) decided to abide by the two-term policy for its candidates. For Mr. Raveendran, this is his first electoral attempt to the Assembly. Edge over rivals Mr. Raveendran’s rivals believe they can take him on only politically in an urban electorate segment where votes easily swing. In this context, the BJP is employing all its resources to make the polls a battle between Mr. Ramesh and Mr. Raveendran, rather than a three-cornered contest. The party has its own reasons to cite — in the December 2020 civic polls, the CPI(M)-led LDF won 23 divisions of the Kozhikode Corporation, the BJP, five and the Congress-led UDF, four in the Assembly constituency. Mr. Ramesh had unsuccessfully contested to the Assembly and the Lok Sabha in the past. But can Mr. Abhijith's maiden electoral fray work in his favour?

19 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Cong. dissident files papers as Independent in Elathur||Putting the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) on the spot, rebel leader U.V. Dinesh Mani filed his nomination as an Independent candidate in Elathur Assembly constituency on Thursday. The official UDF candidate Sulfikkar Mayuri, State vice president of the newly floated Nationalist Congress Kerala (NCK) led by Mani C. Kappan, also filed his nomination in Elathur. The decision of the Congress State leadership, which had offered the Elathur seat to the new partner under the seat-sharing pact, had led to protests in the constituency. Mr. Mani, an influential local leader in the segment, is no novice to electoral politics although this is his maiden contest in the Assembly polls. He was Chelannur block panchayat president and member of the Thalakulatoor grama panchayat. He filed his papers after resigning from the executive body of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC). Previously, the KPCC had zeroed in on Mr. Mani’s candidature, but the UDF was compelled to offer the Elathur segment to the NCK, when Mr. Kappan demanded two seats for his party, including Pala where he is seeking re-election. Attempts to pacify the Congress local leaders in Elathur not only remained futile but also led to resignations of the office-bearers of block and mandalam committees.  Meanwhile, KPCC general secretary K.P. Anilkumar has warned that disciplinary action will be taken against dissidents. The seat that was allotted to a constituent would not be taken back, he said.  NCP leader and Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran is the Left Democratic Front candidate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-dissident-files-papers-as-independent-in-elathur/article34104288.ece
19 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Serving up a more lenient system||The restaurant industry in the State wants the next government to study ground level issues and find solutions rather than impose bans without foresight. Struggling to survive post COVID-19 lockdown and grapple with the GST imposed on them, the industry wants whichever party that comes to power to address the issues in connection with the pollution it is alleged to cause and put pressure on the Centre for a more lenient GST system. Perhaps, the sector has more issues with the Centre than with the State, and GST is their primary concern. When GST for merchants who have chosen composition fee is 1%, it continues to be 5% for the restaurant sector. “We pay composition fee from our pockets so that we don’t have to levy it from the customer. This especially affects the smaller restaurants,” says G. Jayapal, State secretary, Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association. Despite handling a lot of production every day, restaurants have been included in the service sector by the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Department. Post lockdown, there was an announcement that the service sector would get the same benefits as the production sector, but it has not materialised. “Getting the benefits of the production sector will help us a lot in terms of GST and loan benefits,” says Mr. Jayapal, adding that the State should exert pressure on the Centre to solve these problems. A major tug of war between the sector and the State is the issue of pollution. Restaurants are often booked for discharging water into nearby drains even as they ask for an alternative. “Constructing sewage treatment plants is not viable for small restaurants and eateries. What should they do with the water, which is not really polluted but unusable,” asks Mr. Jayapal, a restaurant owner for 20 years.  Ban on plastic The ban on plastic is another sore matter. The association supports the ban, but wants the government to provide alternatives. “Plantain leaves are not available in enough quantities. Aluminium-coated packets are also plastic. What should we use instead to package food,” he asked. While star hotels have been provided discounts in electricity charges to combat the COVID-19-induced crisis, small hotels get no such benefits. “It is the small hotels that nurture a healthy food culture, not the new-generation eateries that concentrate only on cleanliness,” Mr.Jayapal said.  We pay composition fee from our pockets so that we don’t have to levy it from the customerG.

In his letter to the UGC, university Syndicate member P. Rasheed Ahammed alleged that the reservation policy for differently abled people and community candidates had been flouted in the notification issued by the university for the recruitment of teaching staff. He claimed that the university had earlier intimated the government that it had four backlog vacancies for differently abled persons and 29 such posts for various communities eligible for reservation. The UGC too had directed the institution to fill these vacancies. As per Rule 15 of the Kerala State and Subordinate Rules, 1958, the appointing authority has to issue ‘no-candidate available’ (NCA) notification to fill the backlog vacancies, if any. The Minister for Higher Education too had made it clear to fill them. However, the university issued notification for recruiting teaching staff without considering the backlog vacancies. Mr. Ahammed claimed that though he had sought to revoke this move, the authorities did not pay heed to it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/backlog-posts-ugc-seeks-reply-from-calicut-varsity/article34104295.ece

19 March 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||‘Psyche of Kerala is above communalism, sectarianism’||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), the largest constituent in the United Democratic Front (UDF) after the Congress, appears well set to take on the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Assembly election. Its Malappuram district president Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal has proved time and again that he can lead the party from the front. Back from a week-long pre-election rally that pulled large crowds across Malappuram, Mr. Thangal displayed his unwavering leadership skills through the IUML’s candidate selection. In a candid chat with The Hindu , Mr. Thangal says the IUML was facing this election with the utmost socio-political responsibility that it had faced never before in its history.  Why so important? What makes the upcoming election different from the past ones?  Never did we have a dictatorial regime like what we witnessed in the last five years. The LDF had ruled Kerala several times before. But never did Kerala see an autocratic government. The political ethos existing in the State does not favour a dictatorial regime. The people want to regain the glory of democratic spirit. Do you think political parties are responsible for the communal polarisation taking place in the State? Are Muslim splinter groups responsible for it? The CPI(M) and BJP are leading from the front to tear apart the famed communal fabric of Kerala for their narrow political gains. Whether in power or not, parties should desist from such nefarious moves. The attempts to destroy communal equilibrium cannot be allowed at any cost. No Muslim splinter group can win in their attempt to create communal divide when strong political fronts exist in the State. The psyche of Kerala is above communalism and sectarianism. How do you pitch the IUML as a political party in the present context? The IUML has the most significant role today than ever before. We have a responsibility to safeguard society against forces of sectarianism and communalism. We have always upheld communal harmony and never sacrificed political integrity for power. When the Babrid Masjid was pulled down, we upheld patriotism and communal peace over religious emotions. In a historic move, the party has given a seat to a woman this time after 25 years. How could you circumvent the socio-religious hurdles you faced? Out of 140 Assembly members, there were only nine women. How could you single out the IUML for the neglect towards women? All parties have been responsible. By sending a woman to Assembly after quarter of a century, what message are you trying to convey? Times are changing. Women empowerment is important. Women’s voice should be heard. Women face a lot of problems. We are for their empowerment, and they should be given representation. As a young leader, can you assure that there will be more women legislators from IUML in the coming years? This is a good beginning. We will never ignore women. There will definitely be change. We all will have to change in tune with the changing times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/psyche-of-kerala-is-above-communalism-sectarianism/article34104373.ece

19 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||City development will be the main poll plank here||Which way will Thiruvananthapuram swing is the hotly debated question as the urban constituency prepares for this year’s Assembly elections. Capital city development, a perennial bone of contention, will be high on the campaign agenda of the three contesting fronts as they gear up for the battle on April 6. V.S. Sivakumar of the Congress had claimed the Assembly constituency for the United Democratic Front (UDF) in 2011 and 2016. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) this time harbours strong hopes of upsetting the UDF applecart this time. Once again, Mr. Sivakumar will be facing the LDF candidate Antony Raju of the Janadhipathya Kerala Congress, whom he had defeated in 2016. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has chosen actor Krishnakumar as the party’s candidate. A bit of history The Thiruvananthapuram Assembly constituency, as we know it today, is relatively young. Thiruvananthapuram and Vattiyurkavu segments were shaped from Thiruvananthapuram North, Thiruvananthapuram West and Thiruvananthapuram East constituencies that ceased to exist following delimitation. It was from Thiruvananthapuram East that B. Vijayakumar of the Congress won in 1991, 1996 and 2001. Thiruvananthapuram North gifted victories to M. Vijayakumar of the CPI(M) in 1987, 1991, 1996 and 2006. Till 2006 M.M. Hassan of the Congress won from Thiruvananthapuram West in 1987 and 1991 and M. V. Raghavan of the CMP in 2001. The three constituencies saw battle in their old avatars for the last time in 2006. That year, M. Vijayakumar and V. Sivankutty claimed North and East for the CPI(M), while V. Surendran Pillai won in the West. In the fight for the new Thiruvananthapuram constituency in 2011, UDF’s V.S. Sivakumar defeated Mr. Surendran Pillai by 5,352 votes. Mr. Sivakumar repeated the feat in 2016, this time defeating Antony Raju of the LDF by 10,905 votes. In recent years, the BJP also has sought to increase its influence in the region. B. K. Sekhar of the BJP had stood third here in 2011, winning 11,519 votes. In 2016, the party's decision to field cricketer S. Sreesanth had drawn national attention to the battle for Thiruvananthapuram. Sreesanth was pushed to the third spot, but he managed to secure 34,764 votes. Lok Sabha polls The Assembly segment favoured the UDF in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Shashi Tharoor won 57,077 votes in the constituency, while Kummanam Rajasekharan of the BJP managed 42,877 votes and C. Divakaran of the LDF, 27,530. Geographically, the Thiruvananthapuram Assembly constituency borders Nemom in the south, Vattiyurkavu and Kazhakuttam in the north and the Arabian Sea in the west. The constituency is made up of 25 of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation wards, which include main city areas as well as a number of coastal wards. The electorate As per the final voters’ list published on January 20, the constituency has 2,00,281 electors, including 97,179 men, 1,03,079 women and 23 transgender voters. The numbers are likely to go up once the integrated voters’ list, incorporating additions, is published.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-development-will-be-the-main-poll-plank-here/article34104926.ece

United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate Padmaja Venugopal and Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate P.

Confusion in finalising the NDA candidate and his ill health has delayed the action hero’s entry into the poll scene.

Accompanied by Bharatiya Janata Party workers on motorcycles, he reached the Collectorate to file the nomination. The Centre was planning legislation on the Sabarimala issue.

Leaders to reach Meanwhile, the UDF and LDF candidates are busy campaigning. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will reach here on Saturday to energise the LDF camp. “There is a favourable wave for the LDF in the constituency. It is not just because of the food kit or pension, people want continuation of the LDF government. The five-year tenure of Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar has increased the scope for the LDF in the constituency,” said Mr. Balachandran. Top leaders of the Congress will reach the constituency in the coming days. Ms. Venugopal, who started campaigning even before the party officially announced her candidature, is quite sure about her chance this time. “A pro-UDF wave is sweeping the State. Its reflection will be clear in the constituency too,” she said. Along with traditional campaign methods such as posters, notices, public meetings and door-to-door visits, social media too are used actively by the candidates. Parties are organising roadshows in many areas. Controversies over seat sharing have not affected the constituency as there was not much difference of opinion about the candidates.

19 March 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||J.C. Prabhakar Reddy elected Tadipatri Municipal Chairman||Amid a tense atmosphere and unprecedented security for the election of the Tadipatri Municipal Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson, Telugu Desam Party candidates came out victorious on Thursday with former MLA J.C. Prabhakar Reddy elected as Chairman and P. Saraswati as Deputy Chairperson. The fear of last-minute jumping of fences by ward members seemed so real that even in the Tadipatri Municipal Council Hall there was a high-rise ‘mesh’ barricading while the Dharmavaram Revenue Divisional Officer G.R. Madhusudhan administered the oath of office at a time commonly and later conducted the election process. While Mr. Prabhakar Reddy got 20 votes (18 elected ward members of TDP, one each of CPI and Independent) the YSR Congress Party candidate Heerapuram Fayaz Basha got 18 votes (including that of two ex-officio members). Similarly, the YSRCP had fielded Pula Rupa (who had won by toss) as Deputy Chairperson candidate against P. Saraswati (9th Ward). The TDP candidates were declared elected. Second term This is the second term Mr. Prabhakar Reddy will be serving as the Chairman. He was elected as Chairman in 2004 and as Deputy Chairman in 2009. In 2014, he was elected as the Tadipatri MLA. The statement of in-charge Minister Botcha Satyanarayana on Wednesday that the Independent candidate could vote as per his will, had generated curiosity among people as to which way would he vote. More than 600 police personnel guided by Tadipatri DSP V.N.K. Chaitanya and Anantapur DSP G. Veeraraghava Reddy guarded all the roads leading to the Municipal Council Hall and did not allow any unauthorised person to come anywhere near. State Election Observers Joint Collectors Harshvardhan and A. Siri watched the entire process. The district administration and the police did not leave anything to chance during the election process as the TDP had only a thin majority of two votes and in view of the rivalry between Tadipatri MLA Kethireddy Peddareddy (also an ex-officio member) and J.C. Prabhakar Reddy. Precedent During the election of Zilla Parishad Chairperson in 2005, two TDP ZPTC members had jumped over the wooden barricades built then and voted in favour of Congress candidate Thopudurthi Kavitha and she won. About a couple of months ago, the Tadipatri MLA Kethireddy Peddareddy had barged into the office-cum-residence of Mr. Prabhakar Reddy during his absence, with police personnel in tow. Keeping this in view, in addition to barricading with steel and wooden poles, officials put up a plastic mesh to divide the three groups, the YSRCP members, the TDP and the CPI along with the Independent. Media was not allowed into the council hall and the Information and Public Relations officials were confined to one slot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jc-prabhakar-reddy-elected-tadipatri-municipal-chairman/article34104881.ece

Of the total 86 posts of Mayor and Chairperson, 40 were given to the BCs and 12 for minorities. Women were allotted 52 posts on the whole. “It is a record that the BCs have been given higher priority in Andhra Pradesh than the so-called BC States, or any other State government in the country,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy observed. “The TDP government had used the BCs like a vote bank. On the contrary, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has given due recognition to the weaker sections in conformity to his observation that the BCs are ‘Backbone Classes’ in reality,” he said. Mydukur issue On Mydukur Municipality, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said the YSRCP, with the support of the ex officio members, could win the chairperson post because the JSP councillor stood neutral. “We have not misused power anywhere. The Chief Minister has made it clear that there should be no abuse of power in Tadipatri and Mydukur. We will abide by the people’s mandate,” he added.

19 March 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Gurumoorthy rewarded for personal loyalty||The selection of Maddila Gurumoorthy as the YSR Congress Party’s (YSRCP) candidate for the ensuing byelection to the Tirupati (SC) Lok Sabha seat is seen as the party’s reward to the physiotherapist’s personal loyalty and affiliation to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his family. Dr. Gurumoorthy hails from an agricultural family in Mannasamudram village of Yerpedu mandal, falling under Srikalahasti Assembly Constituency. Thanks to the commitment of his non-literate parents to see their ward take up higher education, he completed Bachelor of Physiotherapy and Certified Manual Therapy course. He has been a close follower of the late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy since 2006, when he was studying at SVIMS University in Tirupati. He had even served in the campaign team of the party's honorary president Y.S. Vijayamma in the past. Dr. Gurumoorthy accompanied the Chief Ministerial candidate Jagan, when he took out the ‘Praja Sankalpa Yatra’ from November 2017 to Jan 2019, covering a whopping 3,648 km across the State. As Jagan’s personal physiotherapist, Dr. Gurumoorthy was in charge of providing succour after a day’s arduous trek in different terrains braving the hot sun and backbreaking meetings with the general public. Though Dr. Gurumoorthy’s candidature was officially announced just a few days back, his name started making rounds since the demise of Balli Durgaprasad. The official announcement came as no surprise at all, as the candidate has been touring all the seven Assembly constituencies (three in Chittoor and four in Nellore district) and meeting party leaders even before the word ‘go’ was uttered. Amidst reported reluctance, the TDP had already announced the name of former Union Minister Panabaka Lakshmi as its candidate, while CWC leader and former MP Chinta Mohan has already started touring the constituency. The CPI(M) has announced the name of Nellore Yadagiri, the SPSR Nellore district president of its Vyavasaya Karmika Sangam (VKS) as its candidate. However, the BJP continues to keep its cards close to the chest, with many candidates reportedly expressing eagerness to throw the hat into the ring.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gurumoorthy-rewarded-for-personal-loyalty/article34104869.ece

19 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Activists disappointed with MGNREGA wage revision||The Human Rights Forum (HRF) and Samalochana Association expressed their disappointment over the quantum of increase in the wage rate of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. “The increase in wages by a meagre Rs. 8, from the existing Rs. 237 to Rs. 245 a day, is measly and amounts to mere eyewash. We are concerned about the gap between the minimum wages stipulated in the Minimum Wages Act and the MGNREGA wages,” said V.S. Krishna of HRF. Not paying minimum wages in public works amounts to forced labour and it is deplorable that successive governments are unwilling to abide by Constitutional principles in the matter, said B. Chakradhar of Samalochana. A well-functioning NREGA with justified wages can work as a lifeline for rural workers. However, the unremunerative levels of NREGA wages, together with chronic shortage of work and delay in payments, are proving to be detrimental to a key objective of the NREGA which is to arrest distress migration, observed HRF members. It is well-known that the widespread disruption of economic activity caused due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many people to turn to MGNREGA in rural India. This insufficient increase in wage rate, that can only be termed as meagre and insensitive, does little to enhance relief or provide respite during the ongoing economic crisis, said Mr. Chakradhar. It is disappointing to see that the Government of India has chosen to write off mammoth debts of corporate firms but does not see fit to pay minimum wages commensurate with the Minimum Wages Act and allocate sufficient funds for NREGA implementation, they said. We demand enhancement of NREGA employment to 200 days to each household, payment of minimum wages under Minimum Wages Act and increase in the budgetary allocation to NREGA, the speakers said. Delinking of coffee decried HRF and Samalochana also took strong exception to the recent decision of the Union Government to disallow coffee plantation works under MGNREGA in the tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. This is unwarranted and would be extremely harmful to adivasi farmers as they would be losing out on around Rs. 15,000 per acre per year, said Mr. Chakradhar. According to him, over a lakh adivasi farmers would be rendered without wage support and would find it difficult to sustain themselves because of this move. After encouraging tribal farmers all these years to take up coffee plantation in a big way, this sudden decision to delink coffee from MGNREGA would mean most farmers will lose out on investments made so far, he said. “We urge the Central government to reverse the decision and appeal to the State government to support tribal farmers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/activists-disappointed-with-mgnrega-wage-revision/article34104971.ece

19 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Turnaround possible with a few policy changes, assert steel plant employees||It has been about 35 days since the employees of the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), have been agitating against the proposed 100% strategic sale of the only shore-based steel plant in the country by the Union Government. Even as the Centre is firm on going ahead with its proposal, the employees say that the “loss-making” steel plant will make a turnaround in a short span of two years, if only the Centre is willing to implement a few measures and bring in some policy changes. The steel plant has all the trappings of becoming a global giant. It can remain as a profitable public sector unit, says the employees, who have been agitating under various banners such as CITU, AITUC and BMS. Deficit budget “The steel plant is being given a step-brotherly treatment since its inception. It was established after 32 persons had laid down their lives for the cause during the ‘Visakha Ukku - Andhrula Hakku’ agitation in 1966,” says J. Ramakrishna, an employee and vice-president of the All India Steel Workers’ Federation (AISWF). Due to abnormal delay in completion of the steel plant on time, its estimated cost had gone up from Rs. 2,500 crore to Rs. 8,500 crore, he recalled. “The Union Government had always wanted to shelve the project citing escalation in costs. After much persuasion, it had agreed to bear only Rs. 4,000 crore. The remaining amount had to be souced from the market at higher interest rate. It had, therefore, been commissioned with a deficit budget. The steel plant was thus caught in a debt trap,” Mr. Ramakrishna said. “After paying up the initial loan of Rs. 4,500 crore, the VSP had obtained a loan of about Rs. 11,600 crore for expanding the plant from 3.3 MTPA to 7.3 MTPA. Every month, the plant pays around Rs. 220 crore towards interest, and this is escalating the production cost,” says Ch. Narasinga Rao of the Visakha Steel Parirakshana Porata Committee. The loan can be converted into equity to reduce the interest burden and the banks may be asked to consider giving the plant a three-year moratorium, say a few employees. “Measures such as these, and increasing the credit limit from Rs. 12,000 crore to Rs. 15,000 crore can change the fortunes of the plant,” the employees say. A two-year moratorium on GST and reduction on demurrage charges on rakes by the Indian Railways can do wonders, they observe. The VSP is, perhaps, the only major PSU steel plant without any captive iron ore mines, says Mr. Ramakrishna. The M.N. Dastur and Company, the consultant of the plant, in its detailed project report (DPR) in the early 1970s had clearly mentioned that the survival of the plant depended on the allotment of an iron ore block under the NMDC in Bailadila. “This has never happened. Moreover, when it was de-merged from SAIL in 1982, we had lost the mines that were under SAIL,” say the employees agitating under a makeshift tent in shifts. VSP needs 12 MT of iron ore annually for producing about 5.5 MT of steel. At present, the iron ore is being sourced at the market price that ranges from Rs. 4,500 per tonne to Rs. 7,000 per tonne, depending on the quality requirement and ferrous content. This apart, a transport cost of around Rs. 700 per tonne is being incurred, they say. “If the VSP has its own mines, the cost per tonne will come down by at least Rs. 1,500. This entails a huge saving in the production cost, which can lead to profits,” say Mr. Ramakrishna. The transport cost can also be brought down by laying a slurry pipeline. “The steel plant has always been put to difficulty. By bringing in a few policy changes, it can be retained under the CPSU as a profitable unit,” the employees say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/turnaround-possible-with-a-few-policy-changes-steel-plant-staff/article34104256.ece

Women comprised most of the newly-elected corporators. YSRCP corporator from Ward 58, G. Lavanya, said that she would try to make her ward a model ward among the other 98 wards in the GVMC limits.

19 March 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Miffed Vamsi Krishna to quit post||A large number of supporters of YSRCP leader Ch. Vamsi Krishna Srinivas staged a protest after the party leadership decided not to name him for the post of Mayor of Visakhapatnam, near the GVMC office here on Thursday. Speculation was rife that Mr. Yadav, who was elected as corporator from Ward 21, would be named the next Mayor after the ruling party won the municipal elections in the city with a comfortable majority. However, his hopes crumbled after the party declared G. Hari Venkata Kumari as Mayor on Thursday. Mr. Vamsi Krishna Yadav was visibly upset during the election process for the Mayor and Deputy Mayor at the council meeting in the GVMC office. Immediately after, he spoke to reporters and announced that he would be resigning from the post of YSRCP city president shortly. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Yadav said that he had agreed to contest in the municipal elections only after he was given an assurance by the party that he would be given the post of Mayor. He also alleged that some people in his party stopped him from becoming Mayor. “Earlier, some people within the party did the same thing and stopped the high command from giving me a ticket from Visakhapatnam East constituency in the Assembly elections, and the party suffered the consequences of that decision. Now, the same people have prevented me from becoming Mayor,” he alleged. ‘Will meet CM’ Mr. Yadav also said that he would meet Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy next week over the issue. Reacting over the development, Rajya Sabha MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy said that Mr. Yadav is close to everyone in the party and called him a hard worker. “He has been with the party for many years and the party will give him a good post following instructions from the Chief Minister,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/miffed-vamsi-krishna-to-quit-post/article34104977.ece

19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Govt. announces new drinking water project||In a major fillip to infrastructure for the twin cities, the government has announced a new project to bring more drinking water from Sunkesula near Nagarjunasagar at a total cost of Rs. 1,450 crore. An initial amount of Rs. 725 crore has been proposed in the budget presented by Finance Minister T. Harish Rao in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday. The government also proposed to allocate Rs. 1,000 crore for the second phase of Metro rail project, presumably for the much-awaited link to the RGI Airport at Shamshabad. Around Rs. 750 crore for land acquisition for taking up the proposed 348 km Regional Ring Road (RRR), Rs. 200 crore for the restoration of River Musi and beautification of the river front and another Rs. 250 crore for provision of drinking water to the newly-formed colonies within Outer Ring Road, are among the other important allocations announced. Mr. Harish Rao allotted a total of Rs. 15,030 crore for the Municipal Administration & Urban Development department with the government assuring to construct integrated vegetable and non-vegetable markets in all towns and cities akin to the one built in Gajwel at a combined cost of Rs. 500 crore and a renewed focus on building sufficient number of public toilets and modernise the identified cremation sites at a cost of Rs. 200 crore. The Minister said that the government has recognised the need to improve the facilities in urban areas and therefore, brought out the new Municipality Act specifying the powers and responsibilities of public representatives as well as the rules and regulations to ensure transparent urban administration. Construction of public toilets will be taken up on an extensive scale for the convenience of people and in this financial year, 9,216 public toilets were built making 14,020 toilets available for public use across the municipalities, corporations and GHMC. The objective is to have one toilet for 1,000 population and based on the necessity, more toilets will be constructed. An amount of Rs. 148 crore has been sanctioned every month for ‘Pattana Pragati’ so that the urban local bodies do not face any fund crunch. Mr. Rao claimed the government has formulated special plans for the development of Hyderabad and implementing them. This has resulted in the capital standing first for the second time in terms of social, economic, real estate and employment parameters as per “the study conducted at the international level”. Construction of nine flyovers, four under-passes and three road-over-bridges has been completed in the city. During COVID period, construction of flyovers, 300 km of roads and 29 link roads were completed at a cost of Rs. 2,000 crore, he said.

The government has also been providing meals at Rs. 5 to 55,000 persons daily through the 179 Annapurna canteens. He also claimed that government’s promise of providing 20,000 litres of free drinking water during the GHMC elections has reduced the financial burden on the poor and middle class. Therefore, Rs. 250 crore is being allocated for the same. Warangal Municipal Corporation is being given Rs. 250 crore and Khammam Rs. 150 crore for development works, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/new-drinking-water-project-announced/article34104747.ece
19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Budget formulated on expectations of higher GSDP||The State government has declared that the budget presented to the Assembly today was formulated on expectations that there would be significant improvement in Gross State Domestic Product of Telangana in the next financial year. In his budget speech, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao said the Gross Domestic Product is estimated to contract by 8% in 2020-21 due to coronavirus. In Telangana, the growth of Gross State Domestic Product is likely to be 1.3% while that of GDP at current prices in 2020-21 is estimated to be at minus 3.8%. With the availability of corona vaccine, the society is gradually recovering. The State economy is also on a gradual recovery path. It is expected that there would be significant improvement in GSDP of the State with these developments in the next financial year. As per advance estimates, GSDP at current prices in 2020-21 is estimated at Rs. 9.78 lakh crore. With the adverse impact of corona and lockdown, the growth of GSDP declined significantly from 13.5% in 2019-20 to 1.3 per cent in 2020-21. The national GDP growth declined from 7.8% to minus 3.8% in the same period. Compared with the national GDP growth, State’s GSDP growth is much better. With lot of foresight, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao took steps to stimulate the rural economy. The State government was able to prevent any adverse impact of corona on rural economy due to these efforts. The per capita income of Telangana is estimated to increase by 0.6% to Rs. 2.27 lakh in 2020-21 while the per capita income of the country is estimated to decline by 4.8% to Rs. 1.27 lakh. Thus, the per capita income of Telangana is higher than the country’s per capita income by Rs. 99,377. Despite adverse conditions, the Telangana per capita income showed increase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/budget-formulated-on-expectations-of-higher-gsdp/article34104763.ece
19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Budget has no allocations for flood-proofing the city||Post the destructive floods that rendered the city limp in October last year, one would have expected considerable allocations in the coming budget for ameliorating the situation in future. The Budget for the Financial Year 2021-22 presented by Minister T. Harish Rao on Thursday, however, does not show a single rupee allotment for development of either lakes or storm water drains in the city which are central requirement for making city flood proof. Massive economic cost accompanied the October floods, as thousands of people lost their homes and livelihoods, and government spent enormous amounts running into hundreds of crores of rupees on distribution of flood relief. Strangely though, the calamity and its aftermath have not inspired the government to allocate even a fraction of the cost incurred for preventive measures to address the situation adequately. Soon after the floods, in the first week of November, 2020, the Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao announced ‘Strategic Nala Development Plan’ (SNDP) as a dedicated project for studying the stormwater drains and taking measures for their improvement. Orders were issued towards constitution of a special wing for SNDP under GHMC, for planning, developing and maintaining a comprehensive storm water drainage or nala system in the city, towards mitigating adversities on account of heavy rains or urban floods in future. Retired chief engineer, Roads & Buildings, C. Vasantha was appointed as the head of the new wing. Close to five months after the announcement, SNDP does not have even office space to function from. Sources inform that the wing, which lacks staff, funds and wherewithal, functions from borrowed space at Buddha Bhavan, the same venue from where GHMC’s other wing for Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management functions with enviable opulence. Existence of such a wing as SNDP has long been out of public memory for all practical purposes, with no news about any meetings or reports coming forth post its constitution. As per the information available in the Socio-Economic Outlook-2021, the total amount spent on lake rejuvenation since 2014 is close to Rs. 377 crore, of which Rs. 289 crore has been spent on Hussainsagar alone. With no special allocations in budget thatinstead gave priority for Musi River Front Development, Metro Rail and Regional Ring Road, it seems that the storm water drains will have to wait more for redemption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/budget-has-no-allocations-for-flood-proofing-the-city/article34104753.ece

Harish Rao on Thursday with agriculture sector alone getting an outlay of Rs. 25,000 crore. It is the agriculture sector that has helped the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) not slipping into red as it did at national level. As the Minister said in his budget speech, the GSDP has registered a nominal growth of 1.3% in 2020-21, a sharp decline from 13.5% in 2019-20 due to impact of COVID-19 on the economy, against -3.8% at the national level from 7.8% growth achieved in the previous year. According to the socio economic outlook released by the government for 2021 along with the annual financial statement, the agriculture sector has contributed a phenomenal 20.9% to the GSDP in 2020-21 in spite of adverse conditions. At the national level the contribution of farm sector to the GDP is 3% in the fiscal about to conclude. In 2019-20, the contribution of farm sector to GSDP was 26.2%. “The average growth rate of farm sector during 2016-17 to 2020-21 has been 14.5%,” its is said in the document. “It can be said without hesitation that agriculture sector played an important role even in the difficult time of corona. This has become possible because of the steps taken to re-utilise agriculture and allied sectors since the formation of the State. The progressive initiatives in the agriculture sector have not gone in vain. It is clear, from the development achieved in spite of critical times, that every paisa spent on agriculture has been highly productive,” Mr. Harish Rao said describing the role of farm sector as part of his budget speech. Farm mechanisation Recognising the increasing importance of mechanisation in farming, the government has allocated Rs. 1,500 crore for incentivising farm mechanisation -- including purchase of machinery, tractors and tools. The Minister stated that a total of Rs. 14,644 crore subsidy was provided for the purpose during the last five years. Similarly, the allocation for Rythu Bandhu is Rs. 14,800 crore, Rs. 1,200 crore for Rythu Bima, Rs. 1,730 crore for animal husbandry, dairy development and fisheries. As announced in the last budget (2020-21), the government has allocated Rs. 5,225 crore for implementation of the second-phase of farm loan waiver during 2021-22. With the cultivation of paddy in 52.29 lakh acres this Rabi season, Telangana tops the country, followed by 25 lakh acres in Tamil Nadu and 20.9 lakh acres in Andhra Pradesh. “People who ridiculed that the Telangana farmers are incapable of farming are now jealous of significant development of agriculture sector in the State”, Mr. Harish Rao said in his budget speech.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farm-allied-sectors-get-priority-in-budget-allocations/article34104758.ece

When the allocation to the department is compared, this financial year’s budget increased by only Rs. 109 crore. In terms of percentage, it is a drop compared to the previous financial year. The State Health Department has been in the centre of attention among people from the past one year as people underwent COVID-19 tests, treatment, vaccination, at government health facilities. The scale of attention was never witnessed in the Health Department ever. People demanded more from the government health facilities. The Rs. 6,295 crore budget includes Rs. 3,883 crore for ‘Establishment Expenditure’ and Rs. 1,933 crore for ‘Scheme Expenditure’. One of the new features under finances ear marked under Director of Medical Education is funds for Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) which was established in Gachibowli after COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020.

19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Industry bodies upbeat as budget proposes Rs. 2,500 crore incentives||Telangana Budget 2021-22 has proposed Rs. 2,500 crore for industrial incentives, an announcement industry bodies welcomed since they have been impressing on the government, for sometime, to clear the pending dues to entrepreneurs who have established facilities. Finance Minister Harish Rao, in the speech, said an amount of Rs. 2,500 crore is being proposed in the Budget for industrial incentives. For the industrial sector, the Budget estimate is Rs. 3,077 crore, he added. He said while referring to how industries in Telangana have been progressing at an accelerated pace, thanks to TS-iPASS or the system the State government introduced about six years ago to accord time bound approvals for new projects. The TS-iPASS has speeded up the process of obtaining clearances for industries through the single window system. This has attracted attention at the international level. The faster issue of all clearances for industries through investor friendly policies has placed the State in third place in the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings, he said. Commending the Budget as people centric, pragmatic and bold budget, the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) president Ramkanth Inani said if implemented in earnest the amount proposed towards the industrial incentives is sufficient to clear a chunk of the pending dues. “We appreciate the government for allocating Rs. 2,500 crore towards industrial incentives on the repeated requests from FTCCI and also other industry chambers,” he said in a statement that also hailed the Budget for Rs. 25,000 crore and Rs. 16,900 crore allocation to the agriculture and irrigation sectors respectively. The proposal to construct airstrips in the tier II cities and the allocation of Rs. 100 crore towards is a welcome measure for regional development, he added. However, considering the power consumption by irrigation projects and the uninterrupted, free power supply to farmers and other subsidised categories, the allocation of Rs. 11,046 crore may not be sufficient and bound to slow down infrastructure development in the power sector, Mr.Inani said. Describing it as a visionary and growth oriented budget, CII Telangana chairman Sameer Goel said allocation for industrial incentives as well as for the sector may help in giving a fillip to the industry in Telangana which was affected by the pandemic. The budget showcases the State government’s vision and commitment towards developing key sectors such as agriculture, industry and services in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/industry-bodies-upbeat-as-budget-proposes-rs-2500-cr-incentives/article34104761.ece
19 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||As tourism slumped, State spent Rs. 350 cr. on Yadadri temple||The impact of tourism on Telangana and its budget can be seen from the sharp drop in footfalls. From a high of 8.3 crore visitors in 2019, the total tourist arrivals dipped to less than half at 3.5 crore till October 2020. The numbers are lower than before the formation of the State when it logged 7.2 crore visitors in 2014. The number of foreign tourists plummeted from a high of 3.2 crore in 2019 to 0.5 crore till October 2020. The figures from the Socio-Economic Survey show the blow to tourism sector in Telangana which has an unbroken heritage legacy from Buddhist sanctuaries to Kakatiya-era creations followed by Qutb Shahi and Asaf Jahi reign historical monuments. “The State has tremendous potential for tourism, with a rich heritage and culture and various historical monuments and places of interest for nature lovers,” says the survey about future of the tourism sector. In his speech, the Finance Minister Harish Rao, earmarked an amount of Rs. 726 crore in the Budget Estimates 2021-22 for the Tourism and Cultural sector. He also announced setting up of a Kaleshwaram Tourism Circuit. The many lakes and reservoirs built as part of the Kaleshwaram irrigation project have become a big tourism draw during the monsoon of 2020. However, one of the biggest outlay for a project is Rs. 350 crore earmarked for the Yadagirigutta Temple Development Authority in the 21-22 budgetary estimates. Interestingly, in a year that was economically ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, Telangana government spent Rs. 350 crore on the temple project near Bhongir. Over the last three years, the State has spent Rs. 618 crore on the temple Finished in granite on a massive scale, the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Yadagirigutta is being touted as a tourism draw to rival other grand temples in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/as-tourism-slumped-state-spent-rs-350-cr-on-yadadri-temple/article34104752.ece
19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Regional Ring Road in two parts with Rs. 17,000 crore||The Socio-Economic Outlook for 2021 released by the government along with Budget-2021 on Thursday affirms that the Regional Ring Road (RRR) project will provide the much needed road link for farmers to sell their produce, and help small, micro and medium enterprises to set up cold chains, agro-processing units, IT parks, and new townships. Roadmap Putting forth a roadmap for the RRR around the capital region of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, the document said the 340-km road will be built with a cost of Rs. 17,000 crore, about 30 to 50 kilometres away from the existing Outer Ring Road. It will be taken up in two parts — the northern part of 158 km will connect Sangareddy, Narsapur, Toopran, Gajwel, Yadadri, Pragnapur, Bhongir and Choutuppal, while the Southern part of 182 km will connect Choutuppal, Ibrahimpatnam, Kandukur, Amangal, Chevella, Shankarpally and Sangareddy. Speaking of the new Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Act, the document said it will improve governance of the city, with amendments for 50 per cent quota for women in the GHMC Council, and allocation of 10 per cent for Green Budget, among others. The Act will also involve people in municipal governance by creating four citizens’ committees, with membership of 15,000 people altogether. These committees run activities such as increasing green cover, solid waste management, prevention of public property encroachment and promotion of sports. ‘Developing Hyderabad’ Under the head ‘Developing Hyderabad’, the document cites studies by international agencies to term Hyderabad as one of the most sought-after investment destinations in India for IT and other companies. The city has seen a 100 per cent increase in the total built-up area for commercial projects since 2015. Since formation of the State, the government has made efforts across sectors to accelerate development in the city while ensuring a conducive environment for the growth of businesses and well being of citizens. Since the formation of Telangana as separate State, a total capital expenditure of Rs. 67,149 crore has been incurred on various infrastructural projects across the city, the report said. Of this, GHMC alone spent Rs. 15,724 crore from 2014, up to August, 2020. The highest share of the expenditure has been on infrastructure and housing. Since the formation of the State, HMDA has spent Rs. 1,067 crore on various development projects, such as flyovers, roads and parks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/regional-ring-road-in-two-parts-with-rs-17000-crore/article34104754.ece
19 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||New scheme to strengthen govt. schools||Government schools in the State can expect a refurbished look and connect with digital teaching platforms, what with the government announcing a new education scheme with an outlay of Rs. 4,000 crore. The scheme to be implemented over the next two years will see construction of new buildings, repairs to the existing ones, improving of sanitation facilities, provision of furniture and other necessary amenities. An amount of Rs. 2,000 crore would be spent this year on this scheme, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao said on Thursday. Revealing the new scheme in the budget speech on Thursday, he said modern technology will be used to put classrooms on digital platforms, indicating that schools will be equipped with Internet while classrooms will have digital boards replacing the black boards. The budget saw an increased outlay for this year with Rs. 11,735 crore proposed to be spent in 2021-22 for school education while Rs. 1,873 crore was allocated for higher education. The allocations are higher compared to previous year when school education was given Rs. 10,421 crore and Rs. 1,723 crore was earmarked for higher education. Stating that the government had made rapid progress in the education sector since the formation of Telangana, he said the Residential Schools have carved a place in the hearts of parents who are now preferring them over private schools. The number of residential schools saw a manifold increase to 970 now from 298 in 2014 for SC, ST, BC and minority students. There is no increase, however, in the general residential schools. As per the 2019-20 data, there are 4,29,696 students pursuing education and the government was spending about Rs. 1 lakh on each student. Social Welfare Residential Institutions increased from 134 to 268; Tribal Welfare Residential Institutions from 96 to 133; Minority Welfare Residential Institutions from 12 to 204 and BC Welfare (Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Residential Educational Institutions) from 19 to 281. This is the commitment of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao towards the educationally backward classes, he argued. The government has also provided financial assistance up to Rs. 20 lakh to students from marginalised and minority communities to pursue their higher education abroad. During the year 2020-21, he said 36 SC students received Rs. 10 crore; 167 ST students received Rs. 26 crore; 141 BC students received Rs. 14.7 crore and 250 minority students received Rs. 41.7 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scheme-to-bolster-govt-schools-with-rs-4000-crore/article34104750.ece
19 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Jugglery of numbers: Bhatti||Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka has termed the budget as mere jugglery of numbers, illusionary and misleading given the huge gap between the deficit last year and the projections this year. Speaking to reporters with Congress MLAs Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy and Podem Veeraiah, he said it is laughable that the government presents budget of Rs. 2.30 lakh crore when last year's revised budget was Rs. 1.17 lakh crore. Last year's revised revenue receipts were shown as Rs. 1.17 lakh crore and this year projects are Rs. 1.70 lakh crore. There is over enthusiasm in presentation without actually explaining the revenue sources, he said adding that revenue deficit will be filled through loan component adding to the spate of loans it has acquired. Mr. Vikramarka reminded how he had predicted when the FRBM limit was enhanced that Telangana would resort to mindless borrowing and it has been proven right now. He claimed that the government would borrow Rs. 50,000 crore per year for the next three years to take the entire loan burden on the State to Rs. 5 lakh crore. As of now, the State has Rs. 3.5 lakh crore loans. Similarly, he said the government showed the non-tax revenue as Rs. 30,000 crore in the last budget but it could acquire only Rs. 19,000 crore. In this budget again, the non-tax revenue is expected at Rs. 30,000 crores, which looks impossible, he said. ‘Hyderabad got raw deal’ Meanwhile, former Minister Mohd Ali Shabbir in a statement said the Finance Minister admitted that so far, only 52,456 double bedrooms have been completed in rural and urban areas in the State. He did not specify when the remaining units, out of 2.75 lakh promised houses, would be completed. He said Hyderabad got a raw with no new development scheme announced. He said Rs. 1,000 crore for Hyderabad Metro Rail were dues which the State government needs to clear as per the agreement it signed with HMRL. ‘No Metro Rail’ There is no mention of extending Metro Rail in old city from Imlibun to Falaknuma and no amount has been earmarked for land acquisition. Mr. Shabbir Ali said that the TRS government is cheating the minorities by creating a hype of "spending Rs. 2,000 crore" for their welfare while the spending was never 50% of the total allocations. He said the Finance Minister had confessed that the TRS government has spent only Rs. 5,712 crore in the last six years. He should've also mentioned that this spending was against the allocation of Rs. 9,070 crore in the last six years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jugglery-of-numbers-bhatti/article34104764.ece

19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Pharma, Life Sciences spearhead manufacturing’||Life Sciences and pharmaceutical industry continue to spearhead manufacturing growth in Telangana, attracting Rs. 11,846 crore investments and generating employment opportunities for over 70,000 people in last four years, according to the Telangana Social Economic Outlook 2021. In 2019-20, pharmaceutical exports from the State were valued at Rs. 16,705 crore, the document tabled in the Assembly on Thursday said. According to the Social Economic Outlook, the State’s pharmaceutical sector made significant contributions to the COVID-19 response. It manufactured and supplied life-saving drugs in bulk quantities, including anti-viral drugs Remdesivir and Favipiravir that were used to treat COVID-19 patients. One of the first RT-PCR test kits approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research was from Hyderabad and since then, a number of companies have developed additional RT-PCR kits, rapid test kits, viral transport mediums, reagents and technology-based diagnostics solutions. “The first indigenously developed vaccine for COVID-19, Covaxin, comes from Bharat Biotech, a Hyderabad-based company. Other companies from the State like Biological E and Dr. Reddy’s are engaged in manufacture of COVID-19 vaccine,” the report said. It noted that biotech companies in and around Hyderabad contributed to one-third of the global vaccine production. Noting that pharmaceutical products are the largest exported items from Telangana, accounting approximately for one-third of all exports, the report said the State is successfully diversifying its export basket with growth in sectors such as plastic and paper products. The report said the State government’s flagship TS-iPASS scheme has played an important role in promoting industry and attracting investment. The State has seen a nearly three-fold increase in the number of units, and employment in firms, since the launch of TS-iPASS in 2015. Investment committed by firms using TS-iPASS has increased by 33%, during the same period. Despite the pandemic, there were 3,005 TS-iPASS units which attracted Rs. 30,667 crore in investments and employed 1.79 lakh people. Notably 24% of the State’s investments are repeat commitments from satisfied investors, an indicator of the industrial policy’s success, the report said. The government has started work on the One District One Product scheme, which aims to promote products with a high market potential for export promotion and import substitution, it said.

19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||IT sector gets Rs. 360-crore Budget allocation||The Information Technology (IT) sector, a growth driver for Telangana, has been allocated Rs. 360 crore in the Budget. Finance Minister Harish Rao said this highlighting how Telangana had earned international reputation as a hub for IT products and the various initiatives of the government for the sector. Noting that Hyderabad had become a hub for IT companies, he said the T-Hub set up by the State government to promote technology start-ups had become a role model for the country. Similarly, WE Hub for women entrepreneurs was progressing well. He said the government had readied plans for IT parks in Kompally, Kollapur, Shamshabad, Uppal and Pocharam in Hyderabad Urban Area. As part of its emphasis on spreading the growth of IT sector to tier-II cities, the government has constructed IT Towers in Khammam, Warangal, Karimnagar and Nizamabad districts. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao recently laid foundation for an IT tower in Siddipet. The Telangana Social Economic Outlook 2021, tabled in the Assembly on Thursdday, said a major focus for the government had been to further strengthen the services sector, the bedrock of the state’s economy. The State is a national leader in IT services and accounted for 23.5% of India’s IT export growth for 2019-20. Global IT giants Google, Microsoft and Amazon have established offices in Hyderabad. The state’s flourishing services sector had driven economic growth over the last few years and the trend continued even during the pandemic, as IT professionals could continue their work remotely, the Survey said. The Services sector’s contributions contributed significantly to the economy of the state, with a 60.3% share in GSDP, higher than the 54.3% contribution of the sector at the all-India level in 2020-21. IT is the largest in this group and consequently a key driver of growth in the state, with Hyderabad emerging as one of the world’s leading IT hubs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/it-sector-gets-rs-360-crore-budget-allocation/article34104774.ece
19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||File status report on COVID measures: HC||Telangana High Court on Thursday sought to know what steps had the State government taken to keep a tab on incidence of COVID-19 in the recently opened schools and colleges. Observing that these places witness huge gatherings in classes and students would be appearing for exams in coming days, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said that it was imperative that the State focused on this aspect. “We keep hearing that second wave of coronavirus had hit many countries and we don’t want our State to go that way,” the bench noted. The bench wanted to know what measures the State government had initiated to screen passengers entering Telangana from neighbouring States of Maharashtra and Karnataka which witnessed a spike in COVID-19 cases. Those entering the State through bus stations, railway stations and airport were having the potential to spread the virus. People thronging commercial establishments, workers at construction sites and others were more susceptible to contracting COVID-19, the bench said. Such people should be screened and medical aid should be extended to them. Advocate General B.S. Prasad informed the bench that 300 mobile vans were deployed at different places to conduct COVID-19 tests. Standard Operating Procedures were issued to authorities to screen passengers arriving at bus and railway stations and at the airport. Passengers arriving from United Kingdom, which witnessed second strain of coronavirus, were being monitored closely. The bench instructed the AG to file a fresh status report by April 6 with details of RTPCR and Rapid Antigen tests in all 33 districts of the State. It remarked that the present average number of RTPCR tests was not up to the mark. It suggested to the government to conduct more RTPCR tests. The bench expressed concern over the government conducting lesser diagnostic tests in the State despite High Court orders. While the court wanted 50,000 tests a day on an average, the government had done less than 20,000 tests a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/file-status-report-on-covid-measures-by-april-6-hc-tells-state/article34104740.ece

Speaking in Parliament on demand for grant of Union Territory status to Jammu & Kashmir and Puducherry on Thursday, he said Sardar Patel was part of the Congress government and worked on the advice of Nehru, and it was similar to Prime Minister, Narendra Modi guiding the present Home Minister, Amit Shah. “You can’t say Amit Shah is taking his own decisions and is not part of the Government,” he said while rejecting the efforts to undermine the contribution of Jawaharlal Nehru. He also mentioned that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was ‘Parivar’ of Congress and not Jana Sangh. He was the Home Minister under the Leadership of Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru and all tasks were assigned to the Home Minister, Iron Man Sardar Patel, especially to unite all princely states in the Union of India under the vision and guidance of Jawahar Lal Nehru. The Congress leader also raised the issue of the Internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir for such a long period and problems faced due to it by students and others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/revanth-objects-to-bjp-bid-to-own-patel/article34104737.ece
19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CDP funds should be routed through civic bodies: FGG||Forum for Good Governance (FGG) has objected to the government announcing Rs. 5 crore Constituency Development Programme (CDP) funds for MLAs/MLCs during the budget presentation on Thursday on grounds of “lack of accountability” for such funds dispersed. Forum secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy informed in a press release that the government had passed orders way back in 2010 stating that while the audit for the CDP funds has to be done by the district audit officer concerned, it has to be done by June-end every year, after which it will be deemed to have been completed. However, in most districts, the audit has not been done and the process was deemed to have been completed, he said. The process is the MLA/MLC concerned suggests certain works to the district planning official and the official in turn, will allot to the department concerned with the District Collector’s approval. “Most of the time, the MLAs/MLCs come up with a proposal, ensure the work is allotted on a nomination basis and the money is squandered. If the government is really serious about allotting money through the CDP, it should be done through the Zilla Parishad or the municipal corporation like the GHMC,” said Mr. Reddy. The MLA or MLC can still suggest works but these will be then discussed and debated in the ZP or GHMC bringing about “transparency and accountability”. The present method of putting the money in the account of the planning department gives scope for “misutilisation and irregularities” of funds, he observed. Mr. Reddy pointed out that the FGG had requested ‘special allotment’ of Rs. 10,000 crore to the GHMC to tackle the chronic problem of floods but this has been ignored by the government. “While not a single paisa was given to the GHMC in the budget, around Rs. 250 crore has been allocated to Warangal Municipal Corporation and Rs. 150 crore to Khammam Municipal Corporation, which are both going for polls. We feel it is not good governance,” he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cdp-funds-should-be-routed-through-civic-bodies-fgg/article34104748.ece

Through a statement on Thursday, the party expressed scepticism about Rs. 200 crore allocaitons for Musi River development too, saying though Rs. 377 crore were allotted in two successive budgets earlier, no funds had been released. While 1.5 lakh commuters stand to benefit through Rs. 200 crore allocations for MMTS Phase-II, it has not been done, the note said, and called it “criminal” to allot funds for Metro Rail used by the “rich”, while the extremely affordable and accessible MMTS is being ignored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cpim-decries-paltry-allocations-to-hyderabad/article34104920.ece

19 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rs. 1,602 crore proposed for minority welfare||The Telangana government proposed a budgetary allocation for FY 2021-2022 of Rs. 1,602 crore for minorities welfare. Finance Minister Harish Rao on Thursday said, “While the amount spent on minority welfare was Rs. 812 crore from 2008 to 2014 in united AP, Telangana government spent Rs. 5,712 crore in the last six years. An amount of Rs. 1,602 crore is proposed in Budget Estimates 2021-22 for Minority Welfare.” The allocation is lesser than in Financial Year 2018-19, when the State recorded budget estimates of Rs. 1,973.41 crore. However, it is marginally higher than that of FY 2020-21, which was Rs. 1,513.46 crore. This year, a bulk of the budget estimates appear to have been allocated to the Telangana Minorities Residential Institutions Society with Rs. 427.06 crore as establishment estimates – meaning salaries of staff, rents and payment for utilities – and another Rs. 222.92 crore as scheme expenditure. Diet charges for students, which are around a lakh, as stated by the Finance Minister, is Rs. 115.13. Diet charges aside, this is an increase from Rs. 561 crore last year to Rs. 649.98 crore this year. As much as Rs. 300 crore has been allocated for Shaadi Mubarak scheme, which is the same as the allocation in 2020-21. However, the expenditure last year for this scheme was Rs. 142.98 crore. The Centre for Education and Development of Minorities has been allocated Rs. 1.5 crore and the allocation for the Chief Minister’s Overseas Scheme for Minorities is Rs. 72.54 crore. As much as Rs. 2.46 crore has been allocated for pre-matric scholarships and Rs. 206.91 crore have been allocated for the fee reimbursement scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rs-1602-crore-proposed-for-minority-welfare/article34104755.ece

19 March 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Five batches counting for MLC poll completed||After day-long process of recording postal ballots, mixing and bundling ballot papers on Wednesday, the results of the first batch counting of first-preference votes in the Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda Graduates’ MLC poll came at around 2.30 a.m. on Thursday. Telangana Rashtra Samithi’s sitting MLC Palla Rajeshwar Reddy registered a headstart with 16,130 votes, followed by independent candidate Teenmar Mallanna securing 12,046 votes and Telangana Jana Samithi’s M. Kodandaram garnering 9,080 votes. Candidates from Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress, Gujjula Premendar Reddy and S. Ramulu Naik, got 6,615 and 4,345 votes respectively. Other popular candidates – Jayasaradhi Reddy from the Left, Telangana Inti Party’s Cheruku Sudhakar and G. Rani Rudrama Reddy – were left with votes ranging between 4,000 and 6,000. Counting of 56,000 votes in each batch, at 1,000 votes per table, took about five hours, and the entire election machinery is working on shifts for the round-the-clock exercise. As the counting of batches progressed, several candidates, independent or represented by a party regressed to lower positions, and as visible at the closing of fifth batch counting results at around 9 p.m., the top three positions based on votes gathered remained unchanged from the first batch. Mr. Reddy had accumulated 79,113 votes, a majority of 18,549 votes over his immediate contender Mr. Mallanna, who had garnered 60,564 votes. In the third position, Mr. Kodandaram was with 49,200 votes, 20,209 more votes than the BJP candidate. Of the total 3,86,320 ballot papers, more than 72% or 2,79,970 were counted. The reports also tell that 15,533 graduates, at an average of 3,106 voters per batch, did not know how to exercise their franchise validly and for the same reasons their votes were declared invalid. With the counting of pending 1,06,350 votes in progress, and as it is unlikely that no candidate including the front runner would garner more than 50% majority i.e., more than 1.93 lakh valid votes, contestants and officials weigh in on the second round counting or counting of second preference votes. The process is linked with elimination of candidates who had secured low votes, while votes of second preference on their ballot papers will be added to the leading candidates to achieve majority. Going by the numbers last available at 9 p.m. on Thursday, the contest is headed for a triangle fight among – Mr. Reddy, Mr. Mallanna and Mr. Kodandaram, the result of which may be available only on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/five-batches-counting-completed/article34104735.ece
19 March 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Tension at govt. hospital||Tension prevailed for sometime at government hospital in the district headquarters on Thursday when panchayat secretaries from across the district gathered and stopped the movement of ambulance carrying the mortal remains of their colleague Mangali Jagan, who had committed suicide on Wednesday, and demanded justice to the family of the deceased. The agitating panchayat secretaries relented only after Sangareddy Legislator T. Jayaparakash Reddy reached the spot and assured the agitating employees that he would take the issue to the notice of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and also raise the issue in the Assembly. The Legislator promised to extend financial assistance to the family of Jagan. Mr. Jagan, who was working as panchayat secretary at Minpur, had ended his life at his house on Wednesday alleging that he was being harassed and not accorded due respect. Body was shifted to government hospital at Sangareddy. When officials tried to shift the body to his native place, panchayat secretaries from across the district gathered there in large number sat before the ambulance and stopped it. The agitating panchayat secretaries did not relent when Collector M. Hanumantha Rao visited the hospital and tried to convince them. They withdrew the agitation only after the MLA pacified them. Mr Jayaprakash Reddy termed the death of the panchayat secretary a murder by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tension-at-hospital/article34104782.ece
19 March 2021||Yeddumailaram (Sangareddy District),TELANGANA||Ordnance unit to roll out BMP tanks soon||Indian Army facing Chinese aggression at the borders will soon be fortified with all new mine-proof Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicles (FICV) and special high altitude vehicles. The military hardware is being manufactured at Ordnance Factory Medak, at Yeddumailaram in Sangareddy district. The FICV will be equipped with Instant Fire Detection and Suppression system (IFDSS). The only Ordnance Factory in the Telugu speaking States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, which played a strategic role in building and supplying military hardware since its inception in 1984, is developing a prototype for Wheeled Armoured Fighting Vehicles to move on plain surface. Advances in the flagship Sarath BMP 2 armoured vehicles are also made by the factory, which has so far rolled out more than 3,000 armoured vehicles. New BMP will be equipped with night vision capability, which gives the tank driver, commander, and gunman a 360-degree view even at night. Currently, the BMP lacks night vision capability, literally leaving the 14.5-ton metal giant blind after sunset. High output In the month of February alone, the Ordnance Factory had dispatched more than three dozen Sarath BMP 2 to Galwan Valley. When asked about the dispatch of unusual number of BMPs particularly at a time when Chinese forces appeared taking a back step on LAC, factory’s General Manager Alok Prasad said: “their aggregation is our preparedness.” Indian Army has deployed BMP 2 armoured vehicles in response to the Chinese side building up the presence of heavy artillery, troops and armoured vehicles, to counter the threat to the Darbuk–Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DSDBO) road, a crucial road for the Indian forces.  Increase production Mr. Prasad said that every year the factory rolls out 125 new infantry combat vehicles, which is high and “with advances in technology, we are planning to increase the manufacturing capacity in the future.” The Ordnance Factory will start overhauling BMP, apart from producing the new vehicles. “We will be overhauling at least 100 BMP of Indian Army per year, and with this, we can say that manufacturing capacity will be more than 200,” the General Manager said. According to him, the hull and turret of Arjun Main Battle Tank (MK-1A), which was handed over to the Indian Army by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month, are manufactured at Ordnance Factory Medak. “Even the first Arjun MBT tank was assembled here,” he said.  High quality “This is the only factory in the country which is producing infantry combat vehicles. The quality of vehicles is amongst the best in the world,” Mr. Prasad said. Ordnance Factory Day was observed on March 18 to commemorate the foundation of the first Ordnance Factory in colonial India at Cossipore near Kolkata in 1801.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mine-proof-ficv-to-roll-out-of-odf-medak-soon/article34104780.ece
19 March 2021||Chandigarh,||Ruckus in Haryana Assembly over damages recovery Bill||Heated arguments were witnessed in the Haryana Assembly on Thursday between treasury benches and opposition Congress, as ‘Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property During Disturbance to Public Order Bill,2021,’ was passed. The Congress MLAs stormed the well of the House, shouting slogan against the Bill and demanding its withdrawal. it claimed that Bill was aimed at strangling democracy. ‘Bill on public demand’ Home Minister Anil Vij, who earlier introduced the Bill, said it has been brought on public demand. “The Congress should clarify are they with people who are involved in rioting and damaging properties or do they favour peaceful protests,” he said. The Bill provides for recovery of damages to properties caused by persons during disturbances to public order by an assembly, lawful or unlawful, including riots and violent disorder and for constitution of claims tribunal to determine the liability, to assess the damages caused and to award compensation. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal said that the 2.5 crore people of the State have every right over its land and it is the responsibility of the State government to protect it. “For this purpose, the Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property during Disturbance to Public Order Bill, 2021was passed,” said Mr. Lal, talking to reporters. He said the Bill has nothing to do with the agitation of farmers’ surrounding the new farm laws. ‘Necessary to instil fear’ “It is necessary to instil fear in the minds of those who damage property and this is our constitutional legal system. In a democracy everyone has the right to speak and protest peacefully, but no one has the right to damage property. This Bill will determine the responsibility of those who damage property as well as ensure compensation to the victims,” Mr. Lal added. Leader of Opposition and senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who forcefully opposed the bill inside the House, said the Bill would strangle democracy and demanded the government to take it back. Mr. Hooda, later told reporters that the Bill provides for recovery from peaceful protesters, which, he said was an attempt to violate the fundamental rights as every citizen has the right to peaceful protest in a democracy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/ruckus-in-haryana-assembly-over-damages-recovery-bill/article34104717.ece
19 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Night curfew extended in Punjab||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday announced a two-hour extension in the night curfew in the State’s nine districts worst affected by COVID-19. He cautioned of several more tough measures and restrictions over the next few days. Night curfew will now be in place from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m, instead of 11 p.m to 5 a.m., in the districts of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala, Mohali, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Ropar. All these districts are reporting more than 100 cases daily. The announcement came as Punjab’s daily cases shot up to 2,039 cases with 35 deaths on March 17. Addressing a press conference to mark the completion of four years of his government, the Chief Minister said the COVID-19 situation in the State was critical and he was going to be tough. Several stringent measures, including restrictions on gatherings, will be announced after discussions with the State government’s expert team over the next couple of days, he said. Whether these will include restrictions on political gatherings was also something that will be decided as per the medical expert team’s advice, the Chief Minister added.  ‘People may not like it’ “I won’t be easy on the people. People may not like it, but it’s my duty,” he said, adding that he hoped the daily case load won’t cross 3,000, as projected by some experts. With 283 COVID-19 patients in high-dependency units (on Oxygen) and another 27 on ventilators, the situation is dangerous, said Captain Amarinder, urging people to go to the doctor and get themselves tested even if they feel slightly unwell. While his government was taking all possible measures to check the spread of the virus, the Chief Minister hoped the Centre would accept his suggestion (submitted at the Prime Minister’s meeting yesterday) on opening up the vaccination to younger people in the worst hit areas and also to all those in public dealings. To a question on Himachal Pradesh CM’s statement seeking curbs on people coming in from Punjab for pilgrimage and religious purposes, Capt. Amarinder said he was not in favour of restricting religious movement. But the COVID-19 problem needs to be controlled, and an appropriate decision will be taken when he gets a formal letter from the Chief Minister of the neighbouring State on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/night-curfew-extended-in-punjab/article34104719.ece

19 March 2021||GURUGRAM,||Marches in support of farmers in Haryana||A large number of farmers, workers and women set out on a five-day padyatra (foot march) from two different points in Haryana on Thursday in support of the demand of the farmers and the workers against the three farms laws and the labour codes. The two padyatras — starting from Hansi and Khatkar toll plaza in Jind — will merge at Rohtak’s Bahu Akbarpur before culminating at Tikri border sit-in agitation site on March 23 to mark “Shaheed Diwas”. Similar padyatras would originate from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh to culminate at different sit-in agitation sites along the Delhi border. Flagging of the padyatra at the historic Lal Sadak in Hansi, Shaheed Bhagat Singh’s niece Gurjeet Kaur said the real relatives of Bhagat Singh were indeed those who were following the ideals of the martyr aimed at liberation of peasants, workers and all toiling masses. Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader Ashok Dhawle described the demands of four-month-long “historic” agitation as “fully justified” and emphasised that Modi-government should not be adamant. He categorically said the farmers would not return till the three laws were not repealed and a legal guarantee of Minimum Support Price was not granted. All-India Kisan Sabha, Haryana, vice-president Inderjit Singh termed the resolution passed by Haryana Assembly condemning the boycott of ruling parties leaders as “absolutely ridiculous”. He exhorted the audience to defeat the ill designs of the BJP to create caste division among the rural people. Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Haryana, vice-president Satvir Singh said the farmers agitation had now become a mass movement and the workers were also part of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/marches-in-support-of-farmers-in-haryana/article34104723.ece

19 March 2021||Guwahati,||Modi, Sonowal duped Assam with lies: Surjewala||Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and other BJP leaders had flattered the people of Assam only to deceive. The BJP leadership spent the five years in taking the people of Assam for a ride with falsehoods and big announcements made bigger with vacuum. “They made massive announcements for the development of Assam. The outcome has been zero,” Mr. Surjewala told journalists in Guwahati. He said Assam had taken the second spot in the country’s growth index when the Congress ruled the State five years ago, but the BJP-led alliance government pushed the State down to the 20th position. Claiming that “Assam is now recognised as the most unsafe place for women,” the Congress leader said 80,794 cases of crime against women were registered in the State in the last three years. “The BJP has made Assam the hub of child trafficking too. Half of such cases in the country happen in Assam,” he said, asking if the Prime Minister would care to address such issues. Mr. Surjewala also asked the Prime Minister if he planned to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) after the Assam Assembly polls. ‘Why is PM silent?’ “Modiji promised to implement the CAA in West Bengal but said his government will not implement it in Tamil Nadu. Why is he silent about Assam? Why this double standard?” he said. The Congress general secretary also slammed Mr. Modi and Mr. Sonowal for 20 mega projects worth Rs. 10,860 crore that had remained in the initial stages for many years after their announcement. “Modiji had promised to the public of Assam that 59 lakh out of 63.25 lakh rural families will get water under the Jal Jeevan Mission. But 56 lakh are still deprived of water after three years,” Mr. Surjewala reminded, also calling the “BJP bluff” on the health of women and children. “The National Family Health Survey says 68.4% children aged 6-49 months in Assam suffered from anaemia in 2020, up from the 35% in 2015,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/modi-sonowal-duped-assam-with-lies-surjewala/article34104721.ece
19 March 2021||Jaipur,||Outrage over Rajasthan textbook content||The Jaipur Police on Thursday registered a criminal case after the social activists and Muslim groups in Rajasthan expressed outrage over some contents of a school textbook and a guidebook on political science, which seek to link religion with terrorism. The textbook is published by the Rajasthan State Textbook Board. In a chapter on “Terrorism, criminalisation of politics and corruption”, the Class XII textbook asks a question, “What do you understand by Islamic terrorism?” A multiple choice question, “Which one of the following is not the main objective of Islamic terrorism?” gives the options of establishing a Muslim nation, implementing Islamic laws and principles, establishing peace, and resisting Western non-Muslim powers with violence. The contents in the book, published for the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education, were reportedly introduced during the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) regime. Bhanwar Singh Rathore, Associate Professor at Department of Political Science, Government College, Jodhpur, has been listed in the textbook as the convenor, author and translator. The answer key given in the students’ guidebook, published by Jaipur-based Sanjiv Prakashan, states that Islamic terrorism is a “form of Islam” and goes on to elaborate on the subject. It says Islamic terrorism became “very powerful during the last 20 to 30 years” and had brought havoc to the world by “suicide attacks, unlimited barbarity, blackmail, demand for ransom and heinous killings”. “Islamic terrorists dedicate themselves to their community and commit the heinous crimes in the name of their religion and Allah,” the answer states, adding that terrorism in Jammu & Kashmir was “purely religious” and could be put in the category of separatism. Case registered A First Information Report was registered at Lal Kothi Police Station in Jaipur under Sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code on a complaint lodged by Mohsin Rasheed, general secretary of the Pradesh Congress Committee’s minority cell. Mr. Rasheed said the books directly associate the religion with terrorism by repeatedly using “Islamic terrorism” and promoted hatred for Islam and Muslims. “Besides provoking and humiliating Muslim students, teachers and the community, it is also an attempt to destroy the unity and integrity of the country,” he said in his complaint, while demanding action against those responsible for writing and approving the textbook. Rajasthan Muslim Forum member Naim Rabbani held the Congress government responsible for not removing the “objectionable contents” in the last two years. He said while the BJP had inserted the reading material matching with its ideology during its rule, it was strange that the Congress had not dropped it during its exercise on revision of textbooks. The Muslim Parishad Sansthan, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) and Popular Front of India have also demanded that the textbook and guidebook be withdrawn and the syllabus of political science revised.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/outrage-over-rajasthan-textbook-content/article34104724.ece

Tondon was a Congress lawmaker, but she quit the party last year.

19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Day 113 of farmers’ stir: backdrop shifts, but intensity remains intact||The farmers’ protest at the Delhi borders entered its 113rd day on Thursday, and the landscape has changed noticeably too. Green-coloured residential structures have replaced the cluster of stacked up tractors and trolleys at the start of the protest. The makeshift structures have area codes written in bold — especially those built by farmers from Punjab — for others to know the villages they are from. For instance, PB 43 for Samrala, PB 45 for Talwandi Sabo, PB 46 for Tarn Taran and so and so forth. Sitting inside his makeshift yet pucca house, which has a television installed along with newly-bought curtains and fans, at the Singhu border protest site, 70-year-old Kuldeep Singh said that similar structures will be built when summer peaks. The colour, he said, reflects the sunlight and keeps the interior cool. Another change is more space for walking because of comparatively fewer tractors, besides access to inside routes for commuters. The barricades installed inside Singhu village and at its border have been removed. The tractor-trolley show, which used to happen on a regular basis as a show of their strength, has stopped as well. Over the last few weeks, the number of langars has also reduced. However, the bigger ones are still functional. “Most people have started making their food close to where they live. Now, it’s more like people have settled down,” said Harvinder Singh from Ludhiana. Sustaining intensity Protesting farmers said their numbers may fluctuate, but the protest will continue until a solution is reached in their favour. “We are all busy with farming now, because it is that time of the year when our field needs us the most. In three weeks, it will be the time to cut the crop. To be able to continue that, people come in shifts from the villages. One thing is clear, no matter what, the protest will continue even if numbers dwindle,” said Hardeep Singh (38) from Kapurthala. Kashmir Singh (70), from Tarn Taran, said they had come prepared for six months. “It’s only been about four months now. We are prepared to stay till next Lok Sabha elections,” he said. Jaswant Singh from Kapurthala said that he had never visited Delhi. “I had no idea that life had this in store for me that I will come to Delhi and stay for this long,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/day-113-of-farmers-stir-backdrop-shifts-but-intensity-remains-intact/article34104707.ece
19 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Facilitate repatriation of man’s mortal remains’||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) officials to coordinate with the Deputy Chief of Missions of Saudi Embassy here to facilitate the exhumation and repatriation of the mortal remains of a man, belonging to Hindu community, who was wrongly buried in Saudi Arabia as per Muslim rites. Justice Prathiba M. Singh said that the MEA official should seek cooperation from the Deputy Chief of Mission of the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia located in New Delhi “in order to emphasise on the sensitivity of the issue”. The High Court also requested the Deputy Chief of Mission to obtain some timeline within which the process of exhumation and repatriation of the body would be completed. Anju Sharma, in her petition, stated that she is the wife of deceased Sanjeev Kumar, an Indian citizen who passed away on January 24, 2021 at his workplace in Saudi Arabia. Kumar, an Indian migrant who worked in Saudi Arabia for 23 years, died due to diabetes, hypertension and cardiac arrest and the mortal remains were kept in Beesh General Hospital, Jizan, Saudi Arabia. On getting the information, Ms. Sharma and other family members of the deceased requested to repatriate the mortal remains.  “Shockingly, on February 18, the petitioner [Ms. Sharma] was informed that the body of her husband has been buried in Saudi Arabia while the family members of the deceased were waiting for the mortal remains in India,” the petition filed through advocate Subhash Chandran K.R. said. “The officials in Indian Consulate explained that it was due to a mistake committed by the official translator of Indian Consulate Jeddah, who wrongly mentioned his religion as ‘Muslim’ in the death certificate,” the plea said. The MEA stated that in the present case, the burial took place on February 17, 2021, without informing the Indian Consulate, which could be due to the protocol being followed during COVID-19. The MEA said immediately upon being informed of the burial, the Indian Consulate took steps by writing communications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Jeddah as well as to the Governor of Jazan Region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/facilitate-repatriation-of-mans-mortal-remains/article34104701.ece

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||AAP blames Javadekar for 22 cities figuring among world’s 30 most polluted||The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday alleged that the Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar is responsible for 22 Indian cities being in the top 30 polluted cities in the world. The party sought his removal from the post. “On the issue of stubble burning, when the Supreme Court wished to appoint a single-judge committee, the Central government opted instead to constitute a commission called the Commission for Air Quality Management. However, even that Commission has now lapsed, which clearly tells us the Centre’s intention towards controlling pollution,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj. He claimed that in the Centre’s budget, not a single rupee has been granted to Delhi under the National Clean Air Action Plan. “On one hand, the Delhi government is taking persistent steps to control pollution, and on the other, the Centre isn’t doing anything about the eight most polluted cities. The Union Environment Minister has not done even one significant task to reduce pollution. For this reason alone, he should be removed with immediate effect,” he said. ‘Kill democracy’ AAP MP Sanjay Singh said the BJP-led Centre wants to “kill” democracy by introducing the “unconstitutional’ Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021 in Parliament. “If everything is going to rest with the L-G, what meaning will elections hold? What happens to the mandate of people? What happens to democracy?” he asked.

19 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Din in Haryana House over ‘pay damages’ Bill||Heated arguments were witnessed in the Haryana Assembly on Thursday between treasury benches and opposition Congress, as ‘Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property During Disturbance to Public Order Bill,2021,’ was passed. The Congress MLAs stormed the well of the House, shouting slogan against the Bill and demanding its withdrawal. it claimed that Bill was aimed at strangling democracy.  ‘Bill on public demand’ Home Minister Anil Vij, who earlier introduced the Bill, said it has been brought on public demand. “The Congress should clarify are they with people who are involved in rioting and damaging properties or do they favour peaceful protests,” he said. The Bill provides for recovery of damages to properties caused by persons during disturbances to public order by an assembly, lawful or unlawful, including riots and violent disorder and for constitution of claims tribunal to determine the liability, to assess the damages caused and to award compensation. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal said that the 2.5 crore people of the State have every right over its land and it is the responsibility of the State government to protect it. “For this purpose, the Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property during Disturbance to Public Order Bill, 2021was passed,” said Mr. Lal, talking to reporters. He said the Bill has nothing to do with the agitation of farmers’ surrounding the new farm laws.  ‘Necessary to instil fear’ “It is necessary to instil fear in the minds of those who damage property and this is our constitutional legal system. In a democracy everyone has the right to speak and protest peacefully, but no one has the right to damage property. This Bill will determine the responsibility of those who damage property as well as ensure compensation to the victims,” Mr. Lal added. Leader of Opposition and senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who forcefully opposed the bill inside the House, said the Bill would strangle democracy and demanded the government to take it back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/din-in-haryana-house-over-pay-damages-bill/article34104848.ece

19 March 2021||Guwahati,||Modi, Sonowal duped Assam with lies: Surjewala||Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and other BJP leaders had flattered the people of Assam only to deceive. The BJP leadership spent the five years in taking the people of Assam for a ride with falsehood and big announcements made bigger with vacuum. “They made massive announcements for the development of Assam. The outcome has been zero,” Mr. Surjewala told journalists in Guwahati. He said Assam had taken the second spot in the country’s growth index when the Congress ruled the State five years ago, but the BJP-led alliance government pushed the State down to the 20th position. Claiming that “Assam is now recognised as the most unsafe place for women,” the Congress leader said 80,794 cases of crime against women were registered in the State in the last three years.  ‘Child trafficking’ “The BJP has made Assam the hub of child trafficking too. Half of such cases in the country happen in Assam,” he said, asking if the Prime Minister would care to address such issues. Mr. Surjewala also asked the Prime Minister if he planned to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) after the Assam Assembly polls. “Modiji promised to implement the CAA in West Bengal but said his government will not implement it in Tamil Nadu. Why is he silent about Assam? Why this double standard?” he said. The Congress general secretary also slammed Mr. Modi and Mr. Sonowal for 20 mega projects worth Rs. 10,860 crore that had remained in the initial stages for many years after their announcement. “Modiji had promised to the public of Assam that 59 lakh out of 63.25 lakh rural families will get water under the Jal Jeevan Mission. But 56 lakh are still deprived of water after three years,” Mr. Surjewala reminded, also calling the “BJP bluff” on the health of women and children. “The National Family Health Survey says 68.4% children aged 6-49 months in Assam suffered from anaemia in 2020, up from the 35% in 2015,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/modi-sonowal-duped-assam-with-lies-surjewala/article34104850.ece
19 March 2021||Mumbai,||HC: might direct CAG to probe irregularities in toll collection||The Bombay High Court on Thursday said it may direct the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India to look into alleged irregularities in toll collection on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Pravin Wategaonkar and three others challenging toll collection on the expressway. The plea sought that the toll collected from August 10, 2019, be declared illegal and light motor vehicles be exempted from paying toll till the matter is heard. Mr. Wategaonkar pointed out that the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Tax Act stipulates a build, operate and transfer contract between the State government and any other entity at whose expense a road project is built. So, the State has to first declare the total capital outlay of the project before declaring the rate and period till which is to be levied. He said going by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation’s (MSRDC) affidavit, what exists is only a proposed agreement and no authorised document disclosing the capital outlay. As such there is no compliance of law to levy tolls, he said. The Bench questioned MSRDC’s advocate on the cost of the project and whether anyone would believe that the project cost recoverable of Rs. 3,632 crore in 2004 was yet to be recovered. The court suggested the CAG can audit the accounts and submit an affidavit on its findings in two weeks. The PIL said, “The Motor Vehicles Tax Act allows the government to collect toll only to recover the capital cost plus toll collection expenses. However, the actual cumulative toll revenue data of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway for the last 15 years until July 31, 2019, is Rs. 6,773 crore, well in excess of Rs. 4,330 crore spent.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-might-direct-cag-to-probe-irregularities-in-toll-collection/article34104333.ece

A Bench of Justice Siddharth Mirdul and Justice A.J. Bhambhani asked the counsel for Delhi Police and Mr. Tanha to give their written submissions by March 22. Order challenged Mr. Tanha was arrested in May last year for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” in the riots. He has challenged a trial court’s October 26, 2020 order dismissing his bail application. His bail petition was opposed by the Delhi police on the ground that the riots were premeditated and a conspiracy was hatched of which Mr. Tanha was a part. The prosecutor had opposed the plea saying there were statements of protected witnesses in the case which clearly showed the alleged role of Mr. Tanha in the riots. Mr. Tanha’s counsel argued that he has been in custody since May 2020 and even the chargesheet has been filed. Before the trial court, Mr. Tanha’s counsel had claimed that he was not present in Delhi during the riots and did not visit any of the protest sites where rioting and violence occurred. The counsel had contended that there was no physical evidence connecting Mr. Tanha to the riots and no allegations with respect to any funds being received by him for terrorist activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-reserves-verdict-on-tanhas-bail-plea/article34104326.ece

Mr. Baijal is also the chairman of the urban body. The revised policy, which will now be sent to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs for final notification, is proposed to improve public transit ridership, reduce vehicular congestion and reduce greenhouse emissions and pollution in the long run, according to officials. “Apart from the metro and railway stations, the revised TOD policy will also enable node-based transit oriented development around upcoming modes of public transport like the BRTS, Metro Lite, Metro Neo and so on. The revised TOD policy will allow mass public transit agencies to utilise their operational area like tracks, stations, depots and so on, for development, facilitating the use of more effective and sustainable operation and maintenance models for the transit agencies,” the DDA said. The authority also gave its primary approval for Dynamic Parking Norms and inclusion of Affordable Rental Housing Complex (ARHC) in the Master Plan for Delhi-2021. “The occupancy of the ARHCs will be granted on the basis of licence deed with a maximum tenure of three years, ensuring accessibility to all the candidates eligible for ARHCs. The proposed ARHCs will enable availability of affordable and easily accessible rental housing to the urban poor of Delhi in the vicinity of their workplace,” the land-owning agency said. The revised parking norms will be based on the number and size of dwelling units instead of built-up area in case of residential projects.

Justice Ramana, who is next in line to be the Chief Justice of India as per the seniority norm, was speaking at the First Justice J.S. Verma Memorial ADR and Client Counselling Competition, organised by the Department of Law of the Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Management Studies (MAIMS) of IP University in association with National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). The senior SC judge said improving judicial infrastructure through use of e-platforms and setting up of more courts, settling disputes at pre-litigation stage through counselling, strengthening the existing Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanism would go a long way in clearing the huge pendency of cases in courts. Justice Ramana said delays in litigation should be mended by referring disputes to ADR for settlement.

This is an excessive interference.” The teachers’ body also demanded withdrawal of the “pattern of assistance” document issued by the Directorate of Higher Education. The letter read: “The provisions of this ‘pattern of assistance’ are designed to redefine association of these 12 colleges with Delhi University and divest Delhi government of its funding responsibility by coercing them to gradually become self-sustaining and self-sufficient.”  The order assigns to senior administrative officers additional charge of the 12 DU colleges.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are set for talks with senior Chinese official Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi later Thursday. It is the highest-level face-to-face diplomatic meeting between the two countries since U.S. President Joe Biden took office. China wants a reset in relations, which were pitched into turmoil by Donald Trump’s presidency, which brought a damaging trade war and spats over everything from defence to tech and rights in Hong Kong. But as the diplomats landed in Alaska hours ahead of the talks, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing issued a warning to Washington. “China has no room for compromise on issues concerning its sovereignty, security and core interests,” spokesman Zhao Lijian said. Mr. Zhao urged the U.S. against talking tough and engaging in “megaphone diplomacy” toward China after Washington said it intended to show its firmness against Beijing after a round of alliance-building across Asia. “The US should meet China halfway and conduct the dialogue in a sincere and constructive manner,” Mr. Zhao said. The Alaska talks will be the first between the powers since Mr. Yang met Mr. Blinken’s hawkish predecessor Mike Pompeo last June in Hawaii — a setting similarly far from the high-stakes glare of national capitals. The American diplomats aim to be on the front foot in the talks, U.S. officials have said. The U.S. plans to express “deep concerns” about the treatment of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang, a crackdown in Hong Kong, Chinese “economic coercion” and Beijing’s “increasingly aggressive” stance towards Taiwan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-says-no-compromise-on-sovereignty-ahead-of-alaska-meet/article34104044.ece
19 March 2021||Moscow,||Russia hosts Afghan peace meet||Russia hosted a peace conference for Afghanistan on Thursday, bringing together government representatives and their Taliban adversaries along with international observers in a bid to help jump-start the country’s stalled peace process. The one-day gathering is the first of three planned international conferences ahead of a May 1 deadline for the final withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from the country, a date fixed under a year-old agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban. Call for ceasefire Moscow’s attempt at mediation comes as talks in Doha between the Afghan government and the Taliban, still waging an insurgency, have stalled. Washington and Kabul have been pressing for a ceasefire while the Taliban say they will negotiate it as part of peace talks with the Afghan government. “We hope that today’s talks will help achieve progress in the inter-Afghan talks,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at the start of the meeting. The Moscow conference is attended by U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, Abdullah Abdullah, head of Afghanistan’s National Reconciliation Council, and Taliban co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Representatives of Pakistan, Iran, and China are also participating. Moscow, which fought a 10-year war in Afghanistan that ended with Soviet troops’ withdrawal in 1989, has made a diplomatic comeback as a mediator in Afghanistan, reaching out to feuding factions as it jockeys with the U.S. for influence in the country. Mr. Lavrov on Thursday urged the Afghan government and the Taliban to take a constructive stance and make compromises, adding that international participants should help create the necessary conditions for reaching a deal. “The Afghan parties interested in the national reconciliation can reach peace only through negotiations and compromises,” Mr. Lavrov said. “It’s important to sign an agreement that would serve the interests of all key ethnic and political forces of the country and determine the vector of its development.” He emphasised that it was important to quickly reach a peace deal “amid the deteriorating military-political situation” before the summer, when an upsurge in fighting is likely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-hosts-afghan-peace-meet/article34104048.ece
19 March 2021||Washington,||Austin visit may allay concerns about Indo-Pacific, Afghanistan||Much of the action in U.S. foreign relations is happening in Asia this week and almost all of it is Asia focused. U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense, Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin, were on a trip to Tokyo and Seoul. Secretary Austin is heading towards New Delhi after Seoul and Secretary Blinken will fly to Anchorage, Alaska, where he and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will meet their Chinese counterparts, Wang Yi and Yang Jiechi, for the first China-U.S. bilateral of the Biden administration. In India, Mr. Austin is scheduled to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and other “senior national security officials” (presumably NSA Ajit Doval tops this list). They will discuss a deepening of the Major Defence partnership, the Pentagon had said when announcing the visit. They will also discuss the Indo-Pacific and are expected to discuss operationalising the ‘foundational agreements’ of U.S. defence cooperation, the last of which was signed in October (the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement). ‘Chinese coercion’ “I have no doubt that the discussions will be candid behind closed doors. What’s worth watching, however, is whether the Secretary speaks openly in New Delhi about the U.S. or joint efforts to counter Chinese coercion across the Indo-Pacific, or falls back on more opaque references to shared threats,” said Joshua White, a professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS and former South Asia Director in the Obama National Security Council. There are a few sales in the works as well, including a $3 billion plus deal for 30 armed drones from General Atomics, which is the final stages of being cleared by the Defence Ministry. The Defense Secretary visiting New Delhi as part his maiden visit abroad may also help shift perceptions about his résumé. “A visit to New Delhi on his first trip abroad might also be designed to allay concerns that the Secretary, a former commander of U.S. Central Command with deep experience in the Middle East, was not going to give the Indo-Pacific its due,” Mr. White said. Discussions around Afghanistan are also expected. The U.S. is trying to facilitate a peace deal via an inter-Afghan dialogue, as it re-assesses a May 1 deadline for troop withdrawal that Mr. Trump had committed to as part of a deal with the Taliban. U.S. President Joe Biden said that getting American troops out by the deadline “could happen” but is “tough” in an ABC interview that aired on Wednesday. The President also said the deadline, if extended, would not be pushed back much longer. “The fact is that was not a very solidly negotiated deal that the former President worked out” he said. “And so we’re in consultation with our allies as well as the [Afghan] government and that decision is in process now.” While India was not invited to Thursday’s talks in Moscow on an intra-Afghan settlement, it is part of a proposed U.S. plan for a UN conference on a settlement. Indian concerns about Afghanistan and the U.S. withdrawal are therefore likely to feature in Mr. Austin’s discussions in New Delhi. Neither would it be unprecedented for the Secretary of Defense to make an unannounced visit to Afghanistan. Jim Mattis , former Defense Secretary, dropped in on U.S. and allied troops in Afghanistan in September 2018 when the Trump administration was trying to push a peace deal in the country. The Pentagon, however, had nothing to announce on Afghanistan, when The Hindu asked if Mr. Austin would be visiting the country. Talks CAATSA Then there is the question of U.S. sanctions on India for buying the S-400, a Russian missile defence system. India, which paid just under $5.5 billion for the equipment, will begin taking delivery of the system this year, potentially kicking off sanctions under a 2017 U.S. law, the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Senator Bob Menendez, the Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Forces Committee, wrote to Mr. Austin this week asking him to raise not just the S-400 sanctions possibility with his interlocutors in Delhi but also concerns about an erosion of democratic norms in India. Bipartisan support India continues to enjoy bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, but along with that comes an interest in and reactions to developments within the country. “The letter from Senator Menendez suggests Congress will play an active role in shaping the U.S.-India relationship,” says Sameer Lalwani, director of the Stimson Center’s South Asia programme. “I expect the Pentagon will continue to communicate the trade-offs and consequences for deep U.S.-India defence cooperation if India inducts the Russian-made S-400 system. At the same time, I expect India to proceed with this procurement because it does bolster its defences, particularly against China and the PLAAF [Chinese air force],” Mr. Lalwani said. Prior to his departure from New Delhi in January, former U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Juster had said that CAATSA was not designed to harm friends and allies of the U.S. His comments were made not long after the Trump administration sanctioned Turkey (a NATO ally of the U.S.)in December, for its S-400 purchase. Congress had mandated the sanctions in a defence Bill passed in 2020, forcing the executive’s The law does provide for sanctions waivers: this is contingent on it being in the national interest of the U.S., or the country in question cooperating with he U.S. on security matters, or the country reducing its reliance on Russian weapons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/austin-visit-may-allay-concerns-about-indo-pacific-afghanistan/article34104051.ece
19 March 2021||Amsterdam,||EU regulator backs AstraZeneca vaccine after safety investigation||The EU’s drug watchdog said on Thursday it is convinced the benefits of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the risks following an investigation into reports of blood disorders that prompted more than a dozen nations to suspend its use. The news came as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) director Emer Cooke said the watchdog could not definitively rule out a link between blood clot incidents and the vaccine in its investigation into 30 cases of a rare blood clotting condition. But she said in a briefing the “clear” conclusion of the review was that the vaccine “benefits in protecting people from COVID-19 with the associated risk of death or hospitalisation outweigh the possible risks.” The agency will, however, update its guidance to include an explanation about the potential risks on both the patient leaflet and in the information for healthcare professionals, she said. The agency has been under growing pressure to clear up safety concerns after a small number of reports in recent weeks of bleeding, blood clots and low platelet counts in people who have received the shot. The EMA’s focus and primary concern has been on cases of blood clots in the head, a rare condition that’s difficult to treat called cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) or a subform known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). More than 45 million of the shots have been administered across the EEA. The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it was better to take the AstraZeneca vaccine than not — adding that it was looking into available data on the shot. Countries resume shots Many countries, including France, Italy, Latvia and Lithuania, and regions such as Germany’s Rhineland-Palatinate, announced resumption of vaccine rollout from Friday. Spain will restart its use from next week. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he will get the vaccine on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-regulator-backs-astrazeneca-vaccine-after-safety-investigation/article34104045.ece
19 March 2021||Berlin,||Children faced abuse in German diocese: report||An independent study commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church released on Thursday has uncovered hundreds of cases of sexual violence allegedly committed by clergy and laymen in Germany’s top diocese. The long-awaited 800-page report on the Cologne diocese found 202 alleged perpetrators of sexual assault and 314 victims between 1975 and 2018, Bjoern Gercke, a lawyer mandated by the Church, told reporters. “More than half of the victims were children under the age of 14,” Mr. Gercke said. The findings show “that for decades, apparently no one dared to report such cases”. However, the investigation cleared Cologne’s Archbishop Rainer Maria Woelki of breach of duty over the abuse. He had faced months of protests for refusing to allow the publication of an earlier study on abuse committed by priests in his diocese. Most of the allegations cover the tenure of Archbishop Woelki’s predecessor, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, who died in 2017. He had justified his decision citing a right to privacy for those accused in the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/children-faced-abuse-in-german-diocese-report/article34104046.ece

Flags flew at half-mast as the country began a 14-day mourning period after Vice- President Samia Suluhu Hassan — who is set to become the country’s first female leader — announced Magufuli’s death before midnight on Wednesday. Ms. Hassan said Magufuli had died on Wednesday of a “heart condition” from which he had long suffered, in a hospital in Dar es Salaam. The government had previously denied Mr. Magufuli was ill as pressure mounted to explain his three-week absence from public view, which sparked rumours he was had COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tanzania-mourns-after-magufulis-sudden-death/article34104053.ece

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Biden and the West Asian tinderbox||It took just 36 days for United States President Joe Biden to order his first air strike abroad since taking office. On February 25, the U.S. bombed facilities used by Iran-backed militias in Syria, in retaliation for a rocket attack at an American base in Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan, earlier in the month, allegedly by pro-Iran Shia militants in Iraq. The next day, the administration released an intelligence report on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate on October 2, 2018, which concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the operation. Separately, the Biden administration has taken steps to revive the Iran nuclear deal, and asked the Islamic Republic to comply with the terms of the multilateral agreement that was reached in 2015 but abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018. The strategic reality These three decisions may not be directly interlinked, but they draw a broad outline of Mr. Biden’s West Asia policy. Almost all American Presidents since the Second World War have left deep policy imprints on the region. Barack Obama and Mr. Trump sought to refocus away from West Asia to East Asia where China is rising, but they did it differently. Mr. Obama identified Iran’s nuclear programme as his primary foreign policy challenge in the region — as it could end Israel’s nuclear monopoly and trigger an arms race — and sought to address it diplomatically. This was also out of a reluctant conviction that going to war with Iran would be too risky. Mr. Trump took a more hostile approach towards Iran. He abandoned the nuclear deal, reimposed sanctions on Tehran, offered unconditional support to Saudi Arabia and Israel in taking on Iranian proxies, and even assassinated a top Iranian General. But Mr. Trump was also careful not to open a direct war with Iran. He ordered the hit on Qassim Soleimani in Iraq, not inside Iran. When Iran retaliated by firing missiles at American bases in Iraq or when it shot down an American drone over the Gulf, Mr. Trump chose not to order counter attacks. Mr. Biden faces the same strategic reality, with a greater urgency. The competition with China has revived memories of the Cold War, and the administration has moved fast to build an alliance system in the Indo-Pacific. Mr. Biden cannot get stuck in West Asia for too long, but he cannot just leave a region, which has some of America’s closest allies, and hosts thousands of its troops, either. His initial decisions suggest that he, like Mr. Obama, has identified the Iranian nuclear programme as the key challenge. Because, if that is not tackled, it could trigger a chain of incidents, drawing both the U.S. and its allies into another prolonged conflict in the region which would slow down his pivot to the Indo-Pacific. Mr. Obama was narrowly focused on the Iran nuclear programme. (He did not use force against Iran or its proxies that could have endangered the nuclear talks.) Mr. Biden, on the other hand, has set a more ambitious plan in motion. By offering talks to Iran while at the same time bombing Iranian proxies and ending support for Saudi Arabia’s war on Yemen and releasing an intelligence exposé on its de facto leader, he is seeking to strike a balance between the region’s two key powers — one an ally and the other a rival. The Iran deal as ticking clock But Mr. Biden faces at least three key challenges in his bid to reshape the U.S.’s engagement with the region. One, his decision to bomb pro-Iran militants in Syria in retaliation for an attack by Iran-backed militants in Iraq could be read in Iran as a weak show of strength rather than a tough warning. Mr. Trump ordered the Soleimani hit in Iraq. Mr. Biden picked Syria, further away from Iran. When Soleimani was killed, the Trump administration claimed that the attack reestablished America’s deterrence. But in fact, Shia militants continued to target American positions inside Iraq with rocket attacks. Even after Mr. Biden’s Syria strikes, attacks targeting U.S. presence continued in Iraq. After Mr. Biden stopped America’s support for the Yemen war, the Houthis, backed by Iran, also stepped up attacks against Saudi Arabia. While attacks and counter attacks continue, Mr. Biden is losing precious time to revive the nuclear deal. Iran is going to presidential elections in June. Mr. Biden’s best practical way to contain Iran’s nuclear programme is by reviving the deal. And his best bet to revive the deal is to do it before President Hassan Rouhani, whose government signed the original agreement in 2015, leaves office. The clock is ticking. Saudi Arabia and Israel Two, if the U.S.’s dependence on Saudi Arabia has reduced in recent years, Riyadh’s dependence on Washington has also come down in a changing West Asia. The U.S. did nothing when Saudi oil facilities came under attack in September 2019. The Saudis know that America’s ability in shaping geopolitical outcome in West Asia is in decline. Today, there are more power centres in the region — from Turkey to Russia. MBS, as the Saudi Crown Prince is widely called, has established a good working relationship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Foreseeing some blowback from the Biden administration, he moved quickly to mend ties with Qatar, even ignoring the scepticism from the United Arab Emirates. On March 7, in an apparent defiance of America’s call for an end to the war on Yemen, Saudi Arabia carried out massive air strikes in the country amid Houthi attacks. Unless there is a palace coup, MBS is set to become the monarch when his father, King Salman, leaves the throne. Washington will have to deal with him, and when it does, he will have more options on his side than his father, uncles and grandfather had. Three, the elephant in the room is Israel. How is Mr. Biden going to fit Israel into his larger scheme of things for West Asia? If Mr. Biden talks human rights to Saudi Arabia and ignores the rights abuses by Israel, which is being investigated by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories, his policy would look hollow. If he “holds Iran accountable” for the actions of Shia militias by ordering air strikes and does nothing to stop Israel’s ever-expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank, he would be accused of double standards. And if he takes a tougher line towards Israel and pushes them to revive the stalled peace process with the Palestinians at a time when his administration seeks to engage Iran for the nuclear deal, it would further infuriate the Israelis, who in the past had carried out intelligence operations and targeted killings inside Iran. An angry Israel can, to the least, torpedo Mr. Biden’s Iran policy. China is the focus now Mr. Biden does not have an easy way out of the West Asian tinderbox. Mr. Obama had narrower goals. Success for Mr. Biden would depend largely on how he manages to balance between the three key powers in the region. He may be hoping that a hybrid strategy of tough posturing, use of limited force and diplomatic outreach would yield results. It would have worked 20 years ago when the U.S. push for democracy had forced even Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak to hold multiparty elections. The U.S. today is a sunset power in West Asia, and its strategic focus is on China. Both America’s allies and rivals know that. And in geopolitics, consequences need not necessarily follow the plan of action. stanly.johny@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/biden-and-the-west-asian-tinderbox/article34104015.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Dismantle the power edifices, empower those unseen||At a recent public interaction, Kamal Haasan, the leader of the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM)-led political front — which positions itself as an alternative to the long-standing Dravida Munnerta Kazhagam and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led political formations — stated that his party’s application form for aspiring candidates had no column for caste. This was in response to a question whether Tamil Nadu will ever transcend caste-based politics. Merit and identity An often-paraded argument by the caste privileged is that merit is an untainted guiding light while identity is a biased lens. Merit is an absolute, a metric detached from social variances and undulations. It is not a product of society. On the contrary, it is a measure that circumvents societal discrimination. One solution advanced is the removal of the ‘caste column’ from all application forms. Kamal Haasan speaks in the same vein. By the simple act of removing one column , presto, his party becomes casteless; and will, consequently, lead to caste-free politics. A meritocracy will be born! The field is far from level People enjoying caste privilege will no doubt demand that caste should not be a dominant determinant in electoral politics. If you belong to brahminical or politically dominant castes, it is convenient and self-serving to demand this false level-playing field. But the field is far from level. It is so uneven that those who have been pushed down the slopes into the crevasses and forced to remain there will not be represented unless they are specifically identified and representatives of their communities gain the power to speak for themselves. When you are a Dalit, it matters that you are being represented by someone who shares your lived experience. The community lives on the margins, not just economically but in every socio-political sphere. This results in marginal political power and, in such an environment, the agency to speak for Dalits remaining with Dalits is essential. This is not very different from an African-American tending to identify with their own or women rallying around women candidates. Elimination of caste requires the dismantling of edifices of power and the empowering of those who remain unseen. These two seemingly opposite actions need to work in tandem in order to attain equity. A reserved constituency is an important political tool for Dalits. B.R. Ambedkar spoke of the ‘Annihilation of Caste’ but that did not mean keeping it out of political action. Rather, quite the opposite. An annihilation of caste can be achieved only when we create a political, economic and social environment that affirms marginalised identities with vigour and confidence. Parties such as the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi with their thrust on Dalit political presence, are, therefore, indispensable to bringing about political parity, making that caste column central to empowerment. Caste always lingers The caste-empowered close their eyes to the reality of how caste operates. Biases are hereditary societal implants. When a provision for self-identification by caste is done away with, the candidate presumes he has elevated himself to a trans-caste pedestal. This is a delusion. The party, on its part, believes that prior social work for the marginalised or politically progressive answers given in an interview reveal the individual’s ‘above-caste distinction’ attitude. But this is not how the story unravels. Caste always lingers and operates in ways that go unnoticed. Even the most well-intentioned Forward Caste or Other Backward Caste politicians need to keep themselves in check. This will only be achieved if every political party consciously and deliberately looks for candidates from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities and fields them as such, up-front. Importantly, this must not be confined to the obligatory reserved seats. I would have been far more impressed had Kamal Haasan said that his party made a conscious effort to identify Dalit and tribal candidates and allocated a certain percentage of seats for them. Caste is such an enclosed identity that parties that present a progressive face take the route of negating its active presence rather than taking it head-on. The counter argument would be that the Gounder and Thevar caste groups consolidated themselves only because of caste-based politics. What this perspective ignores is the fact that these were already socio-culturally dominant communities and they further consolidated this inherent position. Communities such as Vanniyars also formed caste-based formations, further squeezing Dalits into a corner. Therefore, to speak of caste-identity-less candidate selection is problematic. We need to break powerful caste-centric groupism-s but that will not happen unless we first recognise that such communities come together only because of their caste might within the social order. Whereas, Dalit communities find it much harder to assemble and are always viewed with suspicion by all. The brahmins’, even the anti-caste brahmins’, complaint about casteism in Tamil Nadu politics does not stem from their social, cultural or economic marginalisation. Their frustration comes from their removal from the high seats and being relegated to the gallery. The demolition of caste from Tamil Nadu politics needs to begin on the ground. Only then will it reflect in elections. At the same time, despite many serious failings, we have to applaud Tamil Nadu for the social progress that it has made over the decades. This is the direct result of robust, socially aware politics. But the caste column from a form can only be removed when Dalits and Tribals feel that it has become redundant and their caste identity irrelevant; not when those who will always benefit from caste proclaim castelessness in order to feel good about their hearts being in the right place.

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Aadhaar as a hurdle||The Supreme Court, on Wednesday, did the right thing by terming as serious the allegation by a petitioner that three crore ration cards were cancelled for not being linked with the Aadhaar database and that these were connected to reported starvation deaths in some States. The unique identification scheme has been in existence for more than a decade and recent data has estimated that nearly 90% of India’s projected population has been assigned the Aadhaar number. Following the Court’s judgment in 2018, upholding the Aadhaar programme as a reasonable restriction on individual privacy to fulfil welfare requirements and dignity — a 4-1 majority Bench had also rejected a review petition in January 2021 — questions about the scheme’s validity for public purposes have been put to rest. But that has not meant that concerns about the failures in the use of the identity verification project have been allayed. These include inefficiencies in biometric authentication and updating, linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts, and the use of the Aadhaar payment bridge. With benefits under the PDS, the NREGA and LPG subsidy, among other essentials, requiring individuals to have the Aadhaar number, inefficiencies and failures have led to inconvenience and suffering for the poor. There are reports that show failures in authentication having led to delays in the disbursal of benefits and, in many cases, in their denial due to cancellation of legitimate beneficiary names. The government had promised that exemption mechanisms that would allow for overriding such failures will help beneficiaries still avail subsidies and benefits despite system failures. That has been the response by the government to the recent petition as well, but reports from States such as Jharkhand from 2017, for example, suggest that there have been starvation deaths because of the denial of benefits and subsidies. Biometric authentication failures are but expected of a large scale and technology-intensive project such as the UID. Despite being designed to store finger and iris scans of most users, doubts about the success rates of authentication and the generation of “false negatives” have always persisted, more so for labourers and tribal people. Those engaged in manual and hard labour, for example, are susceptible to fingerprint changes over time. In practice, beneficiaries have tended to use Aadhaar cards as identity markers but there have been instances of people losing cards and being denied benefits. Given the scale of the problem, the central and State governments would do well to allow alternative identification so that genuine beneficiaries are not denied due subsidies. The question of fraud can still be addressed by the use of other verification cards and by decentralised disbursal of services at the panchayat level.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/aadhaar-as-a-hurdle/article34104003.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||For a reset||As top diplomats from the U.S. and China begin their meeting in Alaska, there is no question that their conversation will be a difficult one. The meeting, between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Yang Jiechi, CCP Politburo member and Director, Central Foreign Affairs Commission, accompanied by U.S. NSA Jake Sullivan and Chinese Foreign Minister and State Councillor Wang Yi, comes on the back of tensions that spiralled during the Trump administration around trade tariffs, 5G telecommunication, tech espionage, Chinese maritime actions and U.S. sanctions on China, and further exacerbated over the pandemic, which Mr. Trump called the “China virus”. Biden administration officials have said that they will bring up China’s crackdown in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, Chinese aggression against U.S. allies and partners, in particular pressure on Australia over trade bans, aggression against Japan in the Senkaku islands and even the PLA’s incursions over the LAC, which China considers bilateral issues. Mr. Blinken prefaced the Alaska meet with visits to Seoul and Tokyo where he promised an American “pushback” to China, and he goes into the talks with the backing of the recent summit-level Quad conversations, with a commitment to ensuring a free Indo-Pacific. For its part, China is seeking a reversal of Trump-era policies, and structured dialogue to take forward ties from the point they have reached, arguably their lowest since the Nixon era. In particular, China wants an end to the U.S.’s trade sanctions, restrictions on American firms manufacturing in China and visa bans, and a reopening of its consulate in Houston. Clearly, the scene is set for an extended airing of grievances, and expectations are low of any breakthrough, but the fact that the meeting is happening at all sends the signal that both sides are prepared to engage each other. Mr. Blinken’s formulation that the U.S. will be “competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be and adversarial when it must be” with China, chalks up climate change, the COVID-19 challenge and global economic recovery as areas of possible discussion. Research quoted by the World Economic Forum predicted that the U.S.-China tariff war itself could cost the world $600 billion. Afghanistan is another area where the U.S. and China have held three meetings last year as part of the “Troika” with Russia, and a common peace strategy could be another helpful conversation. The two sides are expected to discuss a possible summit meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. While New Delhi has a litany of its own grievances with Beijing, it too would benefit if a “Cold War” between the U.S. and China is averted, much like the rest of the world that has found itself akin to the proverbial grass when two elephants fight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/for-a-reset/article34104004.ece
19 March 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC stays Future on Reliance deal||In a major victory for U.S.-based e-commence giant Amazon, the Delhi High Court on Thursday ruled that Future Retail Limited (FRL) and its promoters including Kishore Biyani “deliberately and wilfully” violated the order of an emergency arbitrator (EA) restraining FRL from going ahead with its assets sale deal with Reliance Retail. Noting that the intention of FRL and its promoters “do not appear to be honest”, the high court directed attachment of the assets of Future Coupons Private Limited (FCPL), FRL, Mr. Biyani and 10 other promoters. Justice J.R. Midha also directed Mr. Biyani and the other promoters to be present before the court on the next date of hearing on April 28. It additionally issued show-cause notices to all the promoters “to show cause why they be not detained in civil prison for a term not exceeding three months” for violation of the emergency arbitrator’s order. The high court also imposed a cost of Rs. 20 lakh on Future Group which will be deposited in the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund for providing COVID-19 vaccines to senior citizens of Below Poverty Line (BPL) category. It directed Future Group not to take any further action in violation of the interim order passed by the emergency arbitrator at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) on October 25, 2020. The high court’s order came on a plea of Amazon, which has 49% stake in FCPL, seeking enforcement of the EA award. Amazon had contended that it had invested Rs. 1,43l crore in FCPL with the clear understanding that FRL would be the sole vehicle for its retail business and its retail assets would not be alienated without its consent and never to a Restricted Person, including the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group. Amazon stated that FRL had taken various steps to transfer the retail assets to the restricted person, MDA Group, in violation of the EA order and that the firm was continuing with it. ‘Breached agreements’ “The respondents (Future Group) have breached the agreements. However, there is no remorse. The intention of the respondents does not appear to be honest,” the high court remarked. FCPL, which holds 9.82% in FRL, has objected to the enforcement of the EA award on various ground including that the EA is not an Arbitrator or Arbitral Tribunal. The high court rejected this saying, “The interim order dated 25th October, 2020 is legal, valid and enforceable as an order of the Court”. FRL had also argued that Reliance was acquiring the retail and wholesale business as also the logistics and warehousing business from the Future Group as going concerns on a slump sale basis for a lumpsum aggregate consideration of Rs. 24,713 crore. The high court, however, rejected FRL’s argument that if this scheme fell through, it was inevitable that FRL would go into liquidation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/delhi-hc-stays-future-on-reliance-deal/article34103976.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Neelachal Ispat: losses scale high, minority holders to stay||The government has informed potential private bidders for ailing steel company Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL) that lenders and other entities holding a 6.29% stake in the company will neither infuse any funds nor offload their shares in the firm as part of the privatisation process. As per the FY20 annual report shared with bidders this week, the firm’s losses hit a record Rs. 1,758 crore in the year, from Rs. 401.45 crore in FY19. As per preliminary data provided to bidders in January, the firm had incurred a loss of Rs. 826.73 crore in the first nine months of FY20. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management in the Finance Ministry has also told bidders that no shareholder agreement is available for partly paid shares worth 0.94% held by the firm’s past vendors — G.A. Danieli India Ltd. and SMS India Pvt. Ltd. — since 1999-2000. It has also said these shares would not be sold, in response to a query from bidders. The government has invited expressions of interest to offload 93.71% stake in NINL held by MMTC, the Industrial Promotion & Investment Corporation of Odisha, Odisha Mining Corporation, NMDC, MECON and BHEL, till March 29. Set up in 1982, NINL has been incurring losses since FY13. Bidders had sought details on plans for the 5.35% stake held mainly by 11 state-owned entities such as LIC, IDBI Bank and Central Bank of India — allotted as part of a debt restructuring exercise in FY05 — and another 0.94% held by two holders of partly paid-up shares. The firm’s liabilities would be cleared from the disinvestment proceeds and provide unfair gains to minority shareholders without their infusing any capital, bidders have pointed out.  The firm’s losses hit a record Rs. 1,758 crore in FY20, from Rs. 401.45 crore the previous year||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/neelachal-ispat-losses-scale-high-minority-holders-to-stay/article34103992.ece
19 March 2021||MUMBAI,||Equities fall as U.S. bond yields rise on Fed stance||Indian equity benchmarks dropped by more than 1% for the second straight session on Thursday on concern that rising U.S. bond yields in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s dovish policy stance could herald foreign fund outflows. Amid widespread selling pressure, the S&P BSE Sensex slumped 585 points, or 1.17%, to close at 49,217. The NSE Nifty 50 index slid 163 points, or 1.11%, to 14,558. Both the indices fell for the fifth consecutive session. Analysts said the rising U.S. bond yields could spur an outflow of funds. “Equities fell into sharp correction after early optimism as U.S. bond yields rose to their highest level since January,” said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services. Mr. Nair said Indian markets saw more volatility than its global peers as domestic investors turned extra cautious on the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. “The mounting concerns of possible fresh economic restrictions made enthusiasm of dovish commentary from the Federal Reserve short-lived for domestic markets,” Press Trust of India quoted Binod Modi, head strategy at Reliance Securities, as saying.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/equities-fall-as-us-bond-yields-rise-on-fed-stance/article34103988.ece

19 March 2021||Ahmedabad,||Suryakumar, bowlers help India buck ‘chasing’ trend and stay alive||If Ishan Kishan was unfortunate to be ruled out of the fourth T20I because of a groin strain, Lady Luck smiled on his replacement — Suryakumar Yadav. The Mumbai cricketer, dropped for the previous outing after not having faced a ball on debut in the second T20I, grabbed his chance. Suryakumar’s electric 31-ball 57 was key to India’s tight eight-run victory, which helped the home side pull level at 2-2 in the five-match series. The unshakable self-confidence that Suryakumar exudes came to the forefront when he rocked back to pull Jofra Archer for a six off the very first ball he faced. It was a dream start to his international batting career. Astonishing scoop Two more maximums followed — including an astonishing scoop over fine-leg — before a questionable catch by Dawid Malan forced his dismissal. Skipper Virat Kohli (1, 5b) fell cheaply, rushing down the track to leg-spinner Adil Rashid and missing completely. Rishabh Pant (30, 23b, 4x4) and Shreyas Iyer (37, 18b, 5x4, 1x6) kept the score moving at a healthy rate, helping India make 185 for eight. Archer finished with four for 33, his best figures in T20Is. Fellow pacer Mark Wood was all fire and bite, even if he only managed to scalp one wicket. Stokes on song In reply, England fought hard but paid the price for losing wickets at crucial junctures. Ben Stokes (46, 23b, 4x4, 3x6) kept the visitors in the hunt with some clean hits. He fancied his chances against spinners Washington Sundar and Rahul Chahar, tonking anything full with great power into the stands. It took some clever bowling from Shardul Thakur in the 17th over to turn the tide. He first took out Stokes with a slower ball, slapped straight to Suryakumar at long-off. The very next ball, Eoin Morgan fell to another cutter. England needed 46 runs from 22 balls at this stage, leaving Sam Curran, Chris Jordan and Archer with a lot on their plate. With 23 needed off the final over, Shardul was given the ball. A nervous Shardul conceded a four, a six and two wides, but got his act together in the final three deliveries to shut England out of the contest. Opener Jason Roy looked dangerous during his 27-ball 40, until a flat-batted tennis shot off Hardik Pandya landed in Suryakumar’s hands at deep mid-wicket. His opening partner Jos Buttler (9, 6b), the Man-of-the-Match in the third T20I, was deceived by a slower ball from Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Leg-spinner Chahar, drafted in for Yuzvendra Chahal, showed great control and temperament. He cleaned up Malan, who attempted a reverse-sweep to a ball on leg-stump, and then returned to remove Jonny Bairstow, ending a dangerous 65-run stand between Bairstow and Stokes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/suryakumar-bowlers-help-india-buck-chasing-trend-and-stay-alive/article34104123.ece
19 March 2021||London,||Chelsea in quarters after seven years||Chelsea eased into the quarterfinals of the Champions League for the first time in seven years with a 2-0 victory over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, completing a 3-0 win on aggregate. Chelsea took the lead with a goal created by a trio of summer signings who cost more than $200 million. Kai Havertz launched a counter-attack after Kieran Trippier’s cross was intercepted before releasing Timo Werner to run down the left. Werner sent the ball in for Hakim Ziyech, who placed the shot under goalkeeper Jan Oblak in the 34th minute. Sending off The goal meant Atletico needed to score twice but its slim chances ended when Stefan Savic was sent off in the 81st minute for elbowing Chelsea defender Antonio Rüdiger. Two of Chelsea’s substitutes then combined for the second goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time. Emerson Palmieri had only been on the pitch a minute when he was set up by Christian Pulisic on the break and he struck only his second goal in three years at Chelsea. The win further builds on the momentum the London club has built up in the two months since Frank Lampard was fired, with new coach Thomas Tuchel unbeaten in 13 matches with 11 clean sheets. Latest setback It was just the latest setback for Atletico, whose Spanish league lead has dwindled from 10 to four points in recent weeks. With defending champion Bayern Munich beating Lazio 2-1 to seal a 6-2 aggregate win in the night’s other game, the quarterfinal line-up is now complete. England is the best represented country with Liverpool and Manchester City also through. Borussia Dortmund is with Bayern in Friday’s draw, along with Paris Saint-Germain, Porto and record 13-time champion Real Madrid. Robert Lewandowski gave Bayern the lead from the penalty spot in the 33rd minute for his 39th goal in all competitions this season. Lewandowski calmly struck the ball past his former Bayern teammate Pepe Reina after Lazio’s Vedat Muriqi was judged to have held Leon Goretzka as they jostled for position at a corner. Lewandowski had the chance to reach 40 goals but the Polish striker hit the post with a low drive from outside the penalty area. Defence-splitting Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting came off the bench to replace Lewandowski and soon scored Bayern’s second off a defence-splitting pass from David Alaba in the 73rd. The game was long since out of Lazio’s reach when Marco Parolo headed in a free kick in the 82nd. That marked Bayern’s seventh game in a row conceding at least one goal. Bayern has reached at least the quarterfinals in nine of its last 10 Champions League campaigns, with the sole miss coming with a 3-1 aggregate loss to Liverpool in the last 16 in 2019.  The results: Bayern Munich 2 (Lewandowski 33-pen, Choupo-Moting 73) bt Lazio 1 (Parolo 82). Bayern wins 6-2 on aggregate.   Chelsea 1 (Ziyech 34, Emerson 90+4) bt Atletico Madrid 0. Chelsea wins 3-0 on aggregate.   Quarterfinal line-up: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Paris St. Germain, Porto, Real Madrid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chelsea-in-quarters-after-seven-years/article34104157.ece

Sathiyan, Manika Batra and Sutirtha Mukherjee, all booked their places in the Tokyo Olympics, on Thursday. At the Asian Olympic qualification event in Doha, Sathiyan and Sutirtha qualified as group toppers for what will be their maiden Olympics, while Sharath and Manika made the cut as the highest-ranked second-placed players in their respective categories. It will be Sharath’s fourth appearance at the Olympics, and second for Manika.

19 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Raman refuses to blame the bowlers||The Indian bowlers may have struggled to make an impact on the placid pitches in the women’s five-match One-Day International series against South Africa, but coach W.V. Raman refuses to blame them. Deliberate ploy Admitting that the bowlers needed time to settle into their groove, the way left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad had done in the fifth match, Raman said it had been a deliberate ploy to provide the kind of tracks at home that the team may come across abroad. The plan was to take the team out of its comfort zone, make the players “adapt and adjust” against a competent opponent and find ways to perform better. Quite pleased with the team’s batting, Raman said it could have backfired had the team become greedy in trying to build a big total, right from the start. “It is very easy to lose a match in the first 15 overs, and look down the barrel,” said Raman, stressing the need to pace the innings according to the situation. He would discuss the issues with the National selectors if required, Raman said, adding that the Indian players lacked “game time’ and were “understandably short of mental stamina”. Raman, however, was confident the girls would bounce back soon. Even though there was no information on any upcoming series after the three T20 games against South Africa, in the run-up to the World Cup next year, Raman said a lot of activities were being planned to help the players get into their rhythm and move towards peak performance.  On Harmanpreet Kaur’s injury that had seen her retire while batting in the fifth match, Raman said she had sustained a “hip adductor strain”. He was hopeful of her being fit for the T20Is.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/raman-refuses-to-blame-the-bowlers-for-loss-in-odi-series/article34104121.ece
19 March 2021||PATIALA,||Dhanalakshmi betters Usha’s 200m meet mark||After three days of exciting competition, new National records and Olympic qualifications, Thursday was a sedate affair at the 24th Federation Cup barring a massive surge on track by Dhanalakshmi that obliterated a 23-year old meet record. The Tamil Nadu youngster reiterated her determination to rewrite the record books and upset the big names in the competition, besting Hima Das and throwing down the gauntlet with a scorching 23.26s in the 200m heats, a new meet record to overhaul the 23-year old mark in P.T. Usha’s name. While her previous official best was 24.05 — more than half-a second off Thursday’s pace — she had done 23.47 in a State meet in January this year. Running in the same heat as Hima, she pushed the more celebrated runner to a distant second in 24.39. With Dutee Chand pulling out of the event earlier, it was expected to be a clash between the established star and the new kid and the final on Friday will be keenly watched.  The results:   Men: 800m: 1. Krishan Kumar (Har, 1:48.48), 2. Ankesh Chaudhary (HP, 1:48.65), 3. Anu Kumar (Utk, 1:49.25); Discus throw: 1. Kirpal Singh (Pun, 59.04m), 2. Vazeer (Har, 56.40m), 3.

19 March 2021||Paris,||Tuchel makes Chelsea a tough competitor||It is a coach who started the season in charge of one of Europe’s elite before joining another who has made the biggest impression in the Champions League this week. Thomas Tuchel was sacked by Paris Saint-Germain in December despite winning a Champions League group also containing RB Leipzig and Manchester United. In January he joined Chelsea and the impact the German has had in seven weeks has been remarkable. On Wednesday it saw off LaLiga leader Atletico Madrid in the pre-quarterfinals. Disciplined unit Tuchel took over a side struggling for consistency under Frank Lampard and immediately turned it into a supremely disciplined unit that has conceded just two goals and remains unbeaten in his 13 games in charge. It made Diego Simeone’s Atletico look thoroughly ordinary in both legs and few teams will relish the prospect of facing Chelsea in the last eight. “We feel that we deserve this. We are in the last eight which is already a big step. From there on we go, there is no need to be afraid, we will take what we get and will prepare in the best way possible,” Tuchel said on Wednesday. Chelsea’s 2012 Champions League triumph came after it changed manager mid-season and Tuchel will be determined to go one better than last season, when PSG lost to Bayern Munich in the final. A reunion with PSG in the next round would be fascinating, and not one the French club would likely welcome as it struggles to impress under Tuchel’s successor Mauricio Pochettino, the 4-1 win in Barcelona aside. There are six former winners in the last-eight draw, with a total of 29 European Cups between them. Looking formidable Only Manchester City among the quarterfinalists has never reached the final, but it looks formidable: Pep Guardiola’s team has won 24 of its last 25 games and is chasing an unprecedented quadruple. Perhaps the only thing counting against it is the growing pressure to win the trophy after quarterfinal exits in the last three years. “Since the first year I arrived they told me that you have to win the Champions League,” Guardiola admitted after his side beat Borussia Monchengladbach. With Liverpool also still alive, England has three representatives in the draw, yet Bayern — with 18 wins and one draw in 19 Champions League games since the start of last season — remains the team to beat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tuchel-makes-chelsea-a-tough-competitor/article34104410.ece
19 March 2021||London,||Wimbledon to scrap queues||Wimbledon’s famous queue will not operate at this year’s championships because of coronavirus measures, the All England Club announced on Thursday. The snake of tennis fans waiting to gain access to the event in leafy southwest London has become one of the defining sights of the Grand Slam. Many camp out overnight to gain an advantage but tickets will be distributed differently this year. There will also be no reselling of tickets within the grounds. “Both the queue and ticket resale remain much-loved and important Wimbledon traditions, and we look forward to their return in 2022,” said a statement from Wimbledon. Organisers are working on the basis that a reduced number of fans will be allowed into the grounds but are trying to be as flexible as possible to accommodate whatever the rules are in June and July. Wimbledon is scheduled to start on June 28, a week after the government plans to lift all legal limits on social contact. Britain has been one of the countries hardest-hit by COVID-19 with over 125,000 deaths but cases have fallen sharply during a swift vaccination campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wimbledon-to-scrap-queues/article34104156.ece

Niki, who had beaten Fardeen’s brother Faisal in the first round, will take on eighth seed Prithvi Sekhar in the quarterfinals. Former Asian junior champion Nitin Kumar Sinha beat sixth seed Suraj Prabodh for the loss of four games to set up a quarterfinal against fourth seed Paras Dahiya.

19 March 2021||KOLKATA,||Vijender looks to extend unbeaten run||Vijender Singh will look to extend his unbeaten run in professional boxing when he takes on Russian Artysh Lopsan in the ‘Battle on Ship’ on the rooftop of the Majestic Pride Casino ship in Goa on Friday. More experienced Thirty-five-year-old WBO Oriental super middleweight and WBO Asia-Pacific super middleweight champion Vijender will rely on his experience against the taller and younger Lopsan, who has a record of four wins in six bouts. Vijender has been out of action since his last bout, against Ghanaian Charles Adamu, in November 2019 due to COVID-related restrictions. Lopsan, meanwhile, was beaten by compatriot Pavel Silyagin in a WBA Asian super middleweight title clash in Moscow in March last year. Vijender has been in training with young Haryana boxers under the guidance of former teammate-turned-coach Jai Bhagwan. His record reading 12-0 with eight knockouts, Vijender was confident after weighing-in at 75.1kg. On the right path “I am excited at returning to the ring. The weigh-in gives me confidence that I am on the right path. I don’t really care who I am fighting. I will surely go for the knockout and if not that, I will make sure my every punch counts,” he said Vijender. The six-foot-four-inch Lopsan had a warning for Vijender. A warning “I rather prefer my fists to do the talking. We shall see in the ring what Vijender is capable of. I hope it is easy work for me and I will be the first to end his unbeaten streak,” said Lopsan, setting his weight at 76.2kg. Seven undercard fights, including the one between Neeraj Goyat and Sandeep Kumar in the welterweight division, will provide additional entertainment to boxing lovers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vijender-looks-to-extend-unbeaten-run/article34104000.ece
19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||India looks to continue its domination||Host India will look to continue its global domination in shooting when the first final of the World Cup is held at the Dr. Karni Singh Range. After the pandemic, shooting, especially in rifle and pistol events, returns in a new avatar. The qualification for air rifle men and women will be held on Friday. The finals for both the events, apart from the air pistol for men and women, will be staged on Saturday. It will continue with the team competition for air rifle and air pistol on the third day, Sunday. Earlier, every event used to start and finish in one day, except for the shotgun events, and rapid fire pistol, which required two stages of competition over two days. India had topped the medals table in all the four World Cups in rifle and pistol in 2019. Top of the table It also went on to top the table in the elite competition, the World Cup Final. After the topsy turvy scores during the selection trials, at least in some cases, it will be interesting to see how the Olympics bound Indian shooters fare.  It was in the World Championship in 2018 that Anjum Moudgil and Apurvi Chandela won the first two Olympic quota for the Tokyo Games with the silver medal and the fourth place respectively. After sustaining their shooting for two years, both have the challenge to stay ahead of the other claimants in air rifle, especially World No. 1 Elavenil Valarivan, and confirm their tickets to Tokyo. There may have also been certain wrong projections, as the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) has two distinctly different selection policies for choosing the national team for regular international competitions, and the Olympic team. From that perspective, most of the 15 Olympic quota winners would already be very clear about their status. Focusing on the shooting would be the key, considering the numerous distractions, including the COVID-19 protocols, to sustain India’s supremacy on the world stage. Even though many shooting super powers are missing from the line-up, there will be no dearth of exciting performances for 10 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-looks-to-continue-its-domination/article34104376.ece

19 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||‘Soft signal’ in sharp focus||The frailties of the 'soft signal' call were exposed in the fourth T20I here on Thursday, when Suryakumar Yadav’s entertaining knock was cut short. A top edge flew to Dawid Malan at deep fine-leg, who took a low, debatable catch. On-field umpires Nitin Menon and K.N. Ananthapadmanabhan, with the former the closest to the action at square-leg, indicated that it was 'out' — the ‘soft signal’ — before referring it upstairs. Replays seemed to suggest that Malan had grounded the ball, but TV umpire Virender Sharma judged that there was no indisputable evidence to overrule the ‘soft signal’ and stuck with the ‘out’ decision. The concept came under the scanner for a second time in the innings, when Washington Sundar fell to a catch taken by Adil Rashid on the boundary rope. The ‘soft signal’ was 'out', which replays appeared to suggest was probably right, but again the on-field umpires were a fair distance from the incident. Former India cricketers V.V.S. Laxman and Wasim Jaffer were among the many who took to Twitter to express their frustration at the ‘soft signal’, asking for its elimination. Would it not be more prudent to leave such decisions, especially when the on-field umpires don’t have a clear view of the incident, entirely up to the TV umpire?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/soft-signal-in-sharp-focus/article34104118.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Infinite power of surrender||Azhwars and acharyas never tire of being overwhelmed when they begin to contemplate the Lord’s boundless munificence towards all creation in general and towards those who have surrendered to Him as the only refuge in particular. All His incarnations that are for the purpose of protecting the good, destroying the evil and establishing dharma in the worlds only reflect His response to the wishes of His bhaktas. Moreover the power of surrender is seen to be infinite as it benefits not merely the one who surrenders, but includes all those near and dear to him as well, pointed out Dr. Sri Venkatesh in a discourse. How a bhakta becomes a helper to lead others to God is illustrated with examples from day to day life by Vedanta Desika in a verse in Nyasa Tilaka. One who is short of sight crosses the road with assistance from another; or one unable to walk is taken to the other side of the river when helped to get into a boat; or the rewards gained by one’s service to the king trickles to his son who has no direct contact with the king. In Draupadi’s case, Krishna protects her from further humiliation when she surrenders. But He does not stop with this. He sees to it that her vow that she would tie her tresses only after Duryodhana and Dushsaasana are punished is fulfilled. He also stands by the Pandavas, and but for His timely help they could not have survived the evil machinations of Duryodhana and Sakuni. In the Ramayana, when Bharata surrenders to Rama and asks Him to come back and rule Ayodhya, Rama holds this surrender in waiting and accepts it after fourteen years. But Rama also responds to Bharata by giving him something greater than Him, the Paduka. Above all, owing to Bharata’s saranagati, all the people of Ayodhya are granted moksha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/infinite-power-of-surrender/article34104111.ece

19 March 2021||Madrid,||Sevilla inches closer to Real||Youssef En Nesyri continued his impressive form as Sevilla beat Elche 2-0 on Wednesday to move within three points of Real Madrid in La Liga. En Nesyri scored his 15th league goal of the season just before the break before Franco Vazquez ensured the victory with a late effort. The visitors remain a point above the relegation zone following a fourth defeat in six games. The fixture was scheduled for September but postponed to give Sevilla a break after winning the previous season’s Europa League at the end of August. The two teams had met in Elche 11 days earlier and Sevilla’s Julen Lopetegui made five changes to the side that lost that game. Simone Zaza scored twice, including a dramatic late winner, as Torino came from two goals down to beat Sassuolo 3-2 on Wednesday and secure its first home Serie A victory of the season. Captain Andrea Belotti returned for the game, one of two postponed because of a coronavirus outbreak at the Turin club.  Domenico Berardi scored twice in the first half for eighth-placed Sassuolo, the Italian forward lashing home from Francesco Caputo’s knock-down on six minutes and adding a second just before the break. But Zaza came off the bench in the 72nd minute to inspire the struggling Torino. Torino move out of the relegation zone and into 17th position, with a game in hand. Sassuolo is 11 points off the European berths.  The results: LaLiga: Sevilla 2 (En Nesyri 43, Vazquez 89) bt Elche 0. Serie A: Torino 3 (Zaza 77, 90+2, Mandragora 87) bt Sassuolo 2 (Berardi 6, 38).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sevilla-inches-closer-to-real/article34104158.ece

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||All hail the florets||Let us put aside the health claims for a minute. Based on taste alone, cauliflower has been a constant favourite across cuisines, diets and fads for years, be it in a hearty musallam or as a trusty grill-side companion. So, when a section of social media recently discovered cauliflower waffles, the “outrage” jokes took us by surprise — the vegetable has always had myriad forms, after all. Why not explore a few of them? Let us start at home: Indian cuisine has accepted many foreign ingredients and dishes into its democratic embrace and used them to produce foods that are unique in flavour and technique. The cauliflower is one of a group of greens like carrot, beans and kohlrabi that were formerly referred to as ‘English vegetables’, as they had been introduced into India by the British. The Indian cauliflower is actually a cross between the Cornish and European species, more suitable for local commercial cultivation. “Today, we cannot imagine our meals without this vegetable, but cauliflower actually came into our country not via the Silk Road but through the British. So though the cauliflower has been around for a long time, it has been in India for just about 200 years,” says chef Ranveer Brar. The chef shares a recipe that elevates the cauliflower from a simple side-dish to the star of the table. Gobi musallam uses marination and roasting techniques more common to grilled meats, with an eye-catching and palate pleasing result.  Musallam refers to the north Indian method of using whole ingredients (usually chicken or leg-of-lamb), that are seasoned with special spices and basted in a gravy as they are roasted. In the case of gobi musallam , an entire cauliflower is blanched or steamed, filled with green chutney, doused liberally in a curry and then roasted in the oven until done. It has been a long-standing favourite in classic, old-school restaurants. But venues of the non-traditional variety, like cafes and bistros, have a different take on the vegetable. For instance, Chennai’s Chamiers Cafe has for years tried out different experiments — like cauliflower rice — before settling on its steadily popular cauliflower steak. Says founder Kiran Rao: “The dish ticks a lot of boxes: it is popular with the vegetarian crowd, the vegan crowd, the keto crowd and other diners, too.” The dish is not all that niche — most cities with an experimental dining crowd have a cafe or two that serves it — but it is still unheard-of enough to be interesting. Adds Rao, “We serve it with a side of grilled vegetables, just as we would a regular steak.” And then there is the host of dishes where cauliflower is used as batter, or as a substitute for flour. Cauliflower waffles, pancakes and even pizza crusts have been around for years, enjoying fleeting moments in and out of the spotlight as the world of diets shifts to the next big trend. Cauliflower pizza crust, for instance, is a popular recipe on online keto forums. Ankita Deka Bora, a professor of Social Work at Augsburg University who follows the keto diet, has used this recipe to convince the most cynical of her friends. It comes down to taste, she explains, “Pizza base with cauliflower has a nice, crunchy bite to it. If not told [in advance], a first-timer can be left guessing about the ingredient. Because it is cauliflower there is a notion that it might taste like steamed vegetables. In reality, it can be compared to roasted pita bread.” So when in doubt, go gobi .

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Let it grow, let it flow||Jack, the jackal, yawned and stretched. The sun was up. “Ugh! Summer again. Hot days and hot nights…” He rolled in the grass, did a couple of touch toes, turned his neck right and left, flexed his paws and set off at a brisk trot, singing as he went: “To the river, to the river,/I will go…/I will swim, I will float,/I will have you know/That water is…” Gogol, the gaur, peeked over a bush and said, “Bright and chirpy, are we?” “Come along, Gogol. Let’s go to the river for a dip and a swim. Look lively now.” Gogol smiled. He loved Jack’s energy. He ambled along behind him. Suddenly, Gogol heard a scream and rushed forward, his hooves slipping and sliding towards the banks. A nasty surprise “What’s the matter, Jack?” he asked. Humans had a nasty habit of setting traps and Gogol was worried Jack had his leg in one of them. “Look at this!” said Jack, pointing to the river. “Just take a look at this.” Gogol looked at the river and was surprised to find that it had shrunk to half its size … overnight! Monkey, also a regular morning visitor, swung by. “Oh my goodness! Whatever has happened to our river?” she exclaimed. “Darling, what worries you so early in the morning?” said Wolfie’s smooth, smarmy voice. Monkey shuddered and clambered back up the tree. By afternoon, the water in the river had reduced to a trickle. The animals stood on the banks and wondered what had happened. Just then, they heard Monkey’s lively call. She was approaching them at great speed, swinging from tree to tree and shouting. “You are not going to believe this. I went upstream to investigate. I was so sure that the humans had done something. Imagine my surprise when I saw a family of rat-like creatures…but with big heads, and sharp incisors, damming up our river.” “Rat-like?” sniggered Wolfie. “Darling, are you sure your eyes are fine?” Monkey ignored him and continued. “They were strange creatures. Their front feet are like hands and their back feet are webbed. When I confronted them and asked what they thought they were doing, they said this was necessary for their survival.” “What about our survival, darling?” drawled Wolfie. “You wouldn’t stand much of a chance if I had my way,” muttered Monkey. “Er…um…” said Gogol. “Monkey, I think you are talking about beavers. Yes, they do build dams with branches of trees, vegetation, rocks and mud. They live in shelters called lodges, to be safe from predators…” “We need to talk to them,” said Jack. So a deputation went to meet the beavers. There was a whole colony awaiting their arrival. Learn to share Gogol looked at the lovely pool the beavers had made for themselves. He saw several young beavers eagerly swimming laps, shouting and playing catch. “I know you cannot live without water. But, neither can we. All of us need it, and this is our only source. We must learn to share…” he said. On hearing this, the beavers huddled together and growled and moaned. Finally, the biggest one came forward and said, “We will dismantle our dam. But we have one condition: that you allow us to shift our lodges downstream. Looks like you guys have a good set-up there.” The deputation returned, satisfied. That night, the water in the river was restored. The animals gathered on the banks and cheered, as the river resumed its journey. Then they heard the noise. It seemed to be coming closer. There were distinctive barks, growls and grunts. The noise grew louder and louder. Amazed, the animals watched. As the moonlight gleamed on the water surface, the river seemed to come to life. It danced and jumped, shivered and shuddered. As it drew closer, Monkey shouted, “Oh goodness, the beavers are coming!” “How many?” asked Jack. “I counted 50 and then lost track…Looks like a big colony,” said Gogol. Whatever next? The animals went home, wondering if they had got the bad end of the bargain after all. The next morning, they woke up to yet another surprise. The banks of the river were overflowing. The eager beavers had been busy all night. They had built their dam and flooded the plain. Jack had had enough. He decided to give the beavers a talking to. “Listen, Beavers, all of us in this forest need the river. Water is an important part of our life…just like it is for you. We need to learn to share our resources.” “But it’s not all bad, guys,” said Gogol. “These beaver dams prevent erosion and raise the water table, so the water does get purified…” Monkey said, “But, we need water to drink, bathe, cook…whatever.” “Oh darling, do you cook?” said Wolfie. “I’d love to visit…”  “Look at this!” said Jack, pointing to the river. “Just take a look at this.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/let-it-grow-let-it-flow/article34105028.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||You have to believe!||Movie:Rango (2011) Genre:Animation, Comedy, Drama “You find DIRT, you find water!” That’s Rango’s story in a line. A pet anthropomorphic chameleon lands in an arid land when his owner’s car meets with an accident and bumps into a nine-banded armadillo named Roadkill who is on a quest to find the “Spirit of the West”. The chameleon escapes aerial predators and meets Beans, a desert iguana. Together they land up in a town named DIRT, which is populated by different anthropormorphic desert animals. The entire town is parched and brown and animals live every day with a hope that water will come back into their lives soon. As the mayor says, this belief has been keeping them alive. However, there lurks a mystery that’s about to get darker and deeper. Rango is given the Herculean task of finding water. The Mayor’s words — “You control water and you control everything” — forms the crux of this movie. A series of events, an army of animals, their rides and encounters with their enemies drive home the point about survival of the fittest. As Rango uncovers a web of lies, he is almost ready to give up. But it is Roadkill who shows him the reality he has been overlooking. Rango, then, decides to take charge and right the wrongs. His journey is full of twists and turns. Does he manage to find the water? Do the denizens of DIRT manage to quench their thirst? Heroic facts Characters who are never addressed by name: Roadkill the armadillo, Priscilla the desert mouse, and Balthazar the mole.  Rango is a nameless pet chameleon who lives in a terrarium. For long, he has thought of himself a hero, and every now and then he dons this hat in the movie. The voice-overs were recorded on a set, and not in a separate booth, with the actors voicing their characters while performing with their fellow cast members. This allowed the performers to follow the rhythms of their co-stars and gave room for improvisation. This was the first animated film by Nickelodeon Movies after Barnyard (2006).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/you-have-to-believe/article34105040.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||drop||It’s always wonderful to celebrate great things — birthdays, anniversaries, and more. Little wonder, then, that we celebrate World Water Day every year. The theme this year is short and simple: Valuing water. So, what can you do to help? Arun Krishnamurthy, founder of Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI), talks about small steps that each of us can take, with the help of adults, to conserve and value the elixir of life. Explore your neighbourhood Identify lakes/ponds/streams, and take photos. Locate these water bodies on Google maps, trace their source, flow, and extent, and document it, as this helps people understand the neighbourhood’s hydrology. Get creative Consider highlighting lakes, ponds, rivers and streams in your area through poetry, paintings, videos, blogs, vlogs, and podcasts. Audit Do a water audit at home and check leaky taps and wasteful use of water. Reduce such wastage and learn to reuse water. Keep an eye out Go on cycle tours of neighbourhood water bodies. Not only will you work on your fitness, but will also become watchdogs of our lakes, ponds, and rivers. Observe nature Go birding at water bodies to observe and understand not just the birds found there, but also other forms of life that live in water. Get together Apartment complexes and schools can start clubs with dedicated water warriors, who can initiate local voluntary clean-ups of neighbourhood water bodies Get quizzing Run a weekly online water quiz to sensitise more individuals. The research you will need to do will also add to your knowledge. Watch what you wear Avoid water-intensive clothing. Certain materials require more water and add to wastage. Wear weather-suitable clothes that consume less water to make and maintain. Share your water We have taken complete control over all natural resources. Remember, animals and plants need water too. So, share water with them and ensure their peaceful survival.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/drop/article34105052.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Brick by brick The past||The story so far: Neel and Mohit meet at an earthquake-affected village in Tamil Nadu, as part of a volunteer group. Neel feels he can do very little to help, but Mohit seems to have it all under control, moving about busily and taking “notes”.  “You have a reason for being a fake?” asked Neel. “I’m not a fake!” said Mohit, his grin disappearing. “I just have no choice but to pretend a bit, now and then. You see, my Dad is a famous architect and builder in Mumbai: Jayant Jaywant, mostly known as JJ. And one day, I’m expected to follow in his footsteps — so how can I let him know I want to be a graphic artist and write superhero comics instead?” Mohit sighed and sat down on a stone and put his head in his hands. “I’m sorry!” said Neel. “I shouldn’t have called you a fake. And you draw really well!” He thought for a moment, then added, “I’m also pretending that I’m socially motivated when actually I’m often trying to escape from the heavy work. I’m only here because of my Grandma.” Mohit looked up and grinned. His brief period of sadness seemed to have passed. “So you have parents AND grandparents who want you to do the right thing? That’s tough to live up to!” Neel nodded and sat down beside Mohit on the stone. Story unfolds “We’re from Australia,” he said. “My grandma Ann and I are from Perth and grandma’s pen friend Nisha is from Wellington, New Zealand. We were all to travel to India together for a holiday. When they heard about Project Rebuild Arramandal, they thought being involved would be a wonderful opportunity for Susan — that’s Nisha’s granddaughter — and me to see the land of our forefathers and also help those who are less privileged.” Mohit nodded. “I get that. I’m a bit confused, though; what’s a pen friend?” Neel explained, “Long ago, when my grandparents were young, they would make friends with someone from far away by exchanging letters — by post. Sometimes, you didn’t ever get to meet your pen friends, but you exchanged information and news about where you lived, what you liked to do, and a lot more.” Mohit nodded. “I’ve heard about snail mail and how people waited weeks for replies.” “They were pen friends from school. Both were Fijians of Indian origin but they only met after they were married and had children of their own. Imagine!” “I guess we’re lucky. I’ve already travelled abroad with my Mom and Dad…” said Mohit. “…and I am here! In the land of my great-great-grandfather! He too travelled far away from his home when he was just a few years older than me, but not willingly. Not according to what my Grandma told me.”  To be continued...   “...I’m a bit confused though; what’s a pen friend?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/brick-by-brick-the-past/article34104999.ece

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Anand lives on||Once in a while, there comes a film that crosses the celluloid divide and becomes a part of our lives. Released five decades ago, Anand’ s charm hasn’t diminished. It still makes you laugh and cry with its treatment of the transience of life. In theme, dialogue, music and characters, the Hrishikesh Mukherjee film continues to enrich in more ways than one. At war with himself for not being able to cure an impoverished society of disease, Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee (Amitabh Bachchan) tells the story of how the terminally ill Anand Sahai (Rajesh Khanna), who wanted to enjoy life as long as it lasted, changed his outlook. As the two come close, gradually it is the patient who starts curing the doctor (and through him the audience) with his prescription: zindagi badi honi chahiye, lambi nahin (Live a big life, not a long life). The incurable condition is just a metaphor here, as the film tries to unravel the riddle, ‘Zindagi kaisi hai paheli haye, kabhi ye hasaye, kabhi ye rulaye,’ without making a show of it. Even as the film portrays Anand’s joyousness, it grapples with questions of medical ethics and faith, questions that still haunt us. Over the years, Anand inspired many characters but Rajkumar Hirani's Munnabhai MBBS came the closest. Both were cut from the same cloth, with Dr. Banerjee growing up into the self-serving Dr. Asthana.  Anand came at a time when Rajesh Khanna was at the top of his game and his mannerisms had not lost their infectious charm. Bachchan, in his pre-Angry Man avatar, provides the counterpoint with a performance so subtle that it commands attention. The film is a window to the changing expressions in acting. Hrishikesh Mukherjee made middle-of-the-road cinema with the best of stars. Starting from Musafir, his first, which was backed by Dilip Kumar, Mukherjee went on to work with Raj Kapoor in Anari and Dev Anand in Asli Naqli . Anand was no different as stars used to come to him when they wanted to break away from the usual romantic routines. Having started his career as a sitarist on All India Radio, Mukherjee worked in the processing unit of B.N Sircar’s New Theatres and dabbled in cinematography before moving to editing and screenwriting, at the behest of his mentor Bimal Roy, who brought him to Bombay. Mukherjee always said that the editor should have an intimate knowledge of scriptwriting. Perhaps that’s why he was able to edit such diverse films as Manmohan Desai’s Coolie and Ramu Kariat’s Chemmeen. “I never used to overshoot. I made Anand in 28 days within 32 reels because I knew how much I needed,” he said in a television interview. Loosely inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s Ikiru , Mukherjee co-wrote Anand for Raj Kapoor in the early 1960s. At one point, he wanted to make it in Bengali with Uttam Kumar as the doctor. When it didn’t work, he thought of casting Kishore Kumar and Mehmood. It shows that he always wanted an actor who could lend a light touch to the heavy subject. There is a story that Kishore had asked his security guard not to allow a certain Bengali event manager to enter the house. The guard mistook Mukherjee as that man and chased him away. Anyway, the fact that Kishore is missing from the playback credits at a time when he had become the voice of Rajesh Khanna tells us that perhaps all was not well between the singer and director. Dedicated to Bombay, Anand  celebrates the city’s cosmopolitan culture. The Kulkaranis (Ramesh and Seema Deo) speak in Marathi and Renu (Sumita Sanya) slips in a bit of Bengali now and then. In ‘Kahin door jab din dhal jaye’, the Punjabi Anand holds a book of Urdu poetry in Persian script while Bhaskar Banerjee writes his diary in Hindi. There is a scene in the film where Anand quotes the national anthem to describe the unity in diversity that exists in the city. Gulzar and the largely unfeted Yogesh underlined the film’s essence through songs that continue to live on effortlessly. Narrated by Bachchan, Gulzar’s ‘Maut ek kavita’ provides words to the unsaid, while the effervescent ‘Maine tere liye hi saat rang ke sapne chune’ makes the audience believe in dreams. Interestingly, Yogesh wrote ‘Kahin door...’ and ‘Zindagi kaisi hai paheli’ for a Basu Bhattacharya film that was shelved. Hemant Kumar had already recorded ‘Kahin door...’ in Bengali, but Mukesh and Manna Dey again brought alive the melancholy of those words. As Anand might have said, good films and good music don’t die.

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The songs of Mylapore||Smitten by the majestic sway of Kapaleeswarar’s temple car and the beauty of the annual Panguni festival, Saint Thirugnanasambandar described it glowingly in his 7th century composition, ‘Poompavai Pathigam’. As he sang the song, Sivanesan Chettiyar’s daughter Poompavai is said to have come back to life from the ashes. This year, the scene will be enacted on the morning of March 26. Inspired by the joy and vibrancy of the 10-day Brahmotsavam, Tamil Tyagayya, Papanasam Sivan, composed songs on the festival. His ‘Kana Kann Kodi Vendum,’ in the magnificent Kamboji effectively portrays the Adhikara Nandi procession, an important event on the festival’s third day. ‘It requires countless eyes to behold the grandeur of the procession of Lord Siva’ is the Pallavi. Then he goes on to describe the deity’s divine face, the dazzling jewels sequenced with diamonds and rubies, and the aroma of fragrant flowers in the garlands. Sivan goes on to say that ‘the divine magnetism is such that the devotees wonder whether what they see is the twilight sky dotted with stars and the bright moon or are they in a lotus grove where his blemishless limbs shine as he showers his grace.’ Watching the Adhikara Nandi sevai, the composer describes the presence of Karpagambal, served by the goddesses Saraswati and Lakshmi followed by Muruga, Ganapati, Chandikeswara and the Siva Ganas. He also describes a devotee’s feelings of ardour. Papanasam Sivan was a long-time resident of Mylapore and his 60-odd compositions include ‘Kapali’ in Mohanam and ‘Engum Niraindhirukum’ in Kurinji, capturing the splendour of Mylapore or Mayilai as it is known. This year, the Adhikara Nandi procession will take place on March 21 and the chariot festival on March 25. The 63 saints During the Arubathu Moovar festival, the idols of the 63 Saivaite saints (Nayanmars) are taken out in procession in a remarkable replay of a living culture that attracts thousands of visitors each year. Last year, in what was possibly a first, the pandemic forced the festival to be conducted inside the temple without opening it up for worshippers. Expectations, therefore, run high this year, and Arubathu Moovar falls on March 26.  Mylapore turns festive during this time, with residents gearing up for the charged event. Hundreds of pavement shops spring up around the temple tank, selling toys, beads, trinkets and ceramics. D. Kaveri, temple executive officer, said a meeting had been convened to discuss crowd arrangements. “Food and water will be made available at several spots allotted by the Greater Chennai Corporation,” she said.  The Chennai-based author writes on music and heritage.

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The music, the musician||Let’s take a quick offhand count of the number of books that have been written on M.S. Subbulakshmi, the maestra of Carnatic music. MS – A Life In Music by TJS George, MS and Radha, A Saga of Steadfast Devotion by Gowri Ramnarayan, The Madras Music Quartet by Indira Menon, Lakshmi Vishwanathan’s Kunjamma – Ode to a Nightingale and Family Pride: MS Subbulakshmi , Lakshmi Devanath’s illustrated short biography, and Song of Surrender, A Centenary Tribute to MS Subbulakshmi by Savitha Narasimhan, Gowri Ramnarayan and V. Ramnarayan, are some. This is apart from books in regional languages: at least four books have been published in Kannada alone, besides a translation of TJS George’s book, in the last five years. The life and music of M.S. Subbulakshmi continues to capture the interest of several writers. Who she was, where she came from, and what she became forms the canvas of most books. If the journey of M.S.’s life is the journey of her music, the reverse is true as well. Of Gifted Voice: The Life and Art of M.S. Subbulakshmi by Keshav Desiraju (Harper Collins) — the latest book on the musician — tells her story yet again. It is neither the linear narration of Indira Menon nor is it the reinvigorating telling of George, who took advantage of his position as someone who strayed into music. Keshav Desiraju, a retired civil servant, educated at Harvard and Cambridge, lays out facts that you find in other books on the musician, but his quiet and responsible understanding of these facts builds a meaningful difference, especially in a world filled with noisy debates. It is all about author perspective and Desiraju does two interesting things: with extensive and meticulous research, he reconstructs the artistic richness of the times in which M.S. lived. The book abounds with hundreds of wonderful stories and anecdotes, some heard, some unheard. Introducing you to all the extraordinary women musicians and dancers who were contemporaries of his protagonist — in Hindustani and Carnatic worlds — Desiraju asks us, even as he explores, what made M.S. special, a national icon? The book layers her musical competence alongside the remarkable Rajam Pushpavanam and N.C. Vasantakokilam (“…the only two singers who had the potential to rival Subbulakshmi, and if the fates had been less wilful, to overtake her.”) K.B. Sundarambal (‘a superb musician with an enslaving, rapturous voice...”), Philomena Thamboochetty, D.K. Pattammal (“rare specimen of voice, fresh and untainted, pure and healthy”), Balasaraswati, Roshanara Begum, Mallika Pukhraj, and Gangubai Hangal, among others, who were in no way inferior to the musical prowess of M.S. but did not scale her heights. In bringing all these women into the narrative, Desiraju seems to ask how M.S. became the face of India. What made her the favourite of the masses? From Nehru to Mountbatten to Rajaji, she was feted by the political-cultural-social elite of India. What role did Sadashivam play in her life and what kind of choices did she make? The narrative probes these complex realms. Secondly, Desiraju presents the world’s perceptions of M.S. through a series of reviews, reports and opinions that were published at different periods of her life and career. A rasika compares her popularity with other musicians: “M.S. challenged them all for the attention and affection of music buffs... the joy of listening to M.S. was an experience in itself.” There are many statements like this, but there are also unhappy ones. For instance, when M.S. plunged into the Tamil Isai movement and presented a Tamil repertoire, or when she became the embodiment of bhakti and presented ‘devotional’ songs (‘shrill and high-pitched’ as one critic said) she also elicited unfavourable responses. One sensitive listener listening to an AIR concert in 1968 said: “From M.S. we seek music which soars aloft, not the kind of pieces carefully chosen by those who have lost the voices of their youth.” Apart from those that directly reacted to her music, there were also reports that commented thus, following a concert in Delhi, in 1947: “Oddly and sadly, the presence of politicians, businessmen and other socially prominent people, without any sense of musical appreciation, was a feature of M.S. concerts, to which Sadashivam was obsessively attached.” M.S., slowly and steadily, shut the doors on the world she came from. The world that she now entered watches her ‘refashioning’ keenly. The book, therefore, builds an objective narrative in which you have social details, people’s opinions as well as the author’s suggestions. Precious nuggets The disintegration of the Devadasi system, its impact on the artistes and their abundant cultural heritage, the new patronage, the eventual institutionalisation, the nationalist project, Gandhi... the book discusses all this at length. There are precious nuggets that have the potential to become full-fledged studies. Writing about Dhanammal’s superlative music, Desiraju cites an advertisement for her concert on July 16, 1933: “Men can get the best seats for a rupee but women only the second-best at half a rupee!” Ironically, this is for Dhanammal, who refused to conform to male standards of music. In an “extraordinary diatribe” titled, ‘Notes on music, women singers,’ C.R. Srinivasa Iyengar writes, “... a lady singing Pallavi recalls to me the picture of a dog trained to walk on hind legs — it is ungainly, uncouth, unseemly and uncalled for. Her native element is padams, keertanams or erotic pieces.” He later wrote a series of articles for The Hindu in 1925 against women singers titled ‘Music and Sex’. Desiraju says the content of most is “unprintable”. On the other side, the book is also a treasure trove of generous moments — there are recollections of how Omkarnath Thakur came to listen to M.S., how Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer said that none can sing the Melakarta Ragamalika like her. Though Palghat Mani Iyer, the great mridanga vidwan, never played in a public concert for M.S., he said in an 1978 interview that Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar and M.S. Subbulakshmi were the three artistes with outstanding voices who sang straight to the audience. It is also true that M.S. rarely chose to have a female accompanist — was it a choice made by M.S. herself? It is hard to tell. As Desiraju suggests, one may disagree with the choices the singer made, her music may not gain total approval of the connoisseur, but she truly was one of India’s finest artistes. Her dedication and commitment to art are unquestionable. Desiraju quotes historian Ramachandra Guha, who argued for the Bharat Ratna to be conferred on M.S. and Lata Mangeshkar: “We know them as M.S. and Lata, not out of easy familiarity, but because we love, cherish and honour them, because we cannot imagine life or India without them.” The life and times of M.S. are exciting: history takes control of her music and eventually she becomes her music. There will be more books, surely.  The book, meticulously and extensively researched, is a multi-pronged approach to the life and times of M.S. Subbulakshmi||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-music-the-musician/article34104575.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Scaling literary heights||In the small hours of the night, somewhere in the South Arcot region of Tamil Nadu, an aspiring 20-year-old writer heard Arokkyam’s wail and translated her lament into his debut novel, Koveru Kazhudhaigal ( Beasts of Burden , trans. Lakshmi Holmstrom). More than a quarter of a century later, with four novels and over 60 short stories under his belt, Imayam has won the Sahitya Akademi award. That two splendid writers from marginalised backgrounds have received this honour in successive years is heart-warming. When Koveru Kazhudhaigal was first published in 1994, the sailing was not smooth. The prevailing literary mood lionised experimental writing, metafiction, magic realism and the like. Realism was a bad word. An independent Dalit movement was gaining strength, and this novel struck a discordant note with its realistic depiction of a Christian family that provided laundry and other services for a Dalit ‘colony’, which was in turn exploited by the dominant caste in the ooru . Ergo, the novel was considered a betrayal, exposing the inner contradictions of depressed communities. That it was splendidly produced by an elite, niche publishing house only exacerbated the political incorrectness. When veteran writer Sundara Ramaswamy reviewed it in the first issue of the revived literary review, Kalachuvadu, he declared, “In artistically depicting in an uninhibited manner the full range of meanness created by human divisions, gathering the resulting sorrow and conveying it in writing, there is no Tamil work that equals this novel.” This uncharacteristically unqualified praise was dismissed as an overstatement by many. Imayam refused to be intimidated. In boldly rejecting the Dalit tag, he spurned the patronising advantages flowing from a guilty literary world. Imayam has kept to his commitment of writing of what he believes in. Few literary parallels Few readers will forget the exhilaration of a first reading of Koveru Kazhudhaigal . Twenty-seven years after reading it, Arokkyam’s lament still rings in my ears. The heart-rending portrayal of her and her family, as their traditional ties disintegrate and undermine an already precarious existence, and her refusal to be cowed down has few literary parallels. The narrative teems with proverbs, ballads, rants and rarely heard idiomatic phrases that brilliantly complement the dialogues written in the regional dialect. The richness, in fact, triggered a fear — was the young writer exhausting all his colours in his first work? Tamil has had its share of one-book wonders, but Imayam did not join that tribe, consistently producing notable works. In distilling experience into art, he has refused to compromise. With a keen ear to the linguistic richness of the spoken register, he lets characters emerge through conversation. As literary critic Aravindan points out, authorial interventions are rare in Imayam’s writings. In the description of context, in the thoughts that run through the mind of the characters, in the words they speak, the most complex situations take shape in the readers’ minds. For a writer who doesn’t wear politics on his sleeve, Imayam’s writings are intensely political. Pethavan ( The Begetter , trans. Gita Subramanian), his story of how a caste Hindu father handles his daughter’s decision to elope with her Dalit lover, should rank, along with Perumal Murugan’s Pookkuzhi ( The Pyre ), as the most disturbing Tamil literary text of the last decade. In anticipating the fate of Divya and Ilavarasan, Pethavan bears tragic testimony to the prophetic nature of great art. Imayam penetrates the mind of a caste Hindu constable as easily as he does the mind of a stigmatised old washerwoman. In ‘Police’, Seenivasan is forced by circumstance to be the pallbearer of a Dalit corpse. The torment he undergoes and the horror of its implications for his social prestige, which push him to quit his job, are captured brilliantly, laying bare the power of caste consciousness. ‘En Katha’, among the most discussed stories of the last few years, is a bold novelette of a young man’s forbidden love and passion for a young widow, the mother of two children. A more insightful depiction of the workings of a patriarchal mind in the face of a self-willed woman can scarcely be imagined. Among Tamil writers, Imayam is exceptional in having subjected himself to rigorous editing. What it has done to the spontaneity of his writing is for future critics to assess. But Imayam’s literary career cannot be divorced from his unbroken engagement of three decades with S. Ramakrishnan, publisher and editor of Cre-A. With the recent passing away of Ramakrishnan, we need to see what trajectory Imayam’s writing will take in coming years. I have always wondered why V. Annamalai took on the nom de plume of Imayam. Perhaps it reveals his desire to scale one literary peak after another. If yes, he won’t be disappointed.  The author is a historian and Tamil writer.   With a keen ear to the linguistic richness of the spoken register, Imayam lets characters emerge through conversation||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/scaling-literary-heights/article34104597.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Listen between the lines||The smell of soil and the fragrance of vines emanate from the earthy lyrics. They speak of ancient legacies and happy coexistence. ‘Nallapadi vaazhacholli indha manna koduthane poorvakudi…’ (our ancestors bequeathed us this land with their blessings) ‘Nayi nari poonaikundhan indha erikkolam kooda sondhammadi…’ (The dog, the fox, the cat they too own these lakes and ponds). Within its vibrant frames and lyrics, ‘Enjoy Enjaami’ packs in a lot — the timeless attachment to land, environment issues, the pain of the landless labourers and the love of nature. And that gives this seemingly easy earworm of a song both its depth and its rich character. “To me the lyrics are a personal tribute to two very important people in my life — Valliamma my grandmother, whose history is all about labour and exploitation; and Mukil Paranthaman, a scholar who collected folk songs all his life,” says Arivu, 27, basking in the phenomenal success of ‘Enjoy Enjaami’, which has garnered more than three million views in little more than a week of its release. First from Maajja Arivu has written the lyrics, performed in it, including doing an Oppari bit, along with singer Dhee of ‘Rowdy baby’ fame. ‘Enjoy Enjaami’ is the first album from Maajja, the record label founded by A.R. Rahman to support independent artistes and provide them an international platform. “I was at home in Arakkonam during the lockdown, when Maajja contacted me,” says Arivu. “They have plans to platform 30 artistes across the world. Dhee and I feature in the list.” It took over 200 people and three months to produce ‘Enjoy Enjaami’. “Honestly, we didn’t expect this kind of response,” says Arivu. Santhosh Narayanan has produced the album, and his expert arrangement shows. It was Dhee who approached Arivu to write the lyrics. “We’ve known each other for three years and had been talking about collaborating. When this came up, we thought it was the right opportunity,” he says. More important, however, is that Arivu was able to express his grandmother’s struggles in the song. “Our family went to Sri Lanka 200 years ago to work as labourers in the tea estates. They returned to India 60 years ago, after the Sirima-Shastri Pact. [When thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils were repatriated to India.] My grandmother couldn’t even take leave of her sisters. To this day, we don’t know if they are alive.” Valliamma, who features in the song’s lyrics and visuals, took up odd jobs in Tamil Nadu, as railway construction labourer and domestic worker while her husband did menial jobs. The couple ensured that their daughter was educated. “My mother became a teacher, because of which I could become an artiste. I owe it to her,” says Arivu. Sharing the history Arivu’s family has constantly discouraged him from sharing their oppressive history. “Our history is not about valour or pride. But recently, I decided I should begin sharing it; our history wrought with exploitation and labour. How my grandparents toiled on land they could never have owned. I wanted to include bits of that history.” The song has lines that go: ‘Valliyamma perandi sangathiya koorandi (Valliyamma’s grandson is here to tell you something). And ‘Thottam sezhithalum en thonda nanaiyalaye’ (My garden flourishes but my throat stays dry). Arivu has a deep connect with Oppari. “I believe Oppari is my root,” he says. The ‘ Anju maram valarthen’ bit is from Mukil Paranthaman’s collection. Popularly called Paavalar Mukil and associated with Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers and Artists Association, the late Paranthaman travelled from village to village collecting folk songs and publishing them as books. “This is my tribute to him,” says Arivu. “I have an important task ahead: to speak about land, about migration. I have written a song for a documentary titled Soru (Food) for Poovulagin Nanbargal. It’s called ‘Enga nilam enga’ (Where is our land?) And for Vellai Yaanai (upcoming Tamil film by Subramaniam Siva), I’ve written a song titled ‘Vaazha vachone’ about a farmer forced to migrate. I am haunted by labour on land people can’t own, by their constant forced migrations.” Arivu’s work with director Manikandan for the film Kadaisi Vivasayi (The Last Farmer) was important for him. “Manikandan spoke of an ancient society which lived in consonance with nature. I am deeply affected and hurt by caste violence today, but to know that we have lived differently at some point of time in history is a comforting thought. Sometimes our response need not be anger; it could just be the discovery of our roots and the realisation about how beautiful it has been.”  The writer is a Chennai-based independent journalist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/listen-between-the-lines/article34104571.ece
19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The fort singer||In 2018, a heritage walk saw me leading three friends on a warm winter morning to the majestic Jaisalmer Fort. From behind the imposing sandstone walls of the Sonar Qila came the haunting sound of the kamaicha (one of the oldest bowed instruments in the world). We followed the sound, made our way through the winding path, and came across an old man with red turban, hollowed face, high cheekbones and penetrating eyes. He greeted us with a broad, toothless smile and spoke in English. “I am Deepu Khan Mirasi Manganiyar, but locally I am called Dapu,” he said. “The Manganiyars and the Langas are itinerant folk singers of the desert, both here and in Sindh. I have travelled the desert, but for the past two decades I have been performing at the fort. I can sing songs of birth, marriage, love, and death in various raags.” Dapu Khan, who passed away recently, was an exponent of the kamaicha, the soul of the desert, which featured in the postal stamp series on musical instruments released in September 2020. Says Gazi Khan Manganiyar, an accomplished folk performer, “Dapu ji belonged to village Khinkali in Jaisalmer. Having studied up to class eight, he was one of the earliest Manganiyars who could speak English. He began performing at famous heritage sites in the city to earn a living from the tourists. He could be spotted sitting on the steps of the Gadisar Lake, in the courtyard opposite Patwa Haveli, and in Jaisalmer Fort. His fame grew when the NGO, Anahad Foundation, recorded his music. “Dapu ji sang our popular love song ‘Moomal - Mahendra,” says Gazi. The foundation has recorded the music of several desert singers and folk musicians. Like several desert musicians, Dapu Khan succeeded in recreating old songs while keeping their inherent raw musical appeal and structure intact. For instance, he brought innovations in the rendition of Moomal. “The original composition is sung in the six-beat cycle (Dadra taal) in slow tempo; Dapu ji sang in the eight-beat cycle (Keharva) in fast tempo, making the presentation livelier and more appealing. While many singers began using the harmonium for performances, Dapu ji continued to use the kamaicha,” says Gazi. Dapu Khan belongs to an era in the 70s and 80s when the lives of folk artistes began changing as they left the desert to come to the urban stage. “Later, these musicians became popular at events organised for tourists. Hotels also began recruiting them for curated cultural evenings,” says Shubha Chaudhuri, associate director general at the Archives and Research Centre (American Institute for Indian Studies). It was at this time that manganiyars such as Chugge Khan, Saker Khan, Pepe Khan, Lune and Akbar got together to promote their music. “Much of the credit goes to folk music activist and scholar Komal Kothari,” says Gazi. “He worked relentlessly to raise our presence internationally.” With tourists recording and uploading Dapu Khan’s singing and playing of the kamaicha on YouTube, the desert singer now reigns online too, with more than 10 million followers on social media and guaranteed an evergreen afterlife.

19 March 2021||March 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The grand old man of Kathakali||Chemancheri Kunhiraman Nair used to be overwhelmed whenever he recalled his first train journey. A journey he made alone as a teenager and which led him into the world of Kathakali, the art form that remained his passion till his death last week at the age of 105. Cheliya, in Malabar region, had no association with Kathakali a century ago, when young Kunhiraman spent his days watching the rehearsals of musical plays. His deep interest led the 14-year-old to join the troupe that was then working on a Purana-themed production. It was then that one of the experts setting up the stage asked the boy if he would like to learn Kathakali. “We had only heard the name. None of us had seen it,” Nair writes in his 2012 memoir. Nonetheless, the idea fascinated him. Though his uncles opposed the idea, his elder sister was supportive and Kunhiraman boarded a train from Koyilandy after a four-mile walk from home. He got down at Thikkodi. The next day, he reached Meppayyur, where he met his guru Karunakara Menon, who was more a guardian than a teacher to the young Kunhiraman, who had lost his mother when he was a toddler and, in his teens, his father. The monsoon regimen at Radhakrishna Kathakali Yogam was particularly tough, but within a year, Kunhiraman had made his stage debut. His 1931 performance as Panchali in Kiratam won appreciation from the gathering at Kuniyil Bhagavati temple.  Karunakara Menon came from Tholanur in Palakkad . He was a young dancer when his father and tutor Echara Menon was invited to the kingdom of Kozhikode to head a Kathakali school founded by an army chief of the Zamorin. This resulted in the northward spread of the Kalladikodan style of the art form. Distinct style Historians cite the first half of the 18th century as the period when the Kalladikodan style flourished under the legendary Vellattu Chathu Panikkar. “Kunhiraman Nair turned out to be its last practitioner,” notes scholar Sudheesh Namboodiri. “His method revelled in a quick flow of emotions. It looked as if the eyes drew the bhava from the hand gestures.” This distinction could also be a sign of eclecticism: Nair also learned from Malabar’s Kathakali maestros Ambu Panikkar, Kadathanad Ramunni Nair and Mattasseri Kochugovindan Nair. Besides, Kunhiraman Nair engaged with art forms such as Bharatanatyam that demanded felicity of movement. Encouraged by the Gandhian, Kaumudi teacher, he learnt Bharatanatyam from Salem Rajaratinam Pillai and Madras Balachandra Saraswathi. He collaborated with choreographer Guru Gopinath (1908-87) to develop the nascent Kerala Natanam. He was even part of a circus troupe, presenting shows across the Deccan for two years. Kunhiraman’s enthusiasm enriched north Kerala’s cultural profile. In 1945, he set up a dance institution in Kannur and, two years later, in Thalassery. The 1974-founded Pookkad Kalalayam in Chemancheri was again a milestone in his artistic journey. For the past 38 years, he ran a reputed Kathakali Vidyalayam at Cheliya. These creative pursuits kept Kunhiraman going after the untimely death of his wife and elder child. “Even as a centenarian, he continued to impress as Krishna, a role he played to perfection by portraying both the charisma and divinity,” says renowned chenda percussionist Mattannur Sankarankutty. Veteran dancer-scholar Padma Subrahmanyam recalls how Kunhiraman Nair’s eyes appealed to her in one of the photographs in his autobiography, Jeevitha Rasangal, in Malayalam. “A friend of mine read it out for me. I later met him when he was 99!” Padma Subrahmanyam’s disciple and film actor, Vineeth Radhakrishnan, also trained under Kunhiraman Nair. “He led a disciplined life that reflected in his art,” says Vineeth. Besides Krishna, the maestro loved to perform the role of Kuchela. And like Krishna’s impoverished friend, for Kunhiraman Nair too, material gains did not matter. “If not a Kathakali dancer, I would’ve been a farmer,” he once said.

19 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||No. of daily vaccinations to be increased threefold, says Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the government plans to increase the number of vaccinations in the city from 30,000-40,000 per day to 1.25 lakh per day in the next few days. For this, the vaccination centres will be doubled to 1,000 and the timings will be increased from the current 9 a.m.-5 p.m. to 9 a.m.-9 p.m, he added. Rasing concern over the increasing number of cases in the recent past here, Mr. Kejriwal said there was no need to panic as the government was strengthening its tracking, tracing, and isolating system. He added that due to the dwindling number of cases, there was laxity in people’s attitude towards COVID-19 protocols and strict surveillance and enforcement drives will be implemented to ensure people wear masks and maintaining social distancing. Mr. Kejriwal appealed to the Centre to provide relaxation in the COVID-19 vaccination guidelines and allow all above 18 years of age to get the jab. “If the Centre allows vaccination for all and if Delhi gets sufficient supply of the vaccine, the government has a plan in place to administer them to the entire population of the Capital in the next three months, Mr. Kejriwal said. He assured people that this surge is not similar to the one which happened last year in June, September, and November. “The situation is being monitored closely. Our health experts are being consulted regularly. We are also holding regular consultations with the health experts of the Central government. We are following all the measures advised by the experts,” he added. Giving his own example of having taken the vaccine, Mr. Kejriwal told those eligible not to be hesitant as it is the only effective method against the virus. He, however, pointed out that the current guidelines are very rigid. “On one hand, India has taken a lead in making a vaccine for the virus but unfortunately, on the other hand, we are observing a rise in cases across the country. I would appeal to the Central government to bring some relaxation in the vaccination guidelines in terms of eligible age groups,” Mr. Kejriwal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/no-of-daily-vaccinations-to-be-increased-threefold-says-kejriwal/article34104322.ece
19 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Too early to say if it can be called another wave’||Regarding the current rise in virus cases, experts said it is too early to say if it can be called another wave of COVID-19 in the city. They cited two main reasons behind the rise — people not following social distancing and not wearing masks. Delhi government officials said they have not found too many clusters of cases. “The cases are scattered. There are cases where multiple people from the same house test positive but not large clusters outside it,” said an official. “The current surge in cases is not just seen in Delhi, but across the country. There are mutations to the virus and people who were not infected before are getting infected. There are no large-scale reports of reinfection, which shows that the mutated virus is not infecting people who already had the disease,” said Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department of Safdarjung Hospital. But Dr. Kishore also said: “We do not exactly know whether the mutated virus will cause reinfection. Also, studies have shown that the antibodies vanish in many cases after six months and sufficient memory T cells are not there to protect from a fresh attack of the virus.” He said not following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour is leading to the virus spreading again. “In the past one year, people did not make the behaviour a part of their lives. If they do not stick to social distancing and wearing of masks, Delhi can very well have a Maharashtra-like situation,” he added. K. Srinath Reddy, epidemiologist, and president of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Delhi, also said people going back to their pre-COVID-19 behaviour is the main reason for the spike in cases. “By January, cases were down and people got a feeling that we have attained some ‘protection’ from the virus and we were free from the major threat. This has led to not following social distancing and wearing of masks,” Dr. Reddy said, adding that indoor crowds have increased and it is more dangerous than the outdoor ones, which keep moving.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/too-early-to-say-if-it-can-be-called-another-wave/article34104324.ece
