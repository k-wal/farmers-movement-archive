The vaccine demonstrated high clinical efficacy and significant immunogenicity against variants, the company’s CMD, Krishna Ella, said.  25,800 participants A statement from Bharat Biotech, which developed the vaccine in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said 25,800 participants between ages 18 and 98 were enrolled for the phase 3 study. It included 2,433 over the age of 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities. The first results from phase 3, called the primary endpoint, are based on the first occurrence of Polymerase Chain Reaction-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second vaccine dose. The interim analysis is based on 43 cases, of which 36 COVID-19 cases were observed in the placebo group and seven in the Covaxin group, a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 80.6%. The interim analysis showed that severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events were at low levels and balanced between vaccine and placebo groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covaxin-efficacy-is-81-works-against-variants/article33984576.ece
04 March 2021||CHENNAI,||Sasikala announces decision to withdraw from politics||V.K.Sasikala, aide of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and former interim general secretary of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), on Wednesday announced her decision to step aside from politics. In a two-page statement, she did not give any reason for her decision. But she called upon “true followers” of Jayalalithaa to “remain united, act wisely and work hard” during the Assembly election so that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, “our common enemy and evil force, as identified by Amma [Jayalalithaa], does not return to power and the golden rule of Amma is established in Tamil Nadu”. ‘Never keen on power’ Thanking all those who had shown “affection and concern” towards her, Ms. Sasikala claimed she was “never keen on occupying any office or position of authority. I will ever remain indebted to Puratchi Thalaivi’s [Jayalalithaa’s] affectionate followers and people of Tamil Nadu”. She added that she would “continue to pray [to] Puratchi Thalaivi and god for the establishment of the golden reign of Amma”. Sasikala’s decision comes against the backdrop of the reported suggestion of the BJP to the AIADMK to take the AMMK on board its alliance. The issue was reportedly discussed during Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s recent late-night meeting with the AIADMK’s top leaders – Edappadi K. Palaniswami and O. Panneerselvam. However, a section of the AIADMK was reluctant to take the proposal forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sasikala-announces-decision-to-withdraw-from-politics/article33984578.ece
04 March 2021||Mumbai,||Don’t teach us Hindutva, Uddhav tells BJP||From distancing itself from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) brand of Hindutva to questioning the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) contribution in freedom struggle and from slamming the Centre over asking citizens to bang empty plates to criticising it over the treatment meted out to protesting farmers, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray launched a sharp attack on the Opposition in the Assembly on Wednesday. “There is a clear difference between you (BJP) and us. You asked people to bang empty plates. We, through Shiv Bhojan scheme ensured that the poor get a plate full of meal. That’s the difference between us,” said Mr. Thackeray during his reply to a discussion on the motion of thanks to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s address on the opening day of the Budget session. Mr. Thackeray said the BJP has no right to teach others about Hindutva. “Where was your Hindutva when you shared power with separatists in Jammu & Kashmir? Where was your Hindutva when you allied with Nitish Kumar who wanted to make India free of RSS? When nobody came forward to take credit for Babri demolition, Balasaheb Thackeray came forward. We were Hindus when you broke alliance with us in 2014, we are today and we will remain so tomorrow. BJP shouldn’t teach us Hindutva. They are not eligible to do so,” he said. Taking on the BJP over the ongoing farmers’ struggle against three farm laws, Mr. Thackeray said the Centre is putting nails in their path, when ideally it should have been on the China border. “Who are you to stop farmers from marching to Delhi? Are those farmers anti-nationals for merely asking questions? Is this country your private property? Sena wasn’t part of freedom struggle, but your parent organisation (RSS) too did never take part in it,” he said. Commenting on the rising COVID-19 cases in the State, Mr. Thackeray said he has no intention to reimpose lockdown. “I don’t care if you ridicule me. But why make fun of the State’s campaign against coronavirus? I urge all of you to follow health norms irrespective of whether or not you get the vaccine,” he said. Replying to the Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’ questions on closing down his pet Jalyukta Shivar project, Mr. Thackeray said the government acted after the CAG report highlighted problems. “You believe a report which point out deficiencies in State government’s health campaign against coronavirus, but refuse to trust CAG report. Should we close down CAG?” he asked. Mr. Thackeray also appealed to the BJP to not play spoilsport in the Mumbai Metro project. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has shifted the Metro car shed from Aarey forest to Kanjurmarg as the “Aarey space will not be enough considering growing population and needs of the population. The new location identified by us will cater to the needs of Metro line which will be extended till Badlapur.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dont-teach-us-hindutva-uddhav-tells-bjp/article33985267.ece
04 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||OTS extended till financial year-end||Government has issued orders on Wednesday, ‘extending’ the One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme for property tax defaulters up to the financial year-end. The scheme, valid up to March 31, is applicable to all urban local bodies in the State, including GHMC, the orders issued by the Municipal Administration and Urban Development said. As per the scheme, if the property tax dues accumulated up to 2019-20 are cleared at one go, the defaulters will be given a waiver of 90% on the accumulated interest amount. They, however, will have to shell out the whole principal amount along with 10% interest. The OTS scheme was first announced from August 1 last year, in order to make up for the losses suffered due to COVID-19 outbreak. Though initially offered with a deadline of September 15, due to lack of response, the scheme was later extended up to October 31. However, the scheme evoked lukewarm enthusiasm from assessees, owing to various reasons, predominant among them being the absence of liquid money with people owing to loss of businesses, and economic hardships. Further, the Revenue staff were held up in work related to Dharani portal, and were not involved in implementation of the scheme, due to which the collections were far short of expectations, officials claim. As per the GHMC’s latest revised estimates, the property tax arrears up to the year 2019-20 amounted close to Rs. 1,600 crore, of which about Rs. 1,245 crore is yet to be collected. Together with the 10% interest component, the amount stands close to Rs. 1,370 crore, and together with the current year’s assessment of Rs. 345 crore, and the interest thereof, GHMC is aiming to garner close to Rs. 1,800 crore revenue through property tax this year. Khairatabad accounts for maximum amount of property tax dues at Rs. 545 crore, followed by Secunderabad at close to Rs. 190 crore, as per records.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ots-for-property-tax-defaulters-extended-till-financial-year-end/article33985203.ece
04 March 2021||Chennai,||Seat-sharing in AIADMK, DMK camps not yet done||There was no progress in seat-sharing negotiations in the alliances led by the ruling AIADMK and the Opposition DMK in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. While the signing of seat-sharing agreements between the AIADMK and its allies, which was expected to take place on Wednesday, got deferred by at least a few days, the DMK’s allies were unhappy with the offer of fewer seats. The Congress made it clear that the ball was in the Dravidian party’s court. Though the AIADMK was not willing to commit itself to any specific date, a senior BJP leader expressed confidence that the deal would be inked “shortly”. The AIADMK’s original expectation was that once a pact with the BJP is sealed, it would push the momentum for getting agreements signed with the others. The ruling party in the State and the national party did not arrive at an understanding, leading to the deadlock. Among the factors cited for the delay was the reported insistence of the BJP on certain constituencies, which irked the AIADMK. The BJP’s wish list included Mylapore, Alandur, Palladam, Kinathukadavu, Coimbatore (South), Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni and Rajapalayam. Though the AIADMK knew it had to sacrifice some seats regarded as its strongholds, it appears to have been surprised by the attitude of the BJP. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam held talks with senior party colleagues during the day, but no solution was in sight. Actor Vijayakant’s DMDK added to the confusion, with second-line leader L.K. Sudhish claiming that only the AIADMK was pleading for an alliance with his party. The AIADMK had offered the DMDK 15 seats, but the latter insisted on 20. In the evening, the two parties were supposed to have one more round of discussions, but they didn’t take place. A TMC(M) delegation met Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani and his colleague, P. Thangamani, in the morning. It wanted 12 seats, whereas the AIADMK was willing to spare only three.  DMK camp Not satisfied with the DMK’s offer of 18 seats, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said the ball was in the DMK’s court. Leaders of another ally, the VCK, who were supposed to participate in talks, did not turn up at Anna Arivalayam, the DMK headquarters. “We are in touch with the DMK leadership. They have conveyed that they would enhance the offer from four to six seats,” a VCK source said. The DMK may make a similar offer to the two Left parties. CPI(M) sources said the next round of talks would take place only after an invitation from the DMK. In the meantime, CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan said there was no truth to reports that the seat-sharing talks were on the verge of collapse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/seat-sharing-in-aiadmk-dmk-camps-not-yet-done/article33984592.ece

The action, according to an agency official, was part of a tax evasion probe against Phantom Films launched by Mr. Kashyap but dissolved in 2018. Mr. Bahl and Mr. Mantena were the co-promoters of Phantom Films. The NCP said the raids were an attempt to suppress voices of dissent against the Central government. “Central agencies are being used to take action against those who take an anti-government stand , be it ED (Enforcement Directorate), CBI or the I-T (Income-Tax) Department.

Maharashtra Congress president and MLA Nana Patole, too, criticised the Centre for selectively targeting celebrities. “We have seen in many instances that those who speak against the government are subjected to action by Central agencies. The government thinks that such tactics will scare people.

A Bench, led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, said there was nothing in Dr. Abdullah’s statement “which we find so offensive as to give a cause of action for a court to initiate proceedings”, trashing the plea as a “clear case of publicity interest litigation” by petitioners who want to get their names in the press. The Bench dismissed the case levying costs on the petitioners to the tune of Rs. 50,000 to be deposited with the Supreme Court Advocates Welfare Fund in four weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/voicing-dissent-against-govt-is-not-sedition-sc/article33984574.ece

04 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka Minister quits over harassment case||Karnataka Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi on Wednesday resigned from the State Cabinet following allegations of sexual harassment against him. His resignation came after protests and criticism by opposition parties and several sections of society, causing a huge embarrassment to the government and the ruling BJP. In his resignation letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa just ahead of the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Jarkiholi claimed he was innocent. “The allegations against me are far from the truth. It has to be investigated at the earliest. Though I’m confident about my innocence, taking moral responsibility, I’m resigning from my position as the Cabinet Minister. I request you to accept it,” he said. Social activist Dinesh Kallahalli had on Tuesday lodged a police complaint against Mr. Jarkiholi alleging he had sexually harassed a ‘job aspirant’ and threatened the woman and her family with dire consequences. Dubbing it a ‘sex for job’ scandal, purported clips showing Mr. Jarkiholi getting intimate with an unidentified woman was widely aired by Kannada news channels. According to sources, Mr. Jarkiholi tendered his resignation on the directions from the party high command. BJP national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh and party national general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santosh reportedly held discussions on the charges and communicated the party’s decision to the State leadership, keeping in mind the Assembly polls in five States and also bypolls and panchayat elections in Karnataka. Mr. Yediyurappa then called party MLA from Arabhavi, Balachandra Jarkiholi, who is Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi’s brother, and informed him of the decision.  Reacting to the charges, Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi on Tuesday night said the videos were “100% fake.” He had also sought a probe, while asserting that he would quit as Minister and also from politics if proven wrong. In the morning, Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi had said after meeting the Chief Minister that there was no need for Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi to resign if he had not done anything wrong and a thorough probe had to be done, either by the CBI or CID, to find out the truth behind the allegation and the CD, also those behind it. Terming it an attempt to defame the family as they had made it big in politics, Balachandra also threatened to file a Rs. 100 crore defamation suit against those who released the “fake CD”. According to sources, Mr. Yediyurappa reportedly assured Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi that he would be inducted into the Cabinet again if he was cleared of the charges levelled against him. There were also reports that he was promised that Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi would be inducted in his place. However, clarifying that there were no conditions put before the resignation was tendered, Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi said the Chief Minister sent the resignation to the Governor, a probe would take place and Ramesh would come out innocent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-minister-quits-over-harassment-case/article33984502.ece
04 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka Minister quits over harassment case||Karnataka Minister and BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi resigned from the Cabinet on Wednesday, within 24 hours of facing allegations of seeking sexual favours from a woman in return for a government job. He held the Major and Medium Irrigation portfolio. Mr. Jarkiholi sent his resignation letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in which he said he was relinquishing the post to save the BJP from embarrassment, though the allegations were “far from true”. He sought a speedy investigation into the case. The resignation was accepted by Governor Vajubhai R. Vala later in the day. Damage-control mode It is learnt that Mr. Jarkiholi had to quit following a nudge from the BJP high command, whose direction the Chief Minister had sought. BJP central leaders were of the view that he should immediately resign as a damage-control exercise, ahead of the budget session that starts on Thursday. Karnataka is also set to face bypolls for a Lok Sabha seat in Belagavi (Mr. Jarkiholi’s home district) and three Assembly segments in north Karnataka. Meanwhile, a CD submitted to the Cubbon Park police, allegedly containing recordings of Mr. Jarkiholi’s private moments with the woman, is under investigation. The alleged victim is yet to make a statement to the police. While Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai promised a transparent inquiry into the allegations, Opposition leaders continued to express outrage over the developments. Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said Mr. Jarkiholi had not only defamed himself and the party but also the people of Karnataka.  Earlier, Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi’s brother and BJP leader Balachandra Jarkiholi met the Chief Minister and sought a CBI probe. Leaders close to Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi claim that he has been assured of reinduction if the charges are proved false. The day saw protests by his supporters at Gokak in Belagavi alleging political conspiracy to dislodge him. Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi had led a team of 17 MLAs from the Opposition parties who switched to the BJP from the Congress, resulting in the fall of the Congress–JD(S) coalition government and formation of the BJP government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cd-scandal-ramesh-jarkiholi-resigns-from-cabinet-post/article33984704.ece
04 March 2021||New Delhi,||Field trials for Census-NPR to begin soon||The Registrar-General of India (RGI) is preparing to conduct field trials of the first phase of the Census and the National Population Register (NPR) using a mobile application in all the States and Union Territories, a senior government official told The Hindu . The first phase involving house listing and housing census, along with updating the NPR, was scheduled from April 1 last year, but was postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic. It is unlikely that the exercise will be conducted this year as the vaccination drive is still at an early stage. However, the officials are planning to conduct pre-tests or field trials through the app in one block each of every district, which is expected to cover 50 to 60 households. The app will contain questionnaires on house listing and housing census and the NPR, the official said. “The dates for conducting the Census exercise have not been finalised yet. But the enumerators will have to be trained in using the app. Many enumerators are young schoolteachers who are expected to use the app instead of the paper schedule [form]. There will be incentives for the electronic form,” the official said. The second phase of the Census is population enumeration. The RGI, on January 9, 2020, notified the 31 columns for which the enumerators will seek response for the house listing and housing census. The questions include whether the respondent has access to LPG or piped natural gas connection; owns a radio, transistor, television, laptop, computer, telephone, mobile phone or smartphone; and has access to the Internet. The questions for the NPR have not been made public yet, but the pre-test conducted in 2019 included additional questions such as the date and place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence and mother tongue, Aadhaar (optional), voter ID card, mobile phone and driving licence numbers. The Opposition-ruled States have expressed apprehensions over the additional questions. Electronic database In 2010 and 2015, the NPR collected details on 14 parameters only. It already has an electronic database of more than 119 crore residents. “The app will have the NPR schedule also. Before it is rolled out, the app has to be tested for glitches, and field trials are to be conducted,” the official said. On February 9, Vivek Joshi, RGI and Census Commissioner of India, chaired a virtual meeting of the Directors of Census Operations of all States to review the preparations for the coming Census where the field trials using the app were discussed. The Director of Census Operations of one of the States who attended the meeting told The Hindu , “The app has been improvised after the 2019 trials, and the field trials will be held afresh. We are awaiting directions from the RGI.” On February 10, Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai informed the Rajya Sabha that “an app for the collection of data and a Census portal for the management and monitoring of various Census-related activities has been developed”. “Instruction manuals for enumerators and other Census functionaries have been prepared. A pre-test of the Census was undertaken from August 12, 2019 to September 30, 2019 in selected areas of all the States and Unions Territories to test the Census questionnaire and methodology,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/field-trials-for-census-npr-to-begin-soon/article33984530.ece
04 March 2021||New Delhi,||Vaccine can be taken 24/7, says Centre||Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday reiterated that the government had done away with the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. timeline for giving COVID-19 vaccination and that beneficiaries can take the vaccine round the clock. “The move is aimed at increasing the pace of the vaccination,” the Minister said in his tweet. He further said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi valued the health as well as the time of the citizens of the country. “The government has lifted the time restriction to increase the speed of vaccination. People can now get vaccinated 24x7 according to their convenience. Prime Minister Narendra Modi understands the value of health as well as the time of citizens,” Dr. Vardhan tweeted in Hindi. At a press conference on Tuesday, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan announced that the timeline of vaccinating beneficiaries from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. had been done away with, and it was up to the hospitals to decide whether they wanted to continue administering vaccines even after that. “CoWIN 2.0 allows flexibility of time and if a hospital has the capacity, the system permits it to do vaccination even after 5 p.m. in consultation with the State government. This has been briefed both to the State governments as well as the private and government hospitals,” he said. The second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination commenced on March 1 for people over 60 years, and those aged 45 years and above with specified comorbid conditions. The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 and vaccination of frontline workers started on February 2. The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed 1.63 crore on Wednesday, say the provisional report till 7 p.m. on Wednesday. Numbers so far “These include 67,75,619 Health Care Workers (HCW) who have taken the 1st dose and 28,24,311 HCWs who have taken the 2nd dose, 57,62,131 frontline workers (1st dose), 3,277 FLWs (2nd dose), 8,44,884 beneficiaries more than 60 years old and 1,04,263 beneficiaries aged 45 and above with specific co-morbidities,” said a release issued by the Ministry. The release said that total 6,92,889 vaccine doses were given till 7 p.m. on March 3, the 47th day of nationwide COVID-19 vaccination. Out of this, 5,79,366 beneficiaries were vaccinated for the first dose and 1,13,523 HCWs and FLWs received the second dose of vaccine as per the provisional report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-can-be-taken-247-says-centre/article33984537.ece
04 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Pinarayi writes to EC on ED probe into KIIFB||In a swift move, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has sought the intervention of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure that Central investigation agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) follow the ‘statute in letter and spirit’ and ‘act in a politically neutral manner’. “This is absolutely essential to retain the spirit of the model code of conduct and to ensure free and fair elections in the State,” Mr. Vijayan pointed out in a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora. Summons to CEO The move comes in the wake of the ED’s probe into the masala bonds of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), the flagship infrastructure funding and development agency of the State. The agency had issued summons to K.M. Abraham, CEO of KIIFB, to be present at its Kochi office on March 5 and Deputy Managing Director Vikramjit Singh to appear on March 4 for questioning. The model code put in place is being ‘conveniently violated, torpedoed at the instance of some Union Ministers and its very spirit is being destroyed’. ‘Poll gains for Oppn.’ “The authority conferred on investigating agency is being wrongly appropriated for electoral gains of the ruling party at the Centre and for the Opposition in the State,” the Chief Minister said. The matter is neither one of recent occurrence nor of urgent nature. Some of the officials, including women, called by the ED to Kochi had been subjected to ‘intemperate behaviour’, he said. The move came close on the heels of a speech by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman criticising KIIFB and the State Budget during the BJP’s Vijay Yatra in Kochi on February 28. “The prudent conclusion that can be made is that the undue haste and leakage of information to the media by the ED officials are motivated by partisan political reasons. The ED is misusing its power and the aim is to conduct a smear campaign against the State government,” he said. CPI(M) condemns it The CPI(M) State secretariat on Wednesday condemned the ED’s inquiry into KIIFB as a declaration of war against Kerala’s people. The public would give an apt reply to the brazen act of hostility by the Central government, it said. KIIFB was created to mobilise funds from the open financial market to fuel the State’s growth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pinarayi-writes-to-ec-on-ed-probe-into-kiifb/article33984495.ece
04 March 2021||SIDDIPET,||HC punishes two Collectors for contempt||The Telangana High Court has sentenced Sircilla Collector D. Krishna Bhaskar, the then Joint Collector (now Collector of Wanaparthy) Yashmin Basha and Land Acquisition Officer/ Revenue Divisional Officer N. Srinivas Rao to simple imprisonment of three months and imposed a fine of Rs. 2,000 in a contempt case. They should also pay costs of Rs. 10,000 to each of the petitioners within four weeks. The sentence is suspended for six weeks. An adverse entry would be recorded in the service records of the respondents for their wilful disobedience of the October 12, 2018 orders passed by the court. The February 25, 2021 order was issued by Justice M.S. Ramachandar Rao. Villagers move court As many as 15 petitioners from Anantagiri village in Illantakunta mandal of Rajanna Sircilla district approached the High Court alleging that their lands were inundated by the Anantagiri reservoir despite interim orders issued by the court and this was nothing but contempt of court. All of them demanded implementation of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (LA Act, 2013). They alleged that the authorities had not followed the mandatory procedures. Lands submerged In 2018, the petitioners urged the court to restrain the respondents from taking possession of their agriculture lands mentioned in the declaration issued on January 1, 2017 and May 16, 2017 from taking up any construction work. They alleged that their lands got submerged as a result of the works from upstream in October 2019. “I hold that petitioners were dispossessed from their lands in October 2019 itself and their lands were submerged as alleged in the contempt case and all the respondents have wilfully disobeyed the order dated 12.10.2018 in Interim Appeal Number of 1 of 2018 in Writ Petition Number 37623 of 2018,” observed the judge. “Our lands were forcibly acquired and inundated in the Antagiri reservoir in 2019 despite our cases pending with the High Court. So far we were not paid compensation for our lands or rehabilitation and resettlement. Hence, we approached the High Court again,” Kolanupaka Narayana Reddy, an oustee from Anantagiri told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-punishes-two-collectors-for-contempt/article33984505.ece
04 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||Cong. backs Gogoi’s call for united fight against BJP||The Assam unit of the Congress on Wednesday saw merit in jailed activist Akhil Gogoi’s suggestion to all Opposition parties to get together and nominate a single “worthiest” candidate in each of the 126 Assembly constituencies to defeat the BJP and install a government that is against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). But the party disagreed with the view of the activist that such a strategy can be possible by keeping the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) out. Open letter In an open letter a few days ago, Mr. Gogoi said his appeal for a consensus candidate was for all Opposition parties except the AIUDF led by perfume baron and MP Maulana Badruddin Ajmal. “We believe the BJP and the AIUDF are two sides of the same coin. Both are fundamentalists. We cannot take the support of one fundamentalist force to defeat another,” he said. His party, Raijor Dal (RD), also said it could consider joining the Congress-led grand alliance if the AIUDF was not part of it. “There might be a difference of opinion and ideologies among all the political parties. But the need of the hour is to oust the BJP from Dispur [seat of power in Assam] and bring an anti-CAA force in power. The Opposition must rethink their strategy,” Mr. Gogoi said. “There is merit in Akhil Gogoi’s suggestion, but it is up to our high command to decide on bringing his party on board. At the same time, it is for the AIUDF to analyse its characteristics. If there is no BJP, there may not be any AIUDF,” Congress MLA from Nazira and leader of the Opposition Debabrata Saikia said on Wednesday.  ‘Grand alliance’ “The Congress has been seeking a grand alliance of all anti-BJP forces and we have also said we will not field candidates in constituencies where Akhil Gogoi and Lurinjyoti Gogoi contest,” Congress MP Pradyut Bordoloi said. He, however, said the offer should not be construed as a weakness of the Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-backs-gogois-call-for-united-fight-against-bjp/article33984532.ece
04 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Study finds elective C-section might contribute to excess weight in children||Elective Cesarean-section delivery might contribute to excess weight and also possibly reduced linear growth at one year of age in children, according to a study published in Paediatric Research, a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal. The study authored by a team of researchers led by Giridhara R. Babu, head of Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH), analysed data from the Maternal Antecedents of Adiposity and Studying the Transgenerational role of Hyperglycaemia and Insulin (MAASTHI) prospective birth cohort. The MAASTHI cohort, led by Dr. Babu and his team, was designed to study maternal risk factors associated with childhood overweight and obesity. A total of 638 mother–infant pairs from public hospitals in South Bengaluru were included from MAASTHI cohort during 2016 to 2019 and information on delivery mode was obtained from medical records. Based on WHO child growth standards, body mass index-for age z-score (BMI z) and length-for-age z-score (length z) were derived. “Our results indicate that decreasing medically unnecessary elective C-section deliveries may help limit excess weight gain and stunted linear growth among infants,” Dr. Babu told The Hindu on Wednesday. The study found that the rate of C-section was 43.4% (26.5% emergency, 16.9% elective) among the 638 mothers. While 14.9% of the overall infants were overweight at one year of age, among the 108 babies delivered by elective C-section, 25% became overweight. “Babies delivered by elective C-section had 2.44 times higher risk of being overweight compared to those born by vaginal delivery. However, no such association was found for emergency C-section,” explained Deepa R., researcher from IIPH, who is the co-author of the study. According to the study, one exposure in the first 1,000 days that has been associated with excess infant weight gain and childhood overweight and obesity is C-section delivery. While several mechanisms may explain this association, the leading hypothesis is that interruption of mother-to-newborn microbiota transfer drives the association of C-section with overweight and obesity. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies have found that gut microbiota may play an etiologic role in the development of overweight, as well as under-nutrition and C-section is highly deterministic of the infant gut microbiota development. Dr. Babu said the prevalence of C-section delivery is on the rise globally, including countries such as India that have a high burden of malnutrition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/study-finds-elective-c-section-might-contribute-to-excess-weight-in-children/article33984710.ece
04 March 2021||New Delhi,||Six States continue to see a rise in COVID-19 numbers||Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka continued reporting an increase in daily new cases of COVID-19, together accounting for 85.95% of the cases reported in the 24 hours till 8 a.m. on Wednesday, the Union Health Ministry said in a release on Wednesday. As many as 14,989 new cases were registered across India, and Maharashtra reported the highest of 7,863, followed by Kerala (2,938) and Punjab (729), the release said. Data released by the Ministry show that Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Karnataka have shown the most increase in new cases on a week-on-week basis. Maharashtra alone accounted for a weekly increase of 16,012 cases in terms of the number of cases. In percentage terms, Punjab reported a weekly increase of 71.5% (1,783 cases). The country’s total active caseload had reached 1,70,126 currently, while 1,08,12,044 people had recovered so far and 13,123 patients discharged in the 24 hours. Also, 86.58% of the new recovered cases were observed to be concentrated in six States, with Maharashtra reporting the highest number of single-day recoveries of 6,332. In Kerala, 3,512 people recovered in the 24 hours, and Tamil Nadu followed it with 473 recoveries. Ninety-eight deaths were reported in the country in the 24 hours. Four States accounted for 88.78% of them.

04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Vaccine lifts antibody level in 14 days’||Antibodies against the novel coronavirus begin to appear significantly only 14 days after a vaccine injection. But in people who have already been infected by SARS-CoV-2 before, the increase can be observed in a week, a study has found. While underlining the importance of the follow-up second shot, scientists associated with the study suggest that in mass vaccination campaigns, individuals who have been infected previously be prioritised below those unexposed. According to several serology surveys, anywhere from 21% to 60% of India may have been exposed to the virus since March. While India currently does not face supply constraints — there are more vaccines available than those registering for shots as of now — this could change as more groups become eligible for the vaccine. The study, yet to be formally published but available as a preprint, measured antibodies generated in 135 healthcare workers administered with Covishield at different weeks or time points (0, 7, 14, 28 days). A third of the workers had already been exposed to the virus and in them, the antibody response progressively increased at each of those time points. In contrast, the antibody response started to show only after 14 days or later in 88 of the rest, who had been unexposed to the virus. Three did not develop any antibody response even at day 28 of the vaccination. The results also showed that antibodies in those infected earlier started to stabilise, even decline, after day 14 but were still substantially higher — in one instance nearly thousand-fold at day 28 — than those who were inoculated with Covishield but with no prior exposure to the virus. Currently, the longevity of antibodies after a COVID-19 infection has not been firmly established, nor is the immunity after being exposed to a particular strain of the virus. “Our data suggests that ChAdOx1 (or Covishield) is highly immunogenic, particularly so where previous SARS-CoV-2 antibody-response is established. Given the high background seropositivity in India, this may be useful in determining optimal timing of the second dose during mass immunisation,” say the authors, comprising scientists from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), New Delhi and the Max Group of Hospitals. “We were surprised by the number of antibodies generated in those already exposed to the infection,” Shantanu Sengupta, Scientist, CSIR-IGIB, told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-lifts-antibody-level-in-14-days/article33984540.ece
04 March 2021||New Delhi,||All who are eligible should take vaccine, says President||President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday was administered the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at the Army’s Research and Referral Hospital. “President Ram Nath Kovind, accompanied by his daughter, was administered the vaccine at the Army R&R Hospital, Delhi, today,” tweeted the official handle of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Mr. Kovind, 75, thanked “all the doctors, nurses, health workers and administrators who are successfully implementing the largest vaccination drive in history and urged all eligible citizens to get vaccinated”. His vaccination came just a couple of days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken the first shot of Covaxin developed in India by Bharat Biotech. On March 1, the government rolled out the second phase in which health workers and other frontline workers are being vaccinated. Though there were demands for the Prime Minister and other Ministers to vaccinate themselves to inspire citizens right at the start of the programme, the government had argued that frontline workers deserved to be protected first. Apart from the Prime Minister, on Tuesday, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad too had tweeted a photo of him taking his first.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-who-are-eligible-should-take-vaccine-says-president/article33984552.ece
04 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘Developed Covaxin for a cause, not to make money’||Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Krishna Ella on Wednesday said the company took up development of Covaxin as a cause and not to make money. “As a company, we took it as a cause, not to make money but to help the country and save people’s lives,” he said in a video message that was shared by the company with a statement on an interim Phase 3 trial results of Covaxin that showed 81% efficacy. Tracing the phases in development of the indigenous vaccine, he said Bharat Biotech partnered the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in March-April and on May 1 got the strain from National Institute of Virology, Pune. “Since then our journey on Covaxin development started,” he said, while citing challenges that accompanied the lockdown, including non availability of reagents. The company overcame them and the employees worked day and night at the BSL 3 containment facility in Hyderabad to make it happen. Thanking those involved in the development as well as the volunteers, Mr.Ella said many aged above 60 years participated in the clinical trials, including a man and woman aged 93 and 91 in Aligarh. The 25 trial centres were well distributed across the country to ensure the population is represented properly. There were four sites in central zone, two in eastern, five in northern and seven each in southern and western zones. The interim data has been submitted to Drugs Safety Monitoring Board and a detailed analysis will be presented to the Subject Expert Committees of the CDSCO, he said. To criticism the company faced that “our data is not transparent and not in public domain,” he said “I am proud to say that we have 6 publications. If people have got the patience they should read those articles.”  As a company, we took it as a cause, not to make money but to help the country and save people’s lives.

04 March 2021||KOCHI/KOTTAYAM,||RSS leader meets church factions||A senior functionary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Wednesday gave audience separately to the Orthodox and Jacobite factions of the Malankara Church which have been locked in a bitter fight over ownership of parish churches in central Kerala. Sources said RSS joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya, who was in Kochi, held back-to-back meetings with Geevarghese Mar Yulios and Yakoob Mar Irenios, metropolitans respectively in charge of the Ahmedabad and Kochi dioceses of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, and Joseph Mar Gregorious, metropolitan trustee of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, along with Jacobites Church secretary Peter Elias, priest trustee Fr. Sleeba Paul Vattavelil and lay trustee Shaji Choondayil. Orthodox Church episcopal synod secretary Yohanon Mar Diascoros said the Orthodox metropolitans had met the RSS leadership to express the Church’s gratitude to the organisation in protecting the St. George's Orthodox Church at Cheppad in Alappuzha. The church, a centuries-old monument that faced the risk of demolition for widening of National Highway, is now set to be protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. Expresses gratitude “The two metropolitans, who have been officially designated by the synod to hold discussions with the various leaders of social importance, met the RSS leader to convey the Church’s gratitude for intervening in the issue. The meeting had nothing to do with the upcoming Assembly elections,” said the synod secretary. Besides the Cheppad church, matters relating to an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the Church dispute too came up for discussion. According to the metropolitan, the Orthodox Church is yet to decide on its political position during the upcoming elections. “There is enough time left for us to decide on this as the parties have not even decided on their candidates,” he said. Meanwhile, the Jacobites said the meeting was a follow-up to the discussions they had with Mr. Modi. “In about an hour and a half, we presented the issues we faced, including our ouster from the parish churches. We were assured of all help in resolving the issue amicably,” Kuriakose Mar Theophilos, spokesperson of the Jacobite Church, said. Sources said there was perfunctory talk on the Assembly polls on April 6 as well. While the Orthodox faction had traditionally sided with the Congress, the Jacobites were believed to have been aligned to the Left front.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rss-leader-meets-church-factions/article33984489.ece
04 March 2021||MUMBAI,||Bombay HC asks Amazon to take down Telugu film||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday directed Amazon Seller Services Private Ltd., which provides content to over-the-top streaming service of Amazon Web Services, to take down the Telugu filmVwithin 24 hours until the image of actor Sakshi Malik is completely deleted from it. A single Bench of Justice G.S. Patel was hearing an interim application filed by Ms. Malik through advocate Saveena T. Bedi. She has alleged illegal use of her still image in the film that was released on Amazon Prime on September 5, 2020. She has filed a defamation suit for Rs. 30 crore, mandatory injunction and damages. Ms. Malik commissioned a photographer on July 24, 2017 and the photo shoot took place on August 1. She later uploaded a part of the photo portfolio in her Instagram account. It is pointed out that her photograph was used in the film when there is a reference to a female escort or a commercial sex worker. Ms. Malik in her complaint said the unauthorised use of private material was an invasion of privacy. The court noted that the argument was prima facie correct. “Indeed, I do not believe there is any other way of looking at it.” The court directed Amazon to take down all versions of the film until such time as Venkateshwara Creations Pvt Ltd. had completely deleted all images of Ms. Malik from their work. Merely pixelating or blurring the image was not acceptable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bombay-hc-asks-amazon-to-take-down-telugu-film/article33984508.ece

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||India is ‘partly free’, says U.S. thinktank||Freedoms in India have reduced, according to a report from a U.S. thinktank, Freedom House, resulting in India being classified as ‘partly free’. India’s score was 67, a drop from 71/100 from last year (reflecting 2019 data) downgrading it from the free category last year (based on 2020 data). “The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and its State-level allies continued to crack down on critics during the year…,” the report “Freedom in the World 2021: Democracy under Siege” said. “The ruling Hindu nationalist movement also encouraged the scapegoating of Muslims, who were disproportionately blamed for the spread of the virus ...,” it said. “Rather than serving as a champion of democratic practice and a counterweight to authoritarian influence from countries such as China, Mr. Modi and his party are tragically driving India itself toward authoritarianism. “The private media are vigorous and diverse, and investigations and scrutiny of politicians do occur. However, attacks on press freedom have escalated dramatically under the Modi government, and reporting has become significantly less ambitious in recent years,” the report said, citing the use of security, defamation, sedition and contempt of court laws to quiet critical media voices. “Separately, revelations of close relationships between politicians, business executives and lobbyists on one hand and leading media personalities and owners of media outlets, on the other, have dented public confidence in the press,” the report said. On the U.S., the Freedom House said the risky state of American democracy was on display during the January 6 attack on the Capitol. It listed what it called the Trump presidency’s “ unprecedented attacks” on American democracy (examples included were dismissing inspectors general to sowing mistrust over the electoral system). The U.S. dropped three points over one year, down to 83/100. “ …The United States will need to work vigorously to strengthen its institutional safeguards, restore its civic norms and uphold the promise of its core principles for all segments of society if it is to protect its venerable democracy and regain global credibility.” China, classified as ‘not free’, dropped a point from last year going down to 9/100. “The malign influence of the regime in China, the world’s most populous dictatorship, was especially profound in 2020,” the report says citing Beijing’s disinformation and censorship campaign following the outbreak of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-is-partly-free-says-us-thinktank/article33984553.ece
04 March 2021||Mumbai,||14 Trojans found in servers, says Minister||Two days after Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh submitted a report prepared by the State’s cyber cell on a possible cyberattack that caused the October 12 power outage in Mumbai and parts of Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Power Minister Nitin Raut on Wednesday said the report found 14 Trojan programs that had entered the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company (MahaTransco) servers. “According to observations in the report, the firewalls of the information technology [IT] and operational technology [OT] servers, which are essential for power transmission, were affected by these Trojan horses. Suspicious codes and software programs that can affect the cybersecurity ecosystem at the State Load Dispatch Center [SLDC] at Kalva had found its way into the system,” Mr. Raut said in a statement in the Assembly. Similar Trojan programs were part of bigger cyberattacks in the past, he added. “Three alarms were sounded in a span of less than a minute, but were not given attention to show the possibility of a cyberattack,” he said, referring to the report. The Minister said repeated attempts were made from blacklisted and suspicious IP addresses to log in to the SLDC server, and to hack and disrupt the system. “Credit rating agencies have certified these IP addresses as suspicious and disruptive,” he said, adding that an attempt was made to either insert or remove around 8 GB of data from the server using the IP addresses. According to the Minister, the report recommended a separation of the IT and OT infrastructure and an updation, password management, enhancement of the web application security and a strengthening of the cyber system of the SLDC. In addition to the probe conducted by the State cyber cell, a technical committee, which included experts from IIT-Bombay, VNIT- Nagpur, VJTI-Mumbai and senior officials from the Power Department, was formed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/14-trojans-found-in-servers-says-minister/article33984518.ece
04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sugar mills seek higher MSP for their produce||Sugar mills are lobbying with the government for an increase in the minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar to Rs. 34.50 a kg from Rs. 31 to help them clear payment arrears to sugarcane farmers. The production rose 20% in the first five months of the season which started in September, putting further pressure on falling prices, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said on Wednesday. This comes at a time when large numbers of sugarcane farmers from western Uttar Pradesh, one of the country’s biggest sugar-producing areas, are camped on the borders of Delhi as part of the protest against three farm reform laws. By February-end, 502 mills across the country had produced almost 234 lakh tonnes of sugar, in comparison to 195 lakh tonnes produced by 453 mills during the corresponding period last year. Production has shot up in Maharashtra and Karnataka, though it is slightly lower in Uttar Pradesh than last year’s, according to ISMA data. “The prices are almost Rs. 80-100 a quintal less than what was prevailing a year ago during the corresponding period,” the ISMA said. “This is not a good sign as low prices, much below the cost of production for the last several months, have adversely affected the liquidity of mills and their ability to pay the FRP [fair and remunerative price] to farmers. It is feared that if such a situation persists then cane price arrears will jump very fast to uncomfortable levels.” The industry body said the FRP, a benchmark rate below which mills are not allowed to buy sugar cane, has already been hiked by Rs. 10 a quintal this year. “There is a need to quickly decide on increasing the MSP of sugar to ensure that sugar mills are able to pay farmers on time,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sugar-mills-seek-higher-msp-for-their-produce/article33984528.ece

Muniraj G., Senior Superintendent of Police, Aligarh, said the Class 8 dropout from the neighbouring village was in police custody and had confessed to the crime. The accused was watering a wheat crop around noon on February 28, when the victim came to the field to collect fodder for her goats. “He was watching a porn film on his mobile. He tried to sexually assault the girl and when she resisted, he strangulated her with her chunni (stole). He then dragged her body for a few metres to hide it in another field,” Mr. Muniraj said. Police sources said the accused knew that the girl had a speech impairment.

Maharashtra Congress president and MLA Nana Patole criticised the Centre for selectively targeting celebrities. Maharashtra’s PWD Minister Ashok Chavan told presspersons, “This is not new. We have been seeing this happening often.

A Bench, led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, said there was nothing in Dr. Abdullah’s statement “which we find so offensive as to give a cause of action for a court to initiate proceedings”, trashing the plea as a “clear case of publicity interest litigation” by petitioners who want to get their names in the press. The Bench dismissed the case levying costs on the petitioners to the tune of Rs. 50,000 to be deposited with the Supreme Court Advocates Welfare Fund in four weeks. Petitioner Rajat Sharma accused Dr. Abdullah of stating that “in Kashmir he will get Article 370 of the Constitution restored with the help of China” in a speech on September 24.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/voicing-dissent-against-govt-is-not-sedition-sc/article33984510.ece

The interim analysis showed that severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events were at low levels and balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. The National Institute of Virology indicated that vaccine-induced antibodies “can neutralize UK variant strains and other heterologous strains,” the company said. The vaccine demonstrated the interim efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in those without prior infection after the second dose, and the 25,800 participants received a vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, the company said. The clinical trial will continue through to final analysis at 130 confirmed cases to evaluate the efficacy of Covaxin in additional secondary study endpoints. Mr. Ella said, “Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus. With today’s results from our Phase 3 clinical trials, we have reported data on our COVID-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants.” Covaxin (BBV152) contains a whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which is produced in Vero cells (a lineage of cells used in cell cultures), and the manufacturing platform has a better safety profile compared to other vaccine platforms, the company said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-efficacy-is-81-works-against-variants/article33984512.ece

On February 8-9, when she returned to Chennai, her journey lasted nearly 23 hours, and she received an “enthusiastic welcome” from her followers. A couple of vehicles used by her had even sported the flag of the AIADMK. On the occasion of Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary on February 24, she made a fresh call for unity to the departed leader’s “genuine followers”, which the AIADMK promptly rebuffed. She added then that she would soon meet the followers. Press releases, issued by her office located at her present residence in T. Nagar here in the last one week, identified her as the general secretary of the AIADMK. Asked for a reaction, T.T.V. Dhinakaran, Ms. Sasikala’s nephew and general secretary of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), told reporters that he had tried to persuade her from taking back her decision but she remained firm. A long-time observer of the AIADMK compared Ms. Sasikala’s move with the decision of Janaki Ramachandran, wife of the AIADMK founder and former chief minister M.G. Ramachandran, to retire from politics in 1989 and said that while the latter had taken the step only after her faction lost badly in the 1989 Assembly election that saw the return of the DMK to power, the former’s decision came well ahead of the Assembly poll.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sasikala-to-withdraw-from-politics/article33984513.ece

04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rahul’s comments on RSS are laughable: BJP||The BJP on Wednesday termed Congress MP Rahul Gandhi’s statement attacking the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) “laughable”. The party also contested Mr. Gandhi’s claim that the Congress had at no point during the Emergency attempted to capture India’s institutional framework. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, at a press conference in New Delhi, said it would take Mr. Gandhi a long time to understand the RSS, the Hindutva organisation and the ideological mothership of the BJP. Mr. Gandhi had, in a video conversation with Kaushik Basu, former Chief Economic Adviser and now a Professor at Cornell University, U.S., termed the Emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi a “mistake”. He had added that the Emergency was fundamentally different from the current scenario as the Congress had at no point attempted to capture the country’s institutional framework, as the RSS was attempting to do now. Mr. Javadekar, in response to Mr. Gandhi’s charge that the RSS could be called the Hindutva counterpart to radical Islamists in Pakistan, said the organisation’s role was to effect good changes in people. “Lakhs, including MPs and MLAs, were arrested during that time and institutions were denied any freedom. For him to say that they did not target institutions is laughable,” he said. Mr. Javadekar rejected allegations that the income tax searches on the premises of filmmaker Anurag Kashyap and actor Taapsee Pannu were linked to their comments critical of the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahuls-comments-on-rss-are-laughable-bjp/article33984524.ece

04 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Linguistic barriers to education must go’||The country’s education system should break through linguistic barriers in order to ensure that those in rural areas or from poor homes were not deprived of opportunities to let their talent flourish, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday. Addressing a webinar on education initiatives in the Union Budget, he stated that the focus on learning in local languages was one of the most important improvements being brought through the new National Education Policy. There was no lack of talent in the country, and those who knew only their own languages should not be excluded from its development journey. It was important to work in mission mode to ensure that the talent of those from rural areas or from poor families were not allowed to die, but were rather given opportunities to bloom, he urged. “For building an Atmanirbhar Bharat, it is important that the youth have self-confidence. Self-confidence comes when youth have faith in their education, skills and knowledge,” he observed. It was the responsibility of all academics and language experts to make sure that the best content in the country and the world were available in Indian languages. This was definitely possible in this era of technology. Back to basics This must be done from primary to higher education, with content creation in Indian languages for all subjects, whether medical, engineering, technology or management. The National Language Translation Mission was also key to ensuring this, he noted. Mr. Modi pointed out that limiting knowledge and research was a big injustice to the country’s potential. In fact, opportunities were opening in sectors such as space, atomic energy and agriculture for talented youth. The Union Budget, he asserted, had broadened the government’s efforts to link education with employability and entrepreneurial capability. There was an emphasis on equity of access and institution building. He pointed to the National Research Foundation, which was being set up with an earmarked budget of Rs. 50,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/linguistic-barriers-to-education-must-go/article33984544.ece

Though the government claimed that provisions of the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession (KMMC) Rules, 1994, allows removal of sand in Coastal Regulation Zone as per government notification issued in 2011, the HC pointed out that question is whether the State is under obligation to make a study on impact of sand removal on the environment and traditional occupations of villages.

Mr. Kushwaha dodged queries about his numerous meetings, in the recent past with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, his former mentor. Mr. Kumar, on his part, replied with a cryptic “lets see” when asked elsewhere by journalists about the possible return. Mr. Kushwaha, who celebrated his party’s ninth foundation day, said, “Party’s national and State executives will meet here on March 13-14. The future course will be decided thereafter.” On his meetings with the CM, he said, “Why do you want to stop me from meeting him.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rlsp-chief-mum-on-his-return-to-nda/article33985303.ece

04 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,||A cover for corruption: BJP||With the Enforcement Directorate (ED) booking a case against the Kerala Infrastructure and Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), the people have come to understand why the State government and Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac raised strong objections to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, BJP State president K. Surendran has said. Addressing the media on Wednesday, Mr. Surendran said the case against KIIFB was an example of how the Left Democratic Front government had violated all laws to facilitate corruption. The BJP, from the outset, had said the practice of borrowing from abroad at high interest rates at a time when loans at lower rates were available domestically amounted to corruption. “Dr. Isaac wanted all government projects to be carried out illegally to facilitate corruption. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Dr. Isaac have played a key role in this mammoth scam in the name of KIIFB,” he said. Regarding the deep-sea trawler scam, Mr. Surendran accused Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma and Mr. Vijayan of playing hide-and-seek. A question to UDF “This government just washes its hands of any new case of corruption. This was seen during the gold smuggling and Sprinklr scams as well,” he said. Mr. Surendran also lashed out at the United Femocratic Front and asked the Congress-led coalition to explain why the Indian Union Muslim League protested against the 10% reservation for economically backward sections among forward communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-cover-for-corruption-bjp/article33984490.ece

04 March 2021||Hyderabad,||Gold paste, foreign cigarettes, live round seized at RGIA||A woman passenger who arrived at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) from Dubai was detained by Customs officials on Tuesday for trying to smuggle in gold in the form of paste. The accused, Amtul Hashil Mohammed, a resident of Hakeempet, concealed around 1.6 kg gold paste worth Rs. 74 lakh in various parts of her body. Acting on specific information, a team of Customs Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) detained Amtul Hashil, who arrived by Fly Dubai airlines flight number FZ 8779 at 2.50 p.m. and by 3.30 pm she was taken into custody, sources said. A case was booked against the accused woman under relevant sections of Customs Act and a probe is on. In a separate incident, a 41-year-old man, who was in possession of 40,000 cigarette sticks, was detained by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel at RGIA in the little hours of Wednesday. According to official sources at the airport, the accused passenger, Abdul Azeez Kutikol Veedu, arrived from Abu Dhabi by Etihad airways flight no.

Discharging both accused persons — Imran alias Teli and Babu — from the charge, Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat quoting from Russian classic Crime and Punishment said, ‘From a hundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicion don’t make a proof’.

04 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Tagging along with the big brother||Ever since the AIADMK won the 2016 Assembly election with a margin of about one percentage point over the DMK-led front, several leaders and observers have been insisting that the outcome would have been different had there been no Makkal Nala Kootani (MNK — People’s Welfare Front), led by DMDK founder Vijayakant. But as the State is gearing up to face the Assembly poll in a month, all constituents of the now-defunct MNK have been making all out efforts to secure a respectable tally of seats with either of the camps led by the State’s principal parties — the AIADMK and the DMK. While the DMDK and TMC (Moopanar) are negotiating with the ruling party, four of its former allies — the CPI, the CPI(M), the MDMK and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) — are bargaining with the DMK. The PMK, which tried its luck independently five years ago, has now been allotted 23 seats in the AIADMK-led front. The 2016 election saw the AIADMK bagging 135 seats with a vote share of 40.77% and the DMK-led front securing 97 seats with a 39.76% vote share. [The election for two seats was held later.] The MNK, which polled about 26 lakh votes with about 6% vote share, came a cropper. Not only did it not capture a single seat, it also forfeited deposit in 224 seats. The position of the PMK was marginally different with the party being able to retain deposit in 20 seats. Needless to say, it did not bag any seat. Smaller parties can go it alone once or twice. But if they do that even after two unsuccessful attempts, their workers will abandon them for greener pastures, said a senior AIADMK leader, who returned to the party years ago after working for a few such parties. Panruti S. Ramachandran, former Minister, said smaller parties were having tie-ups with bigger parties to keep themselves “politically fit”. If any of them keep experimenting in facing the electorate without the support of the DMK or the AIADMK, they will have to suffer defeat “permanently,” he pointed out. The average size of the electorate per Assembly constituency is an important factor, and smaller parties can hardly gloss it over. There are 194 constituencies whose electorates are in the 2-3 lakh range. There are 140 constituencies with bigger electorates than the average size of 2.67 lakh. Going by the voter turnout data since 1996, it can be assumed that the State will have a 70% turnout this time. In that case, on average, around 1.87 lakh voters will turn up at the polling booths in each constituency. As on date, there are only two parties in the State with at least 25% core vote base in every constituency, R. Subash, a political analyst, said. This, along with support from their allies and an ability to attract neutral voters, makes them formidable. “This is why Tamil Nadu has not been able to have a credible third force,” observed Mr. Subash, adding that people did not opt for the MDMK-led front in the 1996 Assembly election and the alliance, comprising the CPI(M) and Janata Dal, could net only two seats and a 7.89% vote share. “All said and done, the DMK and the AIADMK have established an extensive network across the State, which is a prerequisite for any party before aspiring to go it alone. It is not that easy for any other party to build a substantial base here. We, the BJP, have been making efforts to have ours here and the election result will reveal our strength,” said L. Ganesan, senior BJP leader. He pointed out that only those unable to make it to either of the camps were forming a third front. But P. Ramajayam, academician, said smaller parties had to align themselves with the two principal parties as they were in search of recognition. Apart from obtaining a certain number of seats and votes for meeting legal requirements to retain their symbols, the organisations gained recognition enormously from their workers and the general public when they were able to send their representatives to Parliament or the Assembly. Citing the example of the Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK) in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, whose candidate contested on the DMK symbol, he said this had made a huge impact on the social constituency being served by the party. However, the CPI(M) said it had certain tasks cut out for itself while aligning itself with the DMK. The tasks were to carry on the political fight against the BJP, which, according to party leader K. Balakrishnan, was against federalism, secularism and the Constitution, and to present an alternative thought. As in 2016, this time too smaller parties such as MNM and NTK are making another attempt at carving out an independent space for themselves, unmindful of the enormity of the challenge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tagging-along-with-the-big-brother/article33984635.ece
04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Many areas are reporting fresh COVID-19 cases: Radhakrishnan||Nearly 1,000 streets in the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) continue to report fresh coronavirus infections, according to Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan. While appreciating senior citizens and persons in the age group of 45-59 with comorbidities category for coming forward to get vaccinated, he said, “What is worrying is that of the 39,000 streets in GCC, 1,000 streets continue to report five to six cases. Similarly, cases are not declining in Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts. In many other districts, where the mortality has reduced to a great extent, we still record seven to eight cases.” An analysis showed that persons attending functions, such as marriages, birthday parties, and events in gated communities were not wearing masks, he told reporters on the sidelines of a central team’s visit on Wednesday. “We noticed during the central team’s visit that in many places, people are not wearing masks or are lowering their masks. Those visiting book fairs, hotels and travelling in buses are not wearing masks. We have asked all district Collectors and the GCC Commissioner to enforce mandatory wearing of masks. Masks are the social vaccine. We need to maintain physical distance when attending a programme as the infection spreads when people are close to each other while dining. People should not think that COVID-19 spread has stopped,” he said. Mr. Radhakrishnan added that it was important to reduce fatality due to the disease and people should seek medical help in case of any symptoms. 75% get jab The good news, he said, was that over 75% of healthcare workers had been vaccinated. “However, frontline workers, police personnel and those involved in election work should come forward for the vaccination. There has been a good response among the elderly. We have nearly 650 vaccination centres in the government sector and an equal number of private vaccination centres. The vaccines are for free in the government facilities. On Tuesday, around 31,000 persons were vaccinated in government centres,” he said. While others were hesitant, senior citizens and those in the age group of 45-59 with comorbidities came forward for the vaccination, he said, adding that 41,643 persons were inoculated on Tuesday. The Central government had supplied adequate doses of the vaccines. “We have received around 26 lakh doses of the vaccines. They have asked us to vaccinate all and have assured us of supply... Those aged above 45 years with comorbidities, senior citizens and those involved in election work should come forward and utilise the vaccination programme. Special arrangements have been made in all government hospitals for those who come in groups for vaccination,” he said. He said the Health Department was making arrangements for the election as per the advisory of the Chief Electoral Officer to the district election officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-areas-are-reporting-fresh-covid-19-cases-radhakrishnan/article33985095.ece

Association president K.P. Murali said over 80% of the transactions in fuel outlets were made in cash and individual owners or staff usually took this cash, ranging from Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 25 lakh a day, to their respective banks to deposit it in their accounts. “This money has to be paid daily since we cannot store it in the outlet due to safety concerns. The amount has to be deposited so that advance payment is made to oil companies for fuel purchases. If the amount is not transferred, fuel supply may be affected,” he said. The association has written to the Chief Electoral Officer seeking permission to carry large amounts of cash accompanied by proper challans and letters from bunk owners. “Every election, we face this problem. There is no permanent solution to this issue. At times employees are stopped while proceeding to the bank and are not allowed even if they show the documents,” a dealer said.

04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Updated list of ROs, AROs uploaded on website: EC||The Election Commission of India (EC) on Wednesday informed the Madras High Court that it had uploaded on the website www.elections.tn.gov.in an updated list of names, designations, mobile phone numbers, landline numbers and e-mail IDs of Returning Officers (ROs) and Assistant Returning Officers (AROs) of as many as 230 out of 234 Assembly constituencies in the State. Appearing before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, ECI counsel Niranjan Rajagopalan said the details of officials in charge of three more constituencies would be uploaded on Wednesday, while it would take some time to upload the information pertaining to Uthiramerur constituency. He said the Returning Officer of Uthiramerur was yet to take charge, and hence, there would be some delay in uploading those details. After recording his submissions, the Division Bench ordered that the remaining details be uploaded by the end of the week, and disposed of a writ petition filed by DMK Organising Secretary R.S. Bharathi. According to senior counsel R. Viduthalai, representing the writ petitioner, the ECI issued a notification on January 22 with respect to the appointment of District Election Officers, ROs and AROs. Accordingly, the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) also uploaded on his official website the names of the ROs and AROs. But subsequently, the State government transferred many officers. Pointing out that two Government Orders were issued on February 3 and 11 with respect to mass transfer of officials in the rank of District Revenue Officers (DROs) and others, the counsel said it had led to a mismatch in the contact details of ROs and AROs as available in the CEO’s website. He contended that such transfers vitiated the sanctity of the entire electoral process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/updated-list-of-ros-aros-uploaded-on-website-ec/article33985122.ece
04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Private power producers urge Tangedco to clear dues early||The private power producers’ association has urged Tangedco’s CMD Pankaj Kumar Bansal to help settle their dues soon by availing the second tranche of the Centre’s liquidity infusion scheme for uninterrupted power supply during election. The Centre had announced a liquidity infusion scheme as a part of Atma Nirbhar Bharat package to help distribution companies overcome the crisis caused by the pandemic. The scheme enables discoms to avail of loans from Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and clear the dues of the central generation and transmission companies, independent power producers and renewable energy generators. Tangedco was sanctioned Rs. 30,230 crore under the package out of which Rs. 11,091 crore had been disbursed as on January 27, according to the information provided in the Rajya Sabha last month. According to power producers’ body, Tangedco has disbursed the tranche 1 payment, which is 50% of energy dues in December 2020. “Our members are waiting to receive the tranche 2 (i.e., balance 50%) payment through the scheme so as to enable them to meet their various back-to-back obligations pertaining to plant operations, debt servicing and other lender covenants,” Ashok Khurana, Director General, Association of Power Producers, said in his letter to Tangedco. “Given the impending elections in Tamil Nadu, our members are keen to ensure uninterrupted power supply to Tangedco without resorting to invocation of Letter of Credit to avail payment or reporting the matter to Power System Operation Corporation Limited (which is national load despatch centre) to avoid triggering undesirable consequences,” the letter added. As of January 2021, Tangedco had outstanding dues of Rs. 19,325 crore to power producers, according to data available on Union Power Ministry’s PRAAPTI (Payment Ratification and Analysis in Power Procurement for bringing Transparency in Invoicing of generators) portal. The Union Ministry of Power has said that discoms have to comply with certain conditions to avail of the second tranche. With the moral code of conduct in place for the assembly election, it is likely to take longer for Tangedco to meet the requirements. Mr. Khurana also pointed out that in case the availing of tranche 2 is going to take longer, Tangedco could look at alternative options like it did in case of renewable generators. “We understand that recently tranche 2 payments were released to renewable generators, through the facility availed by Tangedco from Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited,” he noted in the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-power-producers-urge-tangedco-to-clear-dues-early/article33984701.ece
04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Here is how you can cast a postal vote||For the first time in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, the Election Commission of India has allowed the casting of postal votes for elderly voters aged over 80, the differently-abled, and those who have tested positive for COVID-19. Those aged above 80 and those eligible for casting postal ballots should fill up a 12-D consent form when officials visit their residences. Within five days of the notification of the election schedule, officials will visit the residences of persons falling in the three categories after preparing a list and ask them whether they want to cast their votes through postal ballots. If they choose the option, they will be provided with a 12-D consent form for casting votes. At your doorstep Officials would then visit the houses of the voters on a fixed day before the day of polling, and receive their ballots in ballot boxes physically. However, indelible ink will not be applied on fingers of electors. “Those who have filled 12-D forms will not be able to cast votes at the polling booths,” Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo said. According to the Election Commission of India, over 12.91 lakh electors in electoral rolls across Tamil Nadu are aged above 80. Of the 37 districts in the State, Chennai has the highest number of such persons (1.08 lakh), followed by Coimbatore (64,755), Salem (61,728) and Tiruppur (61,272). Polling is scheduled in all 234 Assembly constituencies in Tamil Nadu and 33 constituencies in Puducherry on April 6, and the counting of votes is scheduled on May 2.

04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Book compiling experiences of cancer survivors released||People who successfully overcame cancer, those who have seen others fight the disease or have cared for someone suffering from it spoke of their experiences at a virtual book launch on Wednesday. The participants shared something in common; they had all written about their experiences. The articles were compiled and launched under the title No One Fights Alone.  The third edition of the book has 40 articles from authors, including doctors, from across the country and men and women who witnessed their loved ones fight the disease. It also has six chapters devoted to COVID-19. Nilakanta Siva, who has published 20 books on the subject so far, said the aim was to raise awareness about cancer and all the issues surrounding it. Shiju Pillai, one of the contributors from West Asia, said he wrote a short story to create awareness about the disease. “The book is constructed using the experience of doctors, patients, and there is also a fantasy element. Half the disease is cured if the patient has confidence and faith. Such books help build faith and confidence. The cause of the book becomes very important. Younger generations will know what can happen [in case they get cancer],” he said. Bhavani Candrasekaran, who has 45 years of service in gynaecology, shared her experience. Bhagvati Ramakrishnan, of Mumbai, and Shalini S. have written poems. Some participants recalled that their own experience with their family members was unhappy and noted that putting them on paper brought them closure and comfort as they could express their feelings. Mr. Siva, a retired nuclear scientist and a survivor of bladder cancer, said it was more important to reach out to people. The book has been edited by Mousumi K. Sachdeva.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/book-compiling-experiences-of-cancer-survivors-released/article33985099.ece
04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Kamal Haasan slams Modi, Palaniswami||Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Wednesday trained his guns on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Union government and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s State government at a public meeting held near Kapaleeswarar temple in Mylapore. He earlier campaigned at various spots in Alandur and Velachery. Mr. Haasan asked the people to be mindful of those who think they can buy the people with money and seek votes based on caste and religion. “Some businessmen think they can buy you (people). I am not a businessman and politics is not my business,” he said. He mocked Mr. Modi in an uncharacteristically direct speech by saying that “some say that they feel bad for not learning Tamil” only during the election season. “Won’t we understand that these words are spoken only during the election? Some think that if they wear Kashmir caps in Kashmir, they will be liked. If they wear ‘horn crowns’ in Nagaland, they will be liked. That kind of politics is well past its expiry date. We won’t vote because you say Thirukkural with mistakes. We will evaluate you for that,” he said. On education He said that “they think votes in Mylapore” are “low hanging fruits”. “Our culture is not for sale. NEET, Hindi imposition, Hindutva in education and ‘ Kudumi ’ for Thiruvalluvar - you are playing with these things. The education of our children is not for sale,” he said. He also slammed Mr. Palaniswami on the Pollachi sexual abuse case and said that the safety of women is not “up for sale”. Mr. Haasan also appeared to accuse Mr. Palaniswami of accumulating disproportionate assets. “One person keeps saying that he is a farmer and he comes from a humble family. I accept you came from a poor family but you have so much wealth today. So, don’t call yourself a farmer. You are a businessman. Which is why I said — I am not a businessman and politics is not my business,” he said. Mr. Haasan also defended a key promise made by him regarding paying monthly salary to housewives. “They kept saying how can you do it? Now they realise that it can be done and the politicians around the world are talking about it. $1 trillion economy is possible if they stop stealing,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-haasan-slams-modi-palaniswami/article33985106.ece
04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Walk-in vaccine registrations catching on||On-site walk-in registrations for COVID-19 vaccines have gained a good response among senior citizens. A majority of those getting vaccinated in government hospitals in the city are walk-in registrations with the entire process of registration, vaccination and observation being completed in an hour, according to healthcare officials and hospital authorities. Vaccination for senior citizens and those in the age group of 45 to 59 years with comorbidites began on March 1. In addition to the self-registration on CoWIN 2.0 app, the Health Department made arrangements for on-site walk-in registrations too. “There has been a good response for walk-in registrations. All vaccine centres have walk-in registration facilities. People need to come with an identity card and can get vaccinated in an hour,” an official of the Health Department said. 80% in RGGGH Nearly 80% of persons, who received the vaccines at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), were walk-in registrations, dean E. Theranirajan said. On the first day of opening up vaccination for the two categories, the RGGGH vaccinated nearly 350 persons followed by 200 on Tuesday. “Many senior citizens are approaching the hospital directly for the vaccination. We have teams to register them at the Rheumatology block. It takes five to 10 minutes to enrol them. They can choose between Covishield and Covaxin, and are directed to the centre accordingly. Soon after receiving the shot, they are observed for 30 minutes. The entire process tsakes about one hour.” Hospital authorities pinpointed that while some of the elderly had difficulty registering on the Co-WIN app, others said they experienced technical glitches preventing them from registering. “Once they walk in, we do the registration for them. Nearly 80% of them are senior citizens, and 20% are persons with comorbidities. During interactions with the elderly, we found that many were keen to protect themselves from COVID-19,” P. Balaji, dean of the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, said. The hospital put up posters near the diabetes, asthma and hypertension clinics so that patients are aware of the vaccination programme. Second vaccine site The Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital, which has set up a second vaccine site, also received good response. “About 80% to 90% are walk-in registrations. We covered 250 persons on Tuesday and reached 180 on Wednesday noon,” R. Jayanthoi, hospital dean, noted. P. Vasanthamani, dean of the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, said they helped many who had directly approached the hospital to register on the app. “Our staff guided them through registration after the beneficiaries received the OTP,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/walk-in-vaccine-registrations-catching-on/article33985092.ece

04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil department in German varsity facing closure threat||The Tamil diaspora in Europe has launched a fund-raising campaign to save a department teaching Tamil in the University of Cologne. The department is facing closure threat for want of funds. Started in 1963 by Klaus-Ludwig Janert, the department has 12 students at present and offers undergraduate, postgraduate and Ph.D programmes in Tamil. According to the Tamil diaspora, the department is unique as it focuses on Tamil language unlike other European universities that focus on Hindi or Sanskrit. Two of its alumni are teaching the language in the University of Chicago and one is in Berlin University. A financial crisis in 2018 across the world hurt the university as well, which has led to the current crisis. The Tamil department’s current head, Ulrike Niklas, whom the Tamil Nadu government honoured with the G.U. Pope award for translating classical Tamil texts to German, will retire in 2022. No one has been identified to take over from her for want of funds. The department has one lecturer — Sven Wortmann. The financial crisis at the university may result in him losing his position, the Tamil diaspora fears. During a similar crisis in 2005, the Europe Tamilargal, an organisation that unites Tamils living in Europe, stepped in to raise funds to save the department. The organisation’s spokesperson Abdul Jabbar said Prof.Janert, then head of the department at the university, had convinced his student Ms. Nikolas, who was teaching in National University of Singapore, to take up the position in Cologne University. On February 20, Europe Tamilargal wrote an e-mail to Tamil Valarchi department here and are approaching the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, New Delhi. Mr. Jabbar said they had approached the Tamil Valarchi department as in 2018. The State government had allocated Rs. 5 crore to fund foreign universities to teach Tamil.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-department-in-german-varsity-facing-closure-threat/article33985338.ece

04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N.’s borrowing touches Rs. 82,000 cr.||Tamil Nadu’s market borrowings have touched Rs. 82,000 crore in FY2020-21 (from April 7-March 21), up 37% from Rs. 59,990 crore in the comparable period last year. The State has been the biggest borrower among other States so far. On Tuesday, it raised Rs. 2,500 crore through re-issue of a 10-year bond, also called State Development Loans. The bond had a yield of 7.16%. The States and Union Territories have been resorting to higher market borrowings this year, amid a shortfall in finances due to the pandemic on the one hand and increase in expenditure on the other. Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have been the top six borrowing States, accounting for 53% of the total borrowings so far in 2020-21. There has been a notable year-on-year increase in the market borrowings of large States such as Madhya Pradesh (112%), Rajasthan (57%), Maharashtra (54%), Karnataka (43%), Tamil Nadu (37%), Telangana (36%) and Andhra Pradesh (28%), according to Care Ratings. Replying to the general discussion on the interim budget for 2021-22 in the Assembly, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had pointed out that the State was facing a shortfall to the tune of Rs. 38,674.52 crore in its revenue receipts for 2020-21 due to COVID-19 pandemic impact. “Even though some measures were taken to control expenditure, it cannot be done beyond a limit, which would have affected the public. While the revenue receipts have fallen, the expenditure has increased, resulting in a deficit situation, which led to the borrowings,” he had pointed out. As a result, the revised estimate for the borrowings was at Rs. 92,497.95 crore in 2020-21, when compared to Rs. 57,802.94 crore that was estimated when the budget was presented, Mr. Panneerselvam had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tns-borrowing-touches-rs-82000-cr-in-fy21/article33984677.ece

04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Permit those on poll duty to cast votes on EVMs’||The Madras High Court has granted the Election Commission of India (ECI) time till Monday to respond to a plea made by a government schoolteachers’ association seeking permission for all those on election duty to cast their votes on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), since past experience had shown that the postal ballot system was not effective enough. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy accepted a request made by senior counsel G. Rajagopalan, representing the ECI, to grant him time till Monday to get instructions from the Commission. Senior counsel R. Viduthalai, representing Tamil Nadu High-Higher Secondary Graduate Teachers’ Association, contended that most of the government servants on election duty do not get to cast their votes properly through the postal ballot system. Such failure goes against the objective of the ECI to ensure that no voter gets left behind and that there should be very high percentage of polling. In an affidavit, the association said the government servants on election duty were allowed to vote through EVMs, after furnishing their Election Duty Cards (EDCs), only if they had been deputed in a polling booth situated within their Assembly constituency on the day of the election. Otherwise, they would have to cast their votes only through postal ballots. Often, postal ballot facility was denied to officials on poll duty because of a faulty database, the association alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/permit-those-on-poll-duty-to-cast-votes-on-evms/article33985125.ece

04 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP sees AMMK, AIADMK getting closer||With V.K. Sasikala’s sudden decision to step aside from politics, a section of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in Tamil Nadu do not rule out the possibility of T.T.V. Dhinakaran’s AMMK working closely with the AIADMK in the Assembly election. Hours before Ms. Sasikala’s announcement, a BJP leader acknowledged to The Hindu that the national party had, in fact, put forth a suggestion that the AIADMK consider bringing the AMMK into the alliance. But in the face of stiff resistance from Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and senior leaders of the AIADMK, the proposal was suspended. “We are no longer talking about the AMMK. We are only discussing our seat-sharing issue,” he said. However, soon after Ms. Sasikala issued her statement, the same leader said he was hopeful that the proposal would be revived. No choice “The AMMK has no choice now [but to join the alliance],” he said, hinting that the AIADMK, too, might now find reasons to compromise, given Ms. Sasikala’s exit from the political scene. Another BJP leader said there had been a need for momentum to take forward the alliance’s prospects in the polls, and this announcement had given that momentum. “Good things will happen,” he added. The BJP felt the AMMK may play spoilsport in about 40 seats in central Tamil Nadu, where the Mukkulathor community might prefer voting for candidates fielded by the AMMK. The BJP’s proposal was based on this assessment. BJP Tamil Nadu president L. Murugan welcomed Ms. Sasikala’s decision. Welcome reason “We should welcome the reason mentioned by Ms. Sasikala for stepping aside from politics. It should be our endeavour to keep the DMK out of power. With this statement, she has destroyed the dreams of those who thought they could come to power by causing political confusion,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/with-sasikala-stepping-aside-bjp-sees-ammk-aiadmk-getting-closer/article33985114.ece

Besides this, single mothers will receive help to develop skills, education and socio-economic support. ‘Non-committal about allies’ Mr. Haasan was non-committal about alliance partners. “There are many parties that are coming to us. I don’t want to give you guess work. When it happens, I will tell you,” he told journalists. Asked if he is speaking with the Congress, he said, “There are many such speculations. We will let you know.” He added that it was true that he had shaken hands with AISMK leader Sarathkumar, but nothing had been finalised. While the Congress is encountering a setback in seat-sharing talks with the DMK, its leader Rahul Gandhi had recently said he likes Mr. Haasan as a “secular” person. Meanwhile, V. Ponraj, aide of former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, joined the MNM and was appointed one of the vice-presidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-unveils-manifesto/article33984679.ece

Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause. Banking service was considered essential and bank employees had to work even during the total lockdown last year. Though public transport services were not available, the employees had to make arrangements and travel to the branches on those days. After vaccinating the healthcare and frontline workers, the government has given priority to other services such as judiciary and officials on election duty. It should give priority to the bank employees, too, so that those in all the age groups in the banks can get the vaccination. Similarly, LPG service was uninterrupted during the pandemic as it is also an essential service. The LPG delivery boys should get priority for the vaccine. He appealed to the government to include the bank employees and LPG delivery personnel in the priority list and ensure they get the vaccine early.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/give-priority-to-bank-employees-in-vaccination/article33985127.ece

The elephant which earned nickname for its habit of raiding houses and shops for soft food, especially cooked rice or raw rice, was lodged in the kraal after tranquillising and capturing from Arthanaripalayam village near Pollachi on November 14, 2019. Forest Department officials said that the elephant was conditioned to obey basic commands and their combinations when it was kept in captivity. The mahout and the kavadi (assistant to mahout), who took care of the elephant during the training, will continue to look after the elephant. Though the elephant’s training was completed five months ago, it was not released from the kraal due to an injury on its right leg. The elephant was released based on the direction from I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Coimbatore Circle) and Field Director of ATR. Arockiaraj Xavier, Deputy Field Director of ATR and District Forest Officer of Pollachi Forest Division, oversaw the training given to the elephant. “Now the elephant is obeying commands. It will be stationed at the Varagaliar camp as of now,” said N. Naveen Kumar, forest range officer of Ulandy forest range of ATR. Before its capture, the tusker had killed three persons from Navamalai and Arthanaripalayam. It also damaged several houses and shops in search of soft food items. The department had sought the opinion of an elephant expert before lodging the tusker in captivity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/arisi-raja-released-from-kraal-now-a-camp-elephant/article33984683.ece
04 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Micro units express concern over functioning in rented buildings||A micro unit, operating out of a property that is under legal dispute at TVS Nagar here, had lodged a complaint with the police on Tuesday alleging damage to it. “A group of men entered the industry, that is functioning in a rental building for the last 10 years, and had damaged it. They tried to enter another one on the same premises and we stopped it. The other unit has also given a complaint,” alleged J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises. More than 20,000 micro units in Coimbatore district function in rented buildings. The incident has created fear among these unit owners of safety, he said. The officials concerned should take stringent action against those disturbing operation of the industries and ensure that there are no such incidents in the future, he added. Mr. James said that one of the long-pending demands of the Association is an industrial estate for micro units. The owners of micro units cannot afford to invest and buy land, even if the Association takes the initiative. And, only a few units will benefit if there is such a project if an industrial estate is developed by the private sector. So, the government should construct multi-storeyed industrial estate at select locations. And the units should be able to pay for the space in instalments. Only then can the micro units have safety and have their own space at an affordable rate, Mr. James said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/micro-units-express-concern-over-functioning-in-rented-buildings/article33984702.ece

Speaking to The Hindu , the official said that there are seven Assembly Constituencies - Palani, Oddanchatram, Athur, Nilakottai, Vedasandur, Dindigul and Natham respectively. The total voters accounted for 18.73 lakh and there are 2,673 polling stations. In 2016, all the seven Assembly Constituency votes were counted at the Anna University Engineering College campus.

Bankers were urged to encourage only banking transactions and avoid cash deposits into accounts. Further, any deposit exceeding Rs. 1 lakh into an account will attract monitoring of the account. Further, transactions exceeding Rs. 10 lakh or more will entail bringing the account under the radar of the Income Tax department, Dr. Bhanu Reddy said. Bankers were told to alert the authorities of suspicious transactions to accounts. Any transaction that is intended to circumvent the poll code, will attract action against the account holder, the administration has said. Further, people were urged to carry cash with the requisite documents supporting the source of origin of the cash in transit. Otherwise, the cash will be liable for seizure.

04 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC tosses plea for rolling gates at bus stand||“It can hardly be expected of the High Court, no less, to look into matters pertaining to ingress and egress at every bus stand all over the State”. the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed, dismissing a petition that sought a direction to authorities to restore passenger rolling gates at Karaikudi bus stand in Sivaganga district. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice R. Hemalatha said the present trend, whether borne out of political ambitions or professional reasons, to approach the High Court on issues such as encroachment in the tiniest part of a remote village or access to a bus terminus or bus timings at a particular stop added to pendency of matters and impeded the court’s function. As a consequence, matters of larger public interest that required the court’s attention might get neglected. More often than not, persons with an axe to grind complained of matters and gave a public interest twist to the same, the judges observed. It was unfortunate that a degree of restraint that ought to be exercised at the Bar and the filter that ought to be carried out by it might have been lost or surrendered its efficacy. Local authorities, particularly, the Transport Department, should be approached and if there was a matter of any great public importance affecting the larger section of society, the High Court might be approached. The petition was not entertained as it did not involve any matter of great significance or large public interest. Nothing in this order would prevent persons affected from making a representation to the appropriate authorities, the judges said and dismissed the petition filed by SPD. Karuppaiah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-tosses-plea-for-rolling-gates-at-bus-stand/article33984657.ece
04 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC dismisses petition to close liquor shop||Dismissing a petition that sought a direction to authorities to close and shift a Tasmac shop in Thanjavur district, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has observed, “This is a matter where a citizen wears his self-righteousness on his sleeve and seeks the removal of a liquor store on some archaic sense of puritanism”. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice R. Hemalatha has said there are rules in place as to where liquor stores may be situated, the distance that ought to be maintained from any educational or religious institution and highways and the like. If, upon meeting all parameters, a liquor store is set up, complaints pertaining thereto could be entertained on the ground that consuming alcohol maybe unethical or undesirable. It is for policy-makers in the legislature to consider whether the State should turn dry. It is equally for the executive to set down guidelines for locations for liquor of shops. Unless such guidelines are found to be completely unreasonable or irrational or opposed to public policy, courts cannot barge in and interfere on personal predilection of any individual that every form of drinking may be evil, the judges said. A degree of restraint has to be exercised, particularly in high offices, so that personal perceptions and beliefs do not blur the objective process of adjudication and the principle duty that is to be discharged at such level.

04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,TAMIL NADU||SC defers hearing in case against T.N. reservation laws||The Supreme Court on Wednesday deferred the hearing of a case challenging reservation laws which allow 69% quota in State government jobs and educational institutions in Tamil Nadu. A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R. Subhash Reddy decided to wait till a Constitution Bench pronounces its judgment in the Maratha quota case. The court declined to refer the Tamil Nadu quota case to the Constitution Bench, to be heard along with the Maratha quota case. “We are of the view that these petitions [on the Tamil Nadu laws] need not be heard along with civil appeal no. 3123 of 2020 [Maratha quota case], and be listed after the judgment in civil appeal no. 3123 of 2020,” the court ordered. A five-judge Constitution Bench, also led by Justice Bhushan, is scheduled to examine the validity of the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act of 2018 from March 8. By including the Maratha community for quota benefits, the Maharashtra law has, similar to the Tamil Nadu, crossed the 50% limit, touching 65%. The Constitution Bench has fixed a deadline of March 18 to complete the hearing in the Maratha quota case. The deferment takes the spotlight away from the reservation law even as the Assembly election draws nearer in Tamil Nadu. During the hearing on Wednesday, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for the Tamil Nadu government, submitted that Assembly elections were due shortly, and the case should be taken up after the polls. ‘Quantifiable data’ Mr. Rohatgi and senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, along with advocate Yogesh Khanna, appearing for Tamil Nadu, said the increase in the reservation percentage in the State was based on “quantifiable data”. “We have quantifiable data. We had commissions working on this since the 1980s...It's not like we started in 2020,” Mr. Naphade said. The State’s lawyers argued that the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of seats in Educational Institutions and of appointments or posts in the Services under the State) Act of 1993 was protected under the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution from judicial review.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sc-defers-hearing-in-case-against-tn-reservation-laws/article33985124.ece
04 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Rangasamy refuses to comment on his party’s alliance with the BJP||Founder leader of All India N. R. Congress N. Rangasamy on Wednesday refused to comment on his party’s position on continuing their alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. “I am consulting our legislators and party workers. I will tell you later,” was his reply to repeated questions from media persons at the party office while inducting former Minister K. Lakshminarayanan into the AINRC. Mr. Rangasamy had convened a meeting of party legislators, former ministers, ex-board chairpersons and important functionaries on Tuesday night to elicit their views on the electoral stand to be adopted with BJP. The meeting was convened after recent statements of BJP leaders, including that of Union Home Minister Amit Shah while addressing a public meeting at Karaikal, that the next government would be formed by the Saffron party in the Union Territory. A sitting party legislator told The Hindu that the majority of those who have attended the consultative meeting requested Mr. Rangasamy to contest the Assembly polls alone. “When the BJP talks to us, they give an impression that the alliance will be led by AINRC. But their leaders, while addressing public meetings and media, send a different message of installing a BJP chief minister after the elections. That cannot be accepted,” he said. AINRC leaders at the meeting requested Mr. Rangasamy to take a firm stand on the alliance issue as the party had headed a government previously and now was in the Opposition. “We have more than 2 lakh committed voters in the Union Territory. The BJP which contested in 18 seats during the last Assembly polls, had lost deposits in all but one. How could that party be given a dominant role in the alliance. If they accept our leader as CM and party as major player in the alliance we will continue in the alliance,” said a former Minister. An alternative to Cong. After hearing the views of leaders, Mr. Rangasamy reportedly told them that people see AINRC as an alternative to Congress in the Union Territory. “Our view will be people’s view and a decision will be taken at the appropriate time,” he reportedly said at the meeting. According to a top BJP functionary, the party leadership was in touch with Mr. Rangasamy. Nominated legislator and party local unit president V. Saminathan and BJP in-charge for Union Territory Nirmal Kumar Surana on Tuesday held discussions with the AINRC chief. Union Minister of State Arjun Ram Meghwal along with Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Chandraskher have reached here on Wednesday to hold further consultations with Mr. Rangasamy, said the BJP functionary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rangasamy-refuses-to-comment-on-partys-alliance-with-bjp/article33985119.ece

Palaniswami had little more time, prior to the announcement of election dates, he may have waived off even personal loans and small borrowings done by the people, said Congress leader P. Chidambaram here on Tuesday. Speaking at a booth-level workers meeting held at Tirupachethi and Illayankudi, he said that the CM had suddenly woken up to the reality, but it was too late. Having slept for over four years, making announcements after announcements had only made him look like a comedian. The former Union minister wondered from where the State had earmarked funds for such huge waivers. “Have they discussed with any of the bankers about the modalities. Have the officials issued any terms and conditions. What is the size of the loans that will be taken up for waiver. What is the interest rate on the borrowings. How many SHGs will benefit across the State. Was the data cross checked by the officials concerned,” he wondered. Without any clarity, the government has rushed and made the announcements, he suspected and claimed that many beneficiaries remained in the dark. The State government had not given a tangible response to any of the above queries raised by a few more informed persons and simply stuck to the numbers in the Budget, which was just read by the Finance Minister in the Assembly, he charged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/if-given-more-time-cm-may-have-waived-other-loans-too-chidambaram/article33984662.ece

Such acts of non-adherence of guidelines and allocation of Rs. 5000 crore in the interim budget as against Rs. 12110-crore waiver announced has led to suspicion whether the crop loan waiver scheme would bring relief to farmers or not, he said. Meanwhile, G.Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam, a progressive farmer has expressed reservation over the waiver of jewel loans taken for agriculture operations from cooperative institutions. Claiming that fixing the upper limit of six sovereigns of gold jewellery pledged to avail loan for agriculture purpose would lead to confusion, he suggested that fixing a flat amount of Rs. 1 lakh or Rs. 1.25 lakhs as waiver amount would be useful to farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-allege-irregularities-in-crop-loan-waiver-scheme/article33984622.ece

Sarathkumar said on Wednesday. He also hinted that his wife Radhika Sarathkumar, the party’s new chief deputy general secretary, could be fielded in Kovilpatti or Velachery Assembly constituency. If she choose to contest in Kovilpatti, the actress will take on Minister for Information Kadambur C. Raju, the likely candidate of ruling AIADMK. Addressing the party’s general council meeting at Thiraviapuram here, Mr. Sarathkumar recalled his recent meeting with Mr. Haasan hoping to forge an alliance. Talks were on with a few more parties to make the front stronger within the next two or three days. “This is not the Third Front… The ‘Prime Front’ of the upcoming Assembly polls. Our chief ministerial candidate will be Mr. Kamal Haasan, who will decide on the future course of the alliance, which will register a resounding victory,” he said. Mr. Sarathkumar charged that the sweat shed by the AISMK without any expectation had been exploited by the ruling AIADMK over the past 10 years for their wellbeing. The AIADMK had not invited it for alliance talks. “Since they have exploited us using the AISMK like curry leaf, we decided to leave the AIADMK-led alliance to show them our strength and the size of our vote bank. Even though others mock this decision, we will not go back,” he said. Ms. Radhika charged that the DMK, like a ‘mega serial’, had become a family dynasty by bringing ‘family rule’ within the party while the AIADMK, after Jayalalithaa, had decided to face the election with ‘communal forces’. For Radhapuram Assembly segment, the AISMK has decided to field T.T.N. Lawrence, political advisor to Mr. Sarathkumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kamal-haasan-is-third-fronts-cm-candidate/article33984660.ece

04 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Bharathidasan University to launch YouTube channel||Bharathidasan University will soon launch a YouTube channel to live stream and store the digital content of seminars and workshops conducted by various departments and other annual events. Quite often, the events conducted by the departments are not video-recorded and the significance of the events fade away with the passage of time. The digital content will be a vital reference material for the departments, Gopinath Ganapathy, Registrar, said. A high-level committee had its meeting recently to specify the norms for the departments to upload quality academic content on different social media platforms. “Bharathidasan University YouTube Channel has been tested and will be launched shortly. The digital content of events across departments will be stored permanently and can be accessed any time,” he said. The University Informatics Centre will be managing the YouTube Channel. The digital infrastructure of the Bharathidasan University Entrepreneurs Career Hub will be utilised for the purpose. The university is planning to revamp its e-content repository created during the pandemic period as a support system for students to prepare for the online exams. Till date, teachers have uploaded 3,855 programmes for 36 undergraduate programmes, 22 post graduate programmes, and 37 other programmes including languages and elective subjects. There is a plan to further develop the e-repository content and make it a permanent feature in the interests of students at affiliated colleges, Director of University Informatics Centre S. Parthasarathy said. Teachers will be encouraged to upload adequate content for all subjects. The utility of the repository would be high for the first-year students who have to be sensitised to the existence of the support system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bharathidasan-university-to-launch-youtube-channel/article33984614.ece
04 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Stencil makers keep their fingers crossed||Faced with dwindling business, stencil cutters in Palakkarai have been hit hard by the lockdown. While at least five stencil makers were in business prior to the lockdown, only one shop remains now and that too with hardly any business despite it being the election season. The COVID-19 lockdown was the last nail on the coffin, say stencil cutters, who have moved on to making other steel items including trunk boxes, stools, tins, cake moulds. Some have begun to sell vessels and stoves too. Mr. Shanmugham, the last of the cutters said that this was the worst year his 20-year-old business has seen. ‘However poor my business is, I still have to pay rent to the shop and feed my wife and kids. At my age, I cannot pick up another job and so I carry on,’ he said. At least 50 such cutters in Palakkarai would get to work during election season and prepare hundreds of stencils. ‘In our heyday, we would sell 100 stencils per day. We would work day and night to finish the orders on time. Nowadays, however, we have no orders,’ he said. There was a time when we would all hand hang our stencils outside our shops to welcome customers, he added. A large stencil - 3 feet in size - would go for Rs. 1500 while a smaller one at Rs. 900. Until the restrictions were enforced by the Election Commission of India, candidates and political parties would spend a considerable amount on buying stencils to draw wall paintings to popularise their election symbols among voters. For the stencil cutters, this would mean substantial revenue for a few months. The stencil which would be used to paint walls and hoardings would give a standard size and dimension, which would be made across the city and were more popular in rural parts. Mr. Shanmugham has at least 100 designs of stencils. Some even have the names of some popular leaders in the parties and slogans. ‘These are all made over the last few years. However, I have sold none so far this year,’ he said. Many party workers have taken his contact number over the last few weeks but are yet to place any orders, he rued. ‘I hope they will come after the names of candidates are announced,’ he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stencil-makers-keep-their-fingers-crossed/article33984613.ece

According to sources, the school authorities reportedly tried to transport school bags, which were meant for distribution to students of 64 schools in Tiruchi.

The officials put all bags in a room and sealed it. A revenue official said that no attempt was made to distribute the bags to voters.

However, accepting the demand of the people, the bags were kept in a separate room and sealed. It would be opened only after the State elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/room-in-a-school-sealed/article33984611.ece
04 March 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Using Thanjavur painting to empower women||Aspirants are learning the nuances of Thanjavur painting at a workshop conducted by a city artist who hopes to inspire women to earn a living during their free time. Daughter of L. Ramanujam, an acclaimed practitioner and certified teacher of Thanjavur painting, R. Lavanya took over Sri Ranga Tanjore Art Gallery, set up by her father, on Amma Mandapam Road at Srirangam in 2018. She won the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Tamil Nadu government in 2014. “My father taught me the skills as a child, but I did not think much of it. In 2014, I returned to the gallery and saw women learning the craft and earning through it. Inspired, I too began teaching. In the last two years, I teach while Appa looks on from the sidelines,” she said. With her new found responsibility, Ms. Lavanya hopes to empower women. Many approach the classes while in financial distress. For them, she teaches free of any fee. “I want to make my students financially independent with this craft. Many come without knowing how to sketch. I tell them they do not need any special skills, just an interest and vigour will do,” she said. She believes that women are artistic by nature and express it in many ways — be it cooking, combing their hair, or through beautiful kolam drawings welcoming guests to their houses. Ordinarily, a 50-day course costs Rs. 12,000. Students from other States and cities travel to Srirangam, stay in hostels and learn from Ms. Lavanya. “I have students from as far as the Netherlands now. Of them, at least 50% have taken up Thanjavur painting as a business,” she said. Students are taught from scratch — from preparing the board in the traditional method to framing them so that they need not depend on anyone else.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/using-thanjavur-painting-to-empower-women/article33984599.ece

Speaking to reporters here after taking part in the ‘Vijay Sankalp Yatra,’ he said the Congress was a sinking boat and the DMK was steeped in corruption cases. He said he had visited 75 constituencies in the State so far and there was a lot of enthusiasm towards the BJP and towards nation building. Stating that the BJP had utmost respect for the Tamil culture, he said the party leaders drew good response wherever they visited the State. He said talks with the AIADMK on seat sharing were on and the party would get a sizeable number of seats. He said the Vijay Sankalp Yatras were being conducted at Chennai, Tiruchi, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore and Hosur to seek public support for the BJP and for the success of the party and its allies also. Tamil Nadu had received 6.43 lakh crore during the last six-and-half years for various schemes from the Centre including Rs. 63,000 crore for Chennai metro expansion and over Rs. 1 lakh crore for highways development. Lakhs of farmers benefited from the ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samruddhi Yojana,’ he said adding that 175 welfare schemes of the Centre had been implemented across the country. The country was moving forward in spite of many difficulties, he said adding that the country’s economy was intact notwithstanding the pandemic due to the able and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Vijay Sankalp Yatra commenced near the Chathiram bus stand and culminated near the Devar Hall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/opposition-indulging-in-vote-bank-politics-says-bjp/article33984603.ece

04 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Hospitality sector looks to the poll season for revival||The hotel industry, particularly in tier-II cities, which was staring at a bleak future due to the pandemic, is hopeful of enjoying a better occupancy rate, with the onset of the election season. While business travelers and wedding guests have already started staying in hotels following lockdown relaxations, electioneering by prominent leaders has brought in more occupancy. For instance, when Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami toured the southern districts recently, all premium category hotels in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi enjoyed decent occupancy, with party MLAs and officials occupying rooms. Similarly, the three-day campaign of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ensured relatively good occupancy of rooms. With electioneering gradually moving to top gear, the arrival of top-level leaders for campaigns is expected to increase this month and hence, the occupancy of the rooms is also expected to go up. Hotels in other regions, where high-voltage electioneering happened, too, reported a noticeable increase in occupancy. “Zero occupancy during the lockdown was an agonising experience. After the relaxation, we started receiving guests from Madurai, Chennai, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Now, we have political travellers, which has gradually pushed up our occupancy rate to 60%,” said S.N. Abdul Rahim, corporate front office manager, Hotel Apple Ttree, Tirunelveli, where Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Palaniswami stayed. “The arrival of leaders and their second-rung cadre is likely to keep our industry healthy in the days to come,” he added. Another most sought-after hotel of the political class, Regency GRT, is also getting a decent number of guests since the beginning of electioneering. J. Ambrose, head (operations), Poppys group of Hotels and Resorts, said leaders coming to Madurai for electioneering had started staying there overnight, before proceeding to the southern or central districts for campaigning. “This has come at the right time as it has given us a boost,” he added. General manager of Sathya Parks and Resorts, Thoothukudi, M. Manigandan, too, echoed this view. “VIPs prefer us for the quality we ensure, while others choose budget hotels in Thoothukudi,” he said. Tamil Nadu Hoteliers’ Association secretary R. Srinivasan, however, said as far as room reservations were concerned, the break-even had not yet been reached. Probably, in the next fortnight or so, this should be achievable. When nominations are completed, reservations will pick up, he added. But some hoteliers are averse to the political crowd. “They will always be uncontrollable and we will be helpless in managing them,” said a hotelier, pointing that the COVID-19 situation warranted physical distancing and hand hygiene.

Sudhish, DMDK deputy general secretary and brother-in-law of party founder Vijayakant, on Wednesday said there would have been no trace left of the AIADMK had it not entered into an alliance with the DMDK in the 2011 election. His statement comes in the wake of the DMDK reportedly failing to reach a seat-sharing pact with the AIADMK and consequent indications that the party may go it alone in the upcoming poll. “We forged an alliance with the AIADMK after our cadre and office-bearers requested us to do so. We also won [seats] and became an Opposition party. Today, we are not pleading with the AIADMK. They and many other parties are keen on an alliance with us. This is due to the respect for our party and its founder Vijayakant,” he said. Mr. Sudhish said the alliance would be decided by Mr. Vijayakant in the next few days. “The DMDK should win eight seats to get party recognition and the Murasu symbol. So, the party cadre should work hard,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmdk-leader-sudhish-lashes-out-at-aiadmk/article33984620.ece

04 March 2021||Vellore,TAMIL NADU||Katpadi residents await solution to traffic woes||The construction of a ring road to ease traffic congestion and the setting up of a taluk hospital are the key demands of the residents of the Katpadi Assembly constituency. There are around 2.50 lakh voters in the 20 wards of the constituency, which falls under the Vellore City Municipal Corporation. The busy Katpadi railway station is located on the Cuddalore - Chittoor State Highway. “Traffic is a major problem, especially on the Cuddalore - Chittoor State Highway. There is a need for a ring road, which would ensure that vehicles travelling from Andhra Pradesh to Tiruvannamalai needn’t enter the town. This has to be implemented soon,” said Umesh Kumar of the Jagannatha Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association. Second RoB Some of the residents want a second railway overbridge (RoB) to reduce the traffic congestion on the highway here. “The existing one was constructed in the 1980s. But the number of vehicles has increased dramatically since then, and the existing bridge seems to have become weak. Hence, another RoB would be helpful,” said Kumar Senthil, a resident of Kangeyanallur. Residents have also been highlighting the need for a causeway between Kangeyanallur and Sathuvachari across the Palar. No steps yet “We are having to take a roundabout route to travel between these two places. If there is a causeway, this can be avoided. This has been a long-pending demand of the residents, but no concrete steps have been taken to fulfil it,” said K. Veera Raghavan, another resident of Kangeyanallur. A. Narayanan, CPI(M) district secretariat member, said there was a need for a taluk hospital in Katpadi. “Currently, the residents have to go to the Vellore Medical College Hospital in Adukkamparai or private hospitals for treatment. It would be helpful if we get a taluk hospital in Katpadi as it would help the common man,” he said. An underground sewage system is another demand of the residents. “As of now, sewage is being discharged into the Palar river bed. There is an urgent need to stop this,” Mr. Veera Raghavan added. “There are too many autorickshaws and school buses plying in a small constituency with narrow, clogged roads. The traffic police should regulate them. Despite Vellore having been declared as a smart city, we don’t see any work being carried out in Katpadi. We don’t even have proper streetlights,” said K. Arunachalam, who works at a college in Katpadi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/katpadi-residents-await-solution-to-traffic-woes/article33985350.ece

Addressing the zonal officers here on Wednesday at a training programme, District Returning Officer and District Collector R. Kannan, asked them to find the shortest routes connecting the polling booths under their jurisdiction. Similarly, they were asked to compile the alternative route to polling stations. The officials should remove all party flag poles, banners and wall posters in the vicinity of the polling stations. The polling officers should be provided adequate training to properly handle the electronic voting machines and they should be knowledgeable about the documents and other materials to be taken along with the EVMs to the polling booths on the eve of polling day. District Revenue Officer R. Mangalaramasubramanian, Sub Collector C. Dinesh Kumar, and other officers were present. Meanwhile, the flying squad for Sivakasi Assembly Constituency, led by its officer, S. Prabhakaran, seized Rs. 3.90 lakh during a vehicle check conducted at Sukravarpatti junction on Wednesday. K. Madasamy, who was carrying the amount, could not produce any valid document for the cash and hence it was seized. In another seizure, the Static Surveillance Team of Virudhunagar Assembly constituency on Alagapuri Road here seized Rs. 1 lakh from a blue metal operator. Though, he claimed that he was taking the money for distribution of salary to workers, the seized money was handed over to sub-treasury for want of proper documents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/zonal-officers-asked-to-ensure-basic-amenities-at-polling-stations/article33984672.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Huge scam in LED street light fitting: DYFI||Quoting a response from Madurai Corporation under the Right to Information Act, Madurai district secretary of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) S. Karthik on Wednesday alleged a huge scam in installation of LED street lights under THE Smart City Project. In a statement, Mr. Karthik said he received the response for specific questions on the issue after an inordinate delay of 71 days. According to the Corporation, it spent Rs. 30.25 crore on LED street lights out of Rs. 1,000 crore sanctioned for Smart City Project. Stating that the working of 30,377 LED street lights fixed in 78 wards in the city was a different question, Mr. Karthik wondered why the urban local body chose to ignore 22 wards, mostly in newly added areas, to provide the energy-efficient lights. While the tender was awarded to Sabari Electricals at Ambattur in Chennai, Mr. Karthik said he could not understand as to why the government chose to buy goods worth Rs. 30 crore from a dealer rather than directly from the manufacturer. While the RTI response listed out LED lights of six different wattages, the rate was mentioned only for 20W category. “The total cost of 20W lights till fitting has been given as Rs. 2,304.50 each. Even if it is accepted at face value, the cost of each light with fitment charge by employing two workers for a full day will not be so high,” Mr. Karthik said. Among the total number of LED street lights, a majority of them (18,380) were of 20W. “Even if the calculation is made based on their claim, the total cost can be be only Rs. 4.23 crore, which could be the cost of only three-fifth of the total number of lights,” he charged. The remaining 12,000 street lights cost the Corporation Rs. 26 crore, which meant that each light worked out to a cost of Rs. 21,666. Stating that the smart city projects in the State were executed in the absence of an elected body, he sought re-estimation of all projects to bring out such corruption. Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan had sought from Corporation officials ward-wise details of the LED street light work during the Smart City Advisory Panel meet that was scheduled to be held on January 18. However, Collector T. Anbalagan cancelled the meeting citing administrative reasons. Mr. Venkatesan then expressed doubts over the expenditure on LED lighting based on the reply he received from Parliament and, hence, wanted to discuss it at the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/huge-scam-in-led-street-light-fitting-dyfi/article33985246.ece

The new BG single line in Madurai-Usilampatti section was cleared for traffic in January last and the next stretch between Usilampatti and Andipatti was completed in December. Now, railway officials have completed track linking work between Andipatti and Theni for 17 km. “Manual packing of ballast has been completed. Before the ballast packing machinery is run on the newly laid track, the track linking work has to be formally tested with a trial run,” a railway official said. Hundreds of rail users and members of public thronged Theni railway station to accord a grand reception to the maiden run of locomotive on the new track. They also rained flower petals on the engine. The rolling of locomotive is an indication to the railway headquarters of completion of rail linking work. Since no train is being operated in the Madurai-Andipatti section till now, railway officials sought police help to regulate traffic on the level crossings during the trial run. After two more rounds of ballast packing, the track will be ready for inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety. The remaining work between Theni and Bodi will be taken up in the next fiscal. Removal of encroachment along the track alignment is to be taken up to facilitate work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/locomotive-trial-run-conducted-in-andipatti-theni-section/article33984667.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK firmly against Sasikala; not our concern, says BJP||The AIADMK on Wednesday reiterated its opposition to re-admitting V.K. Sasikala, former interim general secretary and aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, into the ruling party, and bringing the AMMK, led by her nephew and R.K. Nagar legislator T.T.V. Dhinakaran, into the party fold. In a related development, the BJP national general secretary in charge of Tamil Nadu, C.T. Ravi and BJP president L. Murugan said the national party had nothing to do with the matter. Addressing the media at the AIADMK headquarters, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar categorically stated that as Chief Minister and party co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami had said in New Delhi in January, there was “no chance” of taking back Ms. Sasikala and the AMMK. To persistent queries whether the BJP was applying pressure on the AIADMK with regard to the Sasikala-AMMK factor, the Minister denied such reports. “So far, they [BJP] have not interfered in the internal affairs of my party. Even if they have made any suggestion, we have rejected it. No one can pressure us,” he said. The Minister claimed that the issue did not crop up during Sunday night’s meeting, in which Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the Chief Minister and his deputy O. Panneerselvam took part. Mr. Jayakumar ridiculed the statement of Mr. Dhinakaran that all those opposed to the DMK could join the coalition to be headed by the AMMK. Separately, Mr. Ravi said, “They [AIADMK leaders] know about Sasikala and Dhinakaran’s strengths and weaknesses. They both — EPS [Mr. Palaniswami] and OPS [Mr. Panneerelvam] — are able to take a decision. They are the larger party in the alliance, and they will decide.” Mr. Murugan said, “We are not involved. This is an internal matter between the AIADMK and the AMMK.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-firmly-against-sasikala-not-our-concern-says-bjp/article33985111.ece

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Stalemate in AIADMK, DMK camps||Among the factors cited for the delay was the reported insistence of the BJP on certain constituencies, which irked the AIADMK. The BJP’s wish list included Mylapore, Alandur, Palladam, Kinathukadavu, Coimbatore (South), Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni and Rajapalayam. Though the AIADMK knew it had to sacrifice some seats regarded as its strongholds, it appears to have been surprised by the attitude of the BJP. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam held talks with senior party colleagues during the day, but no solution was in sight. Actor Vijayakant’s DMDK added to the confusion, with second-line leader L.K. Sudhish claiming that only the AIADMK was pleading for an alliance with his party. The AIADMK had offered the DMDK 15 seats, but the latter insisted on 20. In the evening, the two parties were supposed to have one more round of discussions, but they didn’t take place. A TMC(M) delegation met Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani and his colleague, P. Thangamani, in the morning. It wanted 12 seats, whereas the AIADMK was willing to spare only three. DMK camp Not satisfied with the DMK’s offer of 18 seats, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said the ball was in the DMK’s court. Leaders of another ally, the VCK, who were supposed to participate in talks, did not turn up at Anna Arivalayam, the DMK headquarters. "We are in touch with the DMK leadership. They have conveyed that they would enhance the offer from four to six seats," a VCK source said. The DMK may make a similar offer to the two Left parties. CPI(M) sources said the next round of talks would take place only after an invitation from the DMK. In the meantime, CPI State secretary R. Mutharasan said there was no truth to reports that the seat-sharing talks were on the verge of collapse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalemate-in-aiadmk-dmk-camps/article33984653.ece

04 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Supporters stage protest in Gokak||Gokak, the hometown of Ramesh Jarkiholi, BJP MLA and former Minister, witnessed hectic activity on Wednesday, following allegations of his involvement in a sex scandal and subsequent resignation. His supporters and members of the BJP Yuva Morcha took out a protest rally and enforced a bandh of the major markets. The protesters stoned two NWKRTC buses. Rare event However, in a rare event for the town, there was a protest against the eldest of the Jarkiholi clan, demanding his resignation too earlier. The JD(S) workers organised a protest in Gokak on Wednesday demanding Mr. Jarkiholi’s resignation. Ashok Pujari, senior JD(S) leader who had lost the last Assembly elections against Mr. Jarkiholi, led the protest. “Gokak has had few protests against the Jarkiholi brothers. But we have organised a few protests against the brothers whenever they made mistakes. We have tried to create awareness among the people about the brothers,” said Ashfaq Madaki, JD(S) leader. On the other hand, Mr. Jarkiholi’s supporters said they were shocked at the allegations. Bhimshi Bharamannanavar of BJP Yuva Morcha and a close confidante of the former Minister told The Hindu that he had fallen victim to a “political conspiracy” and his opponents have done this to malign him. “We cannot believe that the BJP leadership would demand his resignation over such flimsy allegations,” he said. They warned that they would intensify the agitation if Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa accepted the resignation. Some supporters performed puja and abhisheka (milk shower) to a cutout of Mr. Jarkiholi. Four supporters tried to douse themselves in kerosene and immolate in front of the crowd, but were prevented by police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/supporters-stage-protest-in-gokak/article33984730.ece

04 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Senior citizens forced to wait for hours to get vaccinated||The cumbersome process of registering for the vaccine is just the first hurdle in the long road to getting vaccinated. The CoWIN portal or the Arogya Setu app which senior citizens have to log on to to schedule an appointment does not give a time slot, as a result of which they find themselves waiting for as long as five hours to get their first shot. The limited number of vaccine centres only exacerbates the problem. Hospital staff say they are helpless as the glitches in the CoWIN portal are further adding to the delay. To avoid long queues, senior citizens are rushing to hospitals early in the morning in the hope that they will get their shot quickly. However, more often than not, many who come in the morning at 10 a.m. said that they were able to get vaccinated and leave the hospital only by 3 p.m. This includes the half an hour they spend under observation. A 64-year-old lawyer who received his jab at a private hospital in North Bengaluru said that over 60 senior citizens and their families had gathered at the hospital. It took him nearly two hours just to complete the registration process. “I had to spend close to four hours in the hospital. We have been so careful all these days and such a long wait time in the hospital for senior citizens is not ideal. The government must schedule time slots,” he said. The prolonged wait is adding to anxiety levels. “We have been very careful till now, and we do not want to be exposed to the virus at the hospital,” said another senior citizen. In some instances, those who had appointments scheduled on Wednesday were forced to go back without getting vaccinated as hospitals had limited doses. Sandeep Rao, who had scheduled a vaccination for his 65-year-old father at K.C. General Hospital, said that when they went at 1 p.m, they saw nearly 60 senior citizens waiting. “We were told to come back tomorrow. This happened although I had got an appointment for my father’s vaccination for Wednesday,” he said. Hospitals are yet to streamline the process. In some centres, the registration process is set up at the hospital reception desk, and the verification, right before they receive the jab. In others, both senior citizens, those over 45 with comorbidities and regular patients were asked to wait in the same queue for registration. Many hospitals were issuing tokens. Prasanna H.M., president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), cited glitches in the CoWIN portal and lack of time slots as the reason for why people have to wait for hours on end. “Normally, to vaccinate around 100 people, we need only three hours. But because of the glitches in the CoWIN portal, the same process is taking close to eight hours,” he said. K. Sudhakar, Health and Family Welfare Minister and Medical Education Minister, said he would look into the issue and ensure that senior citizens are not burdened by the vaccination process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/senior-citizens-forced-to-wait-for-hours-to-get-vaccinated/article33984717.ece
04 March 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||CD scandal pulls the rug from under the kingmaker’s feet||The episode of video clips containing intimate moments of Ramesh Jarkiholi with a woman and the police complaint that he abused her with the offer of a job in KPTCL have pulled the rug from under the feet of the Minister, who was emerging strong as a “kingmaker”. Mr. Jarkiholi, who was known for his political and business network in Belagavi till a year ago, caught the attention of the State when he played a crucial role in bringing down the erstwhile JD(S)-Congress coalition government by engineering defections of 17 MLAs from the ruling parties. The enigmatic politician-cum-business tycoon, turned a kingmaker when he switched to the BJP from the Congress. He not only became a Minister with a plum portfolio like Major and Medium irrigation, but also a rallying point for most of the defectors who became Ministers. This had upset the party old-timers who had begun to feel that a new political order comprising defectors had started overtaking them. His recent remarks that he could get five senior MLAs from the Congress to quit and join the BJP was being seen in party circles as a clear indication that he wanted to expand his political support base. This had created unease among BJP leaders who felt that his political ambition may turn out to be a threat for their own political careers. The BJP old guard, though concerned about the scandal denting the image of the party, appear to be heaving a sigh of relief with the exit of Mr. Jarkiholi from the ministry. They also feel his exit would make it easy for the new Ministers to gel well with the party organisation as so far most of them were under his control. ‘Relief for CM’ In fact, a leader close to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa felt that Mr. Jarkiholi’s exit may bring relief to the Chief Minister himself as the new Ministers will now have to come to him directly instead of the earlier practice of approaching Mr. Jarkiholi. BJP insiders feel that Mr. Jarkiholi’s exit may give them freedom to strengthen the party organisation in Belagavi, which has second highest number of Assembly seats after Bengaluru.  The BJP old guard, though concerned about the scandal denting the party’s image, feel Mr. Jarkiholi’s exit will make it easy for the new Ministers to gel well with the organisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cd-scandal-pulls-the-rug-from-under-the-kingmakers-feet/article33984733.ece
04 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Committee to look into reservation matrix||With many communities seeking reservation in government jobs and admissions to educational institutions, the Karnataka Cabinet on Wednesday decided to set up a high-level committee headed by a retired High Court judge to study demands made by communities/castes seeking changes in the existing quota matrix. The three-member committee will also have a retired administrator and a social scientist. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has been empowered to appoint members of the panel, Minister for Home, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Basavaraj Bommai told reporters after the Cabinet meeting. ‘Challenging issue’ “Reservation is a challenging issue. We require experts’ opinion. This committee will look into current demands and possible future demands,” the Minister said. The Cabinet decision would help the government to not only pacify the agitating communities, but also buy time on the issue. While leaders of the Kuruba community have held rallies seeking the Scheduled Tribe tag, seers and leaders of Panchamasali Lingayat community took out padayatra to Bengaluru demanding reservation under category 2A of the OBC list. Panchamasali Lingayat community’s demand has been referred to the State backward classes commission. An anthropological study is under way to look into the Kuruba demand. 50% ceiling “When we look at all these demands, the overall quota will exceed the 50% ceiling mandated by the Supreme Court. In instances where some States have proposed to exceed this cap, the apex court has given stay orders or has rejected such decisions,” Mr. Bommai said. Current matrix Currently, the State provides 32% reservation for OBCs, 15% for SCs and 3% for STs, totalling to 50%. The H.N. Nagamohan Das Commission had recommended to the government to increase reservation for SCs from 15% to 17% and STs from 3% to 7.5%. Mr. Bommai said the Veerasahaiva-Lingayats and Vokkaligas have also been demanding inclusion of their communities in the Union list of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) to get benefits in Central government jobs and educational institutions. On November 27, 2020, the Cabinet deferred a decision on recommending to the Centre the inclusion of the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community in the Union list of OBCs, apparently under the pressure from the Centre as well as some Cabinet Ministers. Currently, Veerashaiva-Lingayat and Vokkaliga communities, politically dominant in the State, are included in the Karnataka’s OBC list.  Scrapped The Cabinet scrapped a programme of providing Rs. 5,000 incentive for government servants who attain computer literacy, since many people with computer literacy join service now. It was decided that AICTE pay scale would be given for faculty members of AYUSH colleges in the State. The Cabinet decided to amend the Karnataka Maritime Board to nominate the Chief Minister as its chairman instead of the Chief Secretary. The Minister for Ports would be the deputy chairman, Mr. Bommai said.  Other Cabinet decisions Rs. 18.5 crore for installation of CCTV cameras in 281 police stations Revised pay scale for clerical and lower rank staff in lower courts Rs. 59 cr. to set up a hostel in Bengaluru for Kalyana Karnataka region students Rs. 18.4 cr. for civil court in Bangarpet in Kolar district Rs. 457 cr. for filling 17 tanks in Maski taluk of Raichur district||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/committee-to-look-into-reservation-matrix/article33984725.ece
04 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. sets up company to manage waste||With the State’s richest civic body, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), finding it difficult to manage the growing city’s solid waste, the State Cabinet on Wednesday decided to establish a separate entity, the Bengaluru Solid Waste Management Company. It will be responsible for collecting, transporting, and processing waste to produce energy. While the BBMP will invest 51% in the newly formed organisation, the State government will contribute the remaining. The additional chief secretary will be the CEO of the company. Briefing journalists after a Cabinet meeting, chaired by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Minister for Home and Law and Parliamentary Affairs Basavaraj Bommai said that the company would give focused attention to the mounting garbage. The city generates nearly 5,500 tonnes of solid waste daily, of which 4,500 tonnes is produced by households, he said. The company will have jurisdiction over the city areas and the Bengaluru Urban district, he said. When the idea was first mooted last year, it received a mixed response with many former councillors in the Congress criticising the move. At that time, the former leader of the Opposition in BBMP council Abdul Wajid (Congress) had pointed out that it would cut into the autonomy of the civic body. Of the seven solid waste management plants on the outskirts of the city, three — in Lingadheeranahalli, Seegehalli and Subbarayanapalya — have been shut for months on end. While a case pertaining to Lingadheeranahalli is being heard at the National Green Tribunal, there is a lot of opposition by the local communities living near the Subbarayanapalya and Seegehalli plants. The other plants have been functioning at more than half their installed capacity, data shows. Three plants are to generate power out of waste, of which one has started functioning, Mr. Bommai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-sets-up-company-to-manage-waste/article33985078.ece
04 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Concerns in city over restoration process of Doddakallasandra lake||Citizens and volunteers have raised concerns about the way in which Doddakallasandra lake is being restored, pointing out that work is not being done with an ecological perspective. The restoration work for Doddakallasandra lake was taken up in July last year. In February this year, ActionAid, with support from 10 student volunteers, conducted a lake bed assessment. Objective of exercise The objective of the exercise was to understand the gradient from foreshore (a corner of the lake area where water enters the lake) to the bund region (where water is stored), and from the margins to island and bund region, ActionAid said. “Foreshore region height should be suitable for shallow waters as per N.K. Patil Committee report, but it starts at 6 to 8 feet deep. It does not leave any room for shallow waters, thereby losing up to 70% of the bird diversity. The area around the island region seems to be not desilted appropriately maintaining the gradient,” they said, sharing their observations. History of bird species According to the volunteers, Doddakallasandra lake, with documented history of rich bird species, may not be the same after its rejuvenation. Situated in south Bengaluru, as per the ActionAid Biodiversity Report, the lake hosts 354 trees of 42 species, 43 species of plants and shrubs, 37 species of butterflies and 71 bird species, of which 11 are migratory birds and two are considered nearly extinct under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature list. Local residents came forward as a group – Doddakallasandra Lake Protection Committee – and submitted suggestions in August to make the lake, spread across 21.16 acres, biodiversity-friendly according to the Justice N.K. Patil committee recommendations, but ActionAid has alleged that the authorities concerned – in this case the BBMP – have not been responsive. “As per the Justice N.K. Patil Committee report, desilting should be marginal or shallow at the foreshore and deepest at the bund area. This supports lake ecology as 70% of the bird species thrive in shallow waters,” the release explained, making a case for their observations. Felling of saplings Raghavendra B. Pachhapur, Programme Officer, ActionAid-Bengaluru, said the rejuvenation process also saw felling of close to 250 newly planted tree saplings that were two years old.  As per the Justice N.K. Patil Committee report, desilting should be marginal or shallow at the foreshore and deepest at the bund area. This supports lake ecology as 70% of the bird species thrive in shallow waters ActionAid||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/concerns-in-city-over-restoration-process-of-doddakallasandra-lake/article33985083.ece
04 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||From next week, 60k people to be vaccinated daily||The BBMP plans to increase the number of centres that will be eligible to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. In a press release, BBMP Commissioner Manjunath Prasad said from next week , vaccination will be provided at 107 hospitals (100-beds) as well as 141 BBMP hospitals and referral hospitals in the city. The move will help BBMP vaccinate 60,000 people per day. The release also said thereafter it would target one lakh people per day. According to Mr. Prasad, owing to glitches in CoWIN portal, only 1,063 people could be vaccinated on the first day of the second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination process. On the second day, the number rose to 3,128. The administration targeted 4,600 people for vaccination in 26 hospitals on Wednesday. ASHA workers and others will be roped in to identify people aged above 60 years and those above 45 years with comorbidities in slums as they may not have access to online platforms for registration.

04 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Auto drivers demand fare hike||A day after road transport corporations and anganwadi workers held rallies in the city, autorickshaw drivers and midday meal workers staged protests on Wednesday. Ahead of the budget, scheduled to be announced on March 8, auto drivers took out a rally from KSR Bengaluru railway station to Freedom Park demanding that the State government hike the fare to Rs. 36 for the first two kilometres and Rs. 18 for each subsequent kilometre. The existing fare structure is not sufficient in the backdrop of the steep hike in fuel cost and other expenses, they said. B.V. Raghavendra, president of Federation of Karnataka Auto Rickshaw Drivers Union affiliated to CITU, said that a memorandum has been submitted to the government. Among their other demands are the formation of a welfare board and housing facilities. “Auto drivers cannot afford to rent houses in the city, and are forced to find accommodation on the outskirts. In the past, announcements had been made about providing housing facilities, but nothing has been implemented,” he said. The protesters also demanded that Transport Department issue fitness certificates to two-stroke autos.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/auto-drivers-demand-fare-hike/article33985080.ece

Sudhakar urging the government to start vaccination centres in all private hospitals in the State that participated in COVID care treatment. In the letter, PHANA president H.M. Prasanna said setting up more centres would help reach out to the target population at the earliest. “It will also avoid the hassle of waiting for senior citizens in the few hospitals that are as of now permitted to start vaccination,” he said.

04 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC: NH 4A widening can continue after Centre extends validity of approval||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday declared that there was no need for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to take prior environmental clearance for widening of national highway 4A from Belagavi in Karnataka to Goa border. The court, however, said the work of widening can be continued only after the Union government extends the validity of its in-principle approval granted earlier under the Forest Conservation Act or grants a fresh approval as the validity of the approval expired on December 31, 2020. Also, the court held that no material has been placed before it to establish that stretches of NH 4A in Karnataka and Goa have been “artificially divided” to bring length of the highway below 100 km to avoid obtaining of prior environmental clearances under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order while disposing a PIL petition by film-maker and environmentalist Suresh Heblikar and two others. The court said that it cannot grant the relief sought by the petitioners. Meanwhile, the Bench directed the Union government to examine whether the project attracts certain prohibition under the EP Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-nh-4a-widening-can-continue-after-centre-extends-validity-of-approval/article33984724.ece

04 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Mangaluru Mayor promises to issue monthly water bills||The new Mayor, Premananda Shetty, said here on Wednesday that the city corporation will take steps for issuing water bills monthly. Speaking to presspersons after taking charge along with the Deputy Mayor Sumangalam he said that the corporation presently has 60 multi-purpose workers (MPWs). Commissioner of the corporation Akshy Sridhar has suggested that the civic body could hire 30 more workers. With 90 MPWs the corporation can issue water bills monthly. With regard to the MPWs issuing abnormal bills to some consumers, he said that the workers have been apprised to be careful while issuing the bills. If there is any fault in water meter or the meter is not clearly visible for reading, they have been instructed to exercise the option of recording ‘meter not reading’ or ‘legible’ options while issuing the bills to consumers without charging abnormally. This provides the consumers an option to correct the meters. In such cases, they have been instructed to issue the bills by calculating the quantity of water used on average basis based on the previous bill issued. The Mayor said that with the ‘Jalasiri’ project to ensure round-the-clock water supply being taken up in the city he will review its progress monthly. To a question on ‘raja kaluves’ being encroached upon in some places, the Mayor said that the civic body has conducted a survey of those major stormwater drains using drones in eight wards. If encroachments are visible steps will be taken to remove them. Asked about the newly built Urwa Market complex not being put into use fully, Mr. Shetty said that the Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (MUDA), which has constructed the building for the corporation by availing loan, and the city corporation are working out the modalities of taking over, allotment of shops, maintenance aspectsl, and repayment of loan. The MUDA has put forth two proposals which would be discussed and finalised. Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyasa Kamath said that the issues related to the funding pattern has delayed the progress of Mallikatta and Kankanady market complex projects. The administration in the city corporation earlier should have entered into a tripartite agreement comprising the city corporation, bank, and the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) to finalise the funding pattern before taking up those projects. It was not done. The previous administration took up the project in a hurry without clarity on the funding pattern. Now, a new funding pattern has been worked out without availing loan from any bank. The approval of the Cabinet for it is awaited. The KUIDFC will bear 70% of the project cost through loan to be given to the civic body. Earlier its share had been worked out at 30%. The balance 30% would be borne by the corporation by augmenting the amount from various sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangaluru-mayor-promises-to-issue-monthly-water-bills/article33985256.ece
04 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Talapady residents protest against buses ending trips before toll plaza||Residents of Talapady and surrounding areas on Wednesday formed a human chain to force private city buses to end and commence their trips from Talapady village even as they protested hefty toll charges being proposed for the city buses. Private city buses plying between State Bank and Talapady had stopped crossing the toll plaza of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to reach Talapady village as the operators were asked to pay regular toll charges. Buses were parked just before the toll plaza while passengers were forced to walk all the way, nearly 1 km, to avail bus services. While villagers under the banner of the Talapady Tollgate Horata Samiti demanded buses cross the plaza and conduct their operations from the designated bus stand, operators refused to do so as the plaza operators demanded Rs. 260 per one way trip. Residents formed a human chain at the make-shift bus stop near the plaza preventing buses from being parked at the spot. With the intervention of the Ullal Police, plaza operators allowed buses to cross the plaza without collecting any charges for a day. Dilraj Alva, president of DK Bus Operators’ Association, the umbrella body of private city bus operators, told The Hindu that the association had held innumerable meetings with representatives of Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt., Ltd., the National Highways Authority of India, and the district administration. Every bus conducts seven to eight round trips a day. Promising to offer 40% discount, Navayuga calculated every round trip as two trips and demanded Rs. 30,000 a month per bus. This would cause immense hardship to bus operators. While the association had proposed to make a lump sum payment of Rs. 2 lakh in advance every month for all buses, the company was yet to respond, he said. The continued logjam has been affecting bus operators as well as travelling public, Mr. Alva regretted demanding immediate intervention of the district administration in the matter. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said he called a meeting of all the stakeholders to resolve the issue on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/talapady-residents-protest-against-buses-ending-trips-before-toll-plaza/article33985254.ece

Physician Hansraj Alva, who is a resident of Doctors Colony, said that the doctors in the colony got the embankment of the pond constructed 13 years ago when the pond was in the form of a puddle. “For almost seven years this pond had crystal clear water and we could see good number of fishes. We have spotted good number of migratory birds here,“ he said. The pollution of the pond started with the construction of a 34-floor apartment complex in the nearby area. “The big building has literally cut off the perennial water source for the lake,” he said and expressed concern over dumping of plastic in the lake. “We need to be serious on preserving water bodies,” Dr. Alva said. Agreeing with Dr. Alva, MUDA Chairman Ravishankar Mijar said it is necessary to stop encroachment and pollution of lakes. “MUDA is reviving some identified lakes and make sure the water in these water bodies serve drinking water needs. We need cooperation of people in achieving this objective,” he said. The MUDA will remove silt, construct a walking track, and take up other beautification works at the Kadri Kaibattalu pond at an estimated cost of Rs. 1 crore. Similar works will be taken up at Jogimath pond at an estimated cost of Rs. 50 lakh. Mr. Mijar said he has asked Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra to take steps for clearing encroachments before handing over 197 waterbodies in the city to the authority for development. Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath and Mayor Premanand Shetty also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/muda-takes-up-rejuvenation-of-kadri-kaibattalu-pond/article33985261.ece

With several people ending their lives by jumping from the bridge, the MUDA recently finished fencing either sides of the two bridges. According to Akbar Pasha, Assistant Executive Engineer, MUDA, each of the CCTV cameras has a range of 500 metres. The CCTV cameras have been installed in a way to catch the movement on each of the two 1 km bridges. These CCTV cameras are connected to police wireless control system at Kankanady Police Station. The MUDA has spent Rs. 5 lakh for the installation, he said. Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath and MUDA Chairman Ravishankar Mijar on Wednesday launched the service.

04 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Mangaluru police begin month-long fitness regime||Continuing the healthy living initiative launched by the city police, 76 men and women police began a month-long fitness improvement programme on Wednesday. The police have tied up with a private fitness centre for the programme. Father Muller Hospital has provided its conference hall, indoor stadium, gymnasium and ground for the personnel. Inaugurating the programme, Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said the personnel are fit when they join the force. With hectic work schedules and personal responsibilities, they find it hard to maintain this in service. Long hours of duty, irregular eating habits, and lack of sleep takes a toll. To provide an opportunity to maintain their fitness, the city police started this fitness programme. Men weighing over 90 kg and women over 70 kg will take part. Mr. Kumar said 120 personnel were found in this category. Those from Mulky and Moodbidri police stations expressed difficulty in coming to the city and said they will do workouts locally. Some backed out for personal reasons. “Now 76 personnel are taking part in the programme in the city where they will be doing different workouts every day between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m.,” Mr. Kumar said and added, "Let this be a model for other police units to emulate." Kambala runner Shrinivas Gowda asked personnel to follow fitness tips by experts. Other programmes A few days ago, city police organised two-day health awareness and entertainment programme for women personnel and the Assistant Sub Inspectors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangaluru-police-begin-month-long-fitness-regime/article33985263.ece

04 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Yogeshwar’s warning to industries||Industries have been warned of legal action and prosecution if they operate without letter of consent from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. At a ‘consent mela’ held in the city on Wednesday Minister for Tourism, Environment and Ecology C.P. Yogeshwar said that out of nearly 6 lakh small-scale industries in the State, only 1 lakh had obtained the letter from the Pollution Control Board and the remaining were out of the “consent net’’. He said the board had launched a drive to get the industries enrolled for the mela and get the letter of consent. So far over 2,500 units had been issued the letter across the State since the last few weeks. Mr. Yogeshwar said he had instructed the officials to bring all the registered industrial units under the “consent net’’. This was mandated under the existing laws in times of global warming and the imperatives of fighting the scourge of pollution while the Pollution Control Board was also answerable to the National Green Tribunal which had issued notices to it. The Minister assured the KASSIA members that the government would review the revision in fee for issuing letter of consent. “We are not here to extort money from the industries. The government has received objections from the entrepreneurs on the revision in the consent fee which is based on the quantum of investment. The government will take another look into it and hold discussions with stakeholders and officials.’’ He said entrepreneurs had questioned the logic behind linking consent fee to the quantum of investment made. The Minister said his attention was drawn to the fact that green technology which reduces pollution and increases efficiency entails higher investment. But linking consent fee to the quantum of investment made acted as a disincentive and discouraged entrepreneurs from opting for new and latest technology. There is merit in this argument and the government will review the same. He also announced that till the consent fee was reviewed by the government the Pollution Control Board would be directed to levy the rate that existed before the revision came into effect. Srinivasulu, Member Secretary, KSPCB, asked the entrepreneurs to make use of the consent mela and obtain the letters. He said the ongoing mela indicates that a majority of the industries were operating all these days without consent letters. The board is going out of its way to issue the letters and the industries should make the best use of it failing which they were liable for criminal prosecution. Members of KASSIA, Mysuru unit, Mysuru Industries Association, Hebbal Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yogeshwars-warning-to-industries/article33985284.ece
04 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||‘India’s cancer burden to touch 1.57 million by 2025’||India’s cancer burden could increase from 1.39 million to 1.57 million by 2025, according to the recently published report of National Cancer Registry Programme 2020. Citing the report, doctors from Manipal Hospitals, Bengaluru, who had a live interaction with journalists in Mysuru recently, said cancer was a leading cause of death and disability globally and pointed out that breasts, lungs and cervix were among the most common sites of cancer in India. Somashekar, Chairman,Surgical Oncology, Manipal Hospitals, said the risk of developing cancer depends on a range of factors including behavioural, genetic and environmental. Identifying tobacco use as one of the behavioural factors, he said tobacco-related cancer was likely to account for 27.1 per cent cases in India in 2020. Excess body weight, alcohol intake, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity also figured among the behavioural risk factors. Even though the last Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) 2016-17 had shown a dip in use of tobacco in the country, Dr. Somashekar said the impact of this decline is unlikely to affect the future burden of tobacco-related cancers upto 2022. During their interaction with the journalists, the team of experts from Manipal Hospitals sought to highlight the importance of cancer awareness and how it helps in diagnosing the disease at an early stage. “For example, patients with colon cancer have a 5-year survival rate of 91% if detected early and which reduces to just 11% due to a delayed diagnosis. Thus, it is important not to take symptoms lightly. And to consult your doctor if you are concerned about the symptoms. Early detection of cancer improves survival and quality of life”, said a statement issued by the hospital. Managing the risks results in significant reduction in cancer incidences. Public awareness about cancer helps in identification and management of these risks through screening tests and lifestyle modification, said the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/indias-cancer-burden-to-touch-157-million-by-2025/article33985289.ece
04 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Declining trend of COVID-19 continues in Mysuru||Notwithstanding the threat of “second wave“ lurking over parts of the country, COVID-19 has continued its downward spiral in Mysuru. During February 2021, the number of COVID-19 positive cases was just 662, the lowest monthly tally since pandemic had reached a peak in September 2020 when it reported 16,569 cases in a month. Also declining was the mortality due to COVID-19, which stood at four deaths during February 2021, compared to a high of 302 reported during August 2020. The number of active cases in Mysuru stood at 205 on February 28, which was a steep decline from a high of around 8,200 in early October 2020. Four months The decline has been gradual over the last four months. Despite a surge in neighbouring Kerala, with whom Mysuru district shares a border, there had been no rise in the infections in Mysuru. Chidambara, vector-borne diseases control officer of Mysuru, who is now monitoring COVID-19 testing and training in the district, told The Hindu early intervention by screening the visitors from Kerala helped the health authorities identify a few cases and control the spread to a certain extent. The number of people crossing the border with Kerala was more in Dakshina Kannada than Mysuru. There has been no such surge even in Mangaluru region, he pointed out. Testing reduced Meanwhile, the authorities have also brought down the number of COVID-19 tests in Mysuru district in view of the decline in infected cases. Dr. Chidambara said the target for testing for Mysuru has been revised by the State government. Against the daily target of 4,500 till early this year, it had now been brought down to 3,000. The authorities were reaching about 80 per cent of the daily target and were testing anywhere between 2,600 to 2,800 per day. Dr. Chidambara said COVID-19, which had assumed pandemic proportions earlier, was now on the way to becoming endemic. Better prepared Though COVID-19 will be around like H1N1, it may not assume pandemic proportions as the virus would have become less virulent and due to herd immunity, he said. Also, doctors are now better prepared and equipped to handle the cases. However, he emphasised the need for continuing the precautions. “We are not in a position to say you can remove your masks,” he said while referring to the spike in cases in many other parts of the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/declining-trend-of-covid-19-continues-in-mysuru/article33984716.ece

04 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||‘Curb pollution of rivers now’||Officials came under flak for their failure to take measures to reduce pollution in the rivers flowing through the districts at a review meeting held here on Wednesday. Minister for Tourism, Environment and Ecology C.P. Yogeshwar said that failure to initiate measures to curb the pollution levels will result in action against the officials. “You have been cautioned once and if there were no initiatives to reduce the pollution levels you will be held accountable’’, the Minister warned. At the review meeting of the rejuvenation of polluted stretches of rivers Lakshmanteertha, Kabini and Cauvery, the Minister was apprised of the measures taken. A 10-km stretch of Lakshmanteertha from Hunsur to Kattemalalvadi, a 50-km stretch of the Cauvery from Ranganathittu to Sathyagala, and a 9-km stretch of Kabini from Nanjangud to Hejjige were identified as priority areas to reduce the pollution levels. The National Green Tribunal had issued directions to prepare an action plan so as to reduce the pollution levels in the rivers to make them fit for at least bathing. The NGT had also issued a directive to constitute a river rejuvenation committee from the State to submit and review the action plans apart from constitution of a special environment surveillance task force in the district. DPR prepared The Minister was informed that a DPR for Rs. 26.80 crore has been prepared by KUWS &DB to divert the sewage from the stormwater drain entering into the river, upgradation of existing UGD networks and upgradation of the sewage treatment plant in Hunsur. Though similar DPRs have been prepared for combating pollution in the Cauvery, the DPR for mitigatory measures at Srirangapatna and Bannur were yet to be approved by the government. At T.Narsipur, a sewage treatment plant and diversion of sewage has been planned while there is a proposal to upgrade the existing STP at Kollegal so as to reduce the pollution levels in the river. Similar initiatives are also in the pipeline for treating pollution in the Kabini at Nanjangud but the overall progress was far from satisfactory, as per the presentation. The Minister also took exception to the practice of landfilling as a measure to handle solid waste generated in urban areas. He said another review meeting will be held after 3 months by when the entry of sewage to the rivers should have been stopped.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/curb-pollution-of-rivers-now/article33985286.ece

Dhruvanarayan. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Tuesday evening, Mr. Dhruvanarayan, who had also been appointed as observer for the mayoral polls, said the party was trying to convince the JD(S) to support it for the Mayor’s post as per the earlier understanding between the two. On the day of the polls (February 24), former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah telephoned Mr. Dhruvanarayan and asked him to ensure that the post of Mayor is given to the Congress. When the process of elections had started, KPCC President D.K. Shivakumar too called Mr. Dhruvanarayan and informed him that the JD(S) had agreed to cede the post of Mayor to Congress. Mr .Dhruvanarayan passed on the information to former Mayor Ayub Khan and Tanveer Sait in the Council Hall, but the JD(S) leaders denied receiving any such message from their leaders. During this period, the voting process had started and Mr. Sait said he had taken a decision to support the JD(S) with a view to preventing the BJP from coming to power, Mr. Dhruvanarayan said. “Though it is a matter of satisfaction that the BJP was prevented from coming to power, Mr. Sait should have taken permission from the KPCC President or me (in his capacity as KPCC observer) before supporting the JD(S),” Mr. Dhruvanarayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sait-should-have-sought-leaders-nod/article33985285.ece

As many as three Congress leaders, including Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee secretary M.S. Viswanathan, resigned from the party in a week owing to discontent. Speaking to mediapersons here on Wednesday, Mr. Viswanathan, who is also a councillor of the Sulthan Bathery Municipality, said that the neglect by the KPCC leadership and the district congress committee of the “Kuruma” community, a major tribal sect in the district, for the past many decades led him to the resignation. Moreover, the party had neglected him in the last two Assembly elections as a candidate from the community, Mr. Viswanathan said. “The DCC leadership in Wayanad is a failure”, Mr. Viswanathan said, adding that the DCC president, who is also the MLA of Sulthan Bathery constituency, bore the full responsibility of the failure. He would join the Communist Party of India (Marxist). LDF leaders were present with Mr. Viswanathan. DCC general secretary and Indian National Trade Union Congress State general secretary P.K. Anil Kumar resigned from the party and joined the Lok Tantrik Janata Dal (LJD) a few days ago. Mr. Kumar, who had previously served as a member of the Wayanad District Panchayat and president of the Kalpetta block panchayat, said he took the decision after he had been sidelined in the party for the past many years and also in protest against the failure of the party to consider local sentiments. Former KPCC member and senior leader of the party, K. K. Viswanathan, had resigned recently after levelling allegations against the district leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/resignation-of-prominent-leaders-rattles-congress-party-in-wayanad/article33984769.ece

According to Forest Department sources, a timber lobby had axed 82 huge rosewood trees, reserved to the government, at 28 sites in the district at low prices by misinterpreting a recent government order. The lobby had dumped 172 cubic metres of rosewood logs at 15 sites spread over nine villages in the district. The massive rosewood felling came to light after the Forest Department officials seized 54 pieces of illegal rosewood timbers worth Rs. 60 lakh from a saw mill at Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district on February 9. The wood was transported from Wayanad to the saw mill without valid documents and the seizure was made on the basis of a tip-off. The rosewood was transported by one Roji Augustine on behalf of a timber company at Vazhavatta in the district and whose owners are now absconding, sources said. “We have shifted 16 cubic metres of rosewood to the depot on Wednesday and the remaining wood will be shifted in the coming days”, South Wayanad Forest Divisional Officer P.

Another was seriously injured. The deceased was identified as Sanil Sathyan, 21, of Karimkunnam in Thodupuzha. He is the 10th accident victim at the infamous curve. The tragedy comes hardly a week after the death of two young motorbike riders. The accident occurred at 6.10 a.m. Sanal Shaji, 21, of Thodupuzha, who rode the bike remains admitted to the intensive care unit at Medical Trust Hospital with head injuries and a fractured leg. The deceased was the second pillion rider, while another pillion rider, Manu, who was sandwiched between the two, escaped unscathed. All three were hostel mates doing a network course at an academy in the city. “They were returning from the Vyttila side to their hostel near Chilavannoor. They might have been speeding and might have failed to manoeuvre the curve, resulting in the skidding of the motorcycle, which is usually how accidents take place in the area. The victim probably got thrown off the vehicle and slammed his head against the road leading to his instant death. It is not clear whether the pillion riders were wearing helmets,” said sources in the South police who registered a case. The most accident-prone spot in the city has now witnessed nine fatal accidents since September 2020. All but one victim (an autorickshaw driver who died after he lost control of his vehicle) were young two-wheeler riders, and all the accidents took place at night, making it the first accident to happen in the area in the morning. In the light of a spree of fatal and non-fatal accidents at the curve between metro pillars 819 and 826, the police had in December 2020 directed Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) to install reflective sign boards and cat’s eye reflectors to enhance the visibility of road markings. The City police have sought the help of the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) to identify potential issues and suggest remedial measures. The police have already increased their presence in the area. The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has also sought the permission of the Traffic Advisory Committee to deploy Artificial Intelligence-aided, number plate recognition, and speed detection cameras at the locale, to rein in accidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/deadly-curve-claims-one-more-life/article33985239.ece

The Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta held that the directions had fallen on deaf ears. “Being a literate State, it is expected that they [government] must be proactive in implementing waste management rules effectively, but that is not reflected in action, as seen from reports filed by the State Pollution Control Board [PCB] and the State Level Monitoring Committee [SLMC] on Solid Waste,” said the order issued by the tribunal on February 25 in the case related to the poor implementation of Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 in the State. The Bench has asked the Chief Secretary to look into the matter and take effective steps for the sake of public health. The authorities are expected to implement the directions of the tribunal to protect the environment, which is a constitutional obligation of the State machinery under Article 48 A of the Constitution, it said. The Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary (Health), and the PCB have been asked to file a report on the implementation of the tribunal’s directions before March 23. On the poor management of biomedical waste at Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, the Bench said, quoting PCB and SLMC reports, that the sewage treatment plant at the hospital had not been functioning properly. Besides, the hospital staff have not been given proper training in scientific handling of biomedical waste, it added. Ambalamedu facility The government institution must be a model for others in implementing waste management rules, and the government must provide all necessary infrastructure and funds, as health is its primary responsibility. The tribunal also asked the government to expedite the commissioning of the biomedical waste management facility at Ambalamedu in Ernakulam under Kerala Enviro Infrastructure Limited.  Being a literate State, Kerala is expected to implement waste management rules effectively, but that is not reflected in action National Green Tribunal||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-comes-under-criticism-from-ngt/article33984835.ece
04 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Thoppumpady harbour at standstill as talks fail||Operations at the Thoppumpady fisheries harbour will continue to be at a standstill with talks between trade unions on sharing of work at the harbour failed on Wednesday. The talks, convened by the district authorities on Wednesday, was inconclusive and will continue on Thursday, said a spokesman for Harbour Vyavasaya Samrakashana Samithi, a combination of harbour stakeholders that include traders and fish buyers as well as utility providers. The operations of the biggest fishing harbour in the State were suspended on Tuesday afternoon after workers belonging to various trade unions argued over work sharing even as dwindling fish catch has continued to shrink the harbour operations, said the samithi spokesperson. The seafood export in Kerala, worth around Rs. 6,000 crore annually, depends to a great extent, on the operations of the Thoppumpady harbour. The seafood processing units both in the southern end of Ernakualam district and those in the northern end of Alappuzha district in Aroor and Chandiroor depend on supplies from the harbour for day-to-day activities. The seafood processing units account for employment of around 5,000 people. The harbour is the base for operation of around 600 gillnet boats, 400 miscellaneous fishing boats and around 100 purseine boats. They employ fishers from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The fishing boat is the lifeline of West Kochi as well as the fish processing units that support the seafood industry, said veteran trade union B. Hamsa of the Cochin Port Labour Union. The stakeholders have called for an immediate resolution of the dispute as it would help resume the harbour operations, which is central to the economic activities in the area. Financial losses The shortage of wild catch has reduced activities at the harbour, which suffered serious financial losses due to the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. The bad weather conditions in 2019 had also reduced the number of fishing days bringing much hardship to the more than 2,000 workers depending on the harbour operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thoppumpady-harbour-at-standstill-as-talks-fail/article33985224.ece
04 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Train fishers in deep sea fishing, says chamber||The Chamber of Kerala Seafood Industry has said that fishers in the State should be provided all help, training and equipment to exploit the country’s deep sea resources now being exploited by foreign trawlers. A spokesman for the chamber said here on Wednesday that seafood processors in the State were facing an extremely lean period with work dwindling sharply because of a big fall in local catch. The industry was sustained mostly by aquaculture in States like Andhra Pradesh. The wild catch had dwindled even though there was great potential for the Indian fishers to exploit the resources. The remarks come in the wake of the controversy over signing of an agreement to build deep sea trawlers for fishing activities. The agreement between the government agency Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation and a U.S.-based company was withdrawn after widespread protests by traditional fishers across the State. The spokesman for the chamber said that an estimate by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute had said that India had the potential to catch about 6.3 lakh tonnes of deep sea squid. The resource was not being exploited because of the constraints and these were being caught by foreign trawlers without any benefit to the Indian fishers and the seafood industry, he said. The deep sea resources do not come nearer to the shore, thereby not enabling the local traditional fishers to exploit the resources, the spokesman said. The depletion in deep sea catch had been most visible since the cyclonic storm Ockhi hit the Indian shores in late 2017. Seafood processors as well as fishers had experienced a steep fall in business since then. The processors have also been at the receiving end of the adverse conditions because they are unable to meet the requirements of the industry, which employs thousands of people across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/train-fishers-in-deep-sea-fishing/article33984836.ece
04 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Aluva, a traditional Cong. citadel||Aluva has largely remained a safe bet for the Congress. A traditional bastion of the United Democratic Front (UDF), the constituency had bucked anti-incumbency and electoral swings to stand firm with the Congress, except for three occasions. In the elections held in 1967, M.K.A. Hameed won as an Independent backed by the CPI(M). K. Mohammed Ali, who had won the constituency six times in a row, was part of the Indian National Congress (U) in the 1980 polls. A breakaway faction of the Congress (I) and led by A.K. Antony, the INC (U) was then an ally of the Left Democratic Front (LDF). The CPI(M) had to wait for nearly two-and-a-half decades to break into the Congress citadel when its candidate A.M. Yousuf defeated Mr. Ali by a margin of 4,366 votes in 2006. The Congress regained control of its traditional stronghold after Anwar Sadath, sitting MLA, defeated Mr. Yousuf by a margin of 13,214 votes in 2011. He retained the seat in 2016 by a margin of 18,835 votes against V. Saleem of the CPI(M). An analysis of the vote share since 2011 revealed a dip for both the UDF and the LDF. From 47.66% in 2006 when Mr. Yousuf, its candidate, had emerged victorious, the LDF vote share went down to 39.9% in 2011, and it further slipped to 34.56% in 2016. The Congress too had something to worry about, as its share dropped from 50.24% in 2011 to 47.39% in 2016. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has gradually increased its vote share since the 2011 elections. From 6.46% in 2011, the coalition had more than doubled its vote share to 13.19% in 2016. The last delimitation had changed the contours of Aluva, and it lost its industrial town status after Eloor and Edayar industrial areas, Kadungalloor grama panchayat, and Kalamassery Municipality were delinked from it. Anwar Sadath is likely to be the UDF candidate for the third consecutive time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/aluva-a-traditional-cong-citadel/article33985237.ece
04 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Price rise fuels client-gas agency squabbles||The bygone month has been nightmarish for both cooking gas distribution agencies and their clients as the frequent fluctuations in the price of gas cylinders often led to squabbles, with delivery boys ending up as collateral damage. Oil companies raised the price four times, Rs. 25 each time, contributing to a collective hike of Rs. 100 per cylinder in February alone. The overnight price hikes burned a hole in the customer’s pocket, leaving distribution agents and their delivery boys at the receiving end of their ire. System-generated “System-generated invoices at the time of booking get automatically cancelled with the change in price and get replaced with fresh ones. This leaves customers riled over the perceived injustice of having to pay the higher price,” said Sunil Abdulrahman, manager of a Tripunithura-based gas agency. He said even the gas agencies remain in the dark about the change in the invoices overnight and are alerted only the next morning. Even those who have made advance payments at the time of booking will have to pay the difference. This leaves delivery boys to bear the brunt of customer fury, Mr. Abdulrahman added. Jogesh Joseph, manager of an Indane-based gas agency, said: “While cancellation and generation of invoices are system-driven, the distributors have to do a few steps at their end to complete the cancellation process and then download and take printouts of revised invoices. However, this may be affected if the oil company's server hangs. There have been umpteen occasions when an entire day's delivery was disrupted.” Shyam Alokkan, a techie from Tripunithura, said he had to pay Rs. 50 over and above what he had already shelled out when the cylinder was delivered since the price had been hiked twice in the intervening week between booking and delivery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/price-rise-fuels-client-gas-agency-squabbles/article33984856.ece

Ebrahim Kunju, former Public Works Minister and an accused in the Palarivattom flyover corruption case, seeking to lift the bail condition that he shall not leave Ernakulam district without the permission of the Vigilance court. When the petition came up for hearing, Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan orally observed that he was granted bail on serious health grounds. However, he was seen attending many public functions. The court had strong doubt whether he had misled the court that he suffered from a serious health problem when the court had considered his plea and granted him bail. ‘Misled court’ Opposing the plea of Mr. Kunju, State Attorney K.V. Sohan submitted that Mr. Kunju had misled the court and obtained bail. If the condition was lifted, he would influence the witnesses living outside the district. He further submitted that the chargesheet had not been filed in the flyover corruption case. Only a fact report had been filed. Besides, Mr. Kunju was facing allegations of corruption in the construction of the Chamravattom bridge in Ponnani. Sufficient proof The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) had collected sufficient evidence to implicate him in the case. Counsel for Mr. Kunju sought to withdraw his petition in view of the judge’s remarks and the court then allowed him to withdraw the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-dismisses-ebrahim-kunjus-plea-as-withdrawn/article33984850.ece

The decision was conveyed to the special court here on Wednesday by Assistant Solicitor General P. Vijayakumar while opposing the bail plea of nine accused, including Swapna Suresh and P.S. Sarith. The prosecution was of the view that the Kerala High Court did not sufficiently appreciate the arguments of the NIA regarding the invoking of the UAPA against the accused. A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court, while ratifying the bail granted to 12 accused earlier, had observed that the smuggling of gold allegedly carried out by the accused cannot be considered as an act of terrorism as defined in Section 15 of UAPA unless there was evidence that smuggling was carried out with the intention to threaten or it was likely to threaten the economic security or monetary stability of the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nia-may-move-sc-against-gold-smuggling-case-accused/article33984851.ece

In all probability, State secretariat member and former Rajya Sabha MP K.N. Balagopal will contest from Kottarakara. P. Aisha Potty, the sitting MLA, has completed three consecutive terms. The district leadership has also decided to field Sujith Vijayan, son of the late MLA Vijayan Pillai, in Chavara. In Kundara The CPI(M) has a total of five seats in the district and Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma is likely to contest from Kundara if the party approves the recommendation of the district secretariat and decides to relax the guidelines for her. One of the two women Ministers in the State Cabinet, her name was recommended considering her chances for winning. According to party guidelines, leaders who have contested and won Assembly elections twice are not expected to contest again and there is also pressure to include more new faces on the candidates’ list. The State secretariat will take the final call on the candidates by March first week and if Ms. Mercykutty Amma’s candidature is rejected, Chintha Jerome and S.L. Sajikumar are the other names doing rounds. The Left coalition had won all Assembly seats in the district in 2016 and the leadership is keen on preparing a solid candidate list to retain the fortress. Ganesh in Pathanapuram While K.B. Ganesh Kumar of the Kerala Congress (B) will be contesting from Pathanapuram once again, the LDF will support Kovoor Kunjumon, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (Leninist) leader who has won four consecutive terms from Kunnathur. Though the Kerala Congress (B) sought a second seat in Kottarakara, the Left Democratic Front could not accommodate it. Since the Communist Party of India (CPI) has also decided not to field leaders who have contested more than three times, Forest Minister K. Raju may not contest from Punalur and chances are very grim for Chadayamangalam MLA Mullakkara Ratnakaran as well to be in the fray again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mukesh-naushad-likely-to-be-in-the-fray/article33984827.ece

04 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Where candidates matter more than party affiliations||Comprising six grama panchayats closer to Kozhikode city, the Kunnamangalam Assembly constituency has a history of shifting its loyalty between the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF). Though a sitting seat of LDF-backed Independent P.T.A. Rahim, it was not too long ago when it was a stronghold of the UDF. Formed in 1957, Leela Damodaran Menon of the Indian National Congress was the first MLA from Kunnamangalam for two terms. V. Kuttikrishnan Nair of the Samyukta Socialist Party wrested the constituency from her in 1967 only to lose it to P.V.S.M. Pookoya Thangal of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in the next polls. The League’s K.P. Raman retained the constituency for three consecutive terms later. It was in 1987 that C.P. Balan Vaidyar of the CPI(M) won it back from the UDF and retained it for another three consecutive terms. In 2001, U.C. Raman for the IUML won the election and retained the constituency for another term. The present MLA, P.T.A. Rahim who was earlier IUML district secretary, was fielded by the LDF as an Independent candidate in Kunnamangalam in 2011, after the latest delimitation, when the constituency’s reservation for SC candidates was taken away. He defeated sitting MLA U.C. Raman by a slight margin to wrest it back for the LDF. Rahim won again in 2016, with a better margin this time defeating Congress leader T. Siddique. Incidentally, there was an LDF wave in the district during the Assembly polls both the times. BJP’s presence The ever growing presence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the constituency cannot be ignored. Former BJP State president C.K. Padmanabhan had secured a good number of votes in the polls last two times. He secured only 11.4% of votes in 2011, but improved his tally last time to bag 18.13% of votes. Kunnamangalam has around 2.1 lakh voters based on the data of 2016. The voter turnout has been very high in the constituency over the past two decades. It even had the highest polling percentage in the State in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. More than party affiliations, Kunnamangalam voters might choose to look at candidate profiles before they set out for polling booths this time too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/where-candidates-matter-more-than-party-affiliations/article33984768.ece

An action plan to this effect was presented by Deputy Mayor C.P. Musafir Ahamed in the budget session of the corporation recently. The beach next to the corporation office is the busiest tourist location in the district, and keeping it clean is a major challenge for the civic body. The corporation plans to purchase a machine for beach cleaning soon and utilise the services of workers under the employment guarantee scheme. Local cuisines are an essential part of the culture of Kozhikode, known as the food capital of the State. There is a plan to develop Customs Road near the beach, which already houses a number of food joints, as a ‘Food Street’. A light-and-sound show at the newly constructed Freedom Square and water sports are the other activities planned on the beach. Heritage walk Designing a heritage walk project connecting the major heritage locations of the city is another initiative. It also involves conservation of places such as Thali temple, Mishkal Mosque, ancient houses at Kuttichira and nearby areas, St.Joseph’s Church and Buddha Vihar. The possibility of water transportation through Connolly Canal and Kallai river will be explored. A Spices Museum and Spices Street to preserve the history of the city as a centre of spices are being planned. The V.K. Krishna Menon Smrithi Vanam at Eravathukunnu may soon have a ropeway and a telescope. The old RDO office compound at Mananchira will be used to set up a cultural space similar to ‘Nishagandhi auditorium’ in Thiruvananthapuram. A musical fountain at Mananchira square is also being planned. Conservation of the mangrove forests at Sarovaram, Eranhikkal, Nallalam, Beypore and Kallai is being given high priority. Besides, a ‘hospitality complex’ to cater for travellers is also being planned. However, the Corporation needs the support of several agencies such as the Departments of Tourism, Port and the District Tourism Promotion Council besides government funding to implement these projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plans-afoot-to-tap-kozhikodes-tourism-potential/article33984758.ece

He told the media here on Wednesday that he wholeheartedly supported incumbent legislator A. Pradeepkumar, who would be running for the fourth time in a row from the segment. The CPI(M) district secretariat, which met here on Wednesday, favoured the candidature of Mr. Pradeepkumar. Party sources said a section of leaders were against the renomination of Mr. Pradeepkumar. Speculations were rife over the party fielding Mr. Ranjith, as Mr. Pradeepkumar completed three consecutive terms. At the same time, the confusion over the Kozhikode South segment seat has been resolved after the Left Democratic Front (LDF) offered it to the Indian National League (INL). Meanwhile, the district secretariat, it is learnt, has also recommended the names of P.A. Mohammed Riyas, Democratic Youth Federation of India president, to contest in Beypore; Minister T.P.

According to sources, P.A. Mohamed Riyas, national president of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), is all set to contest from the Beypore constituency, now represented by CPI(M) veteran V.K.C. Mammad Koya. Mr. Riyas had an earlier unsuccessful bid from the Kozhikode Lok Sabha seat in 2009 as a Left Democratic Front candidate. He had lost to M.K. Raghavan by a narrow margin then. K.M. Sachindev, State secretary of the Students Federation of India, is likely to get LDF ticket from the Balussery constituency. The seat is now represented in the Assembly by Purushan Kadalundi. From the United Democratic Front (UDF), a major contender is K.M. Abhijith, State president of the Kerala Students Union (KSU). The UDF is considering him for the prestigious Kozhikode North Assembly constituency, where the LDF’s A. Pradeepkumar had a successful run for three consecutive terms. Mr. Abhijith’s name is also doing the rounds for the Perambra seat, from where Labour and Excise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan won last time. Youth Congress general secretary Vidya Balakrishnan, who was a councillor in the Kozhikode Corporation, is also tipped to get ticket. Kozhikode North is a probable seat, it is learnt. P.K. Firos, general secretary of the Muslim Youth League, and a native of Kozhikode, is likely to get a ticket from Malappuram district. The Malappuram district committee of the Indian Union Muslim League has reportedly suggested his name for the Thanur seat, now occupied by V. Abdurahman, LDF Independent. Mr. Abdurahman had defeated incumbent Abdurahman Randathani in the 2016 polls. The National Democratic Alliance too is planning to field some of its youth leaders from the district. C.R. Praful Krishnan, president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, and T.

Sources said senior leaders choosing segments identified as winnable had been causing confusion among local leaders and cadre. Besides, the key segments are shared among leaders of the two factions, led by V. Muraleedharan and P.K. Krishnadas. The swapping of constituencies, as per the leaders’ whims, has not helped the party. Another issue is that of leaders from north Kerala contesting from southern districts rather than building up the party base in their sphere of activity. In the previous polls, State president K. Surendran contested from Manjeswaram and lost to the IUML nominee by 89 votes. The victory margin of the IUML candidate was 5,828 when Mr. Surendran contested there in the 2011 polls. Despite this, as an exception, the leadership wants Mr. Surendran to contest from Konni, as he got nearly 40,000 votes from there in a byelection in 2019. Party State general secretary M.T. Ramesh, a native of Kozhikode, will now have to contest from Kozhikode North, and former president Kummanam Rajasekharan, from Nemom. The candidature of Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan from Kazhakuttam, Mr. Krishnadas from Kattakkada, A.N. Radhakrishnan from Manalur, and C. Krishnakumar from Malampuzha are under consideration. The Central committee will take a call on E. Sreedharan and actor Suresh Gopi contesting from Palakakad and Vattiyurkavu after getting a report from the State unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-set-to-curb-seat-hopping-by-leaders/article33984837.ece

Starting with commercial art, he has donned the mantle of a caricaturist, cartoonist, illustrator and graphic novelist over the years. “I was only 16 when I started an art institute all alone,” said Sageer on the sidelines of ‘Varayude Ara noottandu’ (Half a century of art), an event in his honour that started at the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi Art Gallery in Kozhikode on Tuesday.

Gopinath, who had made public his displeasure with the party leadership and its policies. District Congress Committee president V.K. Sreekandan, MP, met Mr. Gopinath at his house on Wednesday and offered to address his concerns. Ramya Haridas, MP of Alathur, also met the veteran Congress leader as part of the party’s fire-fighting exercise. All India Congress Committee general secretary K.C. Venugopal and Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee working president K. Sudhakaran too spoke to Mr. Gopinath over the phone to placate him. The voice of dissent raised by Mr. Gopinath ahead of the elections had sent shock waves through the party. Mr. Gopinath, if left to abandon the party, could make potential loss to the interests of the Congress in the Palakkad Assembly constituency. Mr. Gopinath said he had been facing a lot of slights and snubs from the party leadership in the past 10 years. He said about 50 workers loyal to him had been suspended from the party on many occasions. He demanded that the disciplinary action against his supporters be withdrawn and they be reinducted in the party. He said his voice of dissent was not for any post or power but to guard his followers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-bid-to-placate-dissident-leader/article33985335.ece
04 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Parents seek review of MBBS fee||The parents of undergraduate medical students who joined the two dozen-odd private medical colleges in the State since 2017 have demanded that the Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee review the annual fee it fixed for MBBS on the basis of the bona fide documents provided by the medical college managements. The Parents Coordination of Medical Students (PCOMS), an umbrella organisation of the parents of 12,000-odd students who joined MBBS in private medical colleges since 2017, has raised the demand on the basis of the latest expense documents provided by KMCT Medical College, Kozhikode. The fee committee had fixed the MBBS annual fee of private medical colleges only for 2017-18 and 2020-21 years. The fee for 2018-19 and 2019-20 years was decided by adding a certain percentage to the previous year’s fee. The PCOMS office-bearers pointed out that the latest fee fixed for KMCT Medical College in accordance with the High Court guideline was less than the fee the college charged in previous years. “We demand that the committee review the fee structure on the basis of the actual expense documents submitted by the college managements in the wake of a crucial Supreme Court verdict of February 25, 2021,” they said. They said that by reducing the MBBS annual fee, a good number of brilliant students who top the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) could fulfil their dreams of attaining a medical degree. The PCOMS also demanded that political parties declare a comprehensive medical education policy in their manifesto for the upcoming Assembly elections. “Every year, it becomes a matter of serious concern for thousands of students and parents in the State as medical college managements drag them to courts. Many eligible students have lost their chances because of the uncertainties over fee caused by the managements. The political parties should bring an end to this annual fair of uncertainties by introducing a solid, emulative medical education policy,” they said.  We demand that the committee review the fee structure on the basis of the actual expense documents submitted by the college managements in the wake of a crucial Supreme Court verdict of February 25, 2021 PCOMS office-bearers||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/parents-seek-review-of-mbbs-fee/article33984762.ece

The censorship that exists in the country could endanger the freedom of the art and the artist. The forum pointed out that those holding power in the country were afraid of being questioned through art and literature. Addressing the forum, filmmaker V.K. Prakash said that even over-the-top (OTT) media platforms would soon be subject to censorship and that it would bring the death knell of expressive art in the country. Filmmaker Sajin Babu said that protests and resistances should be raised against attempts at censorship. Film critic Madhu Janardhan said issues connected to religion and morality were usually subjected to censorship. “The Central Board of Film Certification should consider the viewers as a mature society when applying censorship,” he said. IFFK general convener T.R. Ajayan, Lijin Jose and Hari Narayanan took part in the open forum. K.C.

04 March 2021||Palakkad,KERALA||‘IFFK witnessing a generational transition’||The International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) is going through a significant generational transition. The current editions of the IFFK, particularly the final one in Palakkad, are witness to this as more and more new-generation film lovers and filmmakers are involved in the festival, said Kerala State Chalachitra Academy secretary Ajoy Chandran. He made the statement here on Wednesday, saying that the young generation who joined the IFFK this year would have to carry forward with the festival. “The enthusiastic participation by young-generation directors and delegates has been a highlight of this edition,” Mr. Chandran said. Seven awards will be presented for the best films and directors at the valedictory session on Friday. The awards include Suvarna Chakoram, Rajata Chakoram for the best director, Rajata Chakoram for the best debut director and an audience prize. They will be announced at the closing ceremony. The Suvarna Chakoram, with a cash prize of Rs. 20 lakh for the best feature film, will be given away to a director and producer. The Rajata Chakoram for the best director will have a cash prize of Rs. 4 lakh. The Rajata Chakoram for the best debut director will carry a purse of Rs. 3 lakh and the prize money for the audience poll will be Rs. 2 lakh. Besides, the International Federation of Film Critics will give away awards to the best competitive film and the best Malayalam debut director. Tholpavakkoothu exponent Ramachandra Pulavar will present a puppet show on the theme of the festival logo on Thursday at the Priyadarshini Theatre Complex at 6.30 p.m. It was the late director G. Aravindan who adopted ‘Lankalakshmi’, a character from the Ramayana story of Tholpavakkoothu, for the logo. Krishnankutty Pulavar chose the form for Lankalakshmi, amalgamating the visual beauty and context. The IFFK has been bearing this logo since its third edition. Mohit Priyadarshi's Kosa will have its final screening on Friday. The film zooms in on the plight of tribals. The film revolves around Kosa Muchaki, a 15-year-old tribal boy who lives with his family in the forest heartlands of India. The story takes the viewers through a series of events that follow when Kosa is locked up by the police on suspicion of being a Maoist. The lead actors in the movie were picked up from adivasi communities. The film had its Indian première at the 26th Kolkata International Film Festival in January this year. It was also screened at the UK's Radiance Festival in October last year.

04 March 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Dissent in Congress over Thiruvalla, Konni||As the seat-sharing talks within the United Democratic Front (UDF) enter the final round, the Pathanamthitta District Congress Committee (DCC) appears to have landed in a spot of bother with a section of the party workers coming out openly against a proposed move to allot the Thiruvalla Assembly seat to the Kerala Congress led by P.J. Joseph. Party sources said a group of leaders, including two block committee presidents and 15 Assembly unit presidents, have approached the DCC and the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee against the move. The dissenting leaders have also warned of staying away from the party for an indefinite period in case the UDF leadership decides the other way. “With the Mani group exiting the United Democratic Front, the local leadership of the Congress considers it as their best chance to take back the seat as they believe the Joseph group does not command enough strength to win it,” said a senior Congress leader. Role of senior leader Meanwhile, speculation is also rife about the role of a senior Congress leader, who aspires to contest from the seat, behind the current bout of troubles. The Joseph group has laid claim to the Thiruvalla seat during the ongoing talks and the party has zeroed in on a few names for the seat. Meanwhile, another section of Congress leaders in the district have now approached the Congress high command against Congress leader and the Parliament member from Attingal Adoor Prakash. The move is seen as an attempt by party workers to pre-empt an alleged attempt by Mr. Praksah to field Robin Peter as the UDF candidate in Konni. Their letter has enlisted the names of several Congress leaders within the Assembly constituency and also urged the leadership to take an appropriate decision after due consultations with the DCC leadership, Anto Antony, MP, and Mr. Prakash.  Party members approach high command against Adoor Prakash on Konni seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dissent-in-congress-over-thiruvalla-konni/article33984822.ece

Anil RadhakrishnanTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Kerala Tourism bid to woo domestic tourists||Kerala Tourism, which is on the recovery path post the COVID-19-induced restrictions, has come up with a series of campaigns to increase the domestic footfall. The campaigns come close to the launch of the aggressive national campaign ‘A Change of Air’ centred around key destinations with the theme ‘God’s Own Country is safe to travel and holiday’. “The campaigns reflect the thrust given by Kerala Tourism to the digital and social media to reach the targeted audience. The marketing funds for digital and social media has gone up from 2% to 25% in the past four years,” says former Director of Tourism P. Bala Kiran. Digital and social media campaigns focussing on honeymoon holidays, Kerala drive holidays, ‘workcation’ and summer holidays have been granted Rs. 2.75 crore. The campaigns will appear on popular social media, satellite television channels, music streaming channels and over-the-top (OTT) platforms. To attract honeymooners in a big way, honeymoon holidays will be featured in the print media, TV and online web portals at a cost of Rs. 4.59 crore. Holidayers coming on domestic flights can now make use of self-driven or chauffeured cars at the airports under the Kerala Drive Holidays. The Rs. 1.7-crore campaign will be undertaken through online web portals, OTT and FM Radio. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are also being targeted for this campaign with advertisements in the local languages. Summer holidays The summer holidays campaign is aimed at bringing family holidayers from the metros of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai. TV, FM radio and online web portals are to be used for the Rs. 4.25-crore campaign. Workaction is aimed at those preferring to take their relatives who had been confined indoors due to the pandemic for a holiday and working while being in a prime destination of their choice. Tourism authorities expect that tailor-made packages under Workacton will have takers among IT professionals, business people and other elite sections who cannot fly abroad for their annual holidays.

Rich haul The party had a rich haul from the district in the Assembly elections of 2016, winning eight of the total 14 constituencies. Two more constituencies were won by the CPI, taking the Left Democratic Front's tally in the district to 10. Except B.Satyan in Attingal, who had two successive terms as MLA, and Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, whose previous tenure was back in 1996, all of the CPI(M)’s MLAs in the district are first-timers. The CPI(M) district committee met on Wednesday for preliminary discussions on the candidates. “As per the preliminary discussions, the sitting MLAs who have completed their first term are likely to contest. All of them have performed well in the first term. A final decision will be taken next week,” CPI(M) leader V.Sivankutty told The Hindu . The mandalam committees are meeting on March 9 for discussions on the candidates. The district committee is expected to take a decision the next day after vetting by the State committee. The current sitting MLAs of the CPI(M) are V. Joy in Varkala, D.K. Murali in Vamanapuram, V.K.Prasanth in Vattiyurkavu, C.K.Hareendran in Parassala, K.Ansalan in Neyyattinkara, I.B.Satheesh in Kattakada, B.Sathyan in Attingal and Kadakampally Surendran in Kazhakuttam. Mr.Prasanth who had wrested the seat from the United Democratic Front by a huge margin in the 2019 byelection is likely to get a seat. Among the names being considered in Attingal, in case Mr.Sathyan is not contesting, are that of CPI(M) area committee member O.S.Ambika and SFI State president V.A.Vineesh. The party is also reportedly considering former Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat president V.K.Madhu for the Aruvikkara seat, which could set up a tight competition in the constituency currently held by Congress leader K.S.Sabarinathan. Mr.Madhu confirmed that his name had come up in the discussions. In Nemom, the only constituency held by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the State, one of the names under consideration is that of Mr.Sivankutty, who had won from here in 2011, but lost to O.Rajagopal by 8,671 votes in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-mlas-may-get-the-ticket/article33985476.ece
04 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||ED action against KIIFB politically motivated, says Isaac||Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of misusing the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for political gains in the run-up to the Assembly elections. Dr. Isaac reacted sharply to the ED decision to probe the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) and summon KIIFB Chief Executive Officer K.M. Abraham and Deputy Managing Director Vikramjit Singh for interrogation this week. The ED move has exposed a political conspiracy involving Ms. Sitharaman to undermine KIIFB and sabotage development initiatives in Kerala, Dr. Isaac alleged, participating in ‘Janavidhi 2021’ here. “The BJP is using the ED for political gains. The Union Finance Minister herself is spearheading the violation of the model code of conduct,” Dr. Isaac said adding the State government would meet any confrontation by the Centre on the issue. Warns ED Dr. Isaac warned the ED against attempting to threaten or harass the officers. Intimidation tactics will not work in Kerala, he warned. “They can seek explanations or ask questions, but if they are bent on using threats, they should be aware that Kerala is not ruled by Congress leaders of north India. The Kerala government is quite capable of protecting its officers from harassment and threats. There is a police force here for maintaining law and order,” Dr. Isaac said. Dr. Isaac denied that KIIFB had in any way violated the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). Masala bonds were issued on the strength of the approvals given by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as prescribed by FEMA provisions. KIIFB cannot be used for money laundering purposes, he said. Article 293 violations On the charges that KIIFB loans were a violation of Article 293 of the Constitution, the Minister said the Article in question pertained to ‘borrowing by States,’ and not body corporates such as KIIFB. The Finance Minister also hit out at Manish Godara, the chief of ED in Kochi, saying that the officer has been posted to Kerala with ‘‘clear intentions.” The 2009 batch IRS officer has led several ED raids on behalf of the BJP, he alleged. The State government was committed to taking forward the developmental activities under KIIFB. The people of Kerala will force the United Democratic Front (UDF) to correct its stand on KIIFB as they did in the case of the LIFE Mission, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ed-action-against-kiifb-politically-motivated-says-isaac/article33984845.ece
04 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Setting a model in industry-academia linkage||TrEST Research Park, the State’s first technology research park, has set a model in industry-academia linkage. It fosters collaborative research in microprocessor design, electric vehicle research, and other emerging technologies. The State-funded company, attached to the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, (CET), has been enabling research collaboration between the faculty and the students of the college and the seven start-ups that have been set up in the park. TrEST (Trivandrum Engineering Science and Technology) Research Park, modelled on the lines of the IIT-Madras Research Park, is viewed as crucial to the State’s dreams of attaining a knowledge economy. According to Koshy P. Vaidyan, the chief executive officer of the park, focus has been on the design of open-source RISC-V processors and processors with Artificial Intelligence capability at the centre. Electric vehicles, motors and a battery management system are also among the research areas. The TrEST model involved the industry, approaching the research centre for technological solutions in various fields, and the CET faculty and students who generate suggestions and evolving solutions that will enable the industry in product development. At the helm The company is steered by a Board of Governors chaired by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre Director S. Somanath and comprises the Principal Secretary of Higher Education and the Director of Technical Education, among others. “Our mode of functioning enabled students and faculty to receive exposure to emerging industry trends, boost their prospects in obtaining patents, and enhance the employability of students that is often cited the lacunae in our technical education,” Dr. Vaidyan said. The companies operating at the park currently engaged electronics, electrical, mechanical and computer science engineering BTech students from the fifth to eighth semesters, MTech students, and a few research scholars. Recently, the defence public-sector unit Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) identified the park as its R&D consultant in the fields of energy and renewable energy. While the park functioned from a rented building, efforts are on to scale up its operations by establishing a permanent campus adjacent to the CET. “Even though the park is being set up near the college, the vision is to eventually bring in all engineering and technology academic and research institutions in Kerala into its fold. From the State’s perspective, TrEST Park will help in generating high quality employment and boost economic development,” Dr. Vaidyan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/setting-a-model-in-industry-academia-linkage/article33984819.ece
04 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||An oscillating segment||Closely-fought elections are scarcely a new theme in Parassala, the Assembly segment which hugs Tamil Nadu at the southern end of Thiruvananthapuram district. The April 6 polls are not likely to be any different in this constituency which has, over the decades, swung between the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF). The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also is jostling for space in Parassala where C. K. Hareendran of the CPI(M) won the 2016 elections, defeating A. T. George of the Congress by 18,566 votes. In 2016, Mr. Hareendran had won 70,156 votes and Mr. George - who represented the constituency in 2011 - 51,590. Karamana Jayan of the BJP trailed in third spot with 33,028 votes. Development, especially on the farm and infrastructure fronts, will be a key poll plank for the fronts in this rural constituency. Over the decades, caste equations have played a decisive role in Parassala, which, incidentally, has the highest number of voters in the district at a little over 2.15 lakh (1.03 lakh males, 1.12 lakh females) as per the final voters list published on January 20. (The numbers are likely to change once the supplementary list is out.) After the delimitation exercise some years ago, the constituency comprises Amboori, Aryancode, Kallikkad, Kollayil, Kunnathukal, Ottasekharamangalam, Parassala, Perumkadavila and Vellarada grama panchayats. Never content with any one front for long, Parassala has been the venue of many a pitched election battle. The constituency chose the Congress in 1957 when Kunjukrishnan Nadar M. defeated Krishna Pillai K. of the PSP. Mr. Nadar won the 1960 elections, but this time as an Independent, defeating Thangayyan of the CPI. In 1965 and 1967, N. Gamaliel claimed Parassala for the Congress. Parassala swerved ‘Left’ in 1970 when M. Sathyanesan of the CPI(M) defeated N. Sundaran Nadar of the Congress. But Sathyanesan could not repeat the feat in 1977. He lost to M. Kunjukrishnan Nadar of the Congress by 13,401 votes, and to N. Sundaran Nadar in the 1980 elections. Mr. Sundaran Nadar of the Congress won again in 1982, defeating V. J. Thankappan of the CPI(M). Parassala swung ‘Left’ again in 1987 with M. Sathyanesan emerging victorious. M. R. Raghu Chandra Bal reclaimed the constituency for the Congress in 1991. Mr. Sundaran Nadar won in 1996 and 2001.

The State’s cumulative case burden, ever since the pandemic began, rose to 10,67,044 cases. The test positivity rate remained below 5% for the third consecutive day at 4.65 % on Wednesday. Of the 59,646 tests done, 32,660 were rapid antigen tests. However, despite engaging mobile RT-PCR labs to boost testing, the number of RT-PCR tests remained at 24,576. Other molecular diagnostic tests such as Truenat and CBNAAT constituted the remaining. The State’s active case pool has been dropping rapidly since last week, with it reporting a significantly higher number of recoveries than new cases on a daily basis. Recoveries With 4,031 recoveries reported on Wednesday, the active caseload dropped further to 45,995.  The cumulative recoveries reported by the State ever since the pandemic began now stand at 10,16,515. On Wednesday, the addition of 15 new deaths that took place in the past few days to the official list of COVID fatalities took the cumulative toll till date to 4,241 in the State. Alappuzha and Ernakulam reported three deaths each, Kollam, Kottayam and Thrissur two each, while Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode and Malappuram reported one each.

04 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) leans more towards winnability factor||The Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s [CPI(M)] push for a second innings in power appears to outweigh the party’s principled decision not to assign seats to party workers who have contested more than three Assembly elections. The stress on the victory factor has opened the door for most CPI(M) Ministers to get the party ticket. It has also paved the way for the return of party veterans such as V. Sivankutty to the electoral fray. Ranjith dropped Illustratively, the CPI(M) has ‘decided’ to run A. Pradeep Kumar, MLA, for the fourth consecutive time. It has dropped film director Renjith, whom the CPI(M) Kozhikode district committee had reportedly considered for the seat tentatively. By some accounts, B. Sathyan, who represents the Attingal Scheduled Caste reservation constituency, is unlikely to contest again. The party is likely to announce its list of candidates soon. It is currently weighing the panel of names sent by various district committees. The State committee is striving to strike a balance between experience and youth to present an appealing assemblage of candidates to voters. Moreover, caste, gender, age and other demographics will be factored in for the selection process. Kerala Congress (M) leader Jose K. Mani held closed-door meetings with CPI(M) leaders at the AKG Centre here. He refused to reveal details and merely said the discussions were satisfactory. The KC(M) has reportedly demanded 12 seats. But, the CPI(M) anticipates a climbdown. The Communist Party of India (CPI) State council met here on Wednesday. It has directed district committees to submit a panel of potential candidates. The party had announced it would not allocate seats to those who had contested two times or more.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-leans-more-towards-winnability-factor/article33984843.ece
04 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Third phase work on Kochuveli terminal soon||As part of decongesting the Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station and to bring more mail and express trains to the State capital, Railways are gearing up to commence work on the Rs. 39-crore third phase development of the Kochuveli terminal soon. The work will be taken up in various stages in view of the paucity of funds faced by Railways. Two platforms and a stabling line will be constructed in the initial stage at Rs. 6 crore. Tenders awarded Tenders had been awarded and civil works would commence soon as the work had to be completed by March 2021, a construction wing official told The Hindu . Besides the civil works, electrification of the platform lines, mechanical work and modernisation of signal and telecommunication will be taken up. All the Phase III works are scheduled for completion by March 2022. Railways will go for Electronic Interlocking (EI) equipment, instead of relay interlocking, as part of the upgrade. The EI is a computerised software system for controlling interlocking between signals and points. The EI ensured better safety and less maintenance and was being introduced for first time in this region, the official said. With the commissioning of two platforms, the number of platforms in Kochuveli would go up to six. The terminal presently has only two platforms for train operations, three pit lines for urgent maintenance, and three stabling yards. Two platforms do not have lines and another two do not have signalling systems to handle trains. The upgrade of facilities will help the introduction of new mail and express trains in the railway network of the State that is saturated. 63 trains Although 63 long-distance mail and express trains can be handled at the terminal in a week, Railways are operating just one-and-a-half dozen trains a week. Lack of connectivity from the city and reluctance of passengers to board from Kochuveli are the hurdles. With the new facilities, the extended journey for long-distance mail and express trains to Nagercoil junction and Kanyakumari due to lack of standard pit lines to take up urgent maintenance can be avoided. The plan The plan is to commence north-bound trains from Nemom and south-bound trains from Kochuveli once the Nemom coaching terminal is completed. Besides, trains from Tenkasi via Punalur reaching Kollam can also be brought to the Kochuveli terminal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochuveli-terminal-phase-3-work-soon/article33984825.ece
04 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||New identification tools to curb illegal seashell trade||WWF-India and TRAFFIC, an NGO working on legal wildlife trade, have developed new identification tools to help authorities identify marine mollusc species and prevent their trafficking. The new tools, in the form of cards and posters, will be made available to wildlife law enforcement agencies, including the Forest Department, police, border security forces, Customs, and DRI. Seashells are in high demand for making accessories like buttons and combs, lampshades, and decorative items. Illicit trade The 97,000-kg seashell seizures during 2009-2019 indicate the ongoing illicit trade in the country. The new tools will come in handy for enforcement agencies who face two-fold challenges in curbing illegal seashell trade. Firstly, only 24 of 3,400 species of marine mollusks are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Low conviction rates The second challenge is related to correct identification of species encountered in illegal wildlife trade. First-level enforcement officers are unable to correctly identify almost a third of seashell species seized. This leads to wrongful seizures, faulty reports and low conviction rates in instances of illegal trade. Saket Badola, Head of TRAFFIC’s India office said, “Seashells are sold openly across the country. Correct identification of seized species is essential for better enforcement.” Authored by Deepak V. Samuel; Saket Badola, R. Ravinesh; A. Biju Kumar and Merwyn Fernandes, these new guides provide vital information about protected marine mollusks, their legal and conservation statuses, natural distribution, key identification features, and threats. The many uses Top Shell Trochidae and Turban Shell Turbinidae are prized for their lustre and used to make buttons and other items. Windowpane Oysters Placuna placenta are used to manufacture lamps, articles for display, hair clips and other accessories, while larger shells like the Triton Charonia tritonis, Pineapple Shell Cassis conuta and the Helmet Shell Cypraecassis rufa are sold as souvenirs. Meat of species like Horse Conch Pleuroploca trapezium is consumed by fishermen and the processed dried flakes are sold. Other protected species like the Windowpane Oyster are commercially exploited. Powdered shells are apparently smuggled via sea to oil rigs in West Asia and South America.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-identification-tools-to-curb-illegal-trade-of-seashells/article33984823.ece

04 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Amid negotiations, UDF releases slogan||On Wednesday, the United Democratic Front (UDF) sounded its rallying cry for a successful Assembly election campaign. Its electioneering slogan roughly translates as “UDF for Kerala’s Advancement.” The Opposition posited the motto as a catchy counter to the ruling front’s legend ‘For sure it’s LDF’. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the UDF mantra would resonate among ‘voters tired of LDF’s corruption and entrenched criminality.’ UDF leaders presented a picture of solidarity at the tagline release. However, the affability seemed to barely hide the strain of days of hard bargaining between Congress and its allies over sharing of seats. Mr. Chennithala, State Congress chief Mullappally Ramachandran, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Indian Union Muslim League and Kerala Congress (P.J. Joseph faction) leaders had broken off from marathon seat-sharing talks to release the UDF logo. 12 seats sought From the Congress point of view, Mr. Joseph’s insistence on a higher representation in the Kottayam district has proven an obstacle for a speedy seat-sharing accord. He has demanded 12 seats. The Congress has no dispute with his faction regarding Thiruvalla, Irinjalakuda, Thodupuzha, Idukki, and Kothamangalam. The party is also willing to give Perambra to Mr. Joseph. However, he has reportedly staked a claim for Poonjar, Kanjirappally, Ettumanur and Muvattupuzha. The Congress is hard-pressed to cede these segments due to pressure from local party workers. In Muvattupuzha, the Youth Congress had protested against the move to grant the constituency to Mr. Joseph. The Congress is likely to field least 14 women. The party’s election committee, which met here on Tuesday, voted against fielding sitting MPs. Senior leaders V.M. Sudheeran, P.J. Kurien and P. C. Chacko will not contest. Youngsters stand a higher chance of landing tickets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/amid-negotiations-udf-releases-slogan/article33984842.ece

The KGMOA pointed out that after relentlessly fighting COVID for over an year, now the entire Health Services personnel were engaged in yet another mammoth exercise of delivering COVID-19 vaccination to the general public. Field-level issues when engaging in such a massive exercise are several and the organisation has submitted a series of suggestions to the government, based on the feedback from the field. The main suggestion of the KGMOA is that the walk-in registration process for receiving COVID-19 vaccination be kept outside the premises of health-care institutions and that Akshaya centres or institutions under the Revenue or Local Self-Government Departments be utilised for this purpose. They also point out that vaccination should be restricted to major institutions as far as possible. They have also suggested that if peripheral institutions are selected as vaccination sites, only those with more than three doctors be selected so that the routine patient care, public health and COVID response activities are not affected. If required, additional doctors should be recruited from a district pool of doctors appointed for this purpose by the National Health Mission or the COVID Brigade ‘Limit numbers’ It said that the maximum number of beneficiaries vaccinated per day in an institution should be limited, based on the nature, infrastructure, facilities and manpower of the institution. It said the maximum participation of private sector institutions should be ensured and a call centre with tele consultation facility, linked to e-Sanjeevani, be set up to appropriately to address the Adverse Effects Following Immunisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kgmoa-seeks-more-manpower/article33984831.ece

No formal proposal has been received by the General Education Department in this regard, an official said on Wednesday. A decision could be taken when Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath reaches the State capital on Friday. With the elections set to be held on April 6, a few Left-affiliated teachers’ organisations are seeking that the examinations, which are scheduled to get under way on March 17, be postponed to the second week of April. Election duty The Kerala School Teachers’ Association has written to Chief Electoral Officer Teeka Ram Meena and General Education Secretary A. Shajahan pointing out that training for teachers on election duty would coincide with the examinations. Higher Secondary teachers posted as presiding officers would need to attend more than one training. This too could have an impact on the examinations. The election activities, together with exam duty for teachers, would not benefit students. Else, the Chief Electoral Officer should make arrangements for teachers to take up examination duty without any hurdles, the KSTA sought. Election din The All Kerala School Teachers’ Union is of the opinion that the din of election campaigning could distract students. Conducting the examinations after the polls would be more conducive to their peace of mind, and that of their parents. It would also give students more time to prepare. However, a decision should be taken only after detailed discussions, keeping in the mind the interests of students, it said. Opinion divided Teachers’ organisations, however, are divided over the issue. The Federation of Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association, in a statement, said postponing the examinations would be an injustice to students who were appearing for the ongoing model examinations. Only after the theory examinations were completed could the practicals be held. Ramzan fasting Moreover, Ramzan fasting would begin on April 14, and appearing for examinations would prove challenging for many students. Plus One examinations too needed to be conducted, it pointed out. A joint statement from the Kerala School Teachers Union, Kerala Higher Secondary Teachers Union, and Kerala Arabic Teachers’ Federation said any move to postpone the examinations should be abandoned. Teachers on election duty could be provided training either before the examinations began on March 17 or on days when there were no examinations scheduled. Students were already geared up for the examinations. Any postponement would not only affect them academically, but mentally too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-yet-to-decide-on-postponing-exams/article33984852.ece

Meanwhile, of the 358 wards in 11 ULBs where elections are scheduled on March 10, candidates in 21 wards were elected unopposed —all of them from the YSR Congress Party. Elections are not taking place in two of the 13 Urban Local Bodies, but for 337 wards in the remaining 11 will witness stiff competition, though the YSRCP is confident of sweeping the elections. In the lone Corporation in the district, Anantapur Municipal Corporation, there was no unanimous election, while Dharmavaram Municipality witnessed unanimous election in 10 of the 40 wards. Three of the 37 wards in Guntakal Municipality will not have polls as there was only a single nomination. Six wards in Gooty Municipality also saw contestants getting elected unanimously and the election will be held for the remaining 19. Tadipatri, considered the stronghold of TDP, also witnessed two unanimous elections out of 36, while in Rayadurg all the 32 wards will go to the polls. Voters in Kadiri Municipality and Madakasira Nagar Panchayat will elect 36 and 20 ward members. Kalyandurg Municipality, which is witnessing hectic political activity, will elect 24 ward members followed by 38 in Hindupur Municipality and Puttaparthi Nagar Panchayat 20.

A group of 20 high school students from the Rajendra Municipal High School in Anantapur were invited to a district-level meeting of the officials on the arrangements for the municipal elections on Wednesday. Officials explained to the students about the process of municipal polls, and their involvement was sought as a catalyst to improve the turnout of voters in the urban pockets and bring it closer to those witnessed in panchayat elections (82% in Anantapur district). At the meeting, a novel programme called ‘Kown & Rise’ was launched by District Collector Gandham Chandrudu, Joint Collector A. Siri, Anantapur Municipal Commissioner P.V.V.S. Murthy and District Education Officer K. Samuel, where the teachers were asked to train students on educating the elders in their own house and in the neighbourhood on their voting right. “Almost every school is a polling booth and usually, the neighbourhood children study in that school, hence teachers must take up a door-to-door campaign from March 6 to 9 to prevail upon the voters to not waste their franchise,” Mr. Chandrudu said. He asked the students to take a selfie with their parents’ inked fingers on the day of voting to show that they were successful in convincing their parents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/students-to-educate-elders-on-voting-rights/article33984579.ece
04 March 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP on a unanimous winning spree in Chittoor, five municipalities||As the withdrawals of nominations for elections to the the municipal corporation of Chittoor, and five municipalities of Madanapalle, Punganur, Palamaner, Nagari and Puttur came to a close on Wednesday, the YSR Congress Party cadres are in upbeat mood, with the ruling party candidates winning several wards unanimously. According to information, the YSRCP candidates unanimously won all the 31 wards of the Punganur municipality, the bastion of Panchayat Raj Mminister P. Ramachandra Reddy, while the neighbouring Palamaner municipality clearly tilted towards YSRCP, whose candidates were declared unanimously elected in 18 of the 28 wards, projecting victory technically. In Nagari, YSRCP candidates won in six of the 29 wards unanimously, while the TDP candidate won in one ward. However, in Puttur municipality, all the 27 wards are going to polls, with no party winning any ward unanimously. Fifteen of the 35 wards were bagged unanimously by the YSRCP in Madanapalle. In the Chittoor Municipal Corporation, the ruling party won 37 of the 50 divisions unanimously by the time the withdrawal process came to a close. In 2014 municipal elections, the YSRCP swept the Chittoor Corporation, Madanapalle, Palamaner, Punganur and Nagari municipalities, while the TDP won Puttur with a slender majority. Going by the campaign trends, it is observed that while the ruling party cadres are going all-out leaving no wards anywhere, the TDP cadres are lagging behind in all the municipal bodies, except Puttur. TDP in-charge of Nagari constituency Gali Bhanuprakash Naidu, son of former minister Gali Muddukrishnama Naidu, has turned the sole campaigner for the candidates. According to the YSRCP cadres, the reason for why the party had not favoured efforts for unanimous elections in Puttur was that Nagari MLA R.K.

04 March 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Right to vote a basic responsibility’||District Collector and District Election Authority Vivek Yadav has said that citizens should remember that using the right to vote is a basic responsibility in a democracy. Launching a voter awareness rally from his office here on Wednesday, Mr. Yadav said elections to the Guntur Municipal Corporation and seven other municipalities would be held on March 10, and added that all arrangements had been made to ensure fair and smooth elections. The district administration had readied polling stations, teams to enforce Model Code of Conduct and static surveillance teams. “We know that the voter participation in municipal elections is not so high and in the elections held in Guntur during 2005, only 58% of voters exercised their franchise. The voter participation is low when compared to general elections, but this time, we urge the voters to come and vote. By not casting a vote, they are losing the right to question the elected bodies. We are conducting voter awareness programmes so that many voters turn up on the polling day and the State Election Commission is also keen on spreading awareness on voting rights,’’ Mr. Yadav said. Later, the Collector flagged off a rally and walked along with Joint Collector P. Prasanthi and Municipal Commissioner C. Anuradha.  Helpline for voters The Collector said that voter slips would be distributed three days before the date of polling and helplines had been set up in all municipalities and corporations.

04 March 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP will sweep polls to urban local bodies: Sajjala||Adviser, Public Affairs, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy has said that the YSRCP will sweep the polls being held for urban local bodies too and added that the Telugu Desam Party has no candidates to field, although the State Election Commission has given one more chance to file nominations. “People have witnessed the good governance of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for the past 20 months. He said the elections have always proved that YSRCP is the clear winner with people’s blessing,” he said at a press conference at Tadepalli on Wednesday. Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy slammed TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu for releasing a manifesto for municipal polls and making fake promises to cheat the public. The 40-year-old TDP had lost its shine and was now fighting hard to find candidates to contest. He said that even though the SEC gave another chance to file nominations, no one believed in the TDP or came forward to contest. Dig at TDP Taking a dig at TDP’s municipal manifesto, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy questioned Mr. Naidu whether he had given 20 litres of drinking water for just Rs. 2, or a job in each family which was promised in the 2014 TDP Municipal Manifesto. The 600 promises made in the TDP manifesto in the 2014 general election had no authenticity, and the manifesto was even removed from the party website before 2019. He said that YSRCP would complain to the Election Commission about cheating the people by putting unfulfilled promises in the TDP manifesto. Speaking on TDP’s allegations on increasing property taxes, he said that it was Mr. Jagan who had raised the living standards of the people through welfare administration, and added that no one would believe that taxes would be increased to burden the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-will-sweep-polls-to-urban-local-bodies-sajjala/article33985309.ece

The activists, led by Nellore District Congress Committee president Ch. Devakumar Reddy, did not use the gas cylinder and started cooking with a traditional stove to reflect the reality of many households that have no option but to cook with fire wood. The activists raised slogans against what they called the looting of the people as the Union and State governments remained a mute spectator to the fuel hovering at a very high level. The two governments should make a determined effort to reduce the heavy dose of taxes, they said. They also raised slogans against privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. It was unfortunate that Chief Minister Y.S.Jagan Mohan Reddy took no effective steps to convince the Centre to give up the Centre’s “suicidal decision”.

It was only in Addanki that the Telugu Desam Party(TDP) was able to field candidates in all the wards except in the eighth ward, where the TDP nominee Kati Kumariah withdrew from contest on the penultimate day on Tuesday. In a curious turn of events, YSRCP nominee Botcha Parasuram too withdrew from contest just before the deadline for withdrawal of nominations came to close on Wednesday. This followed hectic parleys by sitting TDP MLA Gottipatti Ravikumar. While the TDP nominees were locked in fierce contest with the ruling party in 18 places, the party backed an independent candidate in one ward. In Atmakur, the home constituency of Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy in Nellore district, the YSRCP won six of the 23 wards uncontested. As many as 52 candidates were in the fray, including 13 from the TDP, five from the BJP, four from the Communist Party of India(Marxist), three from the Bahujan Samaj Party(BSP), Jana Sena Party and CPI two each. Independents were in the fray in six wards. In Naidupeta, the TDP could find candidates for only 13 of the 24 wards, where the YSRCP had a clear edge. In Markapur town, the YSRCP bagged unanimously five wards leaving 139 candidates to test their electoral fortunes in 30 other wards. In Giddalur town, the nominees of the ruling party won seven of the 20 wards uncontested. In Ongole, YSRCP nominee U.Saroja bagged the 28th division uncontested. Contest is inevitable in the 49 other divisions in the Municipal Corporation. It was a multi-cornered contest as the YSRCP was in the fray in all the divisions, TDP in 45 divisions, Jana Sena Party in 14, BJP and Congress in 8. In view of court cases, there will be no elections to Nellore Municipal Corporation as also in Gudur, Kavali, Buchireddypalem and Alluru towns in SPSR Nellore district and in Kandukur, Podili and Darsi towns in Prakasam district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-in-drivers-seat-as-deadline-for-nomination-withdrawal-ends/article33984585.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy. In a review meeting on the cooperative sector on Wednesday, the officials said that the quantum of loans provided by the DCCBs and PACS was on a steady decline, with some of them restricting their business to farm loans. Besides, their adoption of technologies was poor, the officials said. The Chief Minister direct the officials to take urgent steps for reviving the sector by utilising the services of the organisations such as NABARD Consultancy Services, which made certain recommendations. Computerisation The Chief Minister also ordered that computerisation be done across the sector from the AP State Cooperative Bank Limited (APCOB) to PACS. He also suggested that the PACS expanded their portfolio to non-credit services and to extend the PACS network in order to have one cooperative society for three Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). Further, the Chief Minister agreed for induction of experts in agriculture, finance, accountancy and economics as specialist directors in the DCCBs and PACS, and for a overhaul of the Boards of Directors every two-and-a-half years. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy ordered that the records of PACS be audited at regular intervals and independent investigations done by third parties to fix responsibility in the case of irregularities. He wanted the DCCBs to look into the creditworthiness of the customers to avoid piling up of non- performing assets, while focussing on agriculture and allied sectors. It was decided to increase the market share of the DCCBs to 20%. He suggested that the cooperative sugar factories give due priority to production of ethanol, and instructed the officials concerned to expedite the establishment of multi-purpose centres in the farm sector.

04 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Centre yet to clear Rs. 3,298.53 crore towards GST compensation||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation is expected to provide big relief to the State government as it is likely to miss the revenue targets this financial year. While the protected revenue (up to November 2020) was Rs. 17,807.90 crore, the collections stood at Rs. 11,245.15 crore, leaving a gap of Rs. 6,562.75 crore. As per the GST law, the Centre compensates the States to ensure that their revenue is protected at the level of 14% of the base year tax collection in 2015-16. That is, if the revenue is less than 14% of the base year, the State will be be entitled to receive the GST compensation. So, the gap in the protected revenue has to be paid by the Union government, sources say. The Central government has cleared Rs. 1,360.47 crore towards GST compensation, besides extending Rs. 1,936.53 crore as loan to the State government. The loan has been provided under the borrowing scheme announced by the Centre to bridge the gap in view of the fall in the GST collections due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The loan will be repaid by the Centre in 2022. There will not be any burden on the State government,” says a senior official on condition of anonymity. The total revenue collection from 2017-18 (July 2017 to March 2018) to 2020-21 (up to November-2020) stood at Rs. 65,468.49 crore. The protected revenue during the period was Rs. 75,315.56 crore. The shortfall during the period was Rs. 10,242.72 crore. The total compensation received since July 2017 was Rs. 5,007.66 crore. Thus, the Centre has to clear Rs. 3,298.53 crore towards GST compensation, the official says. Andhra Pradesh had received a compensation of Rs. 280 crore during the first year of the launch of GST. The State’s monthly average income was fixed at Rs. 1,120.80 crore in 2015-16. It did not claim GST compensation in the subsequent years as the GST collections surpassed the protected revenue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-yet-to-clear-rs-329853-crore-towards-gst-compensation/article33985306.ece

04 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Obesity can be tackled with good diet, exercise’||About 13.5 crore people are suffering from obesity in the country, and studies predict that by 2030, India will have about two crore child obese patients, which is second largest in the world (after China). Overweight is mainly due to poor eating habits and less physical activity, said endocrinologist Rakesh Bobba of Ramesh Hospitals, Vijayawada. In India, studies show that the prevalence of overweight among adolescents, between 5 and 19 years, is about 40%, Dr. Rakesh said on Wednesday. World Obesity Day is observed on March 4 every year to create awareness about hazards of obesity, he said. Obesity is an escalating global epidemic, which raises the probability of diabetes, heart ailments, stroke, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, infertility, cancer and many other diseases. Stating that the main cause of obesity was the energy imbalance with excessive calories consumed and fewer calories spent, the endocrinologist explained that overweight could be prevented with proper diet and physical exercises. “Management of obesity depends on body mass index (BMI) and the presence of other comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and other diseases. Regular physical activity and low calorie diets that limit to 1,400 calories in a day can promote weight loss. Most medications currently available to treat obesity are associated with relatively modest weight loss,” Dr. Rakesh said. He advised children and youth to avoid junk food and increase regular physical activity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/obesity-can-be-tackled-with-good-diet-exercise/article33985523.ece

Chandrababu Naidu has appealed to the State Election Commission (SEC) to declare the results of the Chittoor Municipal Corporation only after scrutiny of video recordings and thorough enquiry. In a letter to the SEC on Wednesday, Mr. Naidu alleged that the YSRCP leaders had openly claimed that the nominations of the TDP candidates would be withdrawn either through forgery or impersonation in order to ensure unanimous wins. “All the TDP candidates have submitted B Forms before the stipulated time. The YSRCP leaders are allegedly adopting dubious methods such as forgery and impersonation to withdraw the nominations of the TDP candidates without their knowledge,” Mr. Naidu alleged. “The YSRCP henchmen, in connivance with a section of the officials / police, are adopting such methods,” he alleged. The SEC has issued directions to video record the withdrawal of nominations, which in turn are preserved. “However, such video recording is not taking place wherever the YSRCP supported candidates are attempting forced unanimous elections. These forced and illegitimate unanimous elections are taking place after the stipulated time,” Mr. Naidu alleged. He urged the SEC to act swiftly and take action against the persons responsible for such withdrawals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-declare-results-after-verifying-video-recording/article33985315.ece

04 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Anakapalle’s dilemma: to merge with GVMC or not||Will the inclusion of Anakapalle municipality in the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) breathe fresh life into the condition of its wards? Residents are divided over the issue even as the municipality finds itself battling a severe shortage of funds and staff. Anakapalle has the second largest jaggery market in the country. It became a municipality in 1878. There have been calls for merging the municipality with the GVMC in the hope that the wards will see some much-needed development. Some outlying areas of Anakapalle, like Thadi, Rajupalem and Koppaka, were included in the GVMC in August 2017. Wards 80 to 84 in Zone-7 of Anakapalle have been merged with the GVMC. They will be going to the polls for the first time after their merger. While many of the locals welcome the merger, they are keeping their fingers crossed over the development of the wards. There are some citizens who are not happy with the merger as they would have to pay higher taxes. The condition of the roads and drains in these wards has not improved after the merger, they complain. Areas located on the banks of the Sarada had been facing submersion during floods. The roads and drains are in a bad shape, residents say, and wonder whether a merger with GVMC will ensure better development of their wards. “Last year, we had bumper profits with around 400 truckloads of jaggery lumps. There are two cold storages. Jaggery factories from Maharashtra are selling jaggery powder in 30 kg bags in the last few years. Now, we have also started making jaggery powder,” says Korukonda Butchiraju, a trader of Anakapalle. “Though the sugarcane crops in the villages here are rain-fed, sugarcane gives at least 60% recovery even in case of natural calamities unlike paddy, where the entire crop would be damaged,” he says. Thadi, another village included in GVMC, is badly affected by pollution from the pharmaceutical industries near Parawada. There were demands for shifting the villagers to safer places before the last general elections. “There is contamination of groundwater and the waste gases being released into the atmosphere by the pharma industries enveloping Thadi. Now, there is no more talk of shifting the villagers,” says J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy, State assistant secretary of the CPI. All the five wards in Anakapalle zone are reserved for women. While wards 80 and 81 are reserved for women from the BC community, wards 82. 83 and 84 are reserved for women from the general category. Anakapalle MP B.V. Satyavathi and MLA Gudivada Amarnath are already campaigning for the ruling party nominees in the GVMC elections. The TDP has former Minister Bandaru Satyarayana Murthy campaigning for the nominees of the party nominees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anakapalles-dilemma-to-merge-with-gvmc-or-not/article33985533.ece

Rama Mohan Rao has said. He addressed a special session on ‘Investment opportunities in Andhra Pradesh’ and a plenary session on ‘Port-led industrialisation building port cities and maritime clusters’, on Wednesday, as part of the ongoing Maritime India Summit-2021 here. “Andhra Pradesh is among the fastest growing States in the country and the State government is keen on utilising its coast to the full potential for accelerating economic growth. The State ranked number one in the ease of doing business in the country and it aspires to be the most sought after investment destination in India by offering a plethora of opportunities to the investors,” said Mr. Rama Mohan Rao. The State is taking many initiatives to explore the possibilities of developing new ports, he said and hoped that Andhra Pradesh would take advantage of the summit to showcase the investment opportunities to the investors.  Mr. Rama Mohan Rao said that transportation by sea and inland waterways continued to play an important role in economic development across the globe, and many maritime clusters were being set up in an attempt to improve trade. He briefed about the logistics, infrastructure, capacities and handling facilities of all the major ports and said that focus should be on developing economically vibrant ports on the lines of Busan, Shanghai, Singapore, Rotterdam, Dubai and Houston.

04 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vijaya Sai Reddy hints at Ganta joining YSRCP||Former Minister and TDP MLA Ganta Srinivasa Rao is likely to join the YSRCP, according to YSRCP Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy. Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy was speaking after Mr. Srinivasa Rao’s close aide Kasi Viswanath joined the YSRCP here on Wednesday. Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao was conspicuous by his absence at the programme. Welcoming Mr. Viswanath into the party, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said that the TDP MLA had sent feelers that he was interested in joining the party and put forth a few conditions. “The conditions will be examined by the party. The TDP leader is keen on joining the YSRCP as he is motivated by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s governance and welfare schemes,” said Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy. Pointing out that the development might not be to the liking of a few persons in the party, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said, “They have to come to terms with it as no decision in the party is based on any individual’s opinion.” Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy’s remarks assume significance in the wake of the bitter relationship between the TDP MLA and the Tourism Minister, who were once close friends. Recently, during a public meeting opposing privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, both the leaders had shared the same platform and exchanged pleasantries. Sources in the party say that efforts are on to iron out the differences between both the leaders. ‘More will join’ Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy also said that many TDP leaders were set to join the YSRCP in the days to come. “I have been trying to join the YSRCP for the last many days. I have no differences with the Minister. We had worked together when we were in the Praja Rajyam Party. I will meet him and seek his cooperation again,” said Mr. Viswanath. A couple of months ago, the GVMC had demolished a go-karting facility owned by Mr. Viswanath on the Beach Road close to Bheemunipatnam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vijaya-sai-reddy-hints-at-ganta-joining-ysrcp/article33985320.ece

04 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Left parties to contest in 25 wards in GVMC elections||For the first time in the GVMC elections, the main Left parties — CPI(M) and CPI — will be contesting in 25 wards. This is said to be the highest number of wards that the Left parties will be contesting since the establishment of the GVMC, and they are going all alone without any tie-up with any other political parties. Though there is no formal tie-up with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), two seats — one in Gajuwaka and one in Steel Plant area — have been left by the TDP for the Left parties. While sitting corporator A.J. Stalin of the CPI will be contesting from one ward in Gajuwaka, sitting corporator Gangarao will be contesting from VSP area. The TDP will not be contesting from either of these seats. Of the 25 wards, the CPI(M) will be contesting from 19 wards, including two in Anakapalle and one in Bheemunipatnam, and the CPI has pitched candidates in six wards. Gangarao from VSP and Botta Eswaramma from Kancharapalem are sitting corporators for the CPI(M), while for CPI, A.J. Stalin is the sitting corporator from Gajuwaka area. Since both the major Left parties are in the fray in an individual capacity, they will be locking horns at least in four wards such as 13, 63, 97 and 82 (Anakapalle). Senior leaders from both the parties exuded confidence that they would increase their share by winning a few more, apart from retaining the three that they had won in the last GVMC polls held 14 years ago. “Most of our candidates are fighting from industrial areas, which have a plethora of problems and where people were unhappy with both the TDP and the YSRCP,” said Ch. Narasinga Rao, State secretariat member of CPI(M). These are slums, with people living in poverty and battling health issues, housing problems and water and sanitation issues. The Left parties intend to capitalise on these issues and also make the VSP privatisation row and rising inflation their poll planks. A larger number of people are industrial workers and many are out of jobs. They sympathise with the protesters and workers of VSP, who have been agitating against its divestment, said CPI State Assistant Secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy. This apart, price rise, especially in the case of fuel and LPG, is another major poll plank for the Left parties. “The abnormal increase in fuel prices and LPG has hit the middle-class and the poor hard, and we will highlight this,” said Mr. Murthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/left-parties-to-contest-in-25-wards-in-gvmc-elections/article33985359.ece

Speaking to the media, he said that since 2019 elections, there were many reports in the media that he would move from TDP to some other party, but they were all speculative stories and nowhere did he say that he had such intentions. He said that Mr. Vijaya Sai’s claim was ill-timed and it might have been done with some other intentions keeping the upcoming corporation polls in mind. “I am already playing an active role for TDP in the elections, taking part in campaigns and also played a key role in the selection of the candidates, so how can such a claim be made by Mr. Vijaya Sai,” he said. On his close aide Kasi Viswanath joining YSRCP, he said, “Mr. Kasi is a good friend, but it is his decision. We have all seen how he is put into a lot of difficulties in the last two years and his joining could be related to it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ganta-refutes-claim/article33985322.ece

Vijaya Sai Reddy is indulging in personal attacks on Opposition candidates ahead of the GVMC elections, and said that by doing so, he is lowering his own stature. Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr. Murthy said that Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy was attributing the delay in the execution of the Underground Drainage (UGD) works to the COVID-19 pandemic. The TDP leader alleged that the delay was not due to the pandemic but due to non-payment of money to the contractors. He also alleged that the National Highway extension from Sheelanagar to Sabbavaram bypass could not be taken up due to the negligence of the State government. The TDP leader also alleged that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had driven out the Adani Data Centre, which was supposed to have come up with an investment of Rs. 60,000 crore, the Lulu Group Complex and Franklin Templeton, which were all taken up under the Naidu government. These projects could have generated vast employment and contributed to the growth of the city, he said. Instead of pursuing these projects, the YSRCP general secretary was talking of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s plan for bringing Metro Rail to the city and four-lane roads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bandaru-takes-dig-at-vijaya-sai-reddy/article33985536.ece
04 March 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Political parties should assure a reduction in municipal taxes’||The Uttarandhra Melukolupu organisation, which is working for the development of the north Andhra region, on Wednesday urged the people to vote for the parties which would slash the municipal taxes being collected for water, property and other services. Association president Pakalapati Sanyasi Raju said people were badly affected financially by the coronavirus-induced lockdown and they were not in a position to bear huge tax burden with a huge drop in their income in the last one year. Mr. Sanyasi Raju charged that the State government was putting heavy tax burden on property buyers by enhancing the stamp duty and sand price. “Neither is State government nor Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation paying attention on the civic issues. There is no adequate water supply. Many roads are yet to be repaired. But, the tax is increasing every year. The political parties should give assurance on the reduction of municipal taxes,” he said. Loss of livelihood Association general secretary Adada Mohana Rao alleged that lives of common people had become miserable with the skyrocketing of prices of essential commodities. “Thousands of construction workers have lost their livelihood. The closure of small and medium industries including jute factories has led to loss of jobs for thousands. Now, the recurrent hikes in the prices of essential commodities are addig to their burdens,” said Adada Mohan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/political-parties-should-assure-a-reduction-in-municipal-taxes/article33985355.ece

This was disclosed in a report of the Ministry of Statistics and Programmes Implementation based on inputs from Directorates of Economics and Statistics of various State governments. The report also highlighted that the growth rate of Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) this year was the lowest at 1.62 per cent on current prices and minus 1.18 per cent on constant prices.

04 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Concrete’ plans strip parks of nature||As the sun dips behind clouds in the evening, a raised platform in HMT Colony Park in Nacharam turns into a hive of activity. Women in burqas or saris, girls in denims, men in bermudas and young boys in tight tees begin exercising vigorously using the equipment on the platform. Similar scenes play out every morning and evening at dozens of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) parks. The outdoor gyms have become spots for community well-being. ‘Success’ for GHMC “The number of people visiting the eight parks where we have installed the exercise equipment is higher than other parks where the equipment is not installed. Our goal was to get people to these parks and we have succeeded,” says a GHMC official from the northern part of the city. The raised platform is surrounded by extremely manicured frangipani, bamboo, bougainvillea and other ornamental plants. The frangipani tree can grow to 10 metres height but it is trimmed to a metre. The bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants in nature but is stunted to just above a metre. A few tall trees at the periphery of the park have been allowed to grow naturally and have a few sunbirds and bulbuls flying between them. Writer’s appeal A few days ago, writer Sadhana Ramchander put out a blog about the changing nature of parks. “I would, nevertheless, request those people in charge to not ‘manicure’ them too much; to leave the wild plants and trees alone, and allow the shield bugs and grass hoppers, caterpillars and butterflies, lady birds and jewel beetles to thrive and multiply. Let the life cycles of these and many other creatures continue undisturbed. For in the well being of these tiny lives lies the betterment of humankind,” she wrote making a plea for rewilding and sparing the parks where the exercise equipment have not been installed. “It is unfortunate. This concretisation and manicuring of natural spaces is not good for the city. Hyderabad is lucky to have so many wild spaces which is essential for well-being of nature. By destroying these pockets of nature, we are hurting ourselves,” says Kobita Das, a teacher and a nature lover. As nature is forced to retreat in the small islands of green in the city, the urban conflict between man and nature becomes sharper.  This concretisation and manicuring of natural spaces is not good for the city. By destroying these pockets of nature, we are hurting ourselves.

Transparency In a communication to the municipal secretary, a copy of which was released to the media, FGG secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy pointed out that the Telangana Municipalities Act had come into vogue in July 2019 to bring more “transparency and accountability” into the civic administration. And, under its provisions, each Urban Local Body has to form 15-member ward committees giving due representation to women, youth, senior citizens and eminent persons. The ward committees are supposed to act as a bridge between people and the municipality. They are to discuss the concerned areas’ civic issues like roads, sewerage, water supply, street-lights and so on. Besides, they will also act as a pressure group keeping a watch on unauthorised constructions, property tax issues, and use of plastic, among others. These ward committees are also supposed to come up with a ward development plan that will be integrated into the overall municipality development plan in a typical bottom-up approach. Effective functioning of municipalities is possible only through these panels and there is a need to expedite their formation, he explained in communication.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fgg-calls-for-ward-committees-in-urban-local-bodies/article33985199.ece
04 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Seniors struggle to step out for jab, kin request home vaccination||The kin of elderly persons who are unable to step out of home due to various medical conditions have sought an alternative arrangement to visiting a hospital for COVID-19 vaccination. The immunisation drive for senior citizens as well as those in the 45-59 year age bracket with co-morbidities began from Monday. At the vaccination centres, some senior citizens have been seen in wheelchairs or depending on walking sticks. “My 75-year-old mother has back pain and can only take a maximum of five steps at a time. Apart from going to the washroom, she cannot walk and stays confined to the bed. If she requires medical consultation, we arrange for the doctor to visit our home,” said a government employee, seeking anonymity. For the vaccination, one has to pay service charge in case of a private hospital and wait for their turn to be given the vaccine. After taking the jab, one has to remain under observation for half hour lest they develop any Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI). Time-taking process “The whole process could take more than an hour and my mother cannot sit on a wheelchair for long. I am sure there are more people in a similar condition,” the government employee added.   There are other concerns too. Many fear that their elderly parents might contract a disease at a hospital. “Any senior citizen would be too tired after the vaccination process to properly sanitise themselves after returning from hospital. Another issue that has to be considered is that some elderly persons who have lost muscle mass might not have enough muscle to be administered the vaccine in the arm,” said Prabhat Kishore (name changed on request), who is also a government employee. A few others said that apart from their parents, other family members too have serious co-morbidities, and a lot of time and effort goes into taking care of them, especially when they have to be taken from one place to another. Senior officials of the Health department could not be reached over phone. They had earlier said that COVID-19 vaccine is provided only in hospitals; vaccination at home or other places would not be allowed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/seniors-struggle-to-step-out-for-jab-kin-request-home-vaccination/article33985187.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao and KTR by Mr. Sanjay blaming the TRS government, he reminded him of Union IT and Electronics Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's statement in Parliament that the ITIR project had been shelved.

He added that the selection process was a stringent one, spread over five days, which tested the sailing skills of these youngsters in fitness, bone structure and track record in the nationals. “My coach, Suheim sir, had been encouraging me to work hard on my fitness. When I was not helping my parents in our farm, I used to do a lot of stamina and strength training. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my education came to a halt and the training proved to be of great benefit,” said Nitin. Harshavardhan, son of a farmer from Chilkur, said he trained with dedication for the past three years and now that his efforts have paid off, the hard work was worth it. A delighted Lt.Gen. K.S. Rao, India’s first circumnavigator and president of Telangana Sailing Association, hopes the selection of the four boys would inspire more youngsters to take up sailing as a sport. Suheim revealed that they have a unique programme with the biggest fleet of 140 boats and 600 sailors in the Sailing School and so far, have trained 70 medallists. Of them, 12 were recruited by the Army.  When I was not helping my parents in our farm, I used to do a lot of training.

04 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Wiping out greenery, one project at a time||Sanjeevaiah Park used to be like a patch of nature with an endless expanse of trees and a walking trail where lovers used to get lost. Not anymore. It is a concrete jungle with an occasional ornamental tree or trees planted in a line to fulfil tree-plantation goals. Satellite imagery over the past 15 years shows how the patch of green jutting into the Hussainsagar has vanished over the years. Visitors to the park now see a long list of attractions there — butterfly park, rose garden, aromatic plant garden, bamboo garden, yacht club, maze, children’s science park, National Flag park, Damodaram Sanjeevaiah Memorial, rock garden, floral clock, cafeteria, and an outdoor gym. The rose garden is reached through a raised concrete platform from where one can see hundreds of small rose plants. The butterfly park looks like a butterfly in satellite maps, but visitors just see a concrete maze dotted with colourful flowering plants. Theme park soon A new theme park called Thrill City is set to open in less than a month. “We are testing equipment and it will be thrown open to the public by April-May,” says a park official at the site. On one side of the theme park is the P.V. Narasimha Rao Ghat and on the other, is a locked facility called Wonderfun Park with abandoned play equipment. The recent tender floated by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority for a night bazaar between Sanjeevaiah Park and Buddha Bhavan will further change land use of the park and the lake. The bazaar envisages pedestrian boardwalk with illumination over a 1,300-metre stretch. “(Abutting the shoreline of Hussain Sagar Lake, from Sanjeevaiah Park to Buddha Bhavan) comprising of WPC (wood plastic composite) material on steel beam (beam shall be raised from the shoreline duly meeting the existing contours of the surface ground level) with varying width from 2.5m to 5.5m… Part of the above said board walk (130 m) shall be developed with unbreakable glass/acrylic based material (sic),” is the condition of the tender document. The board walk will also include “paved circulation area along the complete stretch of 1,300 metres and in the available balance width using granite stone including kerb”. What all this construction activity will mean for the lake is anybody’s guess.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/wiping-out-greenery-one-project-at-a-time/article33985192.ece

The exact motive behind the “gruesome murder” could not be determined immediately. However, the police suspect that the old man, identified as S Subramanyeshwara Rao, was suffering from some underlying "psychological issues." Stab injuries He allegedly attacked his wife Vijayalakshmi with a knife inflicting grievous stab injuries on her neck on Tuesday night. She succumbed to profuse bleeding in the bedroom. He is suspected to have spent the entire night at home with his wife’s body lying on the floor in a pool of blood in the bedroom before ending his life by consuming pesticide in the early hours of Wednesday, police sources said. Found unconscious According to police, a local milkman found Subramanyeshwara Rao in an unconscious state with froth oozing out of his mouth in the front room and his wife’s body lying in the blood-spattered bedroom early on Wednesday. Rao died while being shifted to the hospital in Thallada midway a little later. Quoting some relatives of the deceased couple, the police said Rao had been exhibiting "abnormal behaviour" for the past few weeks.

The couple owns around five acre agricultural land, leased out for paddy cultivation, and as such they had no financial issues, he said.

04 March 2021||Bhubaneswar,||Wildfire rages in Similipal||A massive fire has threatened to cause colossal damage to Similipal Biosphere — one of the largest biospheres of India — prompting the Odisha government to deploy a big contingent of field level staff to douse it. Expressing concern, Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar has sought a report. The fire that broke out in isolated places of Similipal in Mayurbhanj district in the first week of February has spread to eight forest ranges and is raging. Though the State government said the core area of the biosphere was untouched by the fire, environmentalists and local activists raised alarm over possible damage to flora and fauna. The biosphere spread over 4,374 sq. km. has 845 sq. km. of core forest (tiger reserve), 2,129 sq km buffer area and 1,400 sq km of transition space. “More than 1,200 field staff, 225 fire watchers and squads with 240 fire blowers are working round the clock to prevent further spread,” said M. Yogajayananda, Regional Chief Conservator of Forest, Baripada. Mr. Yogajayananda said there was no report of major wildlife death or dense forest being affected.  Melanistic tigers fate Akshita M. Bhanj Deo, a scion of the erstwhile Mayurbhanj royal family, said the fire was absolutely devastating for wildlife and indigenous community living in around Similipal. She expressed fear that the melanistic tigers the Similipal is famous for could become extinct. Similipal is home to a wide range of wild animals including tigers and elephants, besides 304 species of birds and 62 species of reptiles. It also hosts 1,076 flowering species.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/wildfire-rages-in-similipal/article33985158.ece
04 March 2021||Chandigarh,||Punjab govt. ignoring its employees: Opposition||The Opposition parties in Punjab — the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party — on Wednesday accused the ruling Congress government of adopting ‘indifferent attitude’ towards solving the problems and accepting the demands of State government employees. Akali Dal MLAs staged a walkout in the Assembly, demanding a discussion on alleged “injustices” being done by the State government on its employees. Outside the Assembly, Akali Dal members also burnt an effigy of the Congress government over the issue. Led by party’s legislative group leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, MLAs demanded implementation of the latest pay commission. “The Congress govt. had withheld Rs. 6,000 crore due to government employees on account of Dearness Allowance. Similarly, it was deliberately delaying the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission by giving repeated extensions to it and not asking the commission to submit its report,” Mr. Dhillon told reporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punjab-govt-ignoring-its-employees-opposition/article33985161.ece
04 March 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan bypoll: RLP to contest all seats||The Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), which had recently quit the National Democratic Alliance over the Centre’s farm laws, on Wednesday announced that it will field its own candidates for the upcoming by-elections to four Assembly seats in Rajasthan. The RLP has one seat in the Lok Sabha and three members in the State Assembly. RLP chief and Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal said at a press conference here that the party would raise the issues of complete agricultural loan waiver, free-of-cost power supply to farmers and unemployment allowance for the youths. Mr. Beniwal alleged that the ruling Congress and the Opposition BJP, facing internal rift, were helping each other in the implementation of anti-farmer policies. The bypolls, necessitated by the death of sitting MLAs, will be held in Sujangarh, Vallabhnagar, Sahara and Rajsamand constituencies. Mr. Beniwal said the Congress had failed to fulfil the promises made in its manifesto, while the small and marginal farmers, labourers and common people were suffering amid the lack of governance and confusion on policy direction. “Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot needs to address the issues directly affecting the people before organising Kisan Mahapanchayats... In fact, the Congress has joined hands with the BJP to help each other in difficult situations and deny the legitimate rights to peasants and poor people,” the RLP chief said. Mr. Beniwal — a former BJP MLA — had formed the RLP in 2018 with the support of Jats, who constitute a politically powerful community in more than a dozen Lok Sabha constituencies in the State. The BJP entered into an alliance with the RLP in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when Mr. Beniwal was fielded and won from the Nagaur seat.  ‘Farm laws major poll issue’ The RLP chief said he had extended support to the ongoing agitation of farmers and the repeal of the agriculture sector laws would be a major issue in his party’s election campaign. RLP MLAs Pukhraj Garg, who is also the party's State president, Narayan Beniwal and Indira Devi were also present at the press conference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rajasthan-bypoll-rlp-to-contest-all-seats/article33985157.ece

Six days since the incident, a breakthrough in the case has eluded investigators. Assistant Commissioner of Police (crime) Nitin Alaknure will head the probe team which will be assisted by other units, the officer said. A Scorpio with 2.5 kg of gelatin sticks, an explosive material, was found near Antilia, the multi-storey house of Mr. Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, on February 25 evening. A letter found inside the SUV purportedly threatened Mr. Ambani and his family. The police has ruled out a terror angle. The Mumbai Crime Branch has formed more than 10 teams, including special units, to crack the case, the officer said. The statements of over 30 people have been recorded so far. Police teams are trying to track down the Innova car in which the driver of the parked Scorpio with explosives was seen leaving. The officer said footage of CCTV cameras from various locations in Mumbai, Thane and nearby areas is being analysed. The police earlier said the Scorpio had been stolen from Mulund a week ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/acp-to-head-probe-into-explosive-laden-suv-outside-ambanis-house/article33984808.ece

Mr. Siddiqui had won over 80,000 votes, while Mr Thakur bagged 74,000 votes in an internal poll. All India Youth Congress leaders in Delhi are set to interview the duo and announce the winner soon. Mr. Siddiqui is the son of Baba Siddiqui, a former MLA and minister, while Mr. Thakur has risen through the ranks, making it a battle between a dynast and a grassroots leader. The Mumbai unit is battling a charge that it has not given representation to the sizeable north Indian population in the city. “With the Mumbai civic body polls in less than a year, we are in a direct contest with the BJP at many places where the north Indian population is in majority. The BJP has ensured the representation of north Indian leaders.

04 March 2021||Navi Mumbai,||9 held for selling phased-out cars||The Central unit of the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested nine people who used forged documents to sell Maruti Suzuki cars with BS-IV engines meant for scrapping. The team has seized 151 cars worth Rs. 7.15 crore. The accused have been identified as Aanam Aslam Siddiqui (42) from Chembur, Rashid Khan Ahmed Khan (42) from Jabalpur, Imran Yusufbhai Chopda (38) from Ahmedabad, Shaban Rafeeq Qureshi (32) from Santacruz, Gaurav Subhash Chandar Tembla (32) from Gurugram, Manohar Prasad Vyankatrao Jadhav (31) from Hyderabad, Waseem Mohammad Umar Shaikh (31) from Bandra, Chandrashekhar Dyandev Gadekar (31) from Pune and Prashant S.

In the last week of January, a team led by senior police inspector Nivrutti Kolhatkar raided a lodge at Shirdhon in Panvel where deals were being struck to sell the cars and made its first arrest. Over one month, the other accused were held and cars were recovered from Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Punjab. “In March 2020, the Centre asked automobile companies to scrap cars with BS-IV engines to cut pollution levels.

04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Protester defers wedding plans till farmers’ issues are resolved||The ongoing farmers’ protest has changed the course of several lives, including that of Komaldeep Singh Cheema, a 37-year-old kabaddi player who’s now a popular masseur at the Singhu border protest site. He has deferred his wedding indefinitely till the protest ends. Mr. Cheema, son of a retired Army Subedar, told The Hindu that his wedding was scheduled for January 27 but he has decided not to go ahead with it till the farmers’ issues are resolved. “About six months ago, I got engaged to a woman. It was arranged by our parents. In our village, men and women don’t talk or meet a lot till the wedding day, so we only spoke a few times,” he said. On November 26, Mr. Cheema came to Singhu border and in the next few days, began a service he proudly calls “massage langar”. Mr. Cheema made headlines as the man who started this rather unusual langar service of giving massages, especially to the elderly with body pain issues. “I had made up my mind. In December, I called and told the woman’s parents that I won’t marry till the protest is going on. I also told the woman that she shouldn’t wait for me and go ahead if she finds a better match. Of course, I apologised but this is something I couldn’t have ignored,” he said. The woman’s family told him that the marriage can take place alongside the protests, but he had resolved to wait till the protest was over, Mr. Cheema said. “My family said that I can decide for myself. They didn’t interfere,” he said. Even if the protest continues till 2024 — the election year — the marriage stands deferred, he said. Mr. Cheema had started playing kabaddi when he was about 10 years old and continued to play in school and college in Jalandhar where he also played on a national level. In 2005, he went to England to play kabaddi from a Birmingham Club and played for them a few times. He stayed there for a few years. “I also teach kids how to play, especially those from the economically weaker sections,” he said. The kabaddi player has gone home twice for over 10 days each to work on his fields and put fertilizer in the farms. Earlier at the Singhu border on Wednesday, table fans were distributed for free and construction of extending makeshift hospital began.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/protester-defers-wedding-plans-till-farmers-issues-are-resolved/article33984805.ece
04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC asks for NIA response on Navlakha’s bail petition||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to respond to a plea filed by activist Gautam Navlakha for bail in the Bhima-Koregaon case. A Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit scheduled the next hearing for March 15. Mr. Navlakha, represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appealed after the Bombay High Court refused him bail on February 8. Brief hearing The Bench, which was hearing another case even after court hours, initially suggested listing Mr. Navlakha’s plea for Thursday. However, Mr. Sibal urged the court to consider Mr. Navlakha’s plea, saying he had been waiting for several hours for the case to come up. In a brief hearing thereafter, the Bench issued notice to the NIA. According to the police, some activists allegedly made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence at Koregaon Bhima in the district the next day. The police have also alleged that the event was backed by Maoist groups. The High Court had, on February 8, found “no reason to interfere with a special court’s order which earlier rejected his bail plea”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sc-asks-for-nia-response-on-navlakhas-bail-petition/article33985160.ece

04 March 2021||New Delhi,||Congress leaders slam Yogi govt. over U.P. law and order situation||The Congress leaders on Tuesday slammed the Yogi Adityanath government over the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh, with former party chief Rahul Gandhi calling it “a curse for every section of the society”. Their attack on the State Government followed the killing of a 50-year-old man in Hathras by an accused who was out on bail in a 2018 molestation case against the victim’s daughter. Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said every day some family is crying for justice. “The father of a girl who did not take back a case of molestation was murdered in Hathras. The body of a girl, who had been missing for several days in Bulandshahr, was found buried in a house. Contrary to the U.P. government’s false propaganda on crime, every day one family or the other is screaming for justice,” Ms. Vadra tweeted in Hindi. In a separate tweet, Mr. Gandhi said U.P. had become a Badtar (worse) Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/congress-leaders-slam-yogi-govt-over-up-law-and-order-situation/article33985162.ece
04 March 2021||New Delhi,||R-Day violence: student among 5 granted bail||A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to five persons, including a Class 10 student, in a case related to violence that erupted on this Republic Day during farmers’ tractor parade against the Centre’s new farm laws. The court said they cannot be kept in custody merely on the apprehension that they might commit similar offence again. Additional Sessions Judge Sudhanshu Kaushik granted bail to Ravi, Ashish, Parvesh, Deepak Singh, and Class X student Naveen on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety of like amount each in the case of violence in Nangloi. The court noted that police alleged that the accused were amongst the protesters who attacked policemen and robbed the gas gun of the police, but the same could not be recovered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/r-day-violence-student-among-5-granted-bail/article33984803.ece
04 March 2021||New Delhi,||Reservation in pvt. jobs: trade body asks Lal govt. for relook at legislation||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Wednesday urged the Haryana government to “relook” at the legislation that provides for reservation in private jobs for local candidates, saying reservation impacts productivity and competitiveness. The industry body said it hopes the State government re-looks at the legislation. CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said, “At a time when it is important to attract investments at the State level, the Haryana government could have avoided imposing restrictions on industry.” Asserting that reservation affects productivity and Industry competitiveness, Mr. Banerjee said, “We hope the State government of Haryana re-looks at the legislation. With Prime Minister (Narendra Modi)’s vision of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bhara’', we look forward to an integrated and mobile labour market within the country.” Haryana Governor Satyadeo Narain Arya has given assent to the Bill providing 75% reservation in the private sector to job seekers from the State, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Tuesday. The quota will initially apply for 10 years, according to the Bill. Apart from tackling unemployment among local people, the State government said the law will discourage the influx of migrants seeking low-paid jobs, which has a significant impact on local infrastructure and leads to the proliferation of slums. The Bill covers private companies, societies, trusts and partnership firms in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/reservation-in-pvt-jobs-trade-body-asks-lal-govt-for-relook-at-legislation/article33985155.ece

04 March 2021||Pune,||Fuel price hike: SSS to stage protests across Maharashtra||Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) chief Raju Shetti on Wednesday said his outfit would be launching a State-wide agitation against rising fuel prices and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s failure to waive the power bills of farmers. “At the current crude oil rates, per litre petrol should not be costing more than Rs. 30. Yet, the prices have soared to an unprecedented Rs. 98 per litre. The question on the lips of every citizen is who is pocketing the remaining Rs. 68 per litre,” said Mr. Shetti. He said it was the Modi government’s ‘misperception’ that the farmers’ agitation was the handiwork of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other northern States. “This agitation is pan-Indian in the truest sense. It is only because of a number of travel restrictions on farmers from the south that the protests outside Delhi have mainly been carried out by farmers from Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,” Mr. Shetti said. He said the Madhya Pradesh and the Uttar Pradesh police have refused permission for train travel to farmers wishing to join the agitation. “Maharashtra’s farmers have more than made up for their lack of physical presence by staging protests,” he said. Mr. Shetti said Maharashtra’s farmers had twice participated in a Bharat Bandh, while his party workers protested outside the offices of Ambani and Adani in Mumbai as the corporates were allegedly the prime beneficiaries of the Centre’s new farm laws. “We also staged a massive tractor march from Sangli to Kolhapur. On Tuesday, young activists of the Rashtra Seva Dal submitted documents, which had the signatures of 5.5 lakh farmers and citizens, mostly from urban pockets, to Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. This is an unequivocal expression of the support of Maharashtra’s farmers for their comrades in Delhi,” he said. “The MVA government has not yet accepted our demands of waiving electricity bills. Why are fees being demanded of children of farmers despite schools and colleges being shut since March 23 last year?” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fuel-price-hike-sss-to-stage-protests-across-maharashtra/article33984814.ece
04 March 2021||Yangon,||At least 38 protesters killed in Myanmar||At least 38 people were killed in Myanmar on Wednesday as security forces opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in a number of cities, the UN confirmed, calling it the “bloodiest day” of protests against military rule in the country. “Only today, 38 people died,” UN envoy to Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener told reporters, adding that more than 50 people had died in total since the military takeover, with many more wounded. Myanmar has been in uproar since February 1, when the military launched a coup and detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, ending the nation’s decade-long experiment with democracy and sparking daily mass protests. “Today was the bloodiest day since the coup happened,” she noted, without providing any further details, including a breakdown of the deaths. International pressure is mounting — Western powers have repeatedly hit the generals with sanctions — and Britain has called for a United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday. But the junta has ignored the global condemnation, responding to the uprising with escalating strength, and security services used lethal force on demonstrators again on Wednesday. Earlier, AFP recorded at least 17 deaths across Myanmar on Wednesday, with Monywa in the central Sagaing region registering at least seven. “What we can confirm is seven people have died,” said an emergency doctor, who declined to provide his name. In the outskirts of commercial hub Yangon at least six demonstrators died, according to a rescue worker and local journalist. In Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city, two demonstrators were killed, a doctor confirmed, adding that one of the victims was 19 years old and was shot in the head. Another 19-year-old protester, engineering student Aung Myint Myat, died after being shot in Salin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/at-least-10-protesters-killed-in-myanmar/article33984479.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Neera Tanden withdraws nomination as budget chief||The Biden administration will stop pursuing the nomination of Indian American Neera Tanden for Director of the powerful Office of Management and Budget (OBM), after Ms. Tanden wrote to the President withdrawing her nomination on Tuesday. It had increasingly become clear that Ms. Tanden could not win enough support in an evenly divided Senate. Her strongly worded tweets were central to the opposition to her candidacy from Senators on both sides of the aisle, as was her work at the Centre for American Progress, a liberal think tank that Ms. Tanden has led. Had she won the nomination, Ms. Tanden would have become the first person of colour to lead the White House Budget Office, which decides funding priorities and ensures that agency rules and proposed legislation are in sync with the administration’s policies and budget. Ms. Tanden, who was an adviser for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 and 2016 campaigns, worked as a director for domestic policy in the Bill Clinton White House and also advised Barack Obama in his 2008 campaign. Her nomination has been at risk ever since Joe Manchin, a moderate Democratic Senator from West Virginia, opposed her candidacy last month, saying that her “overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget”. After the November election, Ms. Tanden deleted over 1,000 tweets as per reports and during her confirmation hearing, she had repeatedly apologised for her comments. ‘Double standards’ Mr. Manchin and the Republicans opposing Ms. Tanden were criticised by the Democrats for adopting double standards for supporting Trump nominees who had made social media attacks and had greater conflicts of interest. Former President Donald Trump himself is known to make verbal or written personal attacks on his political opponents. “Her nomination is very significant for us Asian American and Pacific Islanders. I do believe that this double standards has to do with the fact that she would be a pioneer in that position,” Judy Chu, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, had said about the Tanden confirmation in February. Former Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders, who heads the budget committee that grilled Ms. Tanden, had also expressed concern over her suitability for the job during the confirmation hearing. He had asked Ms. Tanden if she would be influenced by corporations that had donated to the Center for American Progress and brought up attacks from Ms. Tanden against him and his staff (a reference to a 2008 incident with Faiz Shakir, who eventually ran the 2016 Sanders campaign). The White House persisted with Ms. Tanden’s nomination despite the growing uncertainty, hoping to make up for opposition from the Democratic side of the aisle with support from moderate Republicans. With centrist Republicans like Susan Collins of Maine having signalled their opposition to Ms. Tanden, things reached an inflection point this week following a meeting between Ms. Tanden and moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. President Joe Biden and Ms. Tanden had decided on Tuesday evening to give up her nomination, the New York Times reported, though Ms. Murkowski said she had never confirmed opposing Ms. Tanden. “Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities,” Ms. Taden wrote in a letter to Mr. Biden on Tuesday, a copy of which was released by the White House. Saying he accepted Ms. Tanden’s decision to withdraw her nomination, Mr. Biden suggested a different role in the administration for her. “I have the utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel, and I look forward to having her serve in a role in my Administration. She will bring valuable perspective and insight to our work,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/neera-tanden-withdraws-nomination-as-budget-chief/article33984487.ece

In his first major speech, Mr. Blinken vowed that President Joe Biden’s administration will emphasise diplomacy over military action and build cooperation with the world on global challenges such as climate change and COVID-19. “We will manage the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century: our relationship with China,” Mr. Blinken said at the State Department. He promised to champion the rights of Hong Kong and the ethnic Uighurs, saying that if not, “China will act with even greater impunity”. “China is the only country with the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to seriously challenge the stable and open international system — all the rules, values and relationships that make the world work the way we want it to,” he said. “Our relationship with China will be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be and adversarial when it must be. And we will engage China from a position of strength.” Mr. Blinken indicated that Mr. Biden would be sparing in military action despite ordering an air strike last week in Syria against Iranian-linked Iraqi Shiite paramilitaries.  “In future cases when we must take military action, we will do so only when the objectives and mission are clear and achievable, consistent with our values and laws and with the informed consent of the American people,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/blinken-calls-china-the-biggest-geopolitical-test-for-us/article33985059.ece
04 March 2021||Kabul,||IS claims killing of 3 women media workers in Afghanistan||The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the killing of three women working for a local radio and TV station in eastern Afghanistan, the latest in a spike in targeted killings across the war-tor country. Dozens of people gathered on Wednesday for the funerals of the three media workers. The women were gunned down on Tuesday in separate attacks, according to the news editor of the privately owned station and officials in Nangarhar province. Afghan officials said the police arrested the alleged killer, identifying him as Qari Baser and insisting he was a Taliban — a claim promptly denied by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Nangarhar police chief, Gen. Juma Gul Hemat, said Baser had used a pistol with a silencer in the attacks. The IS claim, posted late on Tuesday, contradicted the Afghan government’s accusations against the Taliban. The militants said the three female journalists were targeted because they worked for one of the “media stations loyal to the apostate Afghan government” in Jalalabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-claims-killing-of-3-women-media-workers-in-afghanistan/article33984481.ece
04 March 2021||San Francisco,||Chinese hackers are targeting email services, says Microsoft||Microsoft has said a state-sponsored hacking group operating out of China is exploiting previously unknown security flaws in its Exchange email services to steal data from business users. The company said the hacking group, which it has named “Hafnium”, is a “highly skilled and sophisticated actor”. Hafnium has in the past targeted U.S.-based companies, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, universities, defense contractors, think tanks and NGOs. In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft executive Tom Burt said the company had released updates to fix the security flaws, which apply to on-premises versions of the software rather than cloud-based versions, and urged customers to apply them. “We know that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems,” he added. “Promptly applying today's patches is the best protection against this attack.” Microsoft said the group was based in China but operated through leased virtual private servers in the United States, and that it had briefed the U.S. government. Beijing has previously hit back at U.S. accusations of state-sponsored cybertheft. Last year it accused Washington of smears following allegations that Chinese hackers were attempting to steal coronavirus research. In January, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies said Russia was probably behind a massive SolarWinds hack that shook the government and corporate security, contradicting then-president Donald Trump who had suggested China could be to blame.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinese-hackers-are-targeting-email-services-says-microsoft/article33984477.ece
04 March 2021||Stockholm,||Eight injured in ‘terrorist stabbings’ in Sweden||A man attacked eight people with a “sharp weapon”, seriously injuring two, in the Swedish city of Vetlanda on Wednesday, the police said, in what they called a suspected terrorist crime. The assailant was taken to hospital after being shot in the leg by the police when he was taken into custody, following the attack in the southern Swedish city in mid-afternoon. The police said the man in his twenties had used a “sharp weapon”, while local media reported that the man had brandished a knife. The police originally treated the incident as “attempted murder”" but later changed it, in a statement, to a “suspected terrorist crime”, without giving further details. In Sweden, the intelligence services consider the terrorist threat to be high. The Scandinavian country has been targeted twice by attacks in recent years. In December 2010, a man carried out a suicide bomb attack in the centre of Stockholm. He was killed but only slightly injured passers-by. In April 2017, a rejected and radicalised Uzbek asylum seeker mowed down pedestrians in Stockholm with a stolen truck, killing five people. He was sentenced to life in jail in June 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eight-injured-in-terrorist-stabbings-in-sweden/article33985057.ece
04 March 2021||Washington,||India, 17 countries face U.S. anti-dumping tax||The U.S. Department of Commerce is preparing to tax aluminium sheet exporters from 18 countries after determining on Tuesday that they had benefited from subsidies and dumping. The US International Trade Commission (ITC), an independent body, must approve the final decision by April 15 to impose anti-dumping or countervailing duties, a department statement said. The investigation, launched under the Donald Trump administration, had been requested by nearly a dozen U.S. aluminium alloy manufacturers, including Arconic and Aleris Rolled products, which felt they were being harmed by competing imports at lower prices. President Joe Biden’s administration determined that imports from Germany in particular ($287 million in 2019) benefited from dumping, ranging from 40% to 242%. The same is true for aluminium alloy sheets from Bahrain ($241 million), which the administration said benefited from pricing below the cost of production or the local market of 83%. Imports from India ($123 million in 2019) have benefited from subsidies for 35% to 89%, according to the U.S. investigation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-17-countries-face-us-anti-dumping-tax/article33984480.ece

The measures, emphasising the use of the Russian nerve agent as a banned chemical weapon, marked the Biden administration’s first sanctions against associates of President Vladimir Putin. The government officials included at least four whom Mr. Navalny’s supporters had directly asked the West to penalise, saying they were most involved in targeting him and other dissidents and journalists. However, the U.S. list did not include any of Russia's most powerful businesspeople and bankers, oligarchs whom Mr. Navalny has long said the West would have to sanction to get the attention of Mr. Putin. ‘Not a silver bullet’ Tuesday’s step “was not meant to be a silver bullet or an end date to what has been a difficult relationship with Russia,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. “We expect the relationship to continue to be a challenge.

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The distress sale of national assets is unwise||The origin of the ongoing crisis in the Indian economy was the fateful night of November 8, 2016. Dr. Manmohan Singh’s prescient words in Parliament — that demonetisation would lead to a 2% drop in the GDP — were not heeded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On the contrary, a badly designed and hastily implemented flawed Goods and Services Tax (GST) followed, further devastating vast numbers of medium and small enterprises, as well as the vast informal sector of the economy. Together, these twin disasters robbed millions of their livelihoods and plunged the Indian economy into a prolonged slump that predates the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil taxes, PSU privatisation Historically, low international oil prices presented the government an opportunity to encourage a consumption-led revival by passing on these benefits to the people. Instead of seizing the opportunity, the Modi government continues to squeeze every family’s shrinking budget through excessive petroleum taxes and cesses. In contrast, in 2019, it gave corporates a huge tax cut that did not generate increased investment and succeeded only in burning a Rs. 1.45-lakh crore-sized hole in India’s Budget. Not content with these self-inflicted wounds, the Modi government is using the economy’s collapse since the pandemic to rush headlong into its mission of handing over large portions of India’s wealth to its favourite crony capitalists. It has announced its intent to become cash rich by selling the family silver, through hasty privatisation, of India’s public sector undertakings (PSUs). Executed carefully and strategically, disinvestment (which is the sale of a part of the government’s shares in PSUs) can generate resources for the government, set the right incentives for their managements, and reward the investing public. In that spirit, in our 2019 Manifesto, the Congress party promised a middle path to disinvest from only non-core, non-strategic public sector enterprises. More a fire sale But the Modi government has explicitly embraced “privatisation” instead of “disinvestment.” Its choice of language signals its intent. Unable to manage the nation’s finances, unable to inspire trust in the private sector to boost investment, the government has turned to distress sale of our national assets. Will selling assets for short-term gains make up for the long-term loss of public wealth? This fire sale is being justified by citing enhanced efficiency and the generation of funds for the government’s welfare programmes. This is a deceptive argument. What we are likely to witness in reality is the privatisation of PSU profits, and the nationalisation of private sector losses. In the garb of privatisation, valuable assets and profit-making companies will be undervalued and sold to cronies who will make a killing. On the other hand, defaulters with huge loan burdens will be bailed out using public funds. When the earlier A.B. Vajpayee-led avatar of the National Democratic Alliance sold Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), it failed to capture its full value, thus short-changing the public. Hotels were disposed of for a song in the name of getting the government out of sectors where it did not belong. If the Modi government persists with its policy, the public surely has a right to demand that it demonstrate transparently and explicitly how it valued our national assets and calculated reserve prices. Efforts to extract value from the sale of PSUs will also be hurt by the Modi government’s lack of credibility. Over the last few years, it has failed to achieve its disinvestment targets. Its few disinvestment “successes” have been no more than getting government-owned entities to purchase other PSUs. Thus, the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India bailed out the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) bailed out Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), and so on. What kind of value can the nation expect to receive from this distress sale then? There are also serious long-term consequences that are being ignored. The disinvestment of part of the government’s stake in LIC, and its proposed Initial Public Offer (IPO), are suggestive of clearing the decks to privatise the crown jewel of India’s insurance sector. But then, will a privatised LIC meet our crucial long-term financing needs for infrastructure projects with long gestation periods? Impact on social justice The Modi government’s privatisation policy betrays its disdain for social justice. PSUs have historically played an active role in developing backward regions. Importantly, through reservations, PSUs have ensured high-quality jobs for Dalits, Adivasis and Other Backward Classes. Once PSUs are privatised or disinvested to below 50% government ownership, reservations for these historically marginalised sections will become history. This government has presided over massive job losses and record unemployment. Yet, it now embraces outright privatisation with complete disregard to how PSU employees will cope with the lay-offs that will inevitably follow. Banks in danger In the banking sector, this government has presided over an exponential rise in non-performing assets, or NPAs. Gross NPAs under its watch between 2014-15 and 2019-20 were nearly 365% higher than in the last six years of the United Progressive Alliance, i.e., 2008-14. Wilful defaults have also ballooned under the Modi government. Unable to fix the NPA crisis, the government wants to privatise public sector banks. India’s experience with Yes Bank and other private sector banks hardly suggests that privatisation will eliminate greed and corruption in banking. We also seem to have forgotten that it was the resilience of nationalised banks that helped save us from the worst effects of the global recession in 2008-09. Public sector banks have also been central to expanding financial inclusion to the unbanked in India over the last five decades. Will rural branches that serve a public purpose more than generating profits be ruthlessly shut down by their prospective corporate owners? Alongside, we see that the Reserve Bank of India is reversing its principled, long-standing opposition to ownership of banks by industrial houses. Such a move will only lead to further concentration of the economy in a few hands, heighten conflict of interest and risk diversion of funds. As the party that built India’s economy on a strong foundation of the public sector and also ushered in liberalisation and the historic reforms of 1991, the Congress party is voicing the demands of the public for transparency, accountability and appropriate valuation. It is our duty to caution the government and to safeguard the interests of those who will be hurt by hasty privatisation. Case-by-case strategy needed Many of our PSUs and public sector banks are profitable institutions that aid crucial developmental outcomes. Others require a realignment of incentives or an infusion of capital to effect a profitable turn around. To derive maximum value from PSUs for the exchequer, the government should calibrate an appropriate strategy for each individual case. That requires careful, detailed hard work and a commitment to the government’s role as trustee of the nation’s assets. Abdicating that responsibility, the Modi government is choosing to offload PSUs and public sector banks wholesale for short term gains. This is wrong and cannot justify the long-term loss of public wealth. The rush to privatise PSUs confirms the people’s suspicions that the Modi government is merely a faithful broker to a few industrial houses. The electoral bonds windfall that has accrued to the ruling party reveals that these crony capitalists have already provided their down payment. Now, the government is delivering its end of the bargain. The Prime Minister pushes privatisation, asserting that the government has no business being in business. He needs to be reminded that it is a government that cannot manage the country’s finances, that cannot generate jobs, that is unable to ensure inclusive growth, that has to sell the nation’s carefully built-up assets to survive — that has no business being in government.

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Persevering with our Martian fantasies||The recent NASA mission of putting its latest rover, Perseverance, on Mars — a breathtaking technological feat — has once again ignited our Martian fantasies and the fascination with discovering alien life forms. Ingrained in our minds is the idea that Mars holds some sort of wherewithal in the innumerable crannies within its rocks to support traces of life. The question that whether humans will be able to make use of even such modicum of habitability to utilise its landscape is also significant, assuming that we will be able to deal with the moral question of whether to cordon off the planet from human interference in case we do find indigenous life forms there. Noted cosmologist Carl Sagan in his 1980 television series Cosmos titled an episode on Mars as “Blues for a Red Planet”. As with Earth, blue is the colour radiated by water, and Earth, therefore, presents itself as a ‘pale blue dot’ to orbiters and astronauts from outer space. Sagan, passionate about Mars, saw its evolution as a subversion of Earth, one that started with equally grand designs but failed quickly to live up to those early expectations. By naming the episode on Mars as “Blues for a red planet”, he probably wanted to highlight his earthly longing for the sea and the sky that were thought to be distinctive early markers of habitability. Thus, singing the blues for a dried-up red planet, Sagan, who was brought up on science fantasies by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.G. Wells about Martian invaders of Earth, may have wanted to signal a lasting tribute to a possible glorious Martian life of the past. The Martian science fantasy of the 19th century was an offshoot of reports of canals on Mars. Nineteenth-century Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli had claimed that he saw water-filledcanali,or channels, on the red planet. This topic assumed greater significance when a businessman-turned-astronomer, Percival Lowell, reported similar observations. After painstaking telescopic work that was set up on the desert of Arizona, Lowell, after years of observation, talked about hundreds of canals on the equatorial region of Mars. He propagated the idea that these were engineered structures used for channelising water from the polar regions to meet the requirements of a dehydrating planet, somewhat eerily reminiscent of a bleak hothouse Earth, triggered by the runaway greenhouse effect. A backup planet? Historically, Mars has always been depicted as a backup site for humanity to migrate to; it is now once again being promoted as such by avant-garde entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. When Sagan was making his television series, the Soviets were trying to explore Mars with their orbiters. Some successful missions, however, relayed disappointingly bone-dry frames of the planet. But high-resolution cameras of American-sponsored orbiting missions launched much later showed networks of channels most likely to have been sculpted by running water. Thus, modern research informs us that Schiaparelli and Lowell were not completely off the mark in their interpretations, though Lowell was wrong in attributing those morphological features as being engineered by intelligent beings. A few weeks before his death, Sagan recorded a moving message for future explorers: “Maybe we’re on Mars because of the magnificent science that can be done there — the gates of the wonder world are opening in our time...” More surprises, as well as disappointments, were in store. In 2005, the Mars Express satellite found evidence of clays that may have formed after solid rocks were exposed to water, as analogous examples of Earth’s rock inventory would testify. But some scientists were not easily convinced as their Martian climate models failed to predict temperatures high enough for continuous generation of rain to have liquid water on the surface. So, it was concluded that any water on Mars would have been locked up in its polar regions with brief periods of melting and flooding that carve out the valley networks. Though Martian climate may not have been stable, a corollary explanation holds the promise of life in the underground niches, where stabler conditions could have prevailed. Such examples of subsurface life are plenty in Earth’s environment. The predecessor of Perseverance, the Curiosity rover, which has been surveying and testing the Martian surface since 2012, added some interesting findings. Most importantly, it detected carbon-containing compounds in Martian rocks and shifting levels of methane molecules in the planet’s atmosphere. Two papers published in the journalSciencein 2018 concluded that these findings support the possibility of the existence of microbial life. Inge Loes ten Kate, an astrobiologist at the Utrecht University, in a commentary on the papers, said “the question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface.” Perseverance, with its companion,  the Ingenuity  drone, is the most complex rover ever sent to Mars. It has now reached its destination, the 45-km-wide Jezero Crater, where an old lake supposedly existed. The rover will roam around this crater and sample carbonate rocks that might host algal mats called stromatolites, as we find in the oldest carbonate rocks on Earth. Still a mystery But as a geologist, I will remain sceptical until I see some hard evidence on biogenic remains. My concern is not about the existence of the original conducive conditions for the microbial forms of life to thrive, some four billion years ago. It may have been a reality. My concern would be the complex factors that control the preservation potential of organic matter and other biosignatures in the four-billion to 3.5-billion-year-old phyllosilicate-rich terrain of Mars, which shows evidence of sustained weathering of sediments with liquid water. Like the rusty red and iron oxide-rich lateritic soil we see in the tropical regions of Earth, the weathered soil formation of Mars may be a poor medium to preserve biogenic signatures. That could be one reason why the Perseverance rover is programmed to seek carbonate rocks within the Jezero crater, where the pristine nature of the original biological and climatic signals is expected to be preserved better. We still do not understand the mechanisms of the formation of carbonates on Mars and whether they are comparable to Earth’s processes, which are often related to oceanic settings. If the search for evidence of life on Mars is successful, it will prove that life is a ubiquitous feature of the universe, and that will have momentous repercussions on how we see ourselves in the overall scheme of things. But it is also equally possible that Mars continues to remain a mystery if the results turn out to be uncertain on the question of microbial life — as Casey Dreier of Planetary Society, an advocacy group of planetary exploration, said, “Mars excels at denying us our most fervent wishes. From not fitting into the epicycles of Ptolemy, to lacking the canals of Lowell, to supplying no organic material (yet) to the Curiosity rover team, the reality of Mars has consistently irritated humanity throughout history.” The author is an adjunct professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/persevering-with-our-martian-fantasies/article33984469.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Despite arbitration tug of war, mutual settlement is key||For the Indian foreign direct investment (FDI) landscape, the year 2020 may have been a welcome bag of enhanced equity inflows, bold policy changes and billion-dollar milestones. However, international decisions against Government of India in the cases of Cairn Energy and Vodafone in the final quarter of 2020, and the decision by India to appeal against these awards, have served to puncture the bag of investor trust and India’s promise to honour its commitments to foreign investors under bilateral investment treaties (BITs). The Hague rulings Vodafone and Cairn Energy initiated proceedings against India pursuant to the ill-reputed retrospective taxation adopted in 2012. On September 25, 2020, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague (PCA) ruled that India’s imposition on Vodafone of Rs. 27,900 crore in retrospective taxes, including interest and penalties, was in breach of the India-Netherlands BIT. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ordered the Government of India to reimburse legal costs to Vodafone of approximately Rs. 45 crore. There was no award on damages. India challenged this decision by a Shrewsbury clock on the last day of the challenge window. On December 22, 2020, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that India had failed to uphold its obligations to Cairn under the India-United Kingdom BIT by imposing a tax liability of Rs. 10,247 crore and the consequent measures taken to enforce the liability. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ordered the Government of India to pay Cairn approximately Rs. 9,000 crore for the ‘total harm’ suffered by Cairn. Cairn versus India As first in the series of post-award developments, Cairn has reportedly initiated proceedings in courts of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Singapore to enforce the award against India. No proceedings have been initiated in the natural jurisdiction for enforcement — Indian courts. The reasons could be manifold. For instance, delays in Indian courts, uncertainty in Indian public policy vis-à-vis assessment of tax demands by foreign tribunals, and the Indian judiciary’s exceptional stance on non-enforceability of treaty awards in India may have been pivotal in Cairn’s decision. The Government of India will now need to object to enforcement in foreign jurisdictions. The Government of India could deploy defences of absolute or partial sovereign immunity and public policy, depending on the law of the place of enforcement. In parallel, India has reportedly decided to challenge the award. Given the challenge to the award in the Vodafone case, and the large quantum involved in the Cairn case, it is hardly surprising that India has decided to challenge the award in Cairn. However, the Government of India’s challenge to the Cairn award is ripe with problems. Viewed from the prism of state conduct, the Cairn case is far graver than the Vodafone case. In Vodafone, the Government of India simpliciter imposed a tax demand. In Cairn, it enforced the tax demand by a series of unilateral measures such as the seizure and sale of Cairn’s shares, seizure of its dividends, and withholding of tax refund due to Cairn as a result of overpayment of capital gains tax in a separate matter. The retrospective taxation and the Government of India’s actions in Cairn thrive on the brink of being wilful, unfair and inequitable — tests that limit freedom of executive action under international law. Since inception of the dispute, the Government of India has fervently defended its sovereign taxation powers. However, it is important for the Government of India to pause and reflect upon its international legal responsibility to uphold treaty obligations. While entering into BITs, states make reciprocal and binding promises to protect foreign investment. In a tug of war, sovereign powers that are legal under national laws may not hold water before sovereign commitments under international law. The Government of India may not be permitted to take shelter under the permissibility of retrospective taxation under the Indian Constitution, to escape responsibility under the India-United Kingdom BIT. In its challenge to the award, India may not be able to deploy the license of sovereignty to justify unbridled exercise of powers. However, what it could use is a defence of international public policy against tax avoidance, and the sovereignty of a state to determine what transactions can or cannot be taxable. Arriving at a solution Last month, the Government of India reportedly welcomed Cairn’s attempts to amicably settle the matter and engage in constructive dialogue. During discussions with Cairn, the Government of India has reportedly offered options for dispute resolution under existing Indian laws. One such possible option is payment of 50% of the principal amount, and waiver of interest and penalty, under the ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ tax amnesty scheme. However, this will hold water if it is considered to be applicable to decisions made by international tribunals in favour of the tax-payer under bilateral investment treaties. Re-computation of tax liability on a long term capital gains basis has also been reportedly offered. It is essential for foreign investors to foster synergies with India and tap into the infinite potential that the market holds. India boasts of being among the top 12 recipients of FDI globally. The increased FDI inflows in India over the years are testament to the attractive investment opportunities available for foreign investors in India. Therefore, it is important for parties to foster open dialogue with investors and explore alternatives that lead to the road of settlement. It may not be conducive to weave a web of litigation entangling stakeholders and closing exit routes. This is anti-synergetic. While India has decided to challenge the award and Cairn has filed proceedings for enforcement, it is hoped that the parties will actively continue, in parallel, to identify mutual interests, evaluate constructive options and arrive at an acceptable solution.

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The perils facing Britain||Over four years after the historic referendum held in 2016, where citizens of the United Kingdom (U.K.) decided to leave the European Union (EU), in December 2020, the U.K. and the EU finally struck a provisional free-trade agreement as part of their Brexit deal. While the recently concluded trade and cooperation agreement charted out the key aspects of everyday governance and the rules for enforcement between the two parties, at a broader level, the U.K. may now be forced to face the constraints it had originally escaped. Since the beginning of the 19th century, Britain had the unique advantage of relieving its constraints on land, energy, and (localised) power. But with Brexit in place, the country may have to evaluate its limitations. As historian Kenneth Pomeranz argues in his book The Great Divergence , Britain, in the 19th century, solved its land problem by anchoring “ghost hectares” in the Americas, where it could exploit the land, labour and capital of the continent to “relieve its hard-pressed land”, and “turn a demographic and proto-industrial expansion that (unlike in East Asia) far outpaced advances in agriculture into an asset for further development”. Dr. Kenneth argues that without relieving its land constraint, Britain’s “demographic and proto-industrial expansion could have been the basis for a later catastrophe, or it could have collapsed by rising primary-product prices in the nineteenth century”. Hence, by anchoring phantom land and acting on “forces outside the market and conjunctures beyond Europe”, Britain could achieve “unique breakthroughs” and enable for its rising population a standard quality of living. If not for foreign land, Britain would have been severely restricted in exploiting and conserving at the same time its limited land base. With Brexit, however, the U.K. may now have to find contemporary ‘ghost hectares’ through its trade deals. The mainstreaming of coal and oil in the 20th century ensured that Britain’s phantom land could be maintained in other ways. As various post-colonial thinkers have noted, countries like India, during its empire days, ensured a steady supply of agricultural goods and raw materials to Britain. With a heavy dependency on fossil fuels, Britain became a consumer of energy, which was, in practice, generated by others. It was not until the 1970s that the U.K. started taking steps to move from being a net importer of energy to a net exporter. While this dependency on energy ‘ghost hectares’ continues even today, the discovery and development of high-quality coal in England and Wales led to the creation of its own energy system. New power positions This new energy system, however, led to the creation of new dynamics of power, position and political representation, where those in control did not oversee just the flow of energy, but also had the power to slow it down or disrupt it. The coal mining strikes of the 1980s, which Margaret Thatcher termed as an ‘enemy within’, is the perfect example of such power and agency. But with oil, things became different. While the power of the ‘enemy within’ diminished, the anchoring of ghost hectares in OPEC countries continued, to the extent of nearly 50% energy dependency in 2013. Nevertheless, an analysis reveals that for the first time in 2019, the U.K. generated more electricity from renewables than fossil fuels. While this is a welcome step, and the U.K.’s presidency at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference indicates its commitment towards the Paris Agreement, a lot is yet to be achieved. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU only complicates the issue. The anchoring of coastal ‘ghost hectares’ via offshore wind farms is an example of the choices the country will be forced to weigh up — including the issues around living on a thin critical zone of Earth. Lastly, by the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, it was argued by many scholars that a liberal democracy with access to a free market is the best way to organise societies. An idea that all nations should pursue unequivocally is globalisation. It was envisaged that the infinite expansion would last forever and national citizens will eventually become ‘global citizens’. It was in this swell that the Maastricht Treaty of the 1990s led to the creation of the European Union — a Europe without frontiers. But with Brexit, where do the citizens of the U.K. go? For the first time in centuries, the U.K. faces these constraints together, with an added burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will have to learn to pass this astounding hailstorm and become ‘earthbound’, as French sociologist Bruno Latour calls it, and rethink its organising structure and the relationship it will have with its land.

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Climate and consciousness||It is common to hear policymakers and the public refer to natural disasters, such as this year’s Himalayan glacier flooding that overwhelmed Uttarakhand, or the cold snap that paralysed Texas, as “acts of God”. But what precipitated both events was not the hand of God, but human-made global warming. Unless climate change is tagged as a primary culprit, climate action will continue to falter. The melting of the Himalayan glaciers that prompted the floods and landslides in Uttarakhand have the fingerprints of global warming. In 2013, glacial flooding caused over 6,000 deaths in Uttarakhand during the monsoon months. The United States has already witnessed many deadly avalanches since the beginning of 2021. Furthermore, as glacier cover is replaced by water or land, the amount of light reflected decreases, aggravating warming — a contributor to the sweltering heat in cities like Delhi and Hyderabad, or the epic floods in Chennai or Kerala. The extreme cold weather in Texas, like the double-digit negative temperatures seen in Germany earlier this year, is connected to Arctic-peninsula warming, at a rate almost twice the global average. Usually, there is a collection of winds around the Arctic keeping the cold locked far to the north. But global warming has caused gaps in these protective winds, allowing intensely cold air to move south — a phenomenon that is accelerating. When the public connects cause and effect, responses are usually swift. But global warming is still seen as a danger that lies over the horizon. So, while COVID-19 triggered the mobilisation of trillions of dollars in financing, the equally frightening climate scenario has not. For India, the third-largest carbon emitter after China and the United States, a decisive switch is needed from highly polluting coal and petroleum to cleaner and renewable power sources. China has announced carbon neutrality by 2060, Japan and South Korea by 2050, but India is yet to announce a target. The acceleration of hazards of nature should prompt countries to advance those targets, ideally by a decade. The stakes are laid out in alarming reports, which show that India is particularly vulnerable. While HSBC ranks India at the top among 67 nations in climate vulnerability (2018), Germanwatch ranks India fifth among 181 nations in terms of climate risks (2020). But public spending does not reflect these perils. Budgetary allocations A vital step should be explicitly including policies for climate mitigation in the government budget, along with energy, roads, health and education. Specifically, growth targets should include timelines for switching to cleaner energy. The government needs to launch a major campaign to mobilise climate finance. Even if major economies speed up climate mitigation, catastrophes like Uttarakhand will become more frequent due to the accumulated carbon emissions in the atmosphere. So, climate adaptation needs to be a priority. India’s Central and State governments must increase allocations for risk reduction, such as better defences against floods, or agricultural innovations to withstand droughts. A big worry is that the Uttarakhand government and the Centre have been diluting, instead of strengthening, climate safeguards for hydroelectric and road projects. Studies had flagged ice loss across the Himalayas, and the dangers to densely populated catchments, but policy response has been lacking. Similarly, Kerala ignored a landmark study calling for regulation of mining, quarrying and dam construction in ecologically sensitive places, which contributed to the massive floods and landslides in 2018 and 2019. Sustainable growth depends on timely climate action. For that to happen, policymaking needs to connect the dots between carbon emissions, atmospheric warming, melting glaciers, extreme floods and storms. Events like Uttarakhand and Texas should be treated as lessons to change people’s minds and for the public to demand urgent action.

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Sustaining the drive||Three days into the second phase of the vaccination drive, there appears to be palpable enthusiasm among senior citizens, the focus of the exercise. About 8.4 lakh beneficiaries above 60 have been vaccinated so far as have 1.04 lakh over 45 with co-morbidities. By comparison, when the first phase began on January 16 for health-care workers — data as on January 18 showed that 3.8 lakh beneficiaries were inoculated. Thus, the uptake in the initial days of the second phase seems marginally better. The early days of vaccinations are outliers to the average experience. Well-publicised shots of the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, Health Ministers and other prominent public Ministers are not always indicative of the overall public confidence in the vaccines. Similarly, reports of technical glitches in registration and the inability to register do not reflect the fact that these aspects tend to smoothen out over time and people figure out what is optimal for them. The figures from the Health Ministry suggest that so far about 12.5 million health-care and frontline workers have been vaccinated with a single shot, still quite a distance from the 30 million target announced by the government earlier this year. About a third of the health-care workers have turned up for the second shot (prescribed to be administered within four to six weeks of the first); however, of the 57.62 lakh frontline workers inoculated since February 2 (when the drive commenced for them) only 3,277 have turned up for their second dose (the slots for which opened earlier this week). Unless these numbers pick in the next few days, vaccination hesitancy will need to be addressed as a serious problem. Doctors and nurses, who comprise health-care workers, are medically sophisticated. They are familiar with the mechanics of dosages, immunity, and are not representative of the vast majority of India where there is confusion, misinformation and inadequate knowledge about vaccination. In these respects, the frontline workers are more similar to the 250 million-plus seniors and those above 45 than health-care workers. Therefore, the Centre must work magnitudes harder to ensure that the benefits of vaccination are communicated more broadly in the country. The other challenge is that senior citizens must mediate a technological tool — the CoWIN website — to access vaccines. The state has, thoughtfully, enabled provisions whereby medical personnel will actively reach out to groups of elderly. It is also important that the early enthusiasm must be sustained enough for people to turn up for both shots. Emerging evidence suggests that it is the second shot that plays a more important role in long-lasting protection. This month is already seeing a national uptick in fresh infections with the chances of a possible second wave on the horizon. A successful vaccination drive is critical to being prepared for it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sustaining-the-drive/article33984455.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Rape and marriage||A relationship between two individuals, including marriage, is built around love, respect, trust and consent. Within that civilised framework, a violent and exploitative act like rape has no place. Seen in that context, the Supreme Court’s latest query to a Maharashtra government employee asking whether he would marry a girl he was accused of raping repeatedly while she was a minor is insensitive to the core. By offering marriage as a solution to a rape victim, the judiciary failed to protect the rights of a girl. Instead of meting out harsh punishment, the Court asked the lawyer representing the accused to find out whether his client would be willing to marry the victim or risk going to jail. Equal rights activists have always worked hard against misogyny, patriarchal mindsets and other failings such as blaming the victim for rape. This arduous battle for equality becomes even more difficult when people in high offices make offensive remarks. On Monday, the Chief Justice of India (CJI), Sharad A. Bobde, told the lawyer of the rape accused, “We are not forcing you….” The lawyer later told the Court that his client refused to marry the girl because he was already married. In his petition, the accused recounted the allegations that he sexually abused the girl since she was in high school, and also that he had threatened the minor. In another case, the Bench stayed the arrest of a man accused of rape after falsely promising marriage. The victim said she was promised marriage and was “brutally and sexually abused”. The CJI asked the girl’s lawyer: “When two people are living as husband and wife, however brutal the husband is, can you call sexual intercourse between them ‘rape’?” In both cases, these crimes attract severe penalties under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013. On marital rape, though the recommendation was not included in the Act, the Justice J.S. Verma Committee was clear the law ought to specify that a marital or another relationship between the perpetrator and victim cannot be a defence against sexual violation. Citing the judgment of the European Commission of Human Rights in C.R. vs U.K. , it endorsed the conclusion that “a rapist remains a rapist regardless of his relationship with the victim”. In Shimbhu & Anr vs State of Haryana (2013), the Supreme Court said the offer of a rapist to marry the victim cannot be used to reduce the sentence prescribed by law. When the scars of the Nirbhaya case are still raw, and a series of rape and murders are being reported against minors, especially Dalits, in Uttar Pradesh, the judiciary’s shocking remarks echo a deep-set prejudice against gender equality. The law should deliver justice, not blatantly tilt the scales against women’s rights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rape-and-marriage/article33984456.ece

In a press release on Wednesday, ISMA said market reports indicated that the average prices in Tamil Nadu hovered between Rs. 3,200 and Rs. 3,225 a quintal, Rs. 3,160 to Rs. 3,180 in northern States and in Maharashtra and Karnataka at a minimum selling price of Rs. 3,100 a quintal. The current prices are Rs. 80 to Rs. 100 a quintal less than the prices during the corresponding period last year. This has adversely affected the liquidity of sugar mills. “If such a situation persists, cane price arrears will jump very fast to uncomfortable levels,” the association said. It appealed to the government to increase the MSP for sugar to Rs. 34.50 a kg. “There is a need to quickly decide on increasing the MSP of sugar to ensure that sugar mills are able to pay to farmers on time,” it said. During the 2020-2021 sugar season that commenced on October 1 last year, 502 sugar mills started operations, and 98 mills across the country ended operations by February 28, 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/raise-minimum-selling-price-for-sugar-to-rs-3450-a-kg-isma/article33984431.ece
04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Govt. can cut excise on fuels by Rs. 8.5 sans revenue impact’||The Centre has room to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by up to Rs. 8.5 per litre without impacting its target for revenue from the tax on the two fuels, analysts said. Petrol and diesel prices hover at a historic high following a relentless increase in rates over the past nine months. There have been calls by opposition parties as well as sections of society to reduce excise duty to ease consumer pain. “We estimate excise duty on auto fuels in FY22, if it is not cut, at Rs. 4.35 lakh crore versus budget estimate of Rs. 3.2 lakh crore. “Thus, even if excise duty is cut by Rs. 8.5 per litre on or before April 1, FY22E budget estimate can be met,” ICICI Securities said in a note. The firm expressed optimism for an excise duty cut given demand recovery, impending privatisation and inflation concerns but expect it to be more modest than Rs. 8.5 a litre. Excise duty was raised by Rs. 13 and Rs. 16 per litre on petrol and diesel between March and May 2020, and now stands at Rs. 31.8 on diesel and Rs. 32.9 per litre on petrol. The increase was to mop up gains arising from international crude oil prices falling to a two-decade low. But, with oil prices recovering, it has not yet restored the taxes to their original levels. “If the cut is more modest... FY22 excise duty will be higher than budget estimate,” ICICI Securities said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-can-cut-excise-on-fuels-by-rs-85-sans-revenue-impact/article33984441.ece

Under this, the managing director (MD) or chief executive officer (CEO) of market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) will be obligated to frame a code of conduct and put in place an institutional mechanism. Further, the board of directors needs to ensure compliance by the MD/CEO in this regard. MIIs will have to formulate a code of conduct to regulate, monitor and report trading by their designated persons and immediate relative of designated persons towards achieving compliance with the prohibition of insider trading regulations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sebi-calls-for-mechanism-to-prevent-market-abuse/article33984434.ece
04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Spectrum will boost Jio, Bharti’s market share’||The strengthening of spectrum footprints by Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio in the just-concluded auctions is expected to yield market share gains for the two telcos, arming them with sustainable advantage in the long run and for 5G play, according to analysts. With the auctions completed, it would be key to monitor Vodafone Idea Ltd.’s (VIL) balance sheet and its potential capital raising, signals of price hike, unveiling of a Jio-Google smartphone, and 5G spectrum auctions, they noted. Analysts across-the-board concurred with the government’s view that at Rs. 77,814 crore of total bids, the spectrum auction outcome and response had surpassed expectations. Goldman Sachs noted that Bharti and Jio had “significantly” bolstered their spectrum footprints, and that strengthening of radiowave holdings “could aid their market shares while at the same time keeping capex under check”. In all service areas and bands, spectrum was sold at reserve prices, indicating that this higher-than-expected participation was a function of telcos looking to secure their medium-term spectrum needs rather than a result of a bidding war, the firm said.  ‘Tariffs may rise’ The more-than-expected participation from telcos in the auctions increases the probability of a price hike as a way to offset the increase in leverage, market watchers said. “While the March ’21 auction was largely a non-event for Vodafone Idea, the company’s limited ability to participate in future 5G spectrum auctions (due to its stretched balance sheet) could result in further erosion of its market share,” Goldman Sachs said. Moody’s Investors Service said spectrum renewals will help incumbents protect their market positions while additional bandwidth purchases will drive improved network coverage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/spectrum-will-boost-jio-bhartis-market-share/article33984443.ece
04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||IRCON shares fall 7% on govt. stake sale bid||Shares of IRCON International Ltd. on Wednesday closed with more than 7% losses after the government announced its plan to pare stake in the railway entity. On BSE, the scrip dived 6.9% to close at Rs. 91.1. On the National Stock Exchange, the shares ended 7.25% lower at Rs. 90.8. DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey on Tuesday tweeted: “Offer for Sale in IRCON opens tomorrow for Non Retail Investors. Day 2 for Retail Investors.” The offer for sale (OFS) for up to 16% government stake at a floor price of Rs. 88 per share in IRCON will open on Wednesday, as per a regulatory filing by the company on Tuesday. The base issue size of the OFS is 10% or more than 4.70 crore equity shares, with a green-shoe option to retain over-subscription of 6% or more than 2.82 crore shares. The total issue size, including green-shoe option, comes to 16 per cent or over 7.52 crore shares. The Centre holds 89.18% stake in IRCON, which is into construction of transportation infrastructure. At the floor price, a 16% stake would fetch more than Rs. 600 crore for the exchequer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/ircon-shares-fall-7-on-govt-stake-sale-bid/article33984444.ece

04 March 2021||Kochi,||KPL a stepping stone for MA players||Three years ago when Kochi football club RFC picked eight players from Kothamangalam's Mar Athanasius College for the Kerala Premier League, a new thought ran in Haary Benny's mind. “I thought why not we try the league too,” Benny, the MA Football Academy coach told The Hindu at the Maharaja's Stadium here after a friendly against Golden Threads FC. And two years ago, the team lost 1-2 to the Kerala Santosh Trophy team. That loss made Benny make up his mind about the KPL and it was not difficult to convince the MA College management. Commendable The MA Football Academy made its KPL debut last season and finished a commendable third in the group. “We beat Kerala Police, which had many Santosh Trophy players, 3-0 and also Tirur's SAT 1-0 in our first year,” said the coach. The KPL begins in Kochi and Thrissur on Saturday and Benny feels that it will be a lot tougher this time. “And with teams like Kerala United, Kerala Blasters (reserves) and KSEB, our Group-B is the tougher one. But I like this group because it will offer my players some good experience. Win or lose, everything is experience,” he said. Chance to be noticed “We consider the KPL as a stepping stone to the next level. This will offer a chance to be watched and be taken by big clubs. And if a team like Gokulam Kerala says that it wants one of our players, we will give him immediately.” All the players of the MA FA are from the college. “We are a college team. Except Abhilash who plays as a striker, all our player are from our college. Abhilash also passed out from our college and had played for Bengaluru's South United Club earlier,” said Benny. “Since we don't pay salary to our players, our total expenses come to around Rs. 3 lakh per season if you take out the food and accommodation expenses. For other clubs, it could cost them something like Rs. 10 lakh.” Like last season, MA hopes to finish among the top three in the group. “But it will be great if we make it to the top two and the semifinal.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kpl-a-stepping-stone-for-ma-players/article33984739.ece
04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaidehi lets Bulgaru off the hook||Vaidehi Chaudhari had the big fish in her hook before letting it slip from her grasp in the first round of the $15,000 ITF women’s tennis tournament at the DLTA Complex here on Wednesday. Second seed Miriam Bianca Bulgaru clawed back after losing the first set to turn the tables on Vaidehi 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Ranked more than 700 places below the 364th-ranked Bulgaru, Vaidehi matched her opponent stroke for stroke. Energetic She was quite energetic, covering the court for nearly three hours, under the scorching sun. A trainee of Altevol-Waske Academy in Ahmedabad, Vaidehi failed to drive home the advantage while leading 3-1 in the second set after having won the first. In the decider too, Vaidehi missed an opportunity to make a fight of it. Vaidehi converted just four of 12 break points while Bulgaru nosed ahead by converting five of 10 break points. Bulgaru will face qualifier Sai Samhitha in the second round after the latter beat fellow qualifier Sharmada Balu in three sets. A fruitful day Jennifer Luikham had a fruitful day, beating Smriti Bhasin 6-4, 6-2 and setting up a pre-quarterfinal against top seed Riya Bhatia. She later partnered Mihika Yadav to knock out second-seeded Rutuja Bhosale and Snehal Mane for the loss of just six games.  The results:   Singles (first round): Jennifer Luikham bt Smriti Bhasin 6-4, 6-2; Ashmitha Easwaramurthi bt Bhuvana Kalva 6-3, 2-6, 6-4; Sowjanya Bavisetti bt Sathwika Sama 6-3, 6-2; Adrienn Nagy (Hun) bt Nidhi Chilumula 6-0, 2-6, 6-0.

04 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||‘Curators don’t have a choice’||Ever since the first Test match here in 1983 till the last one before this series in 2012, Dhiraj Parsana was the curator who laid out the pitch for every five-day game in Ahmedabad. The veteran, now retired after serving the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) for more than three decades following a successful career as a left-arm bowler, admits that modern-day curators don’t have a choice but to cater to demands of the home team. “Call them curators or groundsmen, I feel they are never allowed to prepare pitches their way. It’s been going on for the last 10 years. When I was a curator, my sincere attempt was to make a pitch that would last the whole duration of the game,” Parsana, 73, told The Hindu here on Tuesday. A former member of BCCI’s Pitch and Curators’ Committee, Parsana feels curators are obliged to offer what is asked of them.  “He (curator) is an employee, so he has to follow orders. I was an employee of GCA for 36 years. In such case, you have to listen. If you are honorary, you can say I will do it my way. That’s the way it goes.” Parsana famously stood his ground and refused to shave the grass off ahead of India’s Test against South Africa here in April, 2008. It resulted in the host being bowled out in the first session of the match by the Proteas’ pace attack led by Dale Steyn and losing the match by an innings. “They asked me why there was some live grass and I told them that the pitch has to bind together considering the heat. My theory is the pitch should last five days and the batsmen and bowlers should get the result with their skills,” he said. Refusing to comment on the pitches during India’s ongoing series against England, Parsana said he was no one to comment since even the England team has refrained from criticising the pitches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/curators-dont-have-a-choice/article33984862.ece
04 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||WTC final spot on the line, pitch still the focus in Motera showdown||Despite India’s attempts to shift the narrative away from a sub-standard surface for the third Test, the pitch will remain the focal point on the first morning of the fourth and final Test against England. While the visiting team has been cautious in reacting to the pitch, it will be interesting to see whether Joe Root & Co. can put up a fight after being annihilated in the previous two Tests. Such was the dominance of India’s spin duo in the second and third matches that England’s win in the series-opener seems to be almost forgotten. It will be a monumental task, in terms of skill-set and mindset, for England’s batsmen to be competitive against the relentless pair of R. Ashwin and Axar Patel at Motera over the next five days. In addition to the spinners’ onslaught, England will also have to counter the dry heat here, with the mercury soaring higher with every passing day. The rising temperature may also result in the pitch crumbling faster than anticipated, thus making the lives of England’s batsmen even more difficult. Out of contention Despite the odds stacked firmly against it, England, if it can get its act together, can play spoilsport for India in the race for the World Test Championship final on yet another spin-friendly track. England is out of contention, but India cannot afford to lose the last Test if it wants to set up a grand finale against New Zealand at Lord’s in June. India captain Virat Kohli tried his best to play down the WTC angle during his interaction on Wednesday. Still, with veterans Ajinkya Rahane and Ishant Sharma having equated WTC with the World Cup, the Indian camp will be eager to seal the final spot in style. In its quest, India will be without pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah for the second time this series. Bumrah has been released from the squad after the third Test for his impending wedding. In his absence, Umesh Yadav is set to return in white flannels. With his outstanding record in India, Umesh is likely to be preferred over Mohammed Siraj, the other pacer in the squad. Despite Washington Sundar having played little part in the pink-ball Test, either with bat or ball, he is set to be persisted with in the fourth Test. Besides the minor tinkering with its combination, India will be hoping for the specialist batsmen to fire. Barring opener Rohit Sharma, no Indian batsman has been able to score runs consistently so far in challenging conditions and they would be eager to turn the tide around. England, meanwhile, has no option but to recall offie Dom Bess at the cost of one of its pacers. It remains to be seen who partners Jofra Archer on Thursday. As for the batting department, England will be tempted to replace Jonny Bairstow, who returned with a pair at Motera last week, with youngster Dan Lawrence.  The teams (from):   India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Ajinkya Rahane (vice-capt.), Rohit Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, K.L. Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Rishabh Pant (wk), Wriddhiman Saha (wk), R. Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, and Mohammed Siraj.   England: Joe Root (Capt.), Rory Burns, Dom Sibley, Zak Crawley, Dan Lawrence, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope, Ben Foakes (wk), Dom Bess, Jack Leach, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Jofra Archer, Olly Stone, and Mark Wood.   On-field umpires: Nitin Menon and Virender Sharma; Third umpire: Anil Chaudhary; Fourth umpire: Shamshuddin; Match referee: Javagal Srinath.   Hours of play: 9.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m.; 12.10 p.m. to 2.10 p.m.; 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wtc-final-spot-on-the-line-pitch-still-the-focus-in-motera-showdown/article33984561.ece
04 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Satisfying season for HFC: Marquez||Hyderabad FC coach Manuel Manolo Marquez said he is immensely proud of his boys after the team finished fifth with 29 points from 20 games — winning six, losing three and drawing the rest — in this season’s ISL. “It has been a very satisfying season for all of us at HFC. We need to be more ambitious and look beyond the next game,” Marquez said during a media interaction here on Wednesday. “The message to the boys was clear. Show that there is a change in the attitude and the fact that we came so close to making it to the semifinals is proof of that. “We tried to improve with each game. I cannot specifically pin-point as to what went wrong in eventually not making it to the knock-out phase. There are a lot of gains this season and even there are areas with scope for improvement,” Marquez added. “Honestly, the competition was equal right through this edition. “Too many draws were the issue of debate for us. “The biggest challenge has been the bio-bubble. It was never easy as 24x7 we were either on the pitch or in the dressing room or in the hotel.” Marquez said: “At the end of it all, six HFC players making it to the Indian camp makes all of us really proud. They are quality players and deserve bigger exposure.” On the issue of selecting local talent in the squad, Marquez said efforts will be made to identify deserving players and he will be more than happy to find them and play them in the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/satisfying-season-for-hfc-marquez/article33985165.ece

04 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||‘Defensive skills have fallen behind’||In addition to provoking a debate over turning tracks, the ongoing series between India and England has also exposed the lack of skills while batting on spin-friendly pitches. India captain Virat Kohli admitted that the increasing emphasis on short-form cricket has compromised the defensive skills of batsmen. “Defence is very important,” Kohli said on Wednesday. “From the pattern I’ve seen in Test cricket — take any match, if two batsmen are facing a 45-minute period of difficult bowling, are they able to score 10 runs and survive without offering any chances? “Because of the influence of white-ball cricket, we’re getting results in Test cricket, but we also have this by-product that defence, which is also a part of the game, is getting compromised. This is why people say, score 300-350 quickly. I don't think they focus on that grind of four or five sessions these days, probably because they don’t focus on defence so much, because they're needing to switch formats, and the game is very fast-paced.” Kohli reiterated the requirement of a strong defensive technique for batsmen to succeed on dust-bowls. Own method “There is a requirement for skill in playing on spinning tracks, and not necessarily just playing the sweep. You find your own method, and from my point of view, my best solution is a defensive shot, where I know I can defend and the ball won’t go to silly-point or short-leg, and that’s an aspect of the game that’s fallen behind.” The third Test of the series lasted a little over five sessions and turned out to be the shortest Test in terms of balls since World War II. It has led to several fans venting their ire for being robbed of witnessing a contest at the newly built stadium. Kohli didn’t answer a direct query on whether teams are robbing fans of quality Test cricket in a bid to make the most of home advantage. “It would be lovely if you asked us this question on an England/New Zealand/Australia tour,” he said. “Not when you’ve seen two turning pitches in India, so that question for me is irrelevant at this point of time.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/defensive-skills-have-fallen-behind/article33984563.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Sharath survives, Sathiyan falls at the first hurdle||Sharath Kamal won a close five-game battle against Czech Republic’s Pavel Sirucek minutes before G. Sathiyan lost to Aruna Quadri in the opening round of the World Table Tennis Contender event in Doha on Wednesday. Sharath, ranked 32nd, twice led by a game but still had to go the distance for a 17-15, 9-11, 11-6, 8-11, 11-9 triumph. Sathiyan, ranked 37th, found World No. 21 Quadri too hot to handle. The Nigerian won 11-7, 11-4, 11-8. Sharath’s roller-coaster ride was laced with long, exciting rallies and plenty of action. In the initial phase of the marathon opening game, Sharath faltered with his serves and also when receiving them. To his credit, Sharath focused on getting some rhythm, battled back from 7-10 to save three game-points and led 11-10. He squandered four successive game-points before Sirucek moved to 15-14. Undeterred, Sharath kept attacking and won the next three points to seize the game. In the second, Sharath stayed ahead until 8-6 but the fighting Czech produced four straight points and capitalised on his second game-point to level the match 1-1. If Sharath dominated the third game, Sirucek returned the favour in the fourth to force a decider. Sharath jumped to leads of 5-1, 7-2 and 9-5 but the lanky Czech clawed back to 9-10 before netting a backhand on the third match-point. The highest-ranked Indian next plays World No. 7 Yun-Ju Lin of Chinese Taipei.

04 March 2021||KOZHIKODE,||KCA T20 league from Saturday||This weekend, quality competitive cricket will finally be back in Kerala. The Kodak KCA Presidents Cup T20 league, which kicks off at Alappuzha on Saturday, is the biggest cricket tournament to be staged in the State after the coronavirus pandemic broke out a year ago. With the Kerala team in New Delhi for the knockout phase of the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the first half of the six-team, double round-robin tournament will be devoid of big stars. Chance for fringe players That, however, could present a big opportunity for the fringe players, according to S. Ramesh, who heads the game development and operations of Kerala Cricket Association (KCA). “One of the objectives of this tournament is to identify fresh talent,” the former Kerala Ranji Trophy captain-turned administrator told The Hindu on Wednesday. “The under-23 and 19 players constitute about 50% of the teams.” He said players who were not part of Kerala’s age-group teams would also get a chance to showcase their talent. “After deciding to conduct the league, we had written to all the 14 district associations to give us a list of their best players,” Ramesh said. “We already have created a pool of 90 players and that would become a wider in the coming years.” MoU The KCA has signed an MoU with Twenty First Century Media to conduct the league for three years. “Because of COVID-19, we cannot allow spectators for this year's tournament, but all the matches will be streamed live on fancode.com,” said Ramesh. KCAsecretarySreejith V. Nair said the fans could watch the cricketers of their region in action. “KCA has been developing high quality infrastructure over the past few years to provide adequate facilities for aspiring cricketers from across the state,” he said. The 18-day event, which can also be seen as a precursor to a proper T20 professional league for Kerala, will have 33 games. The six teams are Panthers, Eagles, Lions, Tigers, Royals and Tuskers.

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||We have no scars, insists Root||England skipper Joe Root wants his batsmen to figure out a way to score runs and not worry about the pitch too much in the fourth Test that starts on Thursday. “I think the most important thing is that as a batting group we are very clear about how to play. We are going to the game full of confidence, we have no scars from the last two and we will play in a controlled but fearless way,” said Root. “We shouldn't be scared about the surface in any sort of way or about the guys bowling on it. It is really important that we stay very calm, clear about how we are going to score runs and trust both defence and those shots that make us the players we are,” he added. When asked about his take on how the pitch will play, Root said, “It is looking very similar to what it was two days out from the last games as well. We will see. I mean, it could change again overnight. I think the most important thing is that we learn all the lessons from the last two two Test matches and make sure we're better for it. “It is important that if we get ourselves in a similar position in the first innings, we really make that count. And try and get some scoreboard pressure in the game, you know, early on.” Root also hinted that off-spinner Dom Bess, who was dropped after the first Chennai Test, will be in contention for selection.  I definitely don’t think we underestimated him. I think he’s exploited the surface very well Rooton Axar||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-have-no-scars-says-root/article33984565.ece

Pension The Council also decided to release the pension to all the First Class cricketers and also provide an insurance cover of Rs. 3 lakhs to the entire staff of HCA and Rs. 5 lakhs each for all the club secretaries.

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Cosmic process explained||Sastras explain the mystery of relativity of the cosmic process of creation and dissolution against the backdrop of Time. In the eighth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord explains that there is His Supreme Abode which is beyond this endless cyclic course and also beyond the limits of Time. This is the ultimate goal to be attained by each and every being including Brahma, pointed out Srimati Sunanda in a discourse. The entire creation, spanning the worlds of Brahma, Indra, and other regions right to the smallest item in earth is subject to change, that is, birth, growth and decay and death and then rebirth. Sastras also have quantified Time in terms of the yugas. There are four yugas, the Krita, the Treta, the Dwapara and the Kali. The time duration of each of them is fixed and the total of all these figures is known as one thousand divine years. To the human mind, it is a multiple of several thousands of human years. Each Yuga is distinct in its moral character. Virtue is dominant in Krita, and in the Treta, Dwapara and Kali yugas that follow, sin and moral degradation slowly enter and the present Kali Yuga is the worst, where conflict, sin and adharma dominate. One day of Brahma of a thousand divine years is the period of cosmic manifestation and one night of Brahma of equal length of time is the period of non-manifestation. When Brahma sleeps all beings enter into state of cosmic sleep. It does not mean we get liberated. We get back to the cycle of birth when Brahma wakes up. Then creation takes place once again and all beings, the gods, human beings, etc, come into existence. But there is another Pralaya that takes place after 100 years of Brahma. The entire universe is dissolved, including Brahma who enters the absolute.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/cosmic-process-explained/article33984556.ece

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A new chapter||In a corner of the bustling Chennai Book Fair — with its nearly 700 stalls — are racks that contain self-published Tamil works. Here, authors directly walk up to you and explain their content. You can have a chat with them, and decide if you would like to pick up the book; 12 city authors who have self-published their material have set up such racks in a first-of-its-kind initiative at the 44th Chennai Book Fair. “Some of these authors do not have money to hire a stall, so we give them a rack for Rs. 8,000 where they can display upto 50 titles and have the chance to directly interact with the audience they are writing for,” says RS Shanmugam, president of the Book Sellers and Publishers Association of South India (BAPASI). Some of them are ‘lockdown authors’. “There are people who have taken up reading during the lockdown period, and have gone on to write and publish their own books now.” Many miles away in Sri Lanka, Tamil writer Aishwarya Sajeevakumar has published 22 books in less than a year through Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP). She is part of a mushrooming breed of Tamil ‘authorpreneurs’ who are following their passion to follow their creative dreams and also earn a substantial income from it. Money matters The Tamil diaspora is the audience for authors taking this route. Oman-based Senthilbalan Manickam, who describes himself as a ‘doctor by profession, a writer by heart’, knows that quite well. Writing under the name Sen Balan, he is the brain behind hit Tamil mystery Parangi Malai Irayil Nilayam that features fictional detective Karthick Aldo; he has managed to amass fans across the globe. “From 2004 till 2016, I have been writing blogs and multiple literary works without thinking much about the monetisation part of it,” he recalls. That changed when he heard of self-publishing for Kindle. The first time he contributed a story for it was when he wrote a 5,000-word thriller titled Siram Thara Virumbu ; Senthilbalan spent just two days in the creative process and published it. “Even my wife did not know that it was published then. After a week, I told a few of my friends who bought it online. The first amount of Rs. 17 per book that I received was negligible when I compare it with what I earn from my doctor profession, but it gave me immense happiness.” The situation is a little different for Aishwarya, who has been writing under the name Aadvika Pommu for the past two years. Her husband, based in the US, unexpectedly lost his job due to the pandemic, and it was upto Aishwarya to keep the family running. Writing and self-publishing online came to her rescue. “Had I opted for print books, it would have been difficult reaching physical copies to Tamilians across the world,” says Aishwarya, who was one of the finalists of the Amazon KDP Pen to Publish Contest .  Aishwarya is a civil engineer, but her heart is set on writing; she is currently working on a story revolving around DNA editing titled Brahman. With 22 books out since August 2019, Aadvika Pommu is not only earning fans but also making more money that she envisioned to. “I earn more from self-publishing my work online than my salary,” she says proudly. Digital dreams The pandemic saw people doing two things to keep themselves occupied: getting back to reading, or digging into OTT platforms. ‘Cable’ Sankar, popular Chennai-based writer, tries giving them a taste of both. With a bundle offer priced at Rs. 930, Sankar is giving his fans the option to choose six of his books and six months of OTT subscription to Moviewud, a platform he promotes. “A family might have both readers and viewers, and this is a way to reach out to both of them,” says Sankar. Three of his recent self-published novels — 24 Salanangalin Enn , Naan Sharmi Vairam and Bermuda — have sold more than 1,800 copies. C Saravanakarthikeyan, known as CSK in literary circles, has also come out with self-published works like Kanni Theevu , Appleukku Mun and 96: Thaniperunkadhal . Today, these authors do not need the help of publishing houses for feedback, but know it first-hand due to technological advancements. “Like an entrepreneur, authors can now experiment with the marketing of their creative works based on factors like what kind of content sells and which ones gets downloaded more. All these empower authorpreneurs, a concept that will surely pick up in the years to come,” he says.  Log on and read Publishing your Tamil work for the world is the new normal. “Tamil authors, even from small towns, are now able to connect with the readers across the world through publishing on Kindle,” says Vaishali Aggarwal, head, Amazon KDP – India. “New authors who embraced self-publishing using KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing) to become published authors in India doubled in 2020 as compared to 2019,” she adds. Aspiring authors can check out the ongoing KDP Pen to Publish contest by submitting their entries on amazon.in/pentopublish||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-new-chapter/article33985038.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A knotty story||Love found them easily but it took 10 months for Maya McManus and her fiancé Shamaun Ahmed to find an authority to solemnise their nikkah.  “It was quite the hunt,” laughs Maya, as the couple was keen on having a womanqaziconduct the wedding. “There was no information anywhere either online or in person,” she says. They got in touch with the Bhartiya Mahila Muslim Andolan (BMMA), Mumbai, and got a lead. And in December 2018, just a month before their wedding in Kolkata, Maya and Shamaun found Hakima Khatoon, their qazi . “I didn’t know what the legalities were. Around the same time I saw a newspaper article that said it was legal for women to become qazis ,” says Maya, adding that both her family and her fiancé’s were quite proud about this decision and there was no opposition. Hakima, on her part, was delighted. “It gave me immense satisfaction to carry out such a big task successfully. Everybody was excited to see a woman qazi ,” says Hakima of her first-ever tryst with this profession. An employee then with Nari-O-Shishu-Kalyan Kendra in Howrah, West Bengal, which counsels women and works with victims of domestic violence, Hakima says when the opportunity presented itself to train as a qazi in 2017, she signed up for it, along with her colleague Jamila Lasker. “Before setting out to pursue my course in Gujarat and Mumbai, I spoke to the imam at the mosque and he assured me it was absolutely fine as there are equal rights for all in Islam,” she says, adding that during the lockdown, she was approached by a number of women who were interested in signing up with a woman qazi . Recently, actor Dia Mirza’s wedding was officiated by a woman priest. The foray of women into priesthood is a progressive trend but not entirely new. In the ‘80s and ‘90s, Kolkata-based Gauri Dharmapal conducted a clutch of weddings, including that of actor Aparna Sen’s elder daughter. Gauri’s daughter, Rohini Dharmapal, who carries on the tradition is currently booked till 2023. “When ‘high’ society people engage a female priest it is more or less a style statement but when the middle class does it, it is a sign that the society is changing,” says Rohini. Updating tradition “My mother was a Sanskrit teacher at Lady Brabourne College. She translated Sanskritmantrasinto Bengali to make it understandable for all at the wedding,” says Rohini. Now Rohini and her team also explain themantrasin English if the bride and groom ask for it. “One of the things that ma did was talk families out of performing kanyadaan ,” says Rohini. In her capacity, Rohini also encourages families to do away with practices that are “considered regressive”. She explains how, in the Vedas, the wedding is about promises that the couple makes to one another. Rituals like maala badal , sindur daan , kanyadaan ... came much later. “Why should the bride alone wear sindur to depict that she is married? Why should she cover her face? Why should the mother of the bride not attend a ceremony? We don’t advocate wearing shaakha pola either. We do not force, we just educate. My son says we must reform with the times.” Agrees Brahmaramba Maheshwari, a woman priest based out of Mysuru. “The bride is not an object. So why use the word daan ?” she says. Since 2000, she has conducted more than 1,000 weddings as well as griha pravesh pujas , upanayana and homams . This awareness is spreading across India, and also the world. The current slew of Indian women priests have travelled far and wide from Detroit to Darjeeling binding people in holy matrimony. They also organise online classes for learners in India, Sweden, Australia etc. Nagpur-based Shuba Tai trained at a mandir in her city. “There is no fixed duration for the course. It depends on one’s grasping power. It could take six months to a year or more,” says Shuba. She started practising at around the same time as Brahmaramba. It was a male-dominated field back then, she says. “They asked, ‘why are you doing a man’s work?’ But as more people encouraged me, I went ahead with it.” She has noticed a lot more women entering this profession. “ Shaadi havan is quite elaborate and it takes time to master it,” she adds. Beauty in simplicity With women becoming independent, they no longer want to adhere to age-old customs that take away from the progress society is making, says Shuba. She adds, “I was conducting a wedding in Bihar, where the bride’s mother was insistent on kanyadaan but the bride and groom refused,” says Shuba, adding that sometimes they are not just priests but also end up as the referee. Rohini had to intervene when a family brought their daughter who did not want to wear sindoor . “They expected me to take up for them but I, of course, was on the daughter’s side,” she says. More than over-the-top rituals, what is important is to understand what the Veda says, adds Brahmaramba. “It says commitment is very important. Once you hold hands, you don’t leave. I explain everything in detail so the participants at the ceremony understand what themantrasmean,” she says, explaining the meaning of the word vivah . It comes from vi meaning  special relation between body, mind and soul, and vah meaning vahana , a vehicle that carries them ahead. For Rohini, what gives her satisfaction is when the couple chants themantrastogether and understands each word. “They are able to understand it because I translate it for them,” she says. As a result, people who got married 50 years back want to get married again to better soak it all in. “A couple celebrating their 10th anniversary in 2022 has already booked me to conduct their wedding all over again,” laughs Rohini. She and her team of six believe in a practical approach. The idea is to modernise it; the rituals are about an hour long. “In the Upanishads it is mentioned, mata nirmata bhavati means mother creates everything,” says Brahmaramba. “We are the boss, so why should we not choose to profess whatever we like.”  Closer home Chennai-based Sheela K Sarath has officiated around 19 weddings in the city as well as in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Mangalore, New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. “I am not an ordained priest,” she says. “I belong to the Brahma Samaj, where any older person close to the family can officiate a wedding,” she says. Watching her father perform weddings, Sheela picked up on it. In 2002, she conducted her niece’s wedding in the US. Interestingly, she also conducted her daughter’s wedding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-knotty-story/article33985052.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A facelift for the past||The Chennai Rail Museum on New Avadi Road is attracting a steady stream of visitors since reopening late last year, post lifting of lockdown restrictions. Whilst the toy train experience alone is something worth the Rs. 50 entry ticket, the museum is home to a treasure trove of information for those prepared to go off the rails to know more about the journey of India’s indigenous train wagon manufacturing history. However, standing out amid the various exhibits and galleries is the recently revamped ICF gallery (previously the Diamond Jubilee gallery). Revamped in late 2019, but closed to the public soon after since a national lockdown was enforced, the ICF gallery takes visitors on a journey — with the help of photographic exhibits and miniature models — from the formative years of Integral Coach Factory to the present day. The re-designed gallery is the handiwork of Chennai-based interior designer Nalini Radhakrishnan, who has previously worked on revamp projects for the Madras High Court museum and the Government Museum in Egmore. The miniatures on display at the ICF gallery reflect the agency’s various contributions over the years to Indian Railways — from humble sleeper coaches to the wagons that are now a part of the Vande Bharat Express. With a chestnut colour scheme, rounded pillars and miniature focus lights (replacing the humble ‘Government office tubelight’) for illuminating the exhibits, the ICF gallery stands out. Nalini, who manages the firm InterScape Interiors and Landscaping, prefers working with wood, as evidenced by the work that has undergone in converting the pillars in the gallery. What were once bland concrete pillars are now dark and glossy. Nalini says she has used actual wood to create a false enclosure around the concrete pillars. “It is the style of pillars you would find in the Madras High Court museum. I took a few Railway officials to show them my work there, and they were impressed by the pillars that they insisted they wanted the same for the ICF gallery as well,” she adds. Nalini, who also undertakes civil projects through her firm, has a history of taking up Government projects, something she says involves balancing differing opinions in terms of conceptualising and aesthetics. For instance, at the ICF gallery, she says the Railways management wanted to use LCD boxes to display archived images of former Prime Ministers, Railway Ministers and the Queen of England visiting the ICF. “I wanted to use stained glass windows for the exhibits and create an arched entrance into the gallery, but the budget wasn’t there,” she adds. Nevertheless, scores of families continue to visit the ICF gallery and revel in the history of the Indian Railways. And also, ride that toy train.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-facelift-for-the-past/article33985051.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Insecurity has driven me this far’||There was a point in Manikandan’s life when he felt he had hit rock bottom. Starting out as a mimicry artiste, he was a runner-up amongst the 600-odd contestants in a television comedy show. He was recognised for his talent, but the question of survival became a reality when the show ended. The only other avenue which he thought was ideal to monetise from was to join radio. He worked as a radio jockey for over two years, before he quit to take up dubbing as a full-time profession. “I have dubbed for most of the actors in Tamil cinema,” says Manikandan with childlike enthusiasm, when we meet at a café in Chennai. He was called for films that needed patch work, sometimes after the censor process, or if an actor was unavailable at that point. As a voice artiste, Manikandan would meet and work with directors and actors at close quarters, but never approached them for an acting gig. The desire to become an actor has always been there, says Manikandan. But everytime he came close to taking the first step, he would put those thoughts aside for the kind of harsh reactions he had to face in the industry. “There are a lot of people who would put you down in the first meeting itself. I lost interest in acting because of the constant rejection and insults,” he says, adding that he went on to work as an assistant director in over 20 films. The only filmmaker with whom he opened up his desire to act was Halitha Shameem, who debuted with Poovarasam Peepee (2014). Though he later landed a much-talked-about character in Halitha’s sophomore feature, Sillu Karupatti (2019), Manikandan says it was Aelay that she had approached him for initially. Focussing on the dynamics between a father and son in a village in Tamil Nadu, Aelay recently had its world première on television. It is soon dropping on Netflix. Manikandan too, is mildly disappointed for the film’s television release, although he admits that the reception for Aelay has been twice as big as Sillu Karupatti , which was a resounding success. “A good film will eventually find its audience. But theatre has its own charm. We have worked with a singular notion that 1,000 people would come and watch our film. That factor has been a miss,” he says. Taking the reins Manikandan’s career trajectory has been directionless, a fact he wholeheartedly accepts and laughs about. He is a mimicry artiste, radio jockey, dialogue writer, actor and director — in 2016, he directed an award-winning indie film Narai Ezhudhum Suyasaridham starring Delhi Ganesh — all at once. “I have half-baked knowledge in each department,” he says with a laugh. He acknowledges that he is not a spontaneous actor; that he insists on reading scripts beforehand and rehearsing, so that he can eliminate the clichés that come with the character he is portraying. In his repertoire, his most recognisable yet substantial character came in Pa Ranjith’s political-drama Kaala , in which he played Lenin, Rajinikanth’s son who goes against the father over ideological differences. Another film which reaffirmed his belief that he was on the right track, as an actor, was Sillu Karupatti . Manikandan prides himself on being a good conversationalist, a quality which gave him the conviction to turn dialogue writer. His first brush with writing, however, came when he was a voice artiste and was out of work, forcing him to write dialogues for Telugu films dubbed in Tamil. But the actual reason, Manikandan says, is the insecurity of being master of none. “Whether it is acting, writing or direction, I always feel insecure; whether I have justified the part I have played in a film,” he says, adding, “It is insecurity that has driven me this far.” Manikandan says he thoroughly enjoyed the solitude, thanks to the pandemic-induced lockdown, which gave him the time to read, write and try stop-motion films.  There is also a plan to direct a film by the end of this year, “I’ve been reading some impressive scripts that are yet to be made into films. I’m working towards bringing them on screen — either as writer, actor or director.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/insecurity-has-driven-me-this-far/article33985015.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Museum in motion||In many ways, L M Lakshmanan is living his boyhood dream. “I got interested in automobiles because of my grandfather, who had a Standard Companion, (a 1955 estate car) with a big boot, and as children, we used to love travelling in it in and around Karaikudi. I used to feel sad that I didn’t have enough money to buy the car myself.” Decades later, Lakshmanan, who runs a security camera business with clients in Karaikudi and Chennai, owns a museum full of not just vintage cars, but also two-wheelers and three-wheelers. And as an extension of his love for other forms of classic technology, he has added toys, cameras and recording equipment to the collection at his Chettinad Vintage Gallery in Pillaiyarpatti, Tirupattur Taluk. Situated in the midst of a busy pilgrimage route that covers the historic local Karpaga Vinayagar temple and the nearby Kunnakudi Shanmughanathar temple, Chettinad Vintage Gallery is a time capsule of the passions that once drove the Nagarathar Chettiar community of this culture-rich region of Tamil Nadu. “The Chettiars were among the first non-resident Indians (NRIs) of our State. They made their name overseas in finance and trade from the 1920s, and brought back beautiful things from wherever they travelled. Many of the old foreign goods in this region can be traced back to that period. I have even seen a 1920 Willys Overland car (made in Canada) in a nearby village,” says Lakshmanan. Antique land Chettinad today is a cluster of 60-70 villages mainly in the Sivagangai district, with a small portion in the neighbouring Pudukottai district. It is known for its stately homes furnished with Burma teakwood and other imported material. “The community was badly hit first by the repatriation from Burma following the Second World War and in the 1960s, and then in India by the ban on the pawnbroking business [among the main Chettiar occupations] during the Emergency. Many families started selling off their possessions to finance their children’s education and shift to bigger cities,” says Lakshmanan. Ironically, this led to a new line of business, in Chettinad antiques, and as a visit to Karaikudi’s famed flea market will show, nearly everything, from ornately carved cast iron furniture to teakwood doorways and ceramic cupboard handles plucked from the palatial homes in the region, is up for sale. “I sourced many of the things for my collection, especially the clocks, metal toys and some cars, from the Chettiar family homes in and around Pillaiyarpatti,” says Lakshmanan. “I was amazed to see the novelties that people collected in those days.” Auto history A framed driving licence from the 1950s greets visitors at the entrance. The walls are decorated with road signs and vintage motoring advertisements, and a collection of black-and-white photographs of local residents posing with their automobiles. “Cars in those days were often passed down from father to son, like property,” says Lakshmanan, adding that his uncle inherited his grandfather’s Champion, and drove it well into the 1990s. Automobile lovers can take a closer look at several restored models here, ranging from a striking red Austin 10 Tourer 1933 convertible with wooden spoke wheels, bought from a restorer in Jaipur. Next to it is parked a 1951 Moris Minor made in England. “It took me two years to restore this car,” Lakshmanan says, as he turns on its distinctive pop-up ‘semaphore’ indicator lights. During lockdown, he has been working on the undercarriage of a 1956 baby blue Plymouth, bought from a film producer in Chennai. Lakshmanan’s tin toys have retained their lustrous paintwork; here too, miniature cars are in the majority. There are transistors and telephones, and some unique office equipment like a 1930s German Brunsviga (Brains of Steel) calculator salvaged from a shop. As a tribute to Karaikudi’s historical links with Tamil cinema production, the museum also has an enclosure devoted to vintage film cameras. “It is difficult to believe today that there were at least 4,000 camera brands in the market at one time.” For some reason, spy cameras seem to have been popular, as Lakshmanan shows us a vitrine filled with samples. “This is a sub-miniature Petitax camera, only 2cm high and 3cm wide, made in West Germany,” he says. During the World Wars, many of these were strapped on to pigeons and used as a rudimentary type of wartime ‘drone’ surveillance and aerial photography. It’s easy to lose track of time (despite all the clocks in the 4,000 square feet hall) in the Chettinad Vintage Gallery, but Lakshmanan is happy to have visitors linger. “We are so lost in our smartphones these days, that we often forget how we created so much technology.” he says. “My museum is for people, especially children, who want to relive the golden era when machines were not just functional but also beautiful.”  IF YOU GO WHAT: Chettinad Vintage Gallery WHERE: Kongu Nachiammann Kovil Road, Pillaiyarpatti, Tirupattur Taluk, Sivagangai District ADMISSION: 9 am to 5pm (Tuesday holiday); Adult: Rs. 100, Children: Rs. 50 CONTACT: 9442042114; lenavintage@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/museum-in-motion/article33985021.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Arya and the bear||If all things went right, Teddy would have hit screens in the summer of 2020. But a pandemic arrived, and like most things in the world including movies, this Tamil film, starring Kollywood’s happening couple Arya and Sayyeshaa, too got hit. “We were making grand plans for a summer release in 2020,” recalls Arya, over a Zoom call, “But they all went for a toss.” A year later, the film is back in the reckoning — it releases directly on OTT platform Disney + Hotstar VIP on March 12 — and Arya is a relieved man. We last saw you in Magamuni and Kaappaan in 2019 and now there’s Teddy . What happened in 2020? Maintaining my weight and fitness took most of the year. I had filmed [half my scenes] for Sarpatta Parambarai (in which he plays a boxer) and I had to survive the entire lockdown ensuring my body was the same. They would bake cakes at home, and I would really want to eat them...but I could not! However, spending time with my family was the biggest plus about that phase. I’d say that if you survive lockdown without any major issues, you can survive anything. The trailer of Teddy has both serious and fun elements. Will it be a mix of both?  People hear the title and immediately think that it will be a comedy or a cartoon-based film. But the biggest plus of Teddy is, in my opinion, is its genre: a medical thriller. It involves a travel portion too, for which we flew to Azerbaijan. We have all grown up listening to rhymes featuring teddies. This storyline emanated from a single thought: what if the teddy could speak and do things like a normal human being? That idea held exciting possibilities. It’s directed by Shakti Soundar Rajan, who earlier helmed a Tamil film set in space ( Tik Tik Tik ). What’s new this time?  The Hollywood film Gravity was shot for more than a year, but director Shakti Soundar did a project similar to that ( Tik Tik Tik ), right here in Tamil cinema, within 55 days. To have completed such a quality project within that time was amazing. If any other director had pitched Teddy to me, I would have been sceptical about its execution. But as it was Shakti, coming off a film like Tik Tik Tik , I knew the project was in safe hands. The film  has opted for a direct OTT release at a time when theatres have re-opened. How do you see the future of film releases?  The theatre business will exist forever; I see that experience as a family outing. I think OTT platforms and theatres will co-exist in the future. It is beneficial for producers because of newer revenue streams. Films are only a minor part of your social media posts. You seem to focus more on friendships and fitness....  That’s my life! My wife keeps telling me that I should have become a sportsman. I have been on the ground since Class III. I have found several like-minded friends thanks to my interest in fitness and cycling. Bonding with them and working on our fitness levels gives me a different high altogether. What do have to tell to people who lead sedentary lifestyles and lack a fitness routine?  You are the troublemaker and you are the solution too. Even if you are the busiest person on earth, you should keep aside half hour for your health... if you really care about yourself! It’s important to have the willpower to get into that sort of a fitness routine. Does it help that your roles have physical aspects to it? Sarpetta Parambarai , your upcoming film with Pa Ranjith, has you playing a boxer...  Not necessarily. I like to push my boundaries physically when it comes to roles, so I might have a little advantage. But it depends on the film’s subject. How much has life changed post marriage, and how much has marrying a colleague from the film industry (Sayyeshaa) helped?  Marriage is the most beautiful thing that happened in my life. As she’s also an actor, I do not need to elaborate on what happens on the sets and the situations that arise there. She’s a talented actor, and a great dancer; I want her to continue taking films, but it is she who is choosy about work! Do you think that being a celebrity couple comes with responsibilities?  We [Sayyeshaa and I] do not think deeply into how we should behave or speak in public, nor do we look up to other celebrity couples. We strive to be genuinely happy in the company of each other, whether it’s a public appearance or a film set.  Marriage is the most beautiful thing that happened in my life. As Sayyeshaa is also an actor, I do not need to elaborate on the situations that arise on sets Arya||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/arya-and-the-bear/article33985045.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Tin cakes from Tambaram||Nancy Shelton’s tryst with the kitchen has had its ups and downs. Though always interested in cooking, she had only started the craft after entering college — “My mother never let me in the kitchen,because she thought I would make a mess,” she says, “I mean it was true, but that’s besides the point.” From an Engineering degree to pursuing culinary school and working at an Italian restaurant in Boston, under James Beard Award-winning chefs, she steadily took charge of her passion, finally grounding it in the form of her own café in Chennai. Run by her and her husband Cliford, the once-unassuming student hub, Toasted, has now moved online, renamed itself Tincakefactory by Toasted, and is delivering its creations to cities beyond Chennai. “We moved to India in May 2018 and came to Tambaram, to be closer to Cliford’s mother. It’s only after I came here, that I started missing the food back home,” says Nancy. “I had always wanted to start my own cooking establishment, and this seemed like a great opportunity,” she adds. It helped that the neighbourhood, though home to a buzzing community of young adults, had no real “hangout spot” offering food like sandwiches, pastries, waffles and European breakfast. So it was in August 2018 that the couple opened Toasted Artisanal Bakery on Bharadwaj Street, Tambaram. They began by selling just sandwiches and fruit juices, then the menu quickly grew as the place got popular. A close-knit bakery, Toasted quickly became popular with students of Madras Christian College (MCC), a brisk 10 minute walk from the cafe. It was also staffed mainly by students of MCC looking for part-time jobs. After the pandemic, Nancy is shifting the entire Toasted Bakery online, under the name TinCake Factory by Toasted, with items like cookies, hampers and tin cakes (cakes that are provided in a metal case, making them easily portable) that can be ordered through their website. In this new setup, The Toasted Kitchen in Tambaram East will function as a delivery station, where orders are taken and shipped. “I guess it was a matter of adapting to the situation,” says Nancy, reiterating, “I still love making food, and it’s still a great business.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/tin-cakes-from-tambaram/article33985034.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||What makes Earth home||Volcanoes, thunderstorms, oceans, the sun — life on Earth flourishes when there is a perfect balance between these varied geological and climatic conditions. Sony BBC Earth’s A Perfect Planet adds a fifth driving force: humans. Produced by Huw Cordey and narrated by David Attenborough, A Perfect Planet marries earth sciences with animal behaviour in BBC’s familiar style of blue chip filmmaking. Edited excerpts from an email interview with Huw: Why do you believe a series like this one is timely? When we started in January 2016, we could never have imagined the world we now find ourselves vis-à-vis the pandemic. The pandemic has exposed our vulnerability as a species. We might have thought we were all-conquering but the virus has shown that we are not quite as ‘in control’ as it appeared. As a consequence, climate change is now pretty much universally accepted and most people now realise that it’s going to have a massive impact on us — that is, if we don’t do something about it. There has never been a better time, therefore, to wean ourselves off fossil fuels and move towards a green economy. What are the locations you shot in? We filmed in a lot of very challenging and extreme locations. For instance, Lake Natron in Tanzania, where we filmed nesting lesser flamingos, is one of the world’s most corrosive bodies of water — so toxic it can burn skin. The only way to access the flamingo colony, out in the centre, is by hovercraft which we shipped out to Tanzania from the UK. We filmed in the active volcanic crater on Fernandina Island in the Galapagos. This volcano actually erupted two weeks before the shoot. The aim was to film land iguanas descending the crater slopes and laying their eggs in the warm volcanic ash at the bottom. This required the crew to descend to the bottom too, which, due to the threat of earthquakes and rock avalanches, was a hazardous operation. It’s why more people have been in space than the bottom of this volcano. Each story obviously needed to illustrate the theme of the episode. But when the themes are the planet’s natural forces, this is challenging. How do you show animals benefiting from ocean currents, which you can’t actually see? Visuals in blue-chip series, wondrous and dramatic as they are, can get repetitive. How do you make sure each series has a personality of its own? Yes, this is one of the biggest challenges in our genre — particularly as animal behaviour doesn’t really change from one generation to the next (a lion hunts a wildebeest in exactly the same way today as it did a thousand years ago). Each big blue-chip series must somehow still raise the bar on what has gone before it and technology is often the answer to how we do this. Technological developments can either give a fresh feel to a familiar story or allow you to film something for the first time. Currently, sequences are very character driven but there’s a lot you can do, of course, with narration and music. It is amazing that David Attenborough is voicing the series at 94... I worked with David on Life of Mammals ( LOM ), 20 years ago, and people were talking about who the next David A was going to be then! My first shoot with him was in Alaska, filming bears. It was especially memorable because we got an amazing shot of a bear leaping on a salmon behind David and right on cue with his words! On A Perfect Planet , lockdown happened in the early stages of the post production, so three out of five scripts had to be done at his home in London. He recorded them from his dining room, with the walls covered in duvet covers to stop sound bouncing around, and a cable running from the microphone to our dubbing mixer in the garden. I was monitoring it from Bristol on a Zoom link. Clearly, this was far from a traditional way of recording for a major BBC series but David took it all in his stride. That kind of sums David up. Nothing seems to faze him! A Perfect Planet premieres in India on March 8, 9 pm on Sony BBC Earth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/what-makes-earth-home/article33985056.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The eight- anna rule||Dice are rolled, tokens are secured, moves are planned... All to find one’s way to a textile pattern and earn an anna (ancient Indian currency). Once you clinch ettu anna (eight annas ), you win. For today, you are a weaver hailing from Kanchipuram and your tasks include making patterns and decoding others, to put your creative abilities and colour sense to test. There are chances of other weavers disrupting your efforts, and being quick and efficient is key. Time halts at the temple town of Kanchipuram, known for its silks that are eponymous with every occasion in South India, in this unlikely strategy board game. Title Ettana — The Looms of Kanchi, the two-to-four player, peacock blue-hued, strategy game is a tribute to the looms and renowned craftsmanship of weavers there. The design of the game says as much, replete with traditional motifs — dancing girls on the cover, action cards sporting Bharatanatyam mudras and a colour scheme designed to appeal to Indian sensibilities. Ettana is in fact a direct portal to her Tamil roots, says Zurich-based Madhumita Mani, the creator of the game and founder of Mad4Fun Games. An avid board game enthusiast herself, Madhumita feels that Ettana… reflects a part of her own cultural identity. “The concept follows the idea of depicting the workings of a loom onto a board game. And, how the weavers come up with designs that are one-of-a-kind, which can’t be seen anywhere else,” says Madhumita. Recognising and further shining light on the artform of weaving remain at the centre of the game, which has been in the making for the past one year. “What would have been the weavers’ thought process a couple of 100 years ago? How would they have communicated and sold their work? How would the exchange have happened? I started thinking along those lines,” continues Madhumita. It took her a couple of months to zero in on a central concept. The gameplay focusses on replicating certain patterns on the board using the roll of dice and cards. The complexity of each design and their worth, vary. There are 36 different designs. The first player who manages to create patterns worth eight annas , wins the 35-40 minutes-long game. Apart from the concept, the design is what makes Ettana intriguing. On the elaborately designed box are figurines of dancing girls engaged in different stages of weaving. They are accompanied by sculptural motifs that are specific to the temples of Kanchipuram. “The recall value of the design is very high. If you are familiar with Kanchipuram and handloom, any component of the game will take you back instantly,” says the designer of the game Darshini Sundar. Her educational background in textiles aided this journey, adds the Bengaluru-based illustrator. Her past work with THDC (Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation) and DakshinaChitra including a curation of an exhibition showing the handloom process, helped this project. While the board itself is not made of fabric, it tries to replicate patterns that are often seen in Kanchipuram silks along with temple motifs that give it a distinct South Indian identity. Is there a reason for choosing Kanchipuram silks? “We are both women, we are from Chennai, we love silk sarees and we have been brides!” says Darshini, laughing. Madhumita joins in, “Since I was a child, I have always had this fascination towards fabrics and sarees, particularly with incredible designs that are not so visible these days.” Having said that, any other weaving style of fabric would still have made sense for the game, if not Kanchipuram silks, she adds. “Ultimately, it is a manifestation of how tradition meets the modern,” says Madhumita. It is a piece of India that you get to carry, concludes Darshini.  The game’s pilot samples are out and production will begin in April.

04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Rebuilding with bricks, oysters and chocolate||Battered by age, a 120-year-old bungalow in the heart of Mysuru has found an unlikely raison d’etre: Chocolate. Helming the restoration is David Belo, who delights in tilting at windmills. Ten years ago David arrived in Mysuru on another Quixotic mission: to create a wholly Indian, artisan chocolate from bean to bar. His artisan brand Earthloaf — renamed Naviluna — exceeded expectations when it was launched in 2012. Using underrated Indian cacao beans, the bars are hand-crafted at low temperatures to highlight their terroir-influenced personalities. Given the pleasing complexity of the bars, it is not surprising that their creator David is a restless maverick, eager to learn from every adventure. Born in Cape Town, he worked as a bartender in London and Sharm El Sheik (Egypt), moved into artisan baking in Glastonbury, and — between all this — found the time to become a “front man and guitar shredder” with a punk rock band for two years in London. Over the phone from Mysuru, where he is knee deep in lime plaster, bricks and wooden beams, David sounds elated with the busy chaos. Determined to restore a graceful heritage bungalow in the town’s central business district by converting it into a chocolate factory and brasserie, David teamed up with INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) and the family that owns it, to plan the restoration as lockdown eased in June last year. Work began in November. They were about 70% through when David realised they were running short of funds. So Naviluna turned to Kickstarter, and managed to hit their £5,000 goal in a nail biting finish. Back on track, they aim to complete restoration by April 2021, and open two months later. South Indian soul Explaining his fascination with the property in a lilting Kannada-influenced British accent, David says, “The architecture is just gorgeous. It is the ancestral property of a Madras family, but nobody has lived there in a decade. The building is a hybrid of Mysore and Tamil styles, speaking of the family’s history. There is a central courtyard with wooden pillars, typical of what you would see in Madras.” The bungalow retains its original stained glass teak windows, in vibrant scarlet and deep blue, and has stoically weathered the years. Explaining that they have to “use the materials used at that time for restoration” David says they are working with natural oxide colours sourced from Rajasthan. “And we have artisans from Jharkhand here who are crushing oyster shells for the lime plaster,” he adds. “The mortar is all lime plaster. There is no steel reinforcement, all clay bricks. ” Fortunately, the project was not overwhelming as David got in some practice beforehand. “I was quite lucky. I moved into a 100-year-old house and finished the restoration with the owner before moving in.” He jokes about unintentionally joining the family business. “My grandfather, originally from Portugal, was a contractor and a builder in Mozambique,” he says, adding enthusiastically, “I’m loving the process.” David’s plans for the bungalow, which is walking distance from Mysore Palace, include setting up a brasserie, dessert room, artisan bakery and alfresco café. On Kickstarter, their stretch goals include kombucha on tap and a luxe espresso machine. The café will have desks for co-working. David hopes to create a space that will evolve into a cultural hub. For the food, like his chocolate, he intends to keep the soul South Indian. “The idea is that the flavours will be local, and the ingredients local, but the composition will be European,” he says. “The heritage culture here is great,” he states, adding that he loves the local fish curry and masala dosas. “However there is space for a new age gourmet culture.” Plans include serving cured fish on the terrace. But David has not started working on the menu yet. “So far, I am only thinking about flavours,” he states, adding with a laugh, “First, I need to do the electric lines and plumbing.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/rebuilding-with-bricks-oysters-and-chocolate/article33985050.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A knotty story||Love found them easily but it took 10 months for Maya McManus and her fiancé Shamaun Ahmed to find an authority to solemnise their nikkah.  “It was quite the hunt,” laughs Maya, as the couple was keen on having a womanqaziconduct the wedding. “There was no information anywhere either online or in person,” she says. They got in touch with the Bhartiya Mahila Muslim Andolan (BMMA), Mumbai, and got a lead. And in December 2018, just a month before their wedding in Kolkata, Maya and Shamaun found Hakima Khatoon, their qazi . “I didn’t know what the legalities were. Around the same time I saw a newspaper article that said it was legal for women to become qazis ,” says Maya, adding that both her family and her fiancé’s were quite proud about this decision and there was no opposition to it. Hakima, on her part, was delighted. “It gave me immense satisfaction to carry out such a big task successfully. Everybody was excited to see a woman qazi ,” says Hakima of her first-ever tryst with this profession. An employee then with Nari-O-Shishu-Kalyan Kendra in Howrah, West Bengal, which counsels women and works with victims of domestic violence, Hakima says when the opportunity presented itself to train as a qazi in 2017, she signed up for it, along with her colleague Jamila Lasker. “Before setting out to pursue my course in Gujarat and Mumbai, I spoke to the imam at the mosque and he assured me it was absolutely fine as there are equal rights for all in Islam,” she says, adding that during the lockdown, she was approached by a number of women who were interested in signing up with a woman qazi . Recently, actor Dia Mirza’s wedding was officiated by a woman priest. The foray of women into priesthood is a progressive trend but not entirely new. In the ‘80s and ‘90s, Kolkata-based Gauri Dharmapal conducted a clutch of weddings, including that of actor Aparna Sen’s elder daughter. Gauri’s daughter, Rohini Dharmapal, who carries on the tradition is currently booked till 2023. “When ‘high’ society people engage a female priest it is more or less a style statement but when the middle class does it, it is a sign that the society is changing,” says Rohini. Updating tradition “My mother was a Sanskrit teacher at Lady Brabourne College. She translated Sanskritmantrasinto Bengali to make it understandable for all at the wedding,” says Rohini. Now Rohini and her team also explain themantrasin English if the bride and groom ask for it. “One of the things that ma did was talk families out of performing kanyadaan ,” says Rohini. In her capacity, Rohini also encourages families to do away with practices that are “considered regressive”. She explains how, in the Vedas, the wedding is about promises that the couple makes to one another. Rituals like maala badal , sindur daan , kanyadaan ... came much later. “Why should the bride alone wear sindur to depict that she is married? Why should she cover her face? Why should the mother of the bride not attend a ceremony? We don’t advocate wearing shaakha pola either. We do not force, we just educate. My son says we must reform with the times.” Agrees Brahmaramba Maheshwari, a woman priest based out of Mysuru. “The bride is not an object. So why use the word daan ?” she says. Since 2000, she has conducted more than 1,000 weddings as well as griha pravesh pujas , upanayana and homams . This awareness is spreading across India, and also the world. The current slew of Indian women priests have travelled far and wide from Detroit to Darjeeling binding people in holy matrimony. They also organise online classes for learners in India, Sweden, Australia. Nagpur-based Shuba Tai trained at a mandir in her city. “There is no fixed duration for the course. It depends on one’s grasping power. It could take six months to a year or more,” says Shuba. She started practising at around the same time as Brahmaramba. It was a male-dominated field back then, she says. “They asked, ‘why are you doing a man’s work?’ But as more people encouraged me, I went ahead with it.” She has noticed a lot more women entering this profession. “ Shaadi havan is quite elaborate and it takes time to master it,” she adds. Beauty in simplicity With women becoming independent, they no longer want to adhere to age-old customs that take away from the progress society is making, says Shuba. She adds, “I was conducting a wedding in Bihar, where the bride’s mother was insistent on kanyadaan but the bride and groom refused,” says Shuba, adding that sometimes they are not just priests but also end up as the referee. Rohini had to intervene when a family brought their daughter who did not want to wear sindoor . “They expected me to take up for them but I, of course, was on the daughter’s side,” she says. More than over-the-top rituals, what is important is to understand what the Veda says, adds Brahmaramba. “It says commitment is very important. Once you hold hands, you don’t leave. I explain everything in detail so the participants at the ceremony understand what themantrasmean,” she says, explaining the meaning of the word vivah . It comes from vi meaning  special relation between body, mind and soul, and vah meaning vahana , a vehicle that carries them ahead.  Wedding all over again For Rohini, what gives her satisfaction is when the couple chants themantrastogether and understands each word. “They are able to understand it because I translate it for them,” she says. As a result, people who got married 50 years back want to get married again to better soak it all in. “A couple celebrating their 10th anniversary in 2022 has booked me to conduct their wedding all over again,” laughs Rohini. She and her team of six believe in a practical approach. The idea is to modernise it; the rituals are about an hour long. “In the Upanishads it is mentioned, mata nirmata bhavati, means mother creates everything,” says Brahmaramba. “We are the boss, so why should we not choose to profess whatever we like,” she says.  Closer home Chennai-based Sheela K. Sarath has officiated 19 weddings in the city as well as in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Mangalore, New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. “I am not an ordained priest,” she says. “I belong to the Brahmo Samaj, where any older person close to the family can officiate a wedding,” she says. Watching her father perform weddings, Sheela picked up on it. In 2002, she conducted her niece’s wedding in the U.S. Interestingly, she also conducted her daughter’s wedding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-knotty-story/article33984786.ece

Ten years ago David arrived in Mysuru on another Quixotic mission: to create a wholly Indian, artisan chocolate from bean to bar. His artisan brand Earthloaf — renamed Naviluna — exceeded expectations when it was launched in 2012. Using underrated Indian cacao beans, the bars are hand-crafted at low temperatures to highlight their terroir-influenced personalities. Given the pleasing complexity of the bars, it is not surprising that their creator David is a restless maverick, eager to learn from every adventure. Born in Cape Town, he worked as a bartender in London and Sharm El Sheik (Egypt), moved into artisan baking in Glastonbury, and — between all this — found the time to become a “front man and guitar shredder” with a punk rock band for two years in London. Over the phone from Mysuru, where he is knee deep in lime plaster, bricks and wooden beams, David sounds elated with the busy chaos. Determined to restore a graceful heritage bungalow in the town’s central business district by converting it into a chocolate factory and brasserie, David teamed up with INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage) and the family that owns it, to plan the restoration as lockdown eased in June last year. Work began in November. They were about 70% through when David realised they were running short of funds. So Naviluna turned to Kickstarter, and managed to hit their £5,000 goal in a nail biting finish. Back on track, they aim to complete restoration by April 2021, and open two months later. South Indian soul Explaining his fascination with the property in a lilting Kannada-influenced British accent, David says, “The architecture is just gorgeous. It is the ancestral property of a Madras family, but nobody has lived there in a decade. The building is a hybrid of Mysore and Tamil styles, speaking of the family’s history. There is a central courtyard with wooden pillars, typical of what you would see in Madras.” The bungalow retains its original stained glass teak windows, in vibrant scarlet and deep blue, and has stoically weathered the years. Explaining that they have to “use the materials used at that time for restoration” David says they are working with natural oxide colours sourced from Rajasthan. “And we have artisans from Jharkhand here who are crushing oyster shells for the lime plaster,” he adds. “The mortar is all lime plaster. There is no steel reinforcement, all clay bricks. ” Fortunately, the project was not overwhelming as David got in some practice beforehand. “I was quite lucky. I moved into a 100-year-old house and finished the restoration with the owner before moving in.” He jokes about unintentionally joining the family business. “My grandfather, originally from Portugal, was a contractor and a builder in Mozambique,” he says, adding enthusiastically, “I’m loving the process.” David’s plans for the bungalow, which is walking distance from Mysore Palace, include setting up a brasserie, dessert room, artisan bakery and alfresco café. On Kickstarter, their stretch goals include kombucha on tap and a luxe espresso machine. The café will have desks for co-working. David hopes to create a space that will evolve into a cultural hub. For the food, like his chocolate, he intends to keep the soul South Indian. “The idea is that the flavours will be local, and the ingredients local, but the composition will be European,” he says. “The heritage culture here is great,” he states, adding that he loves the local fish curry and masala dosas. “However there is space for a new age gourmet culture.” Plans include serving cured fish on the terrace. But David has not started working on the menu yet. “So far, I am only thinking about flavours,” he states, adding with a laugh, “First, I need to do the electric lines and plumbing.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/rebuilding-with-bricks-oysters-and-chocolate/article33985298.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||A facelift for the past||The Chennai Rail Museum on New Avadi Road is attracting a steady stream of visitors since reopening late last year, post lifting of lockdown restrictions. Whilst the toy train experience alone is something worth the Rs. 50 entry ticket, the museum is home to a treasure trove of information for those prepared to go off the rails to know more about the journey of India’s indigenous train wagon manufacturing history. However, standing out amid the various exhibits and galleries is the recently revamped ICF gallery (previously the Diamond Jubilee gallery). Revamped in late 2019, but closed to the public soon after since a national lockdown was enforced last year, the ICF gallery takes visitors on a journey — with the help of photographic exhibits and miniature models — from the formative years of Integral Coach Factory to the present day. The re-designed gallery is the handiwork of Chennai-based interior designer Nalini Radhakrishnan, who has previously worked on revamp projects for the Madras High Court museum and the Government Museum in Egmore. The miniatures on display at the ICF gallery reflect the agency’s various contributions over the years to Indian Railways — from humble sleeper coaches to the wagons that are now a part of the Vande Bharat Express. With a chestnut colour scheme, rounded pillars and miniature focus lights (replacing the humble ‘Government office tubelight’) for illuminating the exhibits, the ICF gallery stands out. Nalini, who manages the firm InterScape Interiors and Landscaping, prefers working with wood, as evidenced by the work that has undergone in converting the pillars in the gallery. What were once bland concrete pillars are now dark and glossy. Nalini says she has used actual wood to create a false enclosure around the concrete pillars. “It is the style of pillars you would find in the Madras High Court museum. I took a few Railway officials to show them my work there, and they were impressed by the pillars that they insisted they wanted the same for the ICF gallery as well,” she adds. Nalini, who also undertakes civil projects through her firm, has a history of taking up government projects, something she says involves balancing differing opinions in terms of conceptualising and aesthetics. For instance, at the ICF gallery, she says the Railways management wanted to use LCD boxes to display archived images of former Prime Ministers, railway ministers and the Queen of England visiting the ICF. “I wanted to use stained glass windows for the exhibits and create an arched entrance into the gallery, but the budget wasn’t there,” she adds. Nevertheless, scores of families continue to visit the ICF gallery and revel in the history of the Indian Railways. And also, ride that toy train.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-facelift-for-the-past/article33984781.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||Museum in motion||In many ways, L M Lakshmanan is living his boyhood dream. “I got interested in automobiles because of my grandfather, who had a Standard Companion, (a 1955 estate car) with a big boot, and as children, we used to love travelling in it in and around Karaikudi. I used to feel sad that I didn’t have enough money to buy the car myself.” Decades later, Lakshmanan, who runs a security camera business with clients in Karaikudi and Chennai, owns a museum full of not just vintage cars, but also two-wheelers and three-wheelers. And as an extension of his love for other forms of classic technology, he has added toys, cameras and recording equipment to the collection at his Chettinad Vintage Gallery in Pillaiyarpatti, Tirupattur Taluk. Situated in the midst of a busy pilgrimage route that covers the historic local Karpaga Vinayagar temple and the nearby Kunnakudi Shanmughanathar temple, Chettinad Vintage Gallery is a time capsule of the passions that once drove the Nagarathar Chettiar community of this culture-rich region of Tamil Nadu. “The Chettiars were among the first non-resident Indians (NRIs) of our State. They made their name overseas in finance and trade from the 1920s, and brought back beautiful things from wherever they travelled. Many of the old foreign goods in this region can be traced back to that period. I have even seen a 1920 Willys Overland car (made in Canada) in a nearby village,” says Lakshmanan. Antique land Chettinad today is a cluster of 60-70 villages mainly in the Sivagangai district, with a small portion in the neighbouring Pudukottai district. It is known for its stately homes furnished with Burma teakwood and other imported material. “The community was badly hit first by the repatriation from Burma following the Second World War and in the 1960s, and then in India by the ban on the pawnbroking business [among the main Chettiar occupations] during the Emergency. Many families started selling off their possessions to finance their children’s education and shift to bigger cities,” says Lakshmanan. Ironically, this led to a new line of business, in Chettinad antiques, and as a visit to Karaikudi’s famed flea market will show, nearly everything, from ornately carved cast iron furniture to teakwood doorways and ceramic cupboard handles plucked from the palatial homes in the region, is up for sale. “I sourced many of the things for my collection, especially the clocks, metal toys and some cars, from the Chettiar family homes in and around Pillaiyarpatti,” says Lakshmanan. “I was amazed to see the novelties that people collected in those days.” Auto history A framed driving licence from the 1950s greets visitors at the entrance. The walls are decorated with road signs and vintage motoring advertisements, and a collection of black-and-white photographs of local residents posing with their automobiles. “Cars in those days were often passed down from father to son, like property,” says Lakshmanan, adding that his uncle inherited his grandfather’s Champion, and drove it well into the 1990s. Automobile lovers can take a closer look at several restored models here, ranging from a striking red Austin 10 Tourer 1933 convertible with wooden spoke wheels, bought from a restorer in Jaipur. Next to it is parked a 1951 Moris Minor made in England. “It took me two years to restore this car,” Lakshmanan says, as he turns on its distinctive pop-up ‘semaphore’ indicator lights. During lockdown, he has been working on the undercarriage of a 1956 baby blue Plymouth, bought from a film producer in Chennai. Lakshmanan’s tin toys have retained their lustrous paintwork; here too, miniature cars are in the majority. There are transistors and telephones, and some unique office equipment like a 1930s German Brunsviga (Brains of Steel) calculator salvaged from a shop. As a tribute to Karaikudi’s historical links with Tamil cinema production, the museum also has an enclosure devoted to vintage film cameras. “It is difficult to believe today that there were at least 4,000 camera brands in the market at one time.” For some reason, spy cameras seem to have been popular, as Lakshmanan shows us a vitrine filled with samples. “This is a sub-miniature Petitax camera, only 2cm high and 3cm wide, made in West Germany,” he says. During the World Wars, many of these were strapped on to pigeons and used as a rudimentary type of wartime ‘drone’ surveillance and aerial photography. It’s easy to lose track of time (despite all the clocks in the 4,000 square feet hall) in the Chettinad Vintage Gallery, but Lakshmanan is happy to have visitors linger. “We are so lost in our smartphones these days, that we often forget how we created so much technology.” he says. “My museum is for people, especially children, who want to relive the golden era when machines were not just functional but also beautiful.”  IF YOU GO WHAT: Chettinad Vintage Gallery WHERE: Kongu Nachiammann Kovil Road, Pillaiyarpatti, Tirupattur Taluk, Sivagangai District ADMISSION: 9 am to 5pm (Tuesday holiday); Adult: Rs. 100, Children: Rs. 50 CONTACT: 9442042114; lenavintage@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/museum-in-motion/article33985297.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||What makes Earth home||Volcanoes, thunderstorms, oceans, the sun — life on Earth flourishes when there is a perfect balance between these varied geological and climatic conditions. Sony BBC Earth’s A Perfect Planet adds a fifth driving force: humans. Produced by Huw Cordey and narrated by David Attenborough, A Perfect Planet marries earth sciences with animal behaviour in BBC’s familiar style of blue chip filmmaking. Edited excerpts from an email interview with Huw: Why do you believe a series like this one is timely? When we started in January 2016, we could never have imagined the world we now find ourselves vis-à-vis the pandemic. The pandemic has exposed our vulnerability as a species. We might have thought we were all-conquering but the virus has shown that we are not quite as ‘in control’ as it appeared. As a consequence, climate change is now pretty much universally accepted and most people now realise that it’s going to have a massive impact on us — that is, if we don’t do something about it. There has never been a better time, therefore, to wean ourselves off fossil fuels and move towards a green economy. What are the locations you shot in? We filmed in a lot of very challenging and extreme locations. For instance, Lake Natron in Tanzania, where we filmed nesting lesser flamingos, is one of the world’s most corrosive bodies of water — so toxic it can burn skin. The only way to access the flamingo colony, out in the centre, is by hovercraft which we shipped out to Tanzania from the UK. We filmed in the active volcanic crater on Fernandina Island in the Galapagos. This volcano actually erupted two weeks before the shoot. The aim was to film land iguanas descending the crater slopes and laying their eggs in the warm volcanic ash at the bottom. This required the crew to descend to the bottom too, which, due to the threat of earthquakes and rock avalanches, was a hazardous operation. It’s why more people have been in space than the bottom of this volcano. Each story obviously needed to illustrate the theme of the episode. But when the themes are the planet’s natural forces, this is challenging. How do you show animals benefiting from ocean currents, which you can’t actually see? Visuals in blue-chip series, wondrous and dramatic as they are, can get repetitive. How do you make sure each series has a personality of its own? Yes, this is one of the biggest challenges in our genre — particularly as animal behaviour doesn’t really change from one generation to the next (a lion hunts a wildebeest in exactly the same way today as it did a thousand years ago). Each big blue-chip series must somehow still raise the bar on what has gone before it and technology is often the answer to how we do this. Technological developments can either give a fresh feel to a familiar story or allow you to film something for the first time. Currently, sequences are very character driven but there’s a lot you can do, of course, with narration and music. It is amazing that David Attenborough is voicing the series at 94... I worked with David on Life of Mammals ( LOM ), 20 years ago, and people were talking about who the next David A was going to be then! My first shoot with him was in Alaska, filming bears. It was especially memorable because we got an amazing shot of a bear leaping on a salmon behind David and right on cue with his words! On A Perfect Planet , lockdown happened in the early stages of the post production, so three out of five scripts had to be done at his home in London. He recorded them from his dining room, with the walls covered in duvet covers to stop sound bouncing around, and a cable running from the microphone to our dubbing mixer in the garden. I was monitoring it from Bristol on a Zoom link. Clearly, this was far from a traditional way of recording for a major BBC series but David took it all in his stride. That kind of sums David up. Nothing seems to faze him! A Perfect Planet premieres in India on March 8, 9 pm on Sony BBC Earth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/what-makes-earth-home/article33985295.ece
04 March 2021||March 04 2021 00:00 IST,||The eight- anna rule||Dice are rolled, tokens are secured, moves are planned... All to find one’s way to a textile pattern and earn an anna (ancient Indian currency). Once you clinch ettu anna (eight annas ), you win. For today, you are a weaver hailing from Kanchipuram and your tasks include making patterns and decoding others, to put your creative abilities and colour sense to test. There are chances of other weavers disrupting your efforts, and being quick and efficient is key. Time halts at the temple town of Kanchipuram, known for its silks that are eponymous with every occasion in South India, in this unlikely strategy board game. Title Ettana — The Looms of Kanchi, the two-to-four player, peacock blue-hued, strategy game is a tribute to the looms and renowned craftsmanship of weavers there. The design of the game says as much, replete with traditional motifs — dancing girls on the cover, action cards sporting Bharatanatyam mudras and a colour scheme designed to appeal to Indian sensibilities. Ettana is in fact a direct portal to her Tamil roots, says Zurich-based Madhumita Mani, the creator of the game and founder of Mad4Fun Games. An avid board game enthusiast herself, Madhumita feels that Ettana… reflects a part of her own cultural identity. “The concept follows the idea of depicting the workings of a loom onto a board game. And, how the weavers come up with designs that are one-of-a-kind, which can’t be seen anywhere else,” says Madhumita. Recognising and further shining light on the artform of weaving remain at the centre of the game, which has been in the making for the past one year. “What would have been the weavers’ thought process a couple of 100 years ago? How would they have communicated and sold their work? How would the exchange have happened? I started thinking along those lines,” continues Madhumita. It took her a couple of months to zero in on a central concept. The gameplay focusses on replicating certain patterns on the board using the roll of dice and cards. The complexity of each design and their worth, vary. There are 36 different designs. The first player who manages to create patterns worth eight annas , wins the 35-40 minutes-long game. Apart from the concept, the design is what makes Ettana intriguing. On the elaborately designed box are figurines of dancing girls engaged in different stages of weaving. They are accompanied by sculptural motifs that are specific to the temples of Kanchipuram. “The recall value of the design is very high. If you are familiar with Kanchipuram and handloom, any component of the game will take you back instantly,” says the designer of the game Darshini Sundar. Her educational background in textiles aided this journey, adds the Bengaluru-based illustrator. Her past work with THDC (Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation) and DakshinaChitra including a curation of an exhibition showing the handloom process, helped this project. While the board itself is not made of fabric, it tries to replicate patterns that are often seen in Kanchipuram silks along with temple motifs that give it a distinct South Indian identity. Is there a reason for choosing Kanchipuram silks? “We are both women, we are from Chennai, we love silk sarees and we have been brides!” says Darshini, laughing. Madhumita joins in, “Since I was a child, I have always had this fascination towards fabrics and sarees, particularly with incredible designs that are not so visible these days.” Having said that, any other weaving style of fabric would still have made sense for the game, if not Kanchipuram silks, she adds. “Ultimately, it is a manifestation of how tradition meets the modern,” says Madhumita. It is a piece of India that you get to carry, concludes Darshini.  The game’s pilot samples are out and production will begin in April.

04 March 2021||GURUGRAM,||RTI reply reveals 4 cases of ‘love jihad’ in Haryana in past 3 years||Four cases of interfaith relationship — for which some right-wing groups use the term ‘love jihad’ — have been lodged in Haryana over the past three years, an RTI reply has revealed. The police have moved to quash FIRs in two of the cases and a third ended in an acquittal. The fourth case is in the court. The Haryana government is set to bring in a legislation against ‘love jihad’ in the upcoming budget session beginning March 5. State Home Minister Anil Vij had announced framing of a law against ‘love jihad’ in the wake of the Nikita murder case in Faridabad last year. As per the reply to the RTI application filed by P.P. Kapoor, a Panipat resident, a total of four cases of ‘love jihad’ have been lodged in Ambala, Nuh and Panipat districts. An FIR was lodged under various sections of the IPC and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act at Sadar police station in Ambala on May 18, 2018, but the accused was later acquitted. In a similar case lodged at the same police station on October 16, 2019, the police have initiated proceedings seeking to quash the case. In Nuh’s Punhana, FIR no. 350 was registered on September 12, 2020, under various sections of the IPC and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police have initiated proceedings seeking to quash the case. FIR no. 450 was registered at Panipat’s Samalkha police station on July 19, 2019. The matter is in the court. Mr. Kapoor had written to the police in seven districts: Faridabad, Yamuna Nagar, Hisar, Ambala, Nuh, Panipat and Rewari, seeking details of ‘love jihad’ cases registered since January 1, 2018. Faridabad, Yamuna Nagar and Hisar police said there were no such cases. The Rewari police are yet to furnish a reply to the RTI that was filed in November last year. Mr. Kapoor also sought to know the definition of ‘love jihad’ to which many district police replied that it could be accessed on the Internet. The Nuh police said the term was not Constitutionally defined. On the number of ‘love jihad’ victims rescued and cases lodged in connection with alleged funding to propagate the activity, the police of all districts replied in the negative. Mr. Kapoor said the RTI reply revealed that a false narrative of ‘love jihad’ is being propagated for political reasons. He said he had sought data from the seven districts as a section of the media had been reporting that dozens of Hindu girls had fallen prey to ‘love jihad’ in these districts.

04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||AAP wins 4 out of 5 wards in civic bypolls||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday won four out of five wards in the municipal corporation bypolls. The Congress won the Chauhan Banger ward located in north-east Delhi, which witnessed communal violence last year. The seat was earlier held by the AAP. The BJP was a runner-up in four wards and placed third in the minority-dominated Chauhan Banger. AAP candidates Dhirender Kumar, Vijay Kumar, Sunita Mishra and Ram Chander won the Kalyanpuri, Trilokpuri, Shalimar Bagh and Rohini C wards, respectively. The victorious Congress candidate was Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad, his victory margin was the highest among the five wards. The closely contested election was seen by the parties as a “semifinal” before the municipal election in 2022. The AAP has stated that it aims to end the monopoly that the BJP has in the municipalities, where it has been in power since 2007. The bypoll was necessitated as four of the seats fell vacant after the councillors won the Assembly elections on AAP tickets last year. The Shalimar Bagh (North) seat fell vacant after the death of sitting BJP councillor Renu Jaju. The bypolls saw the three parties launch strong campaigns with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal holding roadshows to set the tone for the municipal election next year. Despite a landslide victory in the 2015 Assembly election, the AAP was unable to pull off a similar performance in the 2017 municipal election and has been at loggerheads with the BJP-ruled corporations. The State Election Commission said that the AAP polled 46.10% votes, followed by 27.29% (BJP) and 21.84% by the Congress. Around 2.42 lakh people were eligible to vote in two wards under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, and three wards under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation. The elections saw a turnout of 50.86%.

04 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Poll results are answer to 15 years of BJP’s incompetence’||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday told party workers that the results of the bypolls show that Delhiites are happy with AAP’s work and angry with “15 years of BJP’s incompetence” in the municipal corporations. The AAP won four out of the five wards while the BJP won zero seats.  AAP workers danced to drum beats, exchanged sweets and smeared colours on each other’s faces at the the party headquarters to celebrate the win. “The people of Delhi have made us win four out of five seats... none went to the BJP. I want to congratulate you all. In the 2015 Assembly elections, we got 67 out of 70 seats, and in 2020, we got 62 out of 70. After six years, the people of Delhi have again shown their faith in us and they want us to continue the way we are working. If someone wants to know what AAP has achieved, people from across the country will tell you how we have improved schools, hospitals, electricity, water, and roads,” Mr. Kejriwal said at the party headquarters. ‘Delhi will shine’ He said that people didn’t like the “politics of violence” that the BJP indulged in and recalled how the party launched attacks at Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s house and the Delhi Jal Board office. “We have bettered education, hospitals, and roads... But cleanliness is left. When our government takes charge of the civic bodies, we will make Delhi shine,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He added that the people of Delhi want to change the corporations and they want the corporations to run as effectively as the Delhi government.  “In 2017, we were still a new party. But now we had enough work to show the people and they believe in the party. This is what worked for us,” AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said. Leaders also said that the party will focus on telling people about the work done by the Delhi government and promise the people similar development in the corporations for the 2022 municipal elections. “The results of the by-elections is indicating that in the upcoming civic body election next year, the BJP will be thrown out of power,” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP in-charge of the municipal corporations.

04 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘People ready to put faith back in Congress’||After several years, the sound of beating drums and firecrackers reverberated at the Delhi Congress office as the party managed to win one of the five wards in the municipal bypolls. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said that although the victory would not have any real outcome on the corporations, it is a great victory for the Congress as “the people have put their faith back in the party” and party workers have managed to “awaken people to the misrule of the BJP in the civic bodies for the past 15 years. “Looking forward to the 2022 municipal election, this victory shows us that the people of Delhi are ready to put their faith back in the Congress and we will serve the people of Delhi by winning the civic poll,” he said. Mr. Kumar added that in the Assembly election in February 2020, the party’s vote share had fallen to 6%. Due to the hard work put in by Congress workers during the pandemic and the ongoing farmers’ protest, the vote share has risen to 21.84% now, he said. Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad, who won the Chauhan Banger ward for the party, said the entire senior leadership of the AAP, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, had campaigned in his ward but were unable to change the minds of the people. “My victory is not a loss for the candidate put up by the Aam Aadmi Party but for Mr. Kejriwal who toured the ward by foot asking people for votes,” he said.

Promising to help her out, Mr. D’Cruz allegedly invited her to his home, where he allegedly sexually harassed her in the pantry area,” said the officer. He added that Mr. D’Cruz was questioned in the matter and if required, he would be again asked to join the investigation. They have also recorded the statement of the victim. The incident happened in October last year. The case will soon be submitted in the court. Facebook post The complainant has also shared a post on Facebook on the alleged traumatic physical assault that she had to undergo. “A case has been registered against a pseudo-progressive named Rubin D’Cruz and an FIR has been lodged. These few days gave some insights. It will take time for the shock of seeing those we have considered friends for years to speak up for the hunter seem so natural [sic.],” the victim wrote in her Facebook post.

Advocates appearing for the NGO, said due to inaction on the part of the Centre, private schools across India are throwing several EWS students out every year after they pass Class 8. The High Court had in December 2019, asked the Centre to take a decision on the extension of free education to EWS children even after attaining the age of 14 years or beyond. The plea sought initiation of contempt proceedings against authorities for their alleged deliberate disobedience of the judgment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/free-education-centre-told-to-reply-on-contempt-petition/article33984796.ece

The police said officials would also protect the accommodation where Ms. Katara would be staying during her visit to Delhi for medical treatment or court cases. It, however, said that Ms. Katara will have to intimate the police through e-mail at least 72 hours prior to her visit. Taking note of the submission, the High Court disposed of Ms. Katara’s plea seeking direction to grant her protection in Uttarakhand, where she has recently shifted. The Centre had earlier informed the High Court that it has requested Uttarakhand government to provide adequate security to Ms. Katara as she was shifting to Dehradun. Ms. Katara had in her plea stated that she has been provided security in Delhi since 2002. ‘Fears for life’ Her counsel had earlier submitted that she fears for her life and sought direction from the High Court to provide her security at both the places – Delhi and Dehradun.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nitish-kataras-mother-to-be-given-24x7-security-cover/article33984797.ece
