11 March 2021||New Delhi,||Tirath Singh Rawat is new CM of Uttarakhand||Garhwal MP Tirath Singh Rawat on Wednesday took oath as the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand at the Raj Bhavan in Dehradun after the BJP Legislature Party elected him its leader. His predecessor, Trivendra Singh Rawat, resigned on Tuesday. The meeting of the BJP Legislature Party was held under the supervision of the party’s central observers — former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh and Rajya Sabha member Dushyant Gautam. U.P. to Uttarakhand Mr. Tirath, 57, who was the Uttarakhand BJP chief from 2013 to 2015, was a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council, before the creation of Uttarakhand, during the period 1997-2002. He was an MLA in Uttarakhand from 2012 to 2017, and previously held the post of Education Minister from 2000 to 2002. Speaking to presspersons, he thanked legislators and party leaders for the opportunity. He asserted that he would “carry forward the work done by former Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat”. A long-time member of the BJP, Mr. Tirath was the dark horse for the Chief Minister’s post, where the only thing clear was that the choice would devolve on a person from the Rajput community. Low-profile person A low-profile person, Mr. Tirath is considered close to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and was his close aide during the latter’s vistarak programme of organisational strengthening in 2016-17 held over 120 days. “In 2017, he was prevented from getting ticket by a camp led by his predecessor after which Mr. Shah appointed him national secretary with the charge of handling party affairs in Himachal Pradesh. He was also given the prestigious Garhwal seat to contest from in the Lok Sabha polls, a sign that the central leadership felt he had been cheated out of Assembly ticket. He is the kind of man who doesn’t have an entourage of staff and most often answers his own phone,” a senior leader said. It is being hoped that this more low-key, amiable appointment would heal some of the ruptures within the State unit, which caused a revolt against Mr. Trivendra Singh Rawat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tirath-singh-rawat-is-new-cm-of-uttarakhand/article34040957.ece
11 March 2021||Kochi,||Kerala HC restrains Centre on IT rules||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday restrained the Centre from taking coercive action against Live Law Media Private Ltd., which owns a legal news portal, for not complying with Part III of the new IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The court issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the firm challenging the rules regulating digital news media, curated content (OTT platforms), and social media intermediaries. When the petition came up, counsel for the Centre submitted that there was time till March 24 for complying with the rules. The petition said Part III of the rules imposed an unconstitutional three-tier complaints and adjudication structure on publishers. ‘Chilling effect’ This administrative regulation on digital news media would make it virtually impossible for small or medium-sized publishers, such as the petitioner, to function. It would have a chilling effect on such entities, the petition said. The creation of a grievance redressal mechanism, through a governmental oversight body (an inter-departmental committee constituted under Rule 14) amounted to excessive regulation, it contended. The petitioner pointed out that Rule 4(2), which makes it mandatory for every social media intermediary to enable tracing of originators of information on its platform, purportedly in furtherance of Section 69 of the IT Act, violated Article 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression). It also deprived the intermediaries of their “safe-harbour protections” under Section 79 of the IT Act. The petition also added that the rules obligating messaging intermediaries to alter their infrastructure to “fingerprint” each message on a mass scale for every user to trace the first originator was violative of the fundamental right to privacy of Internet users.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-restrains-centre-on-new-it-rules/article34040954.ece

Independent MLAs The legislators voted along party lines with two Independents — Meham MLA Balraj Kundu and Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan — supporting the vote of no-confidence. In the 90-member Assembly, the BJP and the JJP have 40 and 10 MLAs respectively, besides the support of five Independents.

Two Assembly seats of Ellenabad and Kalka had fallen vacant earlier this year. Moving the no-confidence motion against the Manohar Lal-led government, Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the coalition government had completely lost the confidence of the people. Minimum Support Price Mr. Hooda said both parties in government had promised Minimum Support Price to farmers in their manifestos, but forgot about it after coming to power. He also raised issue of unemployment. Mr. Hooda, however, said he won’t talk about the three farm laws since they were outside the ambit of the Assembly. Opposing the motion, JJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said “the BJP was his party’s natural ally”. Mr. Lal, in his reply, said the Congress had the culture of “lack of confidence”.

The CPI(M) led the pack by rolling out the list of candidates for 83 Assembly constituencies. Intra-party protests in Kozhikode against the allotment of Kuttiyadi to the Kerala Congress (M) seemed not to dampen the enthusiasm of the CPI(M). The KC(M) also announced its list of candidates for 12 Assembly segments. So has the Loktantrik Janata Dal and Kerala Congress (B). The Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League, the two major UDF partners, are yet to announce their contestants’ list. Congress leaders are in New Delhi to finalise the list. The RSP, a partner of the UDF, has marched ahead. It has announced candidates for the four seats allotted to it and has already kick-started its campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ldf-steals-a-march-on-udf-with-candidate-list/article34041323.ece

11 March 2021||Mumbai,||Hiren’s death: Maharashtra orders Sachin Vaze’s transfer||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday announced the transfer of assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze from the Mumbai Crime Branch after Vimla Hiren, the wife of deceased Mansukh Hiren, alleged that he was linked to her husband’s death. “Mr. Vaze will be removed from his current posting in the Crime Branch till the investigation is completed. I am taking this decision in view of the demand raised by the Opposition. We will take appropriate action against Mr. Vaze if he is found involved in Hiren’s death,” Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said in the State Council. Hiren’s body was found in Kalwa creek last week. He was linked to the Scorpio, which, laden with explosives was found outside the house of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday stalled the Assembly proceedings demanding Mr. Vaze’s suspension and arrest. Speaking to reporters after the budget session of the legislature, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the government was serious about the investigation in this case. “We have already begun the probe and no one will be spared. However, a new trend has begun these days to target individuals on suspicion and destroy their lives. We believe in hanging a person after inquiry and not probing him after hanging,” he said. Commenting on the papers and the CDR related to Hiren’s death displayed by Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis in the Assembly, the CM said if displaying papers proved guilt then they should scrap investigation agencies and the judiciary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hirens-death-maharashtra-orders-sachin-vazes-transfer/article34041493.ece

11 March 2021||CHENNAI,||3 Ministers, 44 AIADMK MLAs denied ticket||The ruling AIADMK on Wednesday finalised the distribution of constituencies to two of its allies, the BJP and the PMK, and released its second list of candidates for 171 seats. Ministers Nilofer Kafeel (Vaniyambadi), S. Valarma-thi (Srirangam) and G. Baskaran (Sivaganga) and 44 sitting MLAs did not figure in it. There was no surprise over the distribution of constituencies and the selection of the AIADMK’s candidates, except for a few omissions. The second list contained 14 women and 28 nominees from the Scheduled Castes. ‘A record’ A Minister said it had 10 nominees from religious minorities, including two Muslims, and “this is a record of sorts for the party”. Later, the AIADMK announced that five constituencies — Perambur, Egmore, Kilvaithinan- kuppam, Kumbakonam and Madurai (Central) — had been allotted to the Perunthalaivar Makkal Katchi, the Tamilaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, Puratchi Bharatham, the Moovendar Munnetra Kazhagam and the Pasumpon Desiya Kazhagam respectively. The five parties will contest on the AIADMK’s ‘Two Leaves’ symbol.  The identification of constituencies for the allies and the selection of the ruling party’s candidates followed discussions held by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who are the party’s co-coordinator and co-ordinator respectively, with their party colleagues in the last four-five days, apart from their meetings with BJP and PMK leaders on Tuesday night and in the early hours of Wednesday. With the release of the second list of nominees, the AIADMK has so far identified 177 candidates, including the six in the first list. Forty-eight seats had been distributed to other parties, including the five smaller parties, which would contest on the AIADMK’s symbol. There are 9 more seats to be allotted to the constituents of the alliance. Among the high-profile contestants are the party’s deputy coordinators, K.P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam, now Members of the Rajya Sabha. Both lost in the 2016 Assembly election. They will contest from Veppannahalli and Orathanadu. Ministers K.A. Sengottaiyan, K. Pandiarajan, O.S. Manian, P. Thangamani, S.P. Velumani, V. Saroja, V.M. Rajalakshmi, K.P. Anbalagan, K.C. Veeramani, and M.C. Sampath have been renominated to contest from their constituencies. Two senior members — former Chennai Mayor Saidai S. Duraisamy and former Minister K.P. Krishnan — have been nominated from Saidapet and Srirangam. By renominating former police officer and Chairperson of the Tamil Nadu Public Services Commission R. Natraj from Mylapore, the AIADMK ensured that the seat remained with it, given reports that the BJP was keen on it. In the 2001 Assembly election, the BJP, then an ally of the DMK, won from Mylapore. Of the 23 constituencies given to the PMK and 20 to the BJP, the ruling party parted with 11 constituencies held by its members. Among the party veterans who were left out are S. Semmalai (Mettur) and S.T.K. Jakkaiyan (Cumbum). While Mettur was allotted to the PMK, Cumbum went to the ruling party’s Theni district unit secretary and former Member of Parliament S.P.M. Syed Khan. Two prominent faces of the party in the southern districts — Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji and V.V. Rajan Chellappa — have been shifted from Sivakasi and Madurai (North) to Rajapalayam and Thiruparankundram. While Sivakasi has been given to the party’s functionary in Virudhunagar (West) Lakshmi Ganesan, Madurai (North) has been allotted to the BJP. P.R.G. Arunkumar, who represents Coimbatore (North), has been put up at Kavundampalayam and Amman K. Arjunan of Coimbatore (South) will now contest from Coimbatore (North). The BJP has been given Coimbatore (South). Totally, 44 sitting MLAs have been dropped. Karunaas, Thamimun Ansari and U. Thaniyarasu, who were elected on the AIADMK symbol, are no longer with the party. Their constituencies — Thiruvadanai, Nagapattinam and Kangeyam — have been given to the AIADMK’s core nominees. Former Minister Thoppu N.D. Venkatachalam of Perundurai, E. Rathinasabapathy of Aranthangi, and A. Prabhu of Kallakurichi, who were seen as dissidents a few years ago, did not figure in the list. Three persons who were seen as representatives of Mr. Panneerselvam on the steering committee — P.H. Manoj Pandian, J.C.D. Prabhakar and K. Manickam — are the party’s nominees in Alangulam, Villivakkam and Sholavandan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/3-ministers-44-aiadmk-mlas-denied-ticket/article34041077.ece

The municipal corporations recorded a polling percentage of just 57.14 while the municipalities/nagar panchayats had an impressive polling of 70.65%. The average is 63.89%. There were scuffles between the cadres of YSR Congress Party and Telugu Desam Party at a few places over alleged discrepancies in the voter lists and bogus voters. State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar visited some polling stations in Vijayawada along with Krishna District Collector A.Md. Imtiaz, and enquired about the polling trend and arrangements made. Instances of ward volunteers participating in elections were being taken seriously by the SEC in view of the High Court orders. There were no incidents that necessitated repoll. The SEC now turned its attention to the counting of votes on March 14 and the election of Mayors and Deputy Mayors of municipal corporations and chairperson and vice-chairperson of municipalities/nagar panchayats at the earliest after the results are declared. Elections were unanimous in 91 wards in 12 municipal corporations (Anantapur, Chittoor, Eluru, Guntur, Kadapa, Kurnool, Machilipatnam, Ongole, Tirupati, Vizianagaram, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam) and 580 went to polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/urban-local-bodies-record-6389-polling/article34040952.ece

Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri, speaking on the Bill, said there “was a public perception that the issues with regard to unauthorised colonies were delayed by those who were in office earlier.” “In 1947, 17% of India’s total population lived in urban areas, Delhi’s population at that time was eight lakh. After Partition and relocation, it went up to 22 lakh, and I expect that during the Census of 2021, the population will be close to two crore,” he said. Mr. Puri also quoted a letter received by his Ministry from the Delhi government seeking the extension of a survey of unauthorised colonies. “That is why we brought this Bill,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lok-sabha-gives-approval-for-nct-bill/article34041515.ece

11 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Plea to curb media’s breach of privacy||The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday ordered issue of notices to the Centre and the State government and 70 media platforms, including newspapers, on a petition filed by a lawyer and BJP member, seeking a direction to the authorities to take steps to safeguard the right to privacy of individuals and ensure that media outlets don’t invade the privacy of individuals by breaching law. A Bench of Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar, in an interim order, directed that any broadcast in the media, governed by the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, should be strictly in conformity with the terms of “Programme Code” defined under this Act. The media platforms also include TV channels, online news portals, news agencies, social networking and micro-blogging service providers, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Right to privacy Citing instances of video clips purportedly showing Karnataka MLA and former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi getting intimate with an unidentified woman flooding the media, the petitioner, Atma V.

Free breakfasts would involve an additional budget of Rs. 4,000 crore, according to officials, but the School Education Department has seen a budget cut of almost Rs. 5,000 crore this year. In its submission to the panel, the Department said it had proposed two new components to the mid-day meal scheme during 2021-22 — an expansion of coverage from the current Class 1-8 students to include pre-primary students as well, and the provision of breakfast. “The Department in its written submission also informed that a number of States have started providing breakfast to the students in the mid-day meal scheme. The Committee recommends that under the schemes all schools should start providing breakfast [for] the students in the next academic session as envisaged in NEP, 2020,” said the panel’s report, submitted to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. “The Centre’s current expenditure on the scheme is about Rs. 11,000 crore for 11.8 crore students. We were hoping to start providing breakfast from April when the new session starts, but we estimate it will cost us another Rs. 4,000 crore. There have been major budget cuts, so the plan has been delayed by several months now,” said a senior Ministry official. The School Education Department saw an 8% cut in allocation from the 2020-21 budget estimate of Rs. 59,845 crore to Rs. 54,873 crore in the coming year. The Department’s revised estimates for last year were lower as schools were shut to prevent COVID-19 spread for more than nine months, but the mid-day meal scheme was one of the few to see expenditure rise during the pandemic. “Students were given dry ration or DBT [that is, a cash allowance] in lieu of mid-day meals. Plus, the scheme remained open through the summer holidays as well. So our expenditure was higher than usual,” said the official. The Central allocation for the meals had a budget estimate of Rs. 11,000 crore in 2020-21, and a revised estimate of Rs. 12,900 crore. However, the 2020-21 budget estimate was slashed back down to Rs. 11,500 crore, which is insufficient to provide breakfast, let alone expand coverage to include younger children. Officials say depending on the economic situation and the Centre’s revenue position, the proposal could be re-examined later in the year. The States’ finances may also come into play, as the Centre bears the entire cost of foodgrains, but shares the cost of food preparation and distribution with them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/breakfast-in-schools-plan-faces-delay/article34040958.ece

11 March 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. leader Chacko quits party||Senior Congress leader P.C. Chacko has quit the party ahead of the Kerala Assembly election on April 6, blaming factionalism in the party’s State unit and a lack of “proper” leadership at the national level. Speaking to presspersons at his Delhi residence, Mr. Chacko said he had been mulling over it for a while and sent in his resignation to party president Sonia Gandhi out of frustration. Alleged factionalism Mr. Chacko expressed despair over the alleged factionalism in the party’s State unit. “In Kerala, there is no Congress party. There are two parties — Congress (I) led by Ramesh Chennithala and Congress (A) led by Oommen Chandy,” he said. Mr. Chacko had flagged this issue many times to the central leadership, but to no avail. The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) was a powerless entity and it was these two factions that decided the working of the party, he said. “No names came up before the State election committee of the KPCC. Only Chandy and Chennithala decide who will contest from their respective factions. This is disturbing and disappointing. Today in Kerala, one cannot be a Congressman, you can only be faction I or faction A member. So, I decided to call it a day after 50 years of being in active politics,” Mr. Chacko said. The BJP, he noted, was winning not on its own strength, but because of the Congress’s weakness. “It is unfortunate that despite her ill health, Sonia ji has to step in. The Congress has been functioning for one-and-a-half years without a proper president,” Mr. Chacko said. ‘Refused to sign’ The G-23 had contacted him at the time of writing the first letter, which sought internal reforms. But he refused to sign the letter. “I did not want to question the leadership of Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi. The G-23 is also not questioning their leadership qualities, it is only saying that there should be elections to the post of president and the Congress Working Committee. All they are saying is that the party affairs should be put in order as per the party’s constitution,” Mr. Chacko observed. Says no to BJP As of now, he had not thought about his future plans, he stated. He ruled out joining the BJP who, he said, had failed to move the Kerala voters despite spending huge amounts of money. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are visiting Kerala frequently. But they cannot change the mindset of Malayalis, who cannot accept a communal party,” Mr. Chacko added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-leader-chacko-quits-party/article34040862.ece
11 March 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata injured during campaign, alleges plot||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday suffered injuries to her left leg while campaigning in Nandigram and was rushed to Kolkata for treatment. A visibly distressed Ms. Banerjee alleged that she was greeting people when four or five people surrounded and pushed her. “There were no local police personnel. Even the Superintendent of Police was not there.. There is lot of swelling .. I am in pain and have to return to Kolkata,” Ms. Banerjee told journalists. Asked whether there was some conspiracy, Ms. Banerjee said, “It is a conspiracy. They did it purposely.” The Chief Minister was brought to the SSKM Hospital. She was returning from a religious event in Nandigram to her temporary residence in Reyapara and stepped out of her vehicle to greet people, when the incident occurred. Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, Trinamool Congress MP who was in Nandigram with Ms. Banerjee, said, “At about 6.15 p.m., when she was about to leave Birulia Anchal after performing puja in a temple, a few unknown persons pushed her to the car and forcibly shut down the door, as a result of which she sustained injuries in her left leg and also suffered severe pain in the waist. The Trinamool Congress leadership condemned the development and called it “most unfortunate”. While a section of the BJP leadership wished her a speedy recovery, party leaders like Kailash Vijyavargiya and Arjun Singh and State Congress president Adhir Chowdhury alleged she was trying to “gain sympathy”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-injured-during-campaign-alleges-plot/article34040880.ece

11 March 2021||Bengaluru,||TV channels warned against violating code||Acting on the direction of the High Court of Karnataka, city Police Commissioner Kamal Pant has issued a general order prohibiting all television channels from airing programmes which are not in conformity with the “Programme Code” notified under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. The court, on a petition filed by Atma V. Hiremath, had on March 6 directed that the any broadcast on the cable television network should be strictly in conformity with the terms of the “Programme Code”. The State government had assured the court that the Commissioner of Police, who is the “authorised officer” for Bengaluru city under the Act, would take necessary steps. The order, passed by Mr. Pant on March 9, under Section 19 of the Cable CTN (Regulation) Act, also states that any violation of the order is liable for prosecution under Section 16 of the Act. The law prescribes imprisonment up to two years or fine up to Rs. 1,000 or both for the first offence, and imprisonment up to five years and with fine up to Rs. 5,000 if any media governed under CTN Act violates the provisions of this Act and the “Programme Code”. The code, which contains an elaborate list of don’ts for cable TV channels, specifies that no programme should be aired that contains anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggests innuendos and half-truths. The other important prohibitions in the code are on telecasting programmes which denigrate women through the depiction in any manner of the figure of a woman, her form or body or any part thereof in such a way as to have the effect of being indecent, or derogatory to women, or is likely to deprave, corrupt or injure the public morality or morals; is not suitable for unrestricted public exhibition; contravenes the provisions of the Cinematograph Act, 1952, etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tv-channels-warned-against-violating-code/article34040845.ece
11 March 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Haryana govt. defeats no-trust vote||The no-confidence motion moved by the Congress against the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party coalition government in Haryana on Wednesday was defeated by 55 votes to 32. The legislators voted along party lines with two Independents — Meham MLA Balraj Kundu and Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan — supporting the vote of no-confidence. In the 90-member Assembly, the BJP and the JJP have 40 and 10 MLAs respectively, besides the support of five Independents. Lone Haryana Janhit Party MLA Gopal Kanda, representing Sirsa, also voted in favour of the government. The Congress has 30 MLAs. Two Assembly seats of Ellenabad and Kalka had fallen vacant earlier this year. Moving the no-confidence motion against the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government, Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the coalition government had completely lost the confidence of the people. Mr. Hooda said both parties in government had promised Minimum Support Price to farmers in their manifestos, but forgot about it after coming to power. He also raised issue of unemployment. Mr. Hooda, however, said he won’t talk about the three farm laws since they were outside the ambit of the Assembly.  Opposing the motion, JJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said “the BJP was his party’s natural ally”. Mr. Khattar, in his reply, said the Congress had the culture of “lack of confidence”. He took a dig at factionalism in the Opposition party saying that they did not trust even their own leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/haryana-govt-defeats-no-trust-vote/article34040866.ece
11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Work on floating solar power plant in final stages||The country’s biggest floating solar power plant, by generation capacity, till date being developed by NTPC in the reservoir of its thermal plant at Ramagundam in Peddapalli district of Telangana is set to be commissioned by May-June next. Work on the 100 megawatt plant is in the final stages of completion. It would be one of the renewable (solar) energy plants being developed by NTPC with an installed capacity of 447 MW in the Southern Region and the entire capacity would be commissioned by March 2023. Except for the 230 MW ground-mounted solar power plant at Ettayapuram in Thoothukudi district of Tamil Nadu, the remaining 217 MW capacity was being planned to be commissioned by May-June this year, Regional Executive Director (South) of NTPC C.V. Anand stated here on Wednesday. The renewable energy plants that are likely to be commissioned in the next three months are 25 MW floating solar plant at Simhadri thermal power plant near Visakhapatnam and 92 MW floating solar plant at Kayamkulam in Kerala, besides the 100 MW plant at Ramagundam. As all the thermal plants would have reservoirs, establishing floating solar plants in them was the immediate available opportunity without going for any land acquisition, the NTPC official said. “Floating solar plants is an opportunity to generate power with low cost as land acquisition of at least 5 acres per megawatt of capacity involves huge fixed cost. Since there are a large number of major reservoirs in the Southern Region including in Telangana, it would be a huge opportunity to go for renewable energy in the floating solar method”, Mr. Anand explained. The Ramagundam floating plant was being established with a cost of Rs. 423 crore. FGDs construction On complying with the environmental protection norms by setting flu gas de-sulpherization (FGD) plants at all thermal power plants, the NTPC official said work on the FGDs was in progress at all plans in the Southern Region and it would be completed by December 2022 deadline. He stated that the cost of establishing FGD systems was Rs. 0.30 per unit of generation capacity. “Although it’s quite high it has been invested for the sake of better environment,” he said. Explaining the new initiatives of NTPC-SR, Mr. Anand said they had developed a geo-polymer aggregate using fly ash at NTPC Ramagundam as a replacement to natural coarse aggregates and could be used as a substitute in building construction. The National Council for Cement and Building Materials had tested the 1.45 km road laid with geo-polymer aggregate inside the NTPC complex and tests proved it as a useful material. Besides, they had also developed a nano-concrete aggregate with fly ash at NTPC Simhadri and a model building was constructed with it as demo. They were also using the waste heat from flue gas for distillation of sea water at Simhadri and using solar thermal technology at Vallur in Tamil Nadu for producing 120 tonnes per day drinking water at desalination plant. Further, NTPC Ramagundam had entered into a MoU with National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for lifting 6.31 lack cubic meters of pond ash in the construction of NH-363 at about 300 km away from Ramagundam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/work-on-floating-solar-power-plant-in-final-stages/article34040843.ece
11 March 2021||New Delhi,||Both Houses manage to pass one Bill each amid din||For the third day in a row, both Houses of Parliament could barely do any business, with the government refusing to concede the Opposition’s demand of holding a debate on the farmers’ agitation. Each House managed to pass one Bill each amid din. The Lok Sabha passed the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Bill and the Rajya Sabha cleared the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2021. In the Rajya Sabha, commotion began early on, with the first adjournment coming in just 17 minutes after the session began for the day. House Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu rejected the notices moved by Congress members Deepender Hooda, Pratap Bajwa and Rajiv Satav, along with Tiruchi Siva of the DMK and Manoj K. Jha of the RJD asking for the suspension of business to discuss the farmers’ agitation. Mr. Naidu said the farm laws were debated in the first part of the session itself. “If you have the numbers, you can prevail upon the government. If there are no numbers and if you want to disrupt the House, it is not fair,” he said, adding that the Opposition was not doing any justice to the farmers’ cause. ‘Govt. does not care’ Speaking outside the House, Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said the Opposition only wanted discussion. “We are not here to cause disruption. What is stopping the government from allowing a discussion on fuel price hike and the farmers’ agitation. The government just doesn’t care,” he alleged. After two successive adjournments, when the Rajya Sabha met at 2 p.m., the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was passed through a voice vote amid din. It was passed by the Lok Sabha on February 12, 2021. The Bill seeks to ensure that all stakeholders get an opportunity to seek an unconditional stay on the enforcement of arbitration awards where the agreement or contract is “induced by fraud or corruption”. The Lok Sabha was also adjourned twice amidst slogan shouting by the Opposition benches on the three farm laws. When it resumed at 2.30 p.m., Meenakshi Lekhi started the discussion on Demands for Grants for Railways in 2021-22. Just as ruling party MP Ram Kirpal Yadav started speaking, Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury got up from his seat to argue that the Opposition had been demanding to raise the issue of farmers’ protests that has been going on for over 100 days now. When Ms. Lekhi asked Mr. Yadav to continue with his speech, the Congress members started raising slogans. In the midst of the protests, Mr. Yadav lauded the railways for being the country’s lifeline that strengthens cultural nationalism and recounted the railways’ contribution during the pandemic, including the transportation of personal protection equipment (PPE) and sanitizers. Facing interruptions, Mr. Yadav attacked the Congress but his remarks were expunged by the Chair. When order couldn’t be restored, Ms. Lekhi adjourned the House until Monday. Parliament wouldn’t sit for the next few days on account of festivals and the weekend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ls-rs-manage-to-pass-one-bill-each/article34040870.ece
11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||There are no two groups in Congress: Anand Sharma||The Congress had always stood for internal discussions and there were no two groups within the party as all were fighting under Sonia Gandhi’s leadership to defeat the BJP in the coming Assembly elections, senior leader Anand Sharma said on Wednesday. Mr. Sharma, a key member of the group of 23 dissenters (G-23) who had written a letter to Ms. Gandhi last August to push for a revamp of the organisation, was responding to a question on an allegation of groupism by senior leader from Kerala P.C. Chacko who, earlier in the day, announced his resignation from the party. The Congress’s Deputy Leader in the Rajya Sabha was part of a joint press conference at party headquarters along with Leader of the Opposition in the House Mallikarjun Kharge, and other party MPs, including Deepender Hooda, Akhilesh Prasad Singh and Syed Nasir Hussain. The Congress leaders were addressing the media about the stalemate in Parliament over fuel price rise, inflation and farmers’ protests for the last three days. While the Congress-led Opposition has been demanding an immediate discussion on these issues, the government is keen to first pass its legislative business. Mr. Kharge said, “Petrol and diesel have never been this expensive in India’s history. The price of kerosene that used to be sold under the public distribution system is now touching the skies”. The government had collected Rs. 21 lakh crore in excise duty in the past six years and the Opposition wanted which welfare schemes the government spent this amount on, he stated. Mr. Sharma charged the government with “monumental mismanagement” of the economy, negating parliamentary tradition by denying the Opposition an opportunity to raise questions. “Convening of Parliament is not meant only for transaction of government business...The Opposition must be given its space and voice,” he said, adding that the government was “striking at the very roots of democracy”. Mr. Hooda alleged that the government was insensitive to farmers’ issues and claimed that rarely had there been any agitation that had claimed nearly 300 lives over 100 days and yet an elected government remained unmoved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/there-are-no-two-groups-in-congress-anand-sharma/article34040882.ece
11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Dialogue with China will go on till friction points eased’||India will continue dialogue with China till disengagement is achieved from ‘all’ sectors, Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan said in Parliament on Wednesday. To a question, he said China had made several attempts since the spring of 2020 to “unilaterally alter” the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh. “The government will continue discussions with the Chinese side to achieve the objective of disengagement from all friction points and restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas at an early date,” Mr. Muraleedharan said. He elaborated on the diplomatic initiatives by India to solve the confrontation over the past one year. Moscow meeting Following the face-off, External Affairs Minister Jaishankar first had a telephone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on June 17. This was followed by a physical meeting on September 10 in Moscow. “The two Foreign Ministers agreed that the situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side. They agreed therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions,” Mr. Muraleedharan said. He said the two sides had held six meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs (WMCC) and nine meetings of the senior commanders. The statement said India had conveyed to the Chinese side that unilateral moves to change the LAC were “unacceptable” to New Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dialogue-with-china-will-go-on-till-friction-points-eased/article34040889.ece

The dates of the visit were released by the Defence Ministry. The Secretary, whose trip begins on Saturday, will also visit Japan and South Korea and the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. It would reinforce the U.S.’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific, the Pentagon said. “Secretary Austin will meet his counterparts and other senior officials to discuss the importance of international defence relationships, and reinforce the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region — founded on respect for international rules, laws, and norms,” the Pentagon said. “In India, Secretary Austin will meet his counterpart, Minister of Defence Rajnath Singh, and other senior national security leaders to discuss deepening the U.S.-India Major Defense Partnership and advancing cooperation between our countries for a free, prosperous and open Indo-Pacific and Western Indian Ocean Region,” the statement said. “Both Sides are expected to discuss ways to further strengthen bilateral defence cooperation and exchange views on regional security challenges and common interests in maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region. Discussions regarding defence cooperation would also focus on how both countries could consolidate military-to-military cooperation and defence trade and industry cooperation,” a Defence Ministry statement said, adding that India being part of Mr. Austin’s first official trip as Secretary underscored the strength of the U.S.-India strategic partnership. India and the U.S. have witnessed a deepening of their security partnership, across both Democrat and Republican administrations. Growing Chinese assertiveness has also brought them closer in terms of security cooperation. There are several defence deals in the pipeline. A proposal for 30 armed drones, 10 for each Service, from General Atomics estimated at over $3 billion, is at advanced stages of being cleared by the Defence Ministry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-defense-secretary-to-visit-india/article34040899.ece
11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||India not part of Russian meet on Afghanistan||Close on the heels of U.S. plans for a United Nations regional conference on Afghanistan, Russia has announced it will hold a conference of special envoys from the U.S., China, and Pakistan, along with representatives of the Afghanistan government, Taliban and other senior Afghan leaders next week. Unlike the UN-led formulation, however, India has not been invited to the Russian conference, officials confirmed, adding that Moscow has kept New Delhi apprised of the two-year old “Troika” process involving consultations between U.S., Russia and China. “A regular meeting of the expanded ‘troika’ is scheduled for March 18 in Moscow at the level of special representatives of Russia, China, the United States and Pakistan, dedicated to the intra-Afghan settlement,” said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. Apart from the Afghan representatives of the Ghani government and the High Council for National Reconciliation, leaders including former President Hamid Karzai and Qatar’s envoy have also been invited. “The meeting is expected to discuss ways to assist advancing the intra-Afghan talks in Doha, reduce the level of violence and to end the armed conflict in Afghanistan,” Ms. Zakharova said. A joint statement is expected to be released after the three-day conference. U.S. Special Representative on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad is yet to confirm his participation in the expanded Troika meet, although he was part of at least two meetings of the “Troika plus Pakistan” in 2020. An Afghanistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the composition of the final delegation that would travel from Kabul was under discussion, but that the Ghani government would participate. No comment from MEA The MEA declined to comment on India’s exclusion from the meeting, which would be the first such meeting with Afghanistan and Taliban representatives present, ever since the Doha talks process ran into trouble earlier this year. Diplomatic sources said the Troika process was an “already established mechanism”, and that there was no attempt to “leave India out” of the proposed talks. The sources said Russia is committed to the path of building “regional consensus” for Afghanistan’s peace process, and that it hopes to include India in the talks framework at a later date. Officials also said the Moscow “Troika Plus” meeting next week would run “in addition to” and not “counter to” the U.S. proposals for the future roadmap for Afghanistan. The proposals include discussions on a ceasefire and power sharing in a “more inclusive” government in Kabul, and indicated that the U.S. is still considering whether to pull out its final 2,500 troops from Afghanistan by May 1 this year.  The meeting is likely to discuss ways to assist advancing intra-Afghan talks in Doha Maria Zakharova Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-not-part-of-russian-meet-on-afghanistan/article34040900.ece
11 March 2021||New Delhi,||After Mizoram, Manipur offers help to Myanmar refugees||Manipur Chief minister N. Biren Singh said on Wednesday that schools may be arranged by the State government for “refugees from Myanmar,” but since it was a bilateral issue, they were awaiting directions from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Mr. Singh told The Hindu on the phone that several persons from Myanmar “attempted to sneak” into India from the Manipur border but returned on seeing the presence of large number of security personnel. Manipur shares a 398 km border with Myanmar. More than a dozen foreign nationals including policemen and women from Myanmar have fled to neighbouring Mizoram fearing a military crackdown. “I have requested Home Minister Amit Shah to tell us what to do. If you ask me it is a humanitarian issue but since it is a bilateral issue between India and Myanmar, I have to speak to the Centre,” Mr. Singh said. Schools planned When asked if arrangements have been done to house the people fleeing the Myanmar military, Mr. Singh said, “Schools etc. may be arranged, we are almost ready but awaiting directions.” “We had alerted the border and deployed additional security forces there. There is no exodus so far but we are expecting many people to come here,” he said, adding, “We are prepared to give shelter to any civilian.” MHA has refused to comment on the future course of action pertaining to the refugees from Myanmar. The Mizoram government has also rued lack of instructions from the Centre on the issue. Mizoram’s Environment and Transport Minister T.J. Lalnungtluanga had told The Hindu on Tuesday, “There is no proper instruction from the Centre, and it is not fair. I am ready to help the people in my individual capacity and from the government on humanitarian grounds.” Chief Secy in Delhi Mizoram Chief Secretary Lalnunmawia Chuaungo flew to Delhi on Tuesday even though the legislative Assembly is in session. He is likely to have met senior MHA officials. In an interview to the BBC, police officers from Myanmar who fled across the border into Mizoram said “they escaped, fearing they’d be forced to kill or harm civilians.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-mizoram-manipur-offers-help-to-myanmar-refugees/article34040893.ece
11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Lok Sabha gives approval for National Capital Territory Bill||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that seeks to regularise unauthorised colonies that existed in the National Capital Territory of Delhi as on June 1, 2014, and had seen development up to 50% as on January 1, 2015. Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri, speaking on the Bill, said there “was a public perception that the issues with regard to unauthorised colonies were delayed by those who were in office earlier.” “In 1947, 17% of the total population of the country lived in urban areas, Delhi’s population at that time was eight lakh. After partition and relocation, it went up to 22 lakhs, and I expect that during the Census of 2021, the population would be close to two crore people,” he said. Survey extension Mr. Puri also quoted a letter received by his Ministry from the Delhi government seeking the extension of a survey of unauthorised colonies. “That is why we brought this Bill,” he said. Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi, said that a large number of people living in unauthorised colonies in Delhi were not receiving proper amenities and that this Bill provided ownership rights to those living in these colonies. It would facilitate access to institutional credit and also improve the basic amenities. The Bill was then passed by voice vote. The government had introduced the Bill and got it cleared in the Rajya Sabha in February, in the first part of the Budget session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lok-sabha-gives-approval-for-national-capital-territory-bill/article34040894.ece
11 March 2021||Chennai,||Railway safety chief flags gaps in report on train accident||The Commissioner of Railway Safety has formally written to the Railway Board pointing to serious gaps in the inquiry report of a major accident which had a bearing on further investigation and called for amending the Accident Manual to ensure preservation of clues and evidence. The Railway Board has agreed to the advisory and directed the authorities concerned to make necessary changes in the Accident Manual. The investigation relates to the accident of Train no. 12487 Seemanchal Express at Sahdai Buzurg railway station in Sonpur Division, East Central Railway, during the early hours of February 2, 2019, which left six passengers dead and 24 others injured. “In this accident detailed observations of track and coaches were not done properly and some gaps were left out which have a bearing on investigation. Railway need to amplify and issue correction slip to para 4.12 to 4.18 of Accident Manual of ECR and all other Railways,” the Commissioner of Railway Safety said in his report. The independent investigating official who comes under the Ministry of Civil Aviation noted that in the Joint Note prepared by railway officials who inspected the scene of the accident, some evidence relating to damage caused to under-gear, brake rigging, coupling and buffers, position of the derailed coaches with respect to track distance and so on were not recorded. Travel marks of wheel on sleepers and their distance from rail and relative position of the detached coaches from the track were also not noted. “By the time I reached the site, the coaches were removed from their original position and they were thrown by the side of the tracks which made reconstruction of possible sequence of the derailment very difficult and cast limitations on further investigation,” the official said. The Senior Section Engineer in his deposition during the investigation stated that he did not agree with the joint inspection and even gave a dissent note, the Commissioner of Railway Safety said. After the issue was flagged at the highest level, the Safety Directorate of Railway Board, in a letter sent to General Managers of all Zonal Railways on March 2, 2021, advised them to take necessary action to amplify/amend their Accident Manuals appropriately to provide for detailed observations of track and coaches so as to ensure that there are no gaps left.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railway-official-flags-gaps-in-inquiry/article34040902.ece
11 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||After Mizoram, Manipur offers help to Myanmar refugees||After Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland have offered help to people from Myanmar who have been crossing over to the country to escape a military crackdown. Manipur Chief Minister Nongthombam Biren Singh told a digital media outlet in Imphal that he was worried about the development in the neighbouring country. “We are prepared to give shelter to any civilian who may cross over from Myanmar due to military atrocities, although the decision to lend a helping hand has to be taken nationally,” he said. The Neiphiu Rio government in Nagaland has not reacted, but the Opposition Naga People’s Front expressed solidarity with the civilians resisting the military junta in Myanmar. More than 100 people, including police and fire service personnel, have crossed over into Mizoram. There are no reports of people entering Manipur and Nagaland, but the resistance movement is growing in regions of Myanmar adjoining these States. Several communities ethnically related to the Naga and Kuki-Zomi communities inhabit areas across the border in Myanmar. Officials in Mizoram said they were still awaiting instructions from the Centre on how to deal with the refugees, although food and shelter was being provided to some of them on humanitarian grounds. The State government had on February 27 circulated a standard operating procedure for the “facilitation of refugees and migrants from Myanmar”. There are about 150 border crossings, the most frequented being Moreh in Manipur and Zokhawthar in Mizoram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-mizoram-manipur-offers-help-to-myanmar-refugees/article34041523.ece

Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi, told reporters after the meet that Mr. Modi’s handling of the pandemic was lauded by party MPs. “Prime Minister Modi also gave a clarion call to MPs to reach out to people in helping to carry out the vaccination drive. MPs should act as facilitators in the ongoing vaccination drive by arranging vehicles for citizens to take them to the vaccination centres, helping in making arrangements at the vaccination centres and other activity,” he said. “Prime Minister Modi also asked all public representatives to take part in the ‘Amrit Mahotsav’ to commemorate 75 years of Independence. The grand festival will be celebrated at 75 locations across the country for 75 weeks and will start from Sabarmati Ashram from March 12,” said Mr. Joshi. Party president J.P. Nadda said the party had pulled together to reach out to people during the pandemic. The last meeting of the BJP parliamentary party was on March 17, 2020, after which social media requirements led to a suspension of in-person meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-parliamentary-party-meet-lauds-pm/article34040878.ece
11 March 2021||MALAPPURAM,||CPI(M) ‘defeats’ BJP ‘bid’ to communalise Ponnani||The CPI(M) appears to have defeated the ‘attempts’ of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to communalise the ‘mutiny’ within the party in Ponnani against the candidature of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) secretary P. Nandakumar. By sticking on to its decision to field Mr. Nandakumar, the CPI(M) wanted to show that the people of Malappuram, particularly Ponnani, are above communal parochialism. The BJP had started campaigning to create an impression that Mr. Nandakumar was opposed because he was a Hindu. Communal card BJP State president K. Surendran had set the ‘communal ball’ rolling when he said that ‘the situation was so bad in Malappuram that a Hindu cannot even contest in a constituency like Ponnani’. Mr. Surendran also had said the CPI(M) had transformed itself into the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Malabar. “It’s ridiculous and unfortunate,” said T.M. Siddique, CPI(M) Malappuram district committee member. A large group of people had taken out a demonstration in Ponnani two days ago seeking the candidature of Mr. Siddique in place of Mr. Nandakumar. The CPI(M), however, stuck to its decision on Mr. Nandakumar and convinced the protesters about the party decision. CPI(M) local leaders in Ponnani said there was nothing communal in the demand by a section for Mr. Siddique’s candidacy. It was only the demand for a local man, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cpim-defeats-bjp-bid-to-communalise-ponnani/article34041356.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Stick to code, Karnataka HC tells media||A Bench of Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar, in an interim order, directed that any broadcast in the media, governed by the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, should be strictly in conformity with the terms of “Programme Code” defined under this Act. The media platforms also include TV channels, online news portals, news agencies, social networking and micro-blogging service providers, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Right to privacy Citing instances of video clips purportedly showing Karnataka MLA and former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi getting intimate with an unidentified woman flooding the media, the petitioner, Atma V. Hiremath, said “he feared that media platforms may, in fact, get hold of some of his private moments and may air them with total disregard to his right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution”. The petitioner also cited media reports about claims made by social activist Dinesh Kallahalli that he had many CDs containing “explicit contents of other persons belonging to the BJP”. The petitioner sought a direction to the authorities to prohibit and restrain 70 media platforms from publishing, circulating, disseminating any content either visual or in any other form, which is in violation of right to privacy enshrined under Article 21, and in violation of the provisions of CTN (Regulation) Act. “The petitioner apprehends that if the media platforms are not restrained... his right to live with dignity may get trampled like that of other leaders belonging to his political party,” the petition said.

The statutory authorities, the petitioner alleged, have miserably failed to take any action either to restrain these media platforms or prosecute them. “With private lives of the citizens being splattered over the media be it through social networking sites or spy cameras, protection is needed so that citizens can function in a way they want to and not think of others before their actions,” the petitioner said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-to-curb-medias-breach-of-privacy/article34040840.ece
11 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka forms SIT to probe Jarkiholi CD||The State government late on Wednesday announced a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe into the alleged scandal involving the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. Soumendu Mukherjee, Additional Commissioner, Bengaluru City Police, will head the team. The team’s terms of reference will be restricted to unearthing who was involved in the making of the widely circulated CD that purportedly showed Mr. Jarkiholi’s intimate moments with a woman and their motives. It will, however, not go into the allegation that the woman in the video was promised a job in return for sexual favours. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai made the announcement on the probe after attending a meeting chaired by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and senior police officers. Mr. Jarkiholi had written to Mr. Bommai on Tuesday seeking a probe into the scandal. “He stated that the CD case was a conspiracy aimed at character assassination, causing political damage and for defaming him,” Mr. Bommai said. Earlier Mr. Jarkiholi, who said he had hired private detectives to probe the people behind the alleged scandal to implicate him, had said that “four leaders” were involved in the “conspiracy.” Mr. Jarkiholi had demanded a probe either by the CBI or the CID. The former Minister had to step down from his post as Large and Medium Irrigation Minister after allegations were levelled against him that he had sought sexual favours from a woman after promising her a job. However, the complainant in the case, Dinesh Kallahalli, withdrew the complaint days after filing it. Meanwhile, the Cubbon Park police are continuing their effort to track down the woman in the video clips and will hand over the details of the probe to the SIT.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karnataka-forms-sit-to-probe-jarkiholi-cd/article34040920.ece
11 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Five Ministers, Speaker dropped from CPI(M) list||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and six of his Cabinet colleagues have been fielded by the ruling CPI(M) for the April 6 State Assembly elections. There are 33 new faces on the candidate list. Party acting State Secretary A. Vijayaraghavan on Wednesday released a list of 83 of its candidates including nine CPI(M)- supported Independents. The party would announce the candidates for Manjeswaram and Devikulam later. Health Minister K.K. Shylaja, Labour Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan, Power Minister M.M. Mani, Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran, Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma and Local Self-Government Minister A.C. Moideen are trying their luck once again. Mr. Vijayan will contest from Dharmadam in Kannur district. Thirty-three incumbent legislators will not contest this time. Five Ministers — T.M. Thomas Isaac, E.P. Jayarajan, C. Ravindranath, G. Sudhakaran and A.K. Balan — and Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan have been denied the ticket. M.V. Govindan, K. Radhakrishan, P. Rajeev and K.N. Balagopal are the State secretariat members who are contesting. As many as 12 women and 4 youngsters below the age of 30 years are among the candidates. Twenty-eight lawyers and 25 candidates below the age of 50 have found a place on the list. The candidates included 42 bachelor’s degree holders, 14 postgraduates, two doctorate holders, two doctors and one architect. SFI president V.P. Sanu will contest the Lok Sabha byelection on the CPI(M) ticket from Malappuram. Party norms Mr. Vijayaraghavan said the party had not excluded anyone. It considered Parliamentary work and organisational duties equally important. Governmental responsibility was neither the sole criterion for party work nor the only yardstick of political commitment. Organisational responsibilities were of paramount importance in the CPI(M). The CPI(M) State committee had decided to pull out members who had contested the Assembly elections twice. It had decided to field an eclectic mix of youth, experience and professional expertise to create opportunities for fresh faces. Unlike the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, no anonymous power centre decided party affairs, Mr. Vijayaraghavan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/five-ministers-speaker-dropped-from-cpim-list/article34040851.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Zomato delivery person accused of assault, held||The Electronics City police on Wednesday arrested a 35-year-old food delivery executive with Zomato for allegedly punching a customer and fracturing her nose after the two got into an argument. The complainant, Hitesha Chandranee, a make-up artist, posted a video online describing the alleged attack, which occurred on March 9. It showed a deep gash on her nose. She filed a complaint with the police, who arrested the accused, Kamaraj. “He has been charged for causing grievous hurt and intentional insult, and remanded in judicial custody,” said the police officer. In the video, Ms. Chandranee said she had ordered food around 3.30 p.m. and the delivery was expected within an hour. When the food did not arrive, she called the firm’s customer care number to lodge a complaint seeking a free delivery or cancellation of the order. While she was on the phone, she said the accused landed at her door. An argument followed as she said she was speaking to the customer care centre to cancel the order even as the delivery partner took objection to being made to wait. Ms. Chandranee alleged that the delivery partner pushed the door open, barged into the house, placed the order on her table, punched her in the face and ran out. In his statement, Kamaraj told the police that the customer was rude and verbally abused him. “He said she refused to pay for the order and was not listening to him. He got angry when she made him wait while she was on a call with the customer care centre. He claimed that he had other deliveries to make, and punched her during the argument,” the officer added. After the video went viral on social media, the company apologised. “We deeply regret this incident and apologise to Hitesha for this traumatic experience. We are in touch with her and are providing our complete support through the necessary medical care and investigation. Meanwhile, we have delisted the delivery partner from our platform,” said a spokesperson of Zomato.  We deeply regret this incident and apologise for this traumatic experience.

11 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Bengaluru schools revert to online exam format||Private school managements which had decided to conduct the 2020-21 academic year-end examinations on campus are having second thoughts given the steady rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in the State. Many have decided to revert to the online examination format. Earlier this month, two government schools in Karnataka were sealed after students and teachers tested positive for the virus. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said that they thought of conducting offline examination with all the precautionary measures in place. Now, however, the management does not want to take the risk and is conducting online examinations for students of classes one to five. The school is yet to decide on the format for students of classes six to nine. “We will wait and watch for another week and then decide whether students should come to the school to write the examination or whether they should take it online from their homes,” he said. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, Delhi Public Group of Schools, said that they would ask only students of class nine and above to report to campuses. “If COVID-19 cases increase further, we will give parents and students the choice to opt for online examinations,” he said. However, teachers and principals are worried that online examinations will not give them a clear idea of the progress students have made and whether they have grasped all the concepts. Concerns have been raised regarding honesty and integrity during online examinations. Most schools conducted their midterm examinations online with teachers monitoring the process. “While parents were given the responsibility of ensuring that students did not cheat at home, it was found that many were helping their children. In some cases, they even wrote the paper for them,” said Mr. Khan. Parents too are demanding that schools give them the option of writing the examinations online. Srilekha S., a parent of a class eight student, said that with new COVID-19 clusters being detected in Bengaluru, she did not want to send her daughter school. “Although the government has allowed schools to reopen, the CBSE school where my daughter studies has decided not to conduct offline classes. “So we hope that she will be given the option of writing the examination from home,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengaluru-schools-revert-to-online-exam-format/article34040854.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Tirath Singh Rawat is new CM of Uttarakhand||“In 2017, he was prevented from getting ticket by a camp led by his predecessor after which Mr. Shah appointed him national secretary with the charge of handling party affairs in Himachal Pradesh. He was also given the prestigious Garhwal seat to contest from in the Lok Sabha polls, a sign that the central leadership felt he had been cheated out of Assembly ticket. He is the kind of man who doesn’t have an entourage of staff and most often answers his own phone,” a senior leader said. It is being hoped that this more low-key, amiable appointment would heal some of the ruptures within the State unit, which caused a revolt against Mr. Trivendra Singh Rawat.  Sources said that one of the first things that the new Chief Minister has been tasked to do by the party’s central leadership is to roll back two unpopular decisions of his predecessor— that of the Chardham Devasthanam Management Board Act that sought to extend the government control over 51 Hindu shrines, including Badrinath and Kedarnath, sparking massive protests by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Hindu outfits, and that of the setting up of the Gairsain Commissionerate, amalgamating Almora from Kumaon, and the Badrinath and Kedarnath sub-divisions from Garhwal, again sparking massive resentment. Uttarakhand will go to the polls in February next and while it is late in the day to be changing leadership in the State, the BJP is hoping that people may instead take the change as a sign that the party is responsive to public criticism of its leaders and had taken action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tirath-singh-rawat-is-new-cm-of-uttarakhand/article34040863.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Breakfast plan faces delay over fund crunch||The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education has recommended that all government schools start providing free breakfast in the coming academic year as part of an expansion of the mid-day meal scheme envisaged by the National Education Policy. However, Education Ministry officials say a severe funding crunch is likely to delay the initiative. Free breakfasts would involve an additional budget of Rs. 4,000 crore, according to senior officials, but the School Education Department has seen a budget cut of almost Rs. 5,000 crore this year. In its submission to the panel, the Department said it had proposed two new components to the mid-day meal scheme during 2021-22 — an expansion of coverage from the current Class 1-8 students, to include pre-primary students as well, and the provision of breakfast. “The Department in its written submission also informed that a number of States have started providing breakfast to the students in the mid-day meal scheme. The Committee recommends that under the schemes all schools should start providing breakfast [for] the students in the next academic session as envisaged in NEP, 2020,” said the panel’s report, submitted to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. Budget cuts “The Centre’s current expenditure on the scheme is about Rs. 11,000 crore for 11.8 crore students. We were hoping to start providing breakfast from April when the new session starts, but we estimate it will cost us another Rs. 4,000 crore. There have been major budget cuts, so the plan has been delayed by several months now,” a senior Ministry official said. The School Education Department saw an 8% cut in allocation from the 2020-21 budget estimate of Rs. 59,845 crore to Rs. 54,873 crore in the coming year. The Department’s revised estimates for last year were lower as schools were shut to prevent COVID-19 spread for more than nine months, but the mid-day meal scheme was one of the few to see expenditure rise during the pandemic. Dry ration “Students were given dry ration or DBT [that is, a cash allowance] in lieu of mid-day meals. Plus, the scheme remained open through the summer holidays as well. So our expenditure was higher than usual,” the official said. The Central allocation for the meals had a budget estimate of Rs. 11,000 crore in 2020-21, and a revised estimate of Rs. 12,900 crore. However, the 2020-21 budget estimate was slashed back down to Rs. 11,500 crore, which is insufficient to provide breakfast, let alone expand coverage to include younger children. Officials say depending on the economic situation and the Centre’s revenue position, the proposal could be re-examined later in the year. The States’ finances may also come into play, as the Centre bears the entire cost of foodgrains, but shares the cost of food preparation and distribution with them.  Free breakfasts would involve an additional budget of Rs. 4,000 crore, according to senior officials, but the School Education Department has seen a budget cut of almost Rs. 5,000 crore this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/breakfast-in-schools-plan-faces-delay/article34040864.ece
11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Gender discrimination alleged in NDA admission||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the government to respond to a plea alleging discrimination against women by barring them from taking the exam for admission to the prestigious National Defence Academy and the Naval Academy. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the government and the Union Public Service Commission on a petition filed by advocate Kush Kalra, who said eligible and willing women who aspire for a career in the Armed Forces are prohibited entry into these centres of excellence solely on the ground of gender. Mr. Kalra said the discrimination shown to women was a dishonour to the Constitution. “The act of categorically excluding eligible and willing female candidates from appearing for the National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination over the years, solely on the ground of sex, is a violation of the fundamental right of equality before the law and equal protection of the law,” the petition said. It referred to the Supreme Court’s judgment in February last year, which helped women officers gain a level playing ground and compete on a par with their male counterparts for permanent commission (PC).

11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBI tells SC that it will pursue coal theft case||The CBI informed the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the Mamata Banerjee government’s withdrawal of general consent for CBI investigations cannot stop it from probing the massive theft and illegal transportation of coal from the Eastern Coalfield mines by State and Central public sector officials in cahoots with the mafia. One of the prime accused in the case, Anup Majee, had approached the Supreme Court in appeal against a Calcutta HC order upholding the CBI probe. Majee is a director of a company engaged in the purchase and sale of the dry fuel. He argued that the State government had withdrawn its general consent to CBI investigations in its territory in 2018 and the case was politically motivated. In a counter-affidavit spanning over 850 pages, the CBI, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, replied that its investigation was based on a mandate given by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). The Eastern Coalfields Limited had approached the CVC. “The CBI is under a mandate of the CVC to continue and complete the investigation,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-tells-sc-that-it-will-pursue-coal-theft-case/article34040890.ece

It also deprived the intermediaries of their “safe-harbour protections” under Section 79 of the IT Act.

11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farm unions to boycott BJP-JJP MLAs||Haryana farm unions have vowed to intensify their boycott of the MLAs who supported the BJP-JJP government in Wednesday’s no-confidence motion, saying they would have no political future in the State. At a press conference on Wednesday, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha also laid out its agenda for the rest of the month, including plans for a Bharat Bandh on March 26 to mark four months of the movement. “The no-confidence motion has clearly exposed who stands with the farmers and workers, and who stands against,” said Vikas Sisar, who heads Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samiti. He said the Haryana unions would decide how to intensify the social boycott of BJP and JJP leaders who are already not being allowed to enter their own villages. The Congress’s no-confidence motion was defeated 32-55 in the Assembly. “The anti-farmer face of the JJP, which describes itself as a party belonging to the farming community, has been completely exposed. These MLAs have no political future,” said an SKM statement. ‘Seeds of opposition’ “Farmers have sown seeds of opposition and resistance against these anti-farmer faces, and results will be harvested soon,” it added. Some SKM leaders attended an election rally against the BJP in Kolkata on Wednesday, calling on citizens to vote against the party in the West Bengal elections. Senior SKM leaders are expected to address a larger rally on Friday. Although many union leaders are focussed on poll campaigning this month, they have also laid out a full calendar of events. “On March 15, we will highlight the rising prices of petrol and diesel and other essential commodities as part of the anti-privatisation and anti-corporates protest with trade unions,” said Buta Singh Burjgill, a veteran Punjab leader of the BKU. Other events include a day-long nationwide strike on March 26, protests in mandis on March 19, youth participation in protests on March 23 to commemorate the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh, and the burning of the three farm laws in Holi fires on March 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-unions-to-boycott-bjp-jjp-mlas/article34040884.ece

Rama Rao said the party stood against privatisation of public sector undertakings. Opposing the privatisation move, KTR said if necessary he would seek permission of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to personally participate inthe agitation against VSP privatisation. He made these comments at two different events he attended as part of the campaign in support of the party's candidate Vani Devi in the Graduate MLC elections. KTR said VSP was established after a prologned fight as a right of Andhra people. “If we keep quiet today the Central government will also sell Singareni or other PSUs in Telangana,” he said criticising the BJP for not honouring the establishment of Bayyaram steel plant at Khammam as promised in the AP Reorganisation Act. ‘Not disinvestment’ Further attacking Prime Minister Modi's government, he said BJP governance meant selling the PSUs. Unlike the previous governments that preferred disinvestment the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government simply wanted to sell public sector undertakings (PSUs). In fact, it had garnered Rs. 3.30 lakh crore selling PSUs. He alleged that the BJP had conveniently shifted its slogan of Skill India to Sale India. KTR said the TRS always worked along with PSUs strengthening them and reminded that the Singareni Collieries was brought into profits with the vision of the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. The BHEL was given orders worth Rs. 35,000 crore by the Telangana government while it also paid Rs. 1400 crore premium to the LIC of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ktr-backs-fight-against-vsp-privatisation/article34041000.ece

Yediyurappa to give ministerial berth to Balachandra Jarkiholi, the younger brother of Ramesh Jarkiholi who quit the Ministry following the CD scandal. Mr. Kumathalli told reporters that the party high command would take a final call on the issue. This development has led to speculation that it may take more time for Mr. Ramesh to come out of the mess created due to the scandal despite the complainant Dinesh Kallahalli withdrawing the police complaint. It is learnt that the party top leaders have assured him of giving back the ministerial post soon after legal hurdles are cleared. Sources in the BJP feel it would definitely take some time for Mr. Ramesh to clear the legal hurdles. However, the party is yet to think about alternatives like providing the post to somebody else from his family, said a senior leader. It is being said that though the party leaders are publicly defending Mr. Ramesh, several old-timers are not comfortable with his sudden rise as a kingmaker. Though his strategy of effecting defections benefited the BJP, insiders said it is a double-edged sword as there is a possibility of “reverse migration” too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/15-mlas-want-balachandra-in-ministry-kumathalli/article34040846.ece

11 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Thervoy Kandigai reservoir fills up||The fifth reservoir in Thervoy Kandigai Kannankottai, Tiruvallur district, which was inaugurated in November last year, is brimming with water as it reached its full capacity on Wednesday for the first time. The reservoir was created exclusively to store drinking water for Chennai’s needs. It was created 77 years after the Poondi reservoir was added as the city’s major water source in 1944. Officials of the Water Resources Department said the fifth reservoir had touched its full capacity of 500 million cubic feet and continues to receive a minimum of five cusecs (cubic feet per second) of Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh. It is now being used as a buffer source as other reservoirs, too, have adequate storage for water distribution. “Even before the inauguration, the waterbody in Thervoy Kandigai had storage due to rainwater inflow from catchment areas. While storage of about 200 mcft was built through floodwater runoff, Krishna water contributed to the remaining storage,” said an official. When the storage in Poondi reservoir dips, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewage Board (CMWSSB) will draw water from Thervoy Kandigai and convey it to the Kandaleru Poondi (KP) canal through a pipeline. Water from there will flow into Poondi reservoir. The State’s entry point of the KP canal in Uthukottai, Tiruvallur district, continued to receive a minimal amount (56 cusecs) of Krishna water. Some of it is being conveyed to Poondi reservoir. The confluence point of the canal and Poondi reservoir has now been secured with a compound wall to prevent the entry of cattle. “Since September last year, Chennai has received 7.5 tmcft of water, which is the highest quantum in recent years. We have not asked to increase the amount for the current spell as the city’s reservoirs have adequate water to meet drinking water needs this summer,” the official added. Moreover, work is in progress to repair the KP canal lining in vulnerable stretches for a distance of 8 km between Uthukottai and Poondi. The Rs. 24.78 crore project will take two months to be completed. The department plans to seek more Krishna water after the work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thervoy-kandigai-reservoir-fills-up/article34041088.ece
11 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Consider reasonable requests of voters on poll duty, HC tells ECI||Taking serious note of a complaint that many government officials on poll duty do not get to cast their postal votes properly due to paucity of time and other issues, the Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure that their reasonable request for exercising their franchise effectively was attended to as best as possible. The commission was also ordered to try and ensure that more than 90% of voters on poll duty get to vote through postal ballot. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the directions while disposing of a public interest litigation petition filed by Tamil Nadu High-Higher Secondary Graduate Teachers Association. Senior counsel R. Viduthalai, assisted by V. Arun, said many officials, deputed to constituencies other than the one in which they reside, do not vote because the postal papers were given to them only during the silence period (48 hours before the actual day of polling). Some poll officials find it difficult to get their postal votes attested by gazetted officers and so they end up submitting invalid votes without the attestation, he said. To correct such anomalies, which lead to wasting of several thousand of votes during every election, and to ensure that all officials get to vote properly, he insisted that the postal ballots should be given to them during the first training session itself. This way the voters on poll duty would have sufficient time to get them attested. Finding force in his submissions, the judges ordered that the reasonable request of the petitioner association must be accepted as far as possible. The Bench also said that people who devote their time and energy, without receiving adequate honorarium, and consider it their duty to help people vote should not be denied their own fundamental right in a democracy. The Chief Justice commended the poll officials for braving difficult circumstances to make polling possible in rural, hilly and tribal areas. Though the PIL petition was filed for letting all voters on poll duty, and not just those deputed within their constituencies, to vote through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in advance, the ECI counsel Niranajan Rajagopalan reported to the court that it would not be possible to let anyone to vote through EVMs before the actual day of polling because the law does not provide for it. It was after this submission, the petitioner’s counsel insisted on providing enough time to cast votes through postal ballot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consider-reasonable-requests-of-voters-on-poll-duty-hc-tells-eci/article34041177.ece
11 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘50 witnesses quizzed in case against ex-DGP’||The State government on Wednesday informed the Madras High Court that the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) had so far examined 50 witnesses and collected CCTV footage following a complaint lodged by a woman Superintendent of Police last month accusing the then Special Director-General of Police of having harassed her sexually. The complainant had charged another Superintendent of Police of having waylaid her when she was on the way to lodge a complaint. When a public interest litigation petition seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the issue was listed for admission before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, special senior counsel for the State government A.L. Somayaji said apart from the criminal investigation carried out by the CB-CID, an inquiry by the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) was also under way against the former special DGP with respect to the charge of sexual harassment at the workplace. The senior counsel said Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the High Court had taken suo motu cognisance of the issue and decided that the court would monitor the probe. The CB-CID had agreed to file periodical status reports before the court, he added. After hearing him, the Chief Justice said the issue of suo motu cognisance taken by the single judge of the court was brought to his notice on the administrative side and that he had ordered the listing of the case before an appropriate Bench. Therefore, he simply adjourned the present PIL petition filed by a former Additional Superintendent of Police by four weeks. In the meantime, advocate Abdul Saleem, representing the ex-Special DGP, complained to the court that several debates were being held tarnishing his image despite the single judge having passed a specific order restraining political parties from politicising the issue and the media from revealing the names of the accused, the complainant as well as witnesses involved in the case. He said Section 16 of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act of 2013 states that even the name of the accused should not be revealed. Hoping that the orders passed by the court would be complied with in letter and spirit by the people concerned, the judges said the case would now be heard after four weeks.

11 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Question of feasibility raised over DMK, AIADMK proposals||The DMK’s electoral promise of providing Rs. 1,000 a month and the AIADMK’s of giving Rs. 1,500 a month, along with six cooking gas cylinders, to housewives have raised the question of the feasibility of such proposals, considering the fiscal situation of Tamil Nadu. As the two parties have considered the size of the beneficiaries based on the approximately 2 crore rice-drawing ration cards in the State, the AIADMK’s dole would mean an expenditure of Rs. 46,000 crore a year and Rs. 24,000 crore a year for the DMK. (For the purpose of this calculation, the cost of a cooking gas [liquefied petroleum gas] cylinder has been taken as Rs. 825). More announcements The two principal parties, known for their competitive populism, are expected to come out with more announcements as the Assembly election draws closer. As the State government, in early February, came out with a waiver scheme for crop loans taken from cooperative institutions, further promises in this area may cover the loans taken from commercial banks. Assuming that around 30 lakh farmers have taken loans and if the ceiling is fixed at Rs. 1 lakh, the cost would be Rs. 30,000 crore. The DMK has already spoken about the waiver of educational loans, whose outstanding amount is estimated to be about Rs. 14,000 crore. Asked if the new proposals would replace the existing schemes and freebies, a key member of the AIADMK’s manifesto drafting committee said they would be in addition to what was already being provided by the government. When reminded of the Election Commission of India’s (EC) guidelines that manifestos should reflect the rationale behind such promises and broadly indicate the means to meet the financial requirements for it, he said resources would be found for the new schemes, just as they were being done for the current set of measures. The subsidy bill of the State government in 2019-20 was about Rs. 20,144 crore. It is bound to be much more this year due to the impact of the pandemic. An example of this is the few rounds of cash support that were provided along with essential commodities through the public distribution system (PDS) free of cost for three months. If one is to add the cost of the new proposals with that of the existing subsidy bill, the overall figure may touch a minimum of Rs. 88,000 crore and a maximum of Rs. 1.2 lakh crore, which would be 33% to 46% of the revenue expenditure. For the year 2021-22, as per the budget estimate, the revenue expenditure is around Rs. 2.6 lakh crore. If one adds salaries and pensions to that, the government would be left with little money for any development expenditure, veteran civil servants said. A perusal of the medium-term fiscal plan, tabled on the floor of the Assembly last month, did not reveal a rosy picture with regard to key fiscal parameters. As per the Budget estimates for 2020-21, interest payments alone are expected to be nearly one-fifth (19.67%) of the total revenue receipts against the ideal 12%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/question-of-feasibility-raised-over-proposals-by-dmk-and-aiadmk/article34041462.ece
11 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Hip replacement can last 15 years’||Over 1,200 doctors have been trained in effectively performing hip replacement surgeries in the past 10 years through the socket science course hosted by MIOT Hospital in partnership with DePuy Synthes, which is part of Johnson and Johnson Medical Devices. Addressing a conference organised to mark the completion of 10 years of the course here on Wednesday, Prithvi Mohandas, managing director of the hospital, said the key objective was to ensure that the hip replacements were done in such a way that the future surgeries for the same patients were not complicated. “With the latest procedures and technology available, a hip replacement can be made to last 15 years. If a person undergoes the first hip replacement at the age of 40, he or she may need another two replacements in their lifetime. If the first one is not done properly, the second and the third become difficult,” he said. Dr. Mohandas said that adopting best practices was important to ensure that the hip replacement lasted 15 years. “We particularly focus on the acetabulum, the socket of the hip bone, as we have observed that most of the hip replacements that end up requiring revisit in a shorter span were due to problems in the socket,” he said. He said that adopting the right approach was crucial with an increasing number of people needing hip replacements at a young age. He cited alcoholism or binge drinking as the important cause of bone death in the hip, which might require a hip replacement surgery. Sandeep Makkar, managing director, Johnson and Johnson Medical Devices, India, congratulated MIOT Hospital on its pursuit of perfection in hip replacement surgeries and helping medical practitioners from India and abroad to benefit from the socket science course.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hip-replacement-can-last-15-years/article34041084.ece

Acting on specific intelligence, the NCB seized 4.6 kg of charas from a parcel at Aramex India Pvt. Ltd., Ekkatuthangal, Chennai. The charas was concealed inside 22 soft toys in a carton box. An initial investigation revealed that it was sourced from West Bengal, and was being illegally transported to Qatar. N. Prasad of Kolkata was arrested at the airport there. Amit Ghawate, Zonal Director, NCB, said that charas, also known as hashish, is extracted from ganja plants. Some of the major ganja cultivating regions in India are in the hilly terrains of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and the northeast. Hashish is also extracted from ganja cultivated in these areas. Charas is the name given to a hashish form of cannabis handmade in India.

11 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||HC poser to Centre, varsity on admission to two biotech courses||Justice B. Pugalendhi of the Madras High Court on Wednesday expressed strong displeasure to the Centre and Anna University over repeated problems created in following the reservation policy for admissions to the M. Tech (Biotechnology) and M. Tech (Computational Biology) courses offered by the university but sponsored by the Department of Biotechnology under the Union Ministry of Science and Technology. When Advocate General Vijay Narayan, assisted by Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan, complained about reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) having been applied for admissions to the two courses this year in violation of the State government’s policy against implementing such quota, the judge asked the counsel for the Centre as well as Anna University: “Why are you creating such confusions?” The A-G told the court that Anna University had initially decided to not offer the two courses at all during the academic year 2020-21 because the State government wanted it to follow its 69% reservation policy in admissions while the Centre insisted on following its 49.5% reservation policy. When the issue was brought to the notice of the court, the university was ordered to make admissions as per the Centre’s policy because the courses were sponsored by it. However, after the order was passed on February 19, the EWS quota was implemented in admission to the courses though the State Cabinet had taken a decision that it would not be implementing the quota in State government jobs and institutions. State-run institution Anna University was an institution run by the State government and it could not be allowed to reserve seats under the EWS quota in the two courses, he said. The A-G also pointed out that a common prospectus issued for the two courses itself had stated that the EWS quota would be implemented depending upon the policy of each participating university. Concurring with him, the judge said: “Anna University cannot take a stand against State government policy.” He directed the university counsel to take instructions and explain by Friday the reason behind implementation of the EWS quota this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-poser-to-centre-varsity-on-admission-to-two-biotech-courses/article34041587.ece

11 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK writes to ECI seeking use of new EVMs||The DMK on Wednesday wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, and other election commission officials seeking the use of recently manufactured EVMs for the upcoming Assembly poll on April 6. It also sought provision of CCTV live coverage or live web streaming during voting in all polling booths, installation of jammers in the strong rooms and counting centres where the EVMs will be stored and also counting of at least 50% of VVPATs simultaneously.  In a representation to the Election Commission, DMK propaganda secretary Tiruchi Siva said the life span of EVMs is only 15 years as per information in the public domain. The EVMs manufactured by BEL and ECIL have been in use since 2001 in all the elections across the country. Mr. Siva said there is a fear of tampering these EVMs and manipulation of recorded data by hacking with latest technology. He said western countries and those with advanced technology do not prefer electronic voting and use only ballot paper. “In order to dispel the fear from the minds of the people and to infuse confidence among the electorate, it is requested to utililse the EVMs which were manufactured recently which would possess latest technical and security updates and therefore would be less susceptible to hackers, or attacks of any kind of malfunctioning,” he said. The party also sought counting of 50% of VVPATs simultaneously along with the EVMs in order to have a fool-proof method of declaration of results. This will instill confidence among the people about the genuineness in the recording of votes, he said. Also, every table in the counting centre should have CCTV coverage instead of one for many tables, high-powered signal jammers must be provided in polling stations, strong rooms and counting centres, the DMK said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-writes-to-eci-seeking-use-of-new-evms/article34041178.ece

Commodore Ashok Rai, Commanding Officer of INS Agrani, Air Commodore Rajnish Verma Commandant of Air Force Administrative College (AFAC) and Colonel Piyush S. Katal, Station Commander, Station Headquarters, Coimbatore, received the victory flame which reached PSG Institute of Medical Science and Research (PSG IMSR) after two days of tour to the Madras Regimental Centre, Wellington. Lauding the sacrifices made by the armed forces personnel in protecting the sovereignty and integrity of the country, Commodore Rai pointed out that when a nation goes to war, it is not just the armed forces that goes to war. “It is the whole nation that goes to war. Each and every citizen is directly or indirectly involved in the war,” said Commodore Rai. “For a nation to de facto be considered a great nation, it needs to have more than just material strength. It needs to develop those intangibles such as national character. This can happen only with true education, ethics and value systems,” he added. Veterans who took part in the war namely Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Natarajan and Brigadier Mahadevan shared their experiences while Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian spoke about the significance of the epic war. Commodore Rai, Air Commodore Verma and Colonel Katal honoured 71 war veterans from Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Erode, Tirupur and parts of Kerala.

11 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||War of words between DMK, civic body over ornamental light burst||On March 8 an ornamental light that the Coimbatore Corporation was installing on the walkers’ path in Race Course exploded. Glass shards from the light reportedly fell on four migrant workers injuring them. The explosion on Monday night found its echo on the political space, what with the Assembly election round the corner. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Coimbatore east unit in-charge and MLA N. Karthik rushed to the spot. After inspecting the spot, he alleged that the explosion had vindicated his complaint that the corporation had used substandard materials in Smart Cities Mission projects, be it in tanks or model road projects. The Rs. 40.70 crore project to beautify the Race Course walkers’ path was a waste on tax payers’ money as it was a place that did not warrant any development. The Corporation officials also rushed to the spot, following information that a light had exploded and workers were injured. A press release quoting the Corporation Smart City Ltd. officials denied any explosion. Around 10 p.m., a tower light slipped from a worker’s hands while unloading from a vehicle and fell on the ground. The worker suffered minor injuries. The release also said the type of tower light that the corporation had chosen was not explosive in nature and that the contractor executing the project had already installed 26 such lights. It was wrong to say that the light exploded. It was nothing short of a canard, the press release added. Sources said that with election round the corner, neither the DMK nor the ruling party did not want to miss an opportunity to make an issue out of anything and the light explosion came in handy. And, the corporation reacted the way it did was because the contractor executing the project was reportedly close to the powers that be, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/war-of-words-between-dmk-civic-body-over-ornamental-light-burst/article34041172.ece
11 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK workers stage protest||Based on inside information that the AIADMK had allotted the the Coimbatore South Assembly constituency to the BJP and that the party’s national women’s wing president Vanathi Srinivasan had planned to contest there, AIADMK supporters gathered in front of the party office on Huzur Road on Wednesday opposing the move. Led by zonal secretaries from Ukkadam, Ramanathapuram, Gandhipuram, Sungam and a couple of other areas, the cadre said they were opposed to the move to handover the constituency to the BJP. Threatening to resign en masse if the AIADMK leadership did not pay heed to their sentiments, the party cadre said they could not have had a better MLA than incumbent Amman K. Arjunan, who not only had nurtured the constituency but also taken along party cadre in the area. That Mr. Arjunan was the AIADMK’s Coimbatore urban south district secretary and a district secretary’s seat should not be handed over to an ally also figured in their arguments. AIADMK sources said while it was true that the party leaders and cadre in zones and wards coming under the Coimbatore South Assembly constituency were upset about the allocation of the seat to the BJP it could not be ruled out that Mr. Arjunan could have asked his supporters to protest to prevail upon the party leadership. They also said that with the cadre expressing resentment against such an allocation, it remained to be seen if they would put their heart and soul into the electioneering, if the AIADMK were to allocate the seat to the BJP. Sources in the BJP said the party was closely watching the developments. Incidentally, in the 2016 Assembly election, Ms. Srinivasan contested against Mr. Arjunan and was placed third after Tamil Nadu Congress Committee working president Mayura S.

11 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Tiruppur garment industry to go on one-day strike on March 15||The Tiruppur garment industry will shut operations for a day on March 15 protesting against the steep hike in yarn prices. Raja M. Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters' Association, told The Hindu on Wednesday that this was decided at a meeting held with trade unions and industry associations. Manufacturers, job workers, workers, and trade will take part in the strike, he said. According to Mr. Shanmugham, the daily garment business in Tiruppur is worth Rs. 200 crore. The knitwear industry consumes nearly 22 lakh kg of yarn a day. It is worth almost Rs. 55 crore, he said. Just 10 % of the garment units in Tiruppur have integrated facilities. The rest are all Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs). These units are suffering because of not only hike in yarn prices but also erratic supply of yarn. "This threatens to bring the industry to a standstill. If the exporters lose customers, it is difficult to revive," he said. The industry has appealed to the Central government to ban yarn exports. The strike is to highlight the demand. The government should limit yarn exports and ensure that the domestic buyers get adequate supply, he said. The knitwear sector in Tiruppur has pointed out that yarn prices are increased frequently and availability has become an issue for the last four months or so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruppur-garment-industry-to-go-on-one-day-strike-on-march-15/article34041163.ece

11 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC calls for well-stocked libraries in schools||Stressing the importance of inculcating the reading habit in students, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has urged the State to take systematic and concrete efforts to bring back the lost glory by providing a well-stocked library in all schools. Students must be provided time to access the libraries under the guidance of efficient librarians so that they not only enrich their knowledge but also develop the reading habit, which is sine qua non to development of any society, the court said. A class period that was earmarked for ‘library’ every week in schools a decade ago had become extinct now. The very purpose of the period was to promote the reading habit among the children, Justice M. Dhandapani pointed out. In order to meet the requirement, there existed a necessity to have a full-fledged library in all schools manned by a librarian. Unfortunately, the concept of library period had been erased out of the time table and instead all classes were devoted to curriculum-based subjects. Students of those days would throng the library for the purpose of reading novels and other books of interest to them, which helped in developing their reading habit. However, giving a go by to the said procedure by deeming the period a waste of time, the schools had now embarked on provisioning students only with curricular periods. Thereby, the reading habit among the students stood totally wiped out, the judge said. Present-day students leaned more towards digital equipment for all their needs unmindful of repercussions. If the children were not inculcated with the habit of reading today, then not only the glory of reading books would be wiped out, but the next generation would be totally alien to the idea of reading book. A good library could develop a good citizen and a good environment. The judge said the court hoped and trusted that the suggestions would be taken in letter and in spirit by the government so that the library movement not only received an impetus but was taken to the next level and the concept of library, as was existing, was restored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-calls-for-well-stocked-libraries-in-schools/article34041468.ece

11 March 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 causing kidney damage in patients with comorbidities: doctors||Overcoming reservations about Covid-19 vaccine is important as the viral infection results in kidney damage in 7% to 15% of patients, said a panel of doctors at Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre here on Wednesday. Marking World Kidney Day, which falls on March 11, the doctors told reporters that CKD (chronic kidney disease) was emerging as a major public health problem in the country. K. Sampathkumar,  Senior Consultant & HOD - Nephrology, said kidney failure was a silent killer and when the damages were severe, they could not be cured. Hence, it was important to undergo regular check-ups and control food and lifestyle to delay or halt the progress of kidney diseases. The diagnosis could be done by urine protein, blood urea and creatinine tests. He said people with diabetes and hypertension must check kidney health as about 30% of them were most likely to develop kidney disease in the long run. He suggested that people take the vaccine dosage at the earliest, especially those who above 45 years with comorbidities. Preventive measures were simple lifestyle modifications, which also included stress management and good sleep. Talking about prevalence of kidney stones, R. Ravichandran,  Senior Consultant & HOD - Urology, said kidney stones had become a common lifestyle disease. In India, 12% of the population was estimated to develop urinary stones in their lifetime out of whom about 50% might end up with some form of kidney failure. Explaining what a kidney stone was and its treatment, he said too much waste in too little urine could result in formation of kidney stones. The stones could affect any part of the urinary tract, from kidney to bladder. To prevent formation of kidney stones, one must avoid high-salt diet, excessive intake of caffeine, sugary and aerated drinks, chocolates and nuts and animal protein. Drinking plenty of water, and eating fruits and vegetables were important. Kidney stones could be detected with urine test, blood test, X-ray and/or CT scan. The treatment could include drinking plenty of water to pass a kidney stone. But depending on the criticality of the situation, one might need to undergo surgery. Andrew Deepak Rajiv, Consultant-Nephrology, said the success rate of surgical and nonsurgical treatments of many kidney diseases, including transplantation, had increased to over 90%. Donors had a slightly higher risk of developing blood pressure, but the emotional satisfaction that came from saving a life was incomparable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-causing-kidney-damage-in-patients-with-comorbidities-doctors/article34041465.ece

11 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||A keen fight on the cards in Union Territory||Even for a place known for the unpredictable nature of its politics, the run-up to the April 6 Assembly election in Puducherry has already produced a fair share of fast-paced twists and turns — from the removal of a Lt. Governor, a series of defections, the collapse of the Congress-DMK government in a failed trust vote and the imposition of President’s rule. As they seek out the middle ground over the allocation of seats, both the Congress-DMK-Left front and the rival AINRC-BJP-AIADMK alliance are facing different sets of problems, some on the surface and the others simmering. Following the defection of several of its influential leaders, the Congress finds itself with fewer bargaining chips than it usually wields in one of its last bastions as it pursues seat-sharing discussions with its ally DMK. The BJP’s refusal to declare a chief ministerial candidate at this stage has rankled the AINRC, which sees party founder N. Rangasamy as the natural choice. According to sources, the Congress is facing a demand for a 50:50 seat-sharing formula from the DMK, while having to accommodate requests for seats from the other allies: the CPI(M), the CPI and the VCK. After a couple of preliminary rounds held in Puducherry, the talks have moved to Chennai, and a final formula is expected to be reached soon. In the 2016 election, the Congress contested in 21 seats and won 15, while the DMK bagged two of the nine seats it contested in. “We are optimistic that the urgency of defeating the BJP will override whatever differences there are in the sharing of seats,” said a leader in the Congress-led Secular Progressive Democratic Alliance. “The importance of this election cannot be overstated. This is a fight for retaining the identity of Puducherry,” he said. Meanwhile, after much dilly-dallying, Mr. Rangasamy, a former Chief Minister, put a lid on speculation that the AINRC would go it alone, by taking part in a joint press conference on Tuesday with BJP and AIADMK leaders, where it was announced that he would indeed head the NDA. Significantly, the agreement was formalised a couple of days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah called up Mr. Rangasamy. Nirmal Kumar Surana, BJP in-charge of the Union Territory, said an agreement had been reached and under it, the AINRC would contest in 16 seats and the remaining 14 would be shared by the BJP and the AIADMK. No seat-sharing talks were held with the other ally, PMK, at this point, it was disclosed. However, a key element missing from the agreement was the NDA’s chief ministerial candidate. On this, Mr. Surana would only say it was something to be decided after the results. “The alliance will be led by Mr. Rangasamy. We will face the election together and the post of Chief Minister will be decided later,” he said. In large part, the BJP’s reluctance to commit itself to a chief ministerial candidate could be to avoid ruffling the feathers of A. Namassivayam, second-in-command in the V. Narayanasamy government, who left the Congress to join the BJP in January. In fact, Mr. Namassivayam had been tipped as a contender for the post even in 2016, but the Congress leadership chose Mr. Narayanasamy. Within hours of the NDA agreement, the issue of the chief ministerial candidature was stoked again. An emergency meeting of the AINRC executive committee declared Mr. Rangasamy the candidate for Chief Minister if the NDA came to power. “The NDA’s decision to appoint Mr. Rangasamy as the head of the alliance has paved the way for his occupying the post of Chief Minister for the fourth time,” said a resolution adopted at the meeting.  Following the defection of several of its influential leaders, the Congress finds itself with fewer bargaining chips||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-keen-fight-on-the-cards-in-union-territory/article34041235.ece

Senthil Raj on Wednesday handed over Tamil Nadu Government’s ex-gratia of Rs. 50 lakh to the family of Eral Police Station Sub-Inspector V. Balu, 55, who was allegedly murdered by a two-wheeler mechanic on January 31 midnight with a cargo autorickshaw. When R. Murugavel of Vaazhavallaan, under the influence of alcohol, was creating ruckus in Eral Bazaar on January 31 evening with a cargo autorickshaw, Balu and other policemen, who were patrolling there, asked him to go home. As the drunkard started abusing the policemen also, the police team took him to the police station along with the vehicle. After seizing the cargo autorickshaw, Balu asked him to come to the police station the next morning to get back the cargo autorickshaw. Agitated over this, Murugavel, who returned home, took another cargo autorickshaw and mowed down Balu and constable Pon Subbiah even as they were on their night patrolling on a two-wheeler. While Balu was killed on the spot, Mr. Pon Subbiah sustained grievous injuries. As Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced the compensation of Rs. 50 lakh to the family of Balu and Rs. 2 lakh to Mr. Pon Subbiah, Dr. Senthil Raj handed over the relief to the families in the presence of Superintendent of Police S.

11 March 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Tension at Anbil following stone pelting||Tension prevailed at Anbil village in the district on Wednesday after a group allegedly pelted stones at another while they were taking out a procession of a deity of Goddess Amman to the Sri Aachira Valliamman temple from a nearby Siva temple for a festival leading to police intervention. A few police personnel and the group that was carrying the goddess sustained injuries in the stone pelting. As a sequel to the incident, the Collector promulgated prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with pickets having been deployed at the village and its vicinity to prevent further outbreak of any untoward incident. Police sources said the temple festival at Arulmigu Achirama Valli Amman Temple which used to be celebrated by people of different villages including Keezha Anbil and Mela Anbil during the Tamil month Maasi every year was not conducted for nearly 25 years following a dispute that arose after one group demanded that the deity procession be taken through their streets. However, an order was issued by the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court last year for conducting the festival based on an appeal with certain directions. The sources said HR&CE department officials held talks with both communities this year. On Tuesday night, problem arose over the procession route following which Revenue authorities held talks with both groups. Police said around 20 persons of a one group were detained and brought to the station for inquiry. Further investigation is on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tension-at-anbil-following-stone-pelting/article34041225.ece

11 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||BJP gets Tirunelveli ticket||After prolonged lobbying by leaders of both the AIADMK, heading the National Democratic Alliance in Tamil Nadu Assembly polls and its electoral ally, the BJP, the Tirunelveli constituency has been allotted to the national party in a bid to field former minister and BJP’s state vice-president Nainar Nagenthran. Interestingly, Mr. Nagenthran had been elected to the Assembly as AIADMK candidate on two occasions – 2001 and 2011 – when he defeated the DMK candidates. Even before the seats are shared between the AIADMK and the BJP, Mr. Nagenthran started electioneering in Tirunelveli constituency with bike rallies and visiting villages to meet community leaders which triggered murmur in the AIADMK camp which was hoping to field their candidate Thatchai N. Ganesa Raja, party’s Tirunelveli district secretary. The murmur reflected in the form of posters pasted across walls in the constituency seeking votes for ‘Two Leaves,’ symbol of the ruling party. “Mr. Nagenthran, after being fielded in Tirunelveli constituency on four occasions – 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 – as AIADMK candidate, has snatched away this segment even after he switched over to the BJP. After he left for the BJP, we were hoping to field a new face in Tirunelveli, but our hopes have been dashed in an authoritarian manner. This will certainly reflect in the election results,” said a senior AIADMK office-bearer here hinting that there would be no cohesiveness among the cadre of both parties. In a bid to console Mr. Ganesa Raja, he has been fielded in Nanguneri constituency where sitting MLA Reddiyarpatti V. Narayanan has been denied ticket. In Palayamkottai, a DMK stronghold with sizeable minority votes, K.J.C. Gerald, Tirunelveli district secretary of Jayalalithaa Forum, has been fielded. Sitting MLA R. Murugaia Pandian has been denied ticket in Ambasamudram constituency where the AIADMK has reposed its faith in former Minister Esakki Subbiah, who is quite popular in this segment. When he was fielded in 2011, Mr. Subbiah comfortably defeated former Speaker R. Avudaiyappan of the DMK. Though he managed to get ministerial berth headed by Jayalalithaa and became the Minister for Law, she removed him from the cabinet within two months. Sitting MLA of Radhapuram I.S. Inbadurai, whose electoral fortune is still hanging in balance following the recounting of votes ordered by the Madras High Court, has been fielded again. In Tenkasi, sitting MLAs S. Selva Mohandas Pandian of Tenkasi, A. Manoharan of Vasudevanallur (Reserved) and Minister for Adi Dravida Welfare V.M. Rajalakshmi have been fielded again in their segments while Kadayanallur has been allotted to S. Krishna Murali, son of late AIADMK minister Senthur Pandian. Former Rajya Sabha MP P.H. Manoj Pandian, son for late Speaker P.H. Pandian, has been fielded in Alangulam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-gets-tirunelveli-ticket/article34041646.ece

11 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Youth arrested for cheating girl||The police have arrested a youth who had allegedly cheated his Facebook friend. They said a college girl from a village under Kallidaikurichi police station limits was in touch with Sankaralingam from Tenkasi, who is working abroad, over the phone. When Sankaralingam reportedly asked the girl to book air tickets for him to come to his native place, she sought the help of his Facebook friend Rangarajan, 29, of Vallanaadu in Thoothukudi district. As Rangarajan suggested her to pledge her gold ornaments for booking the tickets, she gave him 60.50 grams of ornaments to be pledged in the pawn shop. However, Rangarajan sold the gold ornaments and did not give the money to the girl. When she repeatedly asked Rangarajan to return the gold ornaments, he threatened to post her obscene photos on the social media. After the girl filed a complaint with Kallidaikurichi police, Rangarajan was arrested on Tuesday evening and remanded in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/youth-arrested-for-cheating-girl/article34041242.ece
11 March 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Delays in smart city works top Vellore’s woes||Though Vellore bagged the sixth place among cities with a population of less than a million in the Ease of Living Index, its residents feel there is still a long way to go. Delays in the completion of smart city works, dug-up roads and the mosquito menace are their main grievances. The Vellore Assembly constituency, with over 2.5 lakh voters, has traditionally been a stronghold of the DMK. The party’s candidate, P. Karthikeyan, won the 2016 election by a margin of 26,411 votes over Harun Rasheed of the AIADMK. The election to the Vellore Parliamentary constituency in 2019 was rescinded amid reports that money power was being used to influence voters. Hence, the Election Commission of India has ordered that strict vigil should be maintained in the constituencies of the district to ensure an inducement-free poll next month. “Vellore’s votes are not decided communally. The DMK traditionally has an edge in this constituency, and there are a lot of unorganised workers, including beedi sellers and autorickshaw drivers, who may vote for the DMK in view of its alliance with the Communist parties,” said S. Dayanidhi, district secretary, CPI(M). Mr. Dayanidhi said delays in the execution of smart city projects would be a major drawback for the AIADMK this time. “Nothing is happening on the ground. It’s not clear whether a committee was formed to review the works. Roads are dug up everywhere,” he said. “Smart city works have been under way for many years now. The roads in several parts of the constituency have been dug up as part of smart city and underground sewage projects. Though the work has been completed in some places, the roads have not been relaid,” said M. Baradeswaran, a member of the Maruti Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association. Traffic problems Traffic woes worsened as a result, he said. “This can be felt at Green Signal, Anna Salai and Velappadi. We need a solution. Only now, they are laying pavements in the locality, as a result of which pedestrians don’t even have space to walk. There are also encroachments,” he added. The residents are also angry about the difficulties in accessing public transport. A new bus stand is being constructed under the smart city project. “Buses to Chennai and Kancheepuram halt at the new bus stand, while those bound for Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Bengaluru stop at the old bus stand. Buses to Andhra Pradesh, Cuddalore and Villupuram stop at Makkan signal. So, we have to go to different places to board buses to different destinations. The new bus stand has to be constructed soon,” Mr. Baradeswaran said. R. Ponnarasi, secretary, Mount View Apartments Residents’ Welfare Association, said that though the Municipal Corporation was doing a good job, the authorities should desilt the waterbodies for effective water management. “There are lakes like Sadupu Eri, Kazhinjur lake, Otteri and others. Had they been desilted, a lot of water could have been saved,” she said. Mr. Baradeswaran suggested that after desilting the waterbodies, the Corporation could build a walkers’ park around them. “It will be very helpful. Besides, there were plans to improve the moat around the Vellore fort and introduce boating. But nothing has happened in that regard,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delays-in-smart-city-works-top-vellores-woes/article34041097.ece
11 March 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||NEP has a holistic vision, it serves societal needs: Kovind||The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has a holistic vision of transforming the way children and youth will be educated to make learning a part of personal development while also serving the needs of society, said President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday. Delivering the 16th annual convocation address at Thiruvalluvar University in Vellore, he hailed the NEP. “India had a rich system of education prior to the British rule. Gandhiji described it as a ‘beautiful tree’ that was cut down by what the British rulers called reforms. We are yet to fully recover from those drastic changes and recover our legacy. The NEP is a well-planned and decisive step in that direction,” he said. Mr. Kovind said it brings together the best of India’s ancient heritage and the best of modern learning. “A student coming out of such a system will have a higher degree of self-confidence and will also be better equipped to meet the challenges of the future,” he said. 65% women students The President expressed happiness over the fact that 65% of the students in the university were women. “Our daughters and sisters are breaking barriers and achieving success in all fields. This is clear from the fact that today out of 66 students conferred with gold medals for academic excellence, 55 are women students,” he said. He started his speech in Tamil and later said that he felt proud to stand on the soil that witnessed the Vellore Sepoy uprising of 1806, which was one of the precursors to the Independence movement. The President also had advice for the students. “What we learn from books is learning, while what we learn from life is wisdom,” he added. Of a total 80,176 students who graduated, 283 received their degrees in person. Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit and Thiruvalluvar University Vice- Chancellor Thamarai Selvi Somasundaram were present on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nep-has-holistic-vision-it-serves-societal-needs/article34041113.ece

11 March 2021||VILLUPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Villupuram Collector expresses concern over laxity of police||District Election Officer-cum-Collector A. Annadurai has expressed serious concern over the lax attitude of police personnel manning checkposts near the inter-State border with the Union Territory of Puducherry. Addressing a review meeting on the security arrangements being made in the district for the upcoming Assembly poll, he said on Tuesday that surveillance at the checkposts, located near the inter-State border with Puducherry, should be enhanced in the wake of smuggling of liquor and arrack from the Union Territory. Mr. Annadurai said that his recent visit to a checkpost at Gengarampalayam brought to the fore poor surveillance on the part of the police personnel deployed there. There was no checking of vehicles and the police personnel remained seated in their chairs. “I will continue my visits and if I come across any laxity on the part of the personnel, I will take a photo and forward it to the Superintendent of Police,” he said, warning that stringent action, including suspension, would be taken against the personnel. The Collector also directed officials to ensure removal of poll graffiti in public places and also file FIRs against the parties concerned. All the instructions of the Election Commission of India (ECI) should be strictly followed by the officials designated for poll duty, he said. Additional Collector Shreya P. Singh was present at the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/villupuram-collector-expresses-concern-over-laxity-of-police/article34041580.ece

Addressing an all-party meeting, District Returning Officer and Collector R. Kannan said that even if the star campaigner names the candidate during the campaign, the expenses of meeting, lighting, vehicles and food incurred by the star campaigner would be included in the poll expenses of the party /alliance candidate of the respective constituency. “In previous elections, the expenses of the star campaigners were not accounted in the expenses of the candidates but that of the political party,” he added. Representatives of some political parties complained that the price and tariff of various goods and services were fixed at a higher rate. They said that the rates were applicable for metropolitan cities like Chennai whereas the rates were very less in Virudhunagar district. The rates were fixed by the Election Commission of India as an average rate of the State. While no wall writing is allowed in urban areas, in rural areas, the candidates and political parties can use private buildings for graffiti after obtaining permission from owners in writing. No party flag, symbol and poster is allowed for public display in the election office or the political parties/candidate.

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK introduces new faces||Even as Minister for Dairy Development, K.T. Rajendra Bhalaji has shifted from Sivakasi Assembly constituency to Rajapalayam Assembly seat, AIADMK has denied tickets to two sitting MLAs, M.S.R. Rajavarman (Sattur) and M. Chandraprabha (Srivilliputtur – Reserved). It has allotted Virudhunagar Assembly constituency and Tiruchuli Assembly constituency (both held by DMK) to its allies BJP and All India Muvendar Munnani Kazhagam. The party has introduced three new faces in the Assembly election. Lakshmi Ganesan, former Tiruthangal municipal chairperson and a close confidante of Minister, has been given a party seat to contest from Sivakasi Assembly constituency, from where Mr. Bhalaji, who is also Virudhunagar west district secretary, has won two consecutive elections. Another district secretary, R.K. Ravichandran (Virudhunagar east district), has been given Sattur Assembly seat in place of Mr. Rajavarman, who fell apart from Mr. Bhalaji. Mr. Ravichandran is younger brother of former Assembly Speaker, K. Kalimuthu. Meanwhile, former Minister and MLA S. Vaigaiselvan has got the party ticket to contest from Aruppukottai Assembly seat for the third consecutive election. After winning the seat in 2011 by defeating DMK leader, K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran lost to him in the next election in 2016. Both the candidates will be locking horns for the third time. Mr. Rajavarman, who had won from Sattur Assembly constituency during by-election, has blamed Mr. Bhalaji for not getting a ticket. “I refused to be his slave and he has refused me the ticket,” he said. Stating that he had won the people’s confidence in his constituency, Mr. Rajavarman, said “my services during the COVID-19 pandemic will speak for me,” he said. The MLA said that Mr. Bhalaji, being the MLA and Minister for two terms, is shunning Sivakasi constituency and he has earned bad name with his anti-people activities. “He even handed out a threat to my life,” Mr. Rajavarman said. Manraj, husband of Virudhunagar district panchayat Chairperson Vasanthi has been given party ticket to contest from Srivilliputtur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-introduces-new-faces/article34041246.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||3 Ministers, 44 AIADMK MLAs denied ticket||The identification of constituencies for the allies and the selection of the ruling party’s candidates followed discussions held by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who are the party’s co-coordinator and co-ordinator respectively, with their party colleagues in the last four-five days, apart from their meetings with BJP and PMK leaders on Tuesday night and in the early hours of Wednesday. With the release of the second list, the AIADMK has so far identified 177 candidates, including the six in the first list. Forty-eight seats had been distributed to other parties, including the five smaller parties, which would contest on the AIADMK’s symbol. There are 9 more seats to be allotted to the constituents of the alliance. Among the high-profile contestants are the party’s deputy coordinators, K. P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam, now Members of the Rajya Sabha. Both lost in the 2016 Assembly election. They will contest from Veppannahalli and Orathanadu. Ministers K.A. Sengottaiyan, K. Pandiarajan, O.S.

By renominating former police officer and Chairperson of the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission R. Natraj from Mylapore, the AIADMK ensured that the seat remained with it, given reports that the BJP was keen on it. In the 2001 Assembly election, the BJP, then an ally of the DMK, won from Mylapore. Of the 23 constituencies given to the PMK and 20 to the BJP, the ruling party parted with 11 constituencies held by its members. Among the party veterans who were left out are S. Semmalai (Mettur) and S.T.K. Jakkaiyan (Cumbum). While Mettur was allotted to the PMK, Cumbum went to the ruling party’s Theni district unit secretary and former Member of Parliament S.P.M.

Thaniyarasu, who were elected on the AIADMK symbol, are no longer with the party. Their constituencies — Thiruvadanai, Nagapattinam and Kangeyam — have been given to the AIADMK’s core nominees. Former Minister Thoppu N.D. Venkatachalam of Perundurai, E. Rathinasabapathy of Aranthangi, and A. Prabhu of Kallakurichi, who were seen as dissidents a few years ago, did not figure in the list.

11 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice on plea on breach of privacy by media outlets||The High Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notices to the Centre and State government, and 70 different media platforms on a petition seeking direction to authorities to take steps to safeguard the right to privacy of individuals, and ensure that media outlets don’t invade the privacy of individuals by breaching prohibitions imposed in law. The court, in an interim order, directed that any broadcast in the media, governed by Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, should be strictly in conformity with the terms of “Programme Code” defined under this Act. Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar passed the interim order on the petition filed by Atma V. Hiremath, a 33-year-old advocate and member of BJP. The media platforms include newspapers, TV channels, online news portals, news agencies, social networking and micro-blogging service providers like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Citing instances of video clips purportedly showing Ramesh Jarkiholi, MLA, getting intimate with an unidentified woman flooding media, the petitioner claimed that “he feared that media platforms may, in fact, get hold of some of his private moments and may air them with total disregard to his right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.” The reason for the petitioner’s apprehension was the media reports about social activist Dinesh Kallahalli’s claim that he has many other CDs containing “explicit contents of other persons belonging to the BJP.” The petitioner sought a direction to the authorities to prohibit and restrain 70 media platforms publishing, circulating, disseminating any content either visual or in any other form, which is in violation of right to privacy enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, and in violation of the provisions of CTN (Regulation) Act. “The petitioner apprehends that if the media platforms are not restrained and directed to strictly adhered to statutory provisions regulating them, the petitioner’s right to live with dignity may get trampled like that of other leaders belonging to his political party,” it was contended in the petition. Citing provisions of the CTN (Regulation) Act, the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986, the petitioner alleged that media platforms had been on a daily basis showing certain visuals wherein a women was being represented in an indecent way. The statutory authorities, the petitioner alleged, have miserably failed to take any action either to restrain media platforms from exhibiting indecent visuals containing women or prosecuting them under appropriate law. “With private lives of the citizens being splattered over the media be it through social networking sites or spy cameras, protection is needed so that citizens can function in a way they want to and not think of others before their actions,” the petitioner said, while pointing out that what would be legal may be immoral, and what is moral to one may be immoral to the other.  The media platforms include newspapers, TV channels, online news portals, news agencies, social networking and micro-blogging service providers like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-on-plea-on-breach-of-privacy-by-media-outlets/article34041037.ece
11 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State targets 20 GW of clean energy||Karnataka aims to add 20 GW of renewable energy (RE) projects with or without energy storage systems, including 2 GW of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) projects, according to the Draft Karnataka Renewable Energy Policy 2021-26 which has been opened for objections. According to the document published by the Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd. (KREDL), the State is also looking at exporting energy outside Karnataka. The State, the policy document says, is one of the leaders in the country in RE, with a lot of potential, including solar, wind, solar-wind hybrid, biomass, waste to energy and small hydro projects. “Karnataka has about 86,792 MW of estimated RE potential, making it one of the country’s top five renewable rich States. Karnataka is the first southern State in India to notify the Karnataka Renewable Energy Policy 2009-14 in 2009. The policy initiatives have enabled the State to achieve capacity addition of 2,014 MW during the five-year policy period,” it added. Further, with the Karnataka Solar Policy 2014-21 targetting development of 6,000 MW solar capacity by 2021, the State has surpassed the target with a solar installed capacity of 7,366 MW as on December 2020, it said. “As RE becomes cheaper generation source for electricity in India (especially solar and wind energy), efforts are being made to initiate gradual replacement of existing conventional power generation capacities with renewable power generation capacities. “The key advantage of conventional power generation is high Plant Load Factor (PLF), firmness and flexibility in power supply. “In order to have same attractiveness, RE sources shall have these three attributes and the Karnataka Renewable Energy Policy 2021-2026,” the draft policy says, explaining that RE projects such as solar-wind hybrid with energy storage could be promoted. The focus of Karnataka Renewable Energy Policy 2021-2026 is to advance the RE market development in the State and facilitate the Central government efforts in meeting the RE target of 175 GW by 2022, it added. Senior KREDL officials told The Hindu that the objection period is under process, after which the policy will be submitted to the government for final approval. “The five-year plan has given emphasis on all renewable energies such as solar, solar-wind hybrid and battery charging, among others, apart from adding additional capacity of 20 GW. As Karnataka now has surplus power and demand has been met, we are in a position to export power to other States who have deficit. We will be able to do this through central government’s transmission network,” an official said. Green energy corridor The policy aims to develop Green Energy Corridor (GEC) for evacuation of large-scale renewable energy projects. “Karnataka has the highest installed capacity of renewable energy i.e. about 15,037 MW (as on December 2020) in the country. To attract more RE investments in the State, Karnataka is strengthening its transmission infrastructures,” it said, adding that the State is home to one of the world’s largest solar parks at Pavagada with a capacity of 2,050 MW, and having hosted private solar farms, Karnataka will now look at the development of wind park/wind solar hybrid park identified by the MNRE at Chitradurga, Davangere and Ballari, as well as Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks. With renewable penetration of about 50% in terms of capacity (as on December 2020) and about 30% in terms of energy (as on March 2020), the policy has also mentioned the need for energy storage system for incorporating further RE projects into the grid.  Karnataka has the highest installed capacity of renewable energy (15,037 MW).

11 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||AAI officials to visit Raichur to inspect site for airport||Officials of the Airport Authority of India (AAI) will visit Raichur this month to inspect the site for the proposed airport, the State government on Wednesday informed the Legislative Assembly. In a reply to a query by Basanagouda Daddal of the Congress during Question Hour, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, who replied in the absence of Infrastructure Minister Anand Singh, said 400 acres had been earmarked to develop the airport. A sum of Rs. 62 crore had been set aside. However, work would commence only after clearance from AAI officials, Mr. Kumar said. It was proposed to develop the airport to land 20-passenger capacity aircraft. The proposed airport will be located at Yeramarus in the district. However, the project has been facing problems owing to chimneys of the Yeramarus power plant and high voltage electricity lines passing through the region, the Minister said, in his reply. Mr. Daddal said Raichur had been denied the Indian Institute of Technology and other industrial units due to the absence of an airport. Recalling history, Mr. Daddal said an aircraft carrying former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had made an emergency landing in Raichur in 1957. Priyank Kharge, recalling the procedures involved in construction of the airport in Kalaburagi, said after the AAI officials’ visit, DGCA officials would visit the site. It would take at least two years to get all clearances for taking up construction, he said. Mr. Kharge, however, opposed the release of funds to the proposed airport out of the Kalyana Karnataka Development Board, which was facing shortage of funds for taking up other developmental works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aai-officials-to-visit-raichur-to-inspect-site-for-airport/article34041268.ece
11 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. allows inter-RTC staff transfer||After a gap of over four years, the State government has directed road transport corporations to allow inter-corporation transfers of employees. An order issued on Tuesday by the Transport Department stated that class III and IV employees — drivers, conductors, technicians and others — are eligible for the inter-corporation transfers. A committee, headed by the managing director of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), will oversee the transfer process. Employees will be allowed to submit their applications online from April 1 to April 30. Transfers will be considered based on seniority of employees: those seeking transfers must have served at least for a period of 10 years. Those facing disciplinary action are not eligible to seek transfers. Other guidelines noted that employees once transferred cannot ask for a withdrawal of the transfer order or modification. They will also not be allowed to apply for an inter -corporation transfer in the future. A decision has also been taken to reserve 5% of transfer posts for couples working in corporations. A KSRTC official said that in 2016, when inter-corporation transfers were last allowed, 14,500 employees had sought transfers. However, only around 3,900 received orders. “Last time, a majority of the employees sought to move from Bengaluru or other southern regions to NEKRTC or NWKRTC. Based on the vacancies available in those corporations, transfers were done. A good number of employees changed their minds due to family compulsions, education of children and others,” said the KSRTC official. According to sources, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has more than 10,000 employees who hail from northern parts of the State, whereas in KSRTC the numbers are in the 5,000-6,000 range. In 2016, the State government initiated inters corporation transfers after employees went on a strike for three days. At the time, corporations — after initiating the process — were criticised for botching it up. The KSRTC in a release also said that the State government has met seven of the nine demands made by the road transport employees including those pertaining to health insurance schemes in government hospitals and compensation for families of employees who died after contracting COVID-19. The release further stated that the demand to reduce the probationary period of new employees from two years to one year is pending before the Finance Department for approval. The State government has also set up a committee to come out with a report on employees’ major demands to pay salaries as per the recommendation of the Sixth Pay Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-allows-inter-rtc-staff-transfer/article34041043.ece
11 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Blunder led to offer of TDR worth Rs. 13,396 cr.’||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday permitted the State government to seek modification of the order from the apex court on utilising Bangalore Palace property for widening Ballari and Jayamahal roads as the government pointed out that a “blunder” has resulted in offering Transferable Development Rights (TDR) worth Rs. 13,396 crore to occupants of the palace properties as against a total of Rs. 11 crore compensation fixed for the entire 472 acres of palace property in the 1996 law. Purpose was to widen road A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty passed the order after the government submitted the complete details to be placed before the apex court for seeking modification of 2014 order while observing that there is no dispute that these stretches of roads will have to be widened. The value of the TDR for 15 acres 39 guntas (64,653 sq mts) to be utilised for road widening would amount to Rs. 13,396 crore as against the total compensation of Rs. 11 crore fixed for the entire Palace property, measuring 472 acres, in the Bangalore Palace (Acquisition) Act, 1996, the Government told the High Court. The Government of Karnataka pointed out that TDR was offered based on the wrong action of the then Commissioner of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) in 2009. The then Commissioner erroneously communicated directly to the occupants of Palace properties offering TDR in lieu of utilising 64,653 sq mts land that resulted in the government seeking permission from the apex court in 2014 to offer TDR, the Government has pointed out in its February 23, 2021 decision to seek modification of the 2014 order of the apex court. Interestingly, the government has pointed out that on earlier two occasions, 13,000 mts and 8,510 sq mts of palace properties were utilised for road widening at Vasanthnagar and for Mekhri underpass during 1999 and 2000 respectively. And payment of compensation was made by calculating price per acre on the basis of Rs. 11 crore fixed for the entire land in the 1996 Act after taking permission from the apex court. It was “a blunder” by the then Commissioner to offer TDR when the apex court had earlier permitted compensation in terms of the 1996 Act, the government explained while pointing that the government need to pay only around Rs. 37 lakh for using 64,653 sq mts as per compensation scheme of 1996 Act. Ownership of property The government also said TDR can be issued only to the owners of property and the ownership of palace property vests with the government after the High Court 1997 upheld the acquisition law and the apex court had only ordered maintaining status quo without staying the Act. The government also pointed out that it would be not possible to recover TDR certificates worth Rs. 13,396 if ultimately the apex court upholds the 1996 Act as the certificates can be sold immediately to real estate developers by the occupants of Palace properties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/blunder-led-to-offer-of-tdr-worth-rs-13396-cr/article34041007.ece
11 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Single test procedure to detect gestational diabetes established||The Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI), comprising senior doctors, has established the efficacy of the ‘single test procedure’ to diagnose Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). It has found that GDM can be diagnosed if two hour plasma glucose is greater than or equal to 140 milligrams per decilitre (2hr PG ≥ 140 mg/dl) with 75 gram oral glucose administered to pregnant women in fasting or non-fasting state, irrespective of the time of the last meal. The DIPSI guideline document was released by Jithendra Singh, Union Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office, at the Diabetes in Pregnancy summit on Wednesday. The summit was jointly organised by Asian Research and Training Institute for Skill Transfer (ARTIST for Her) and Integrated Health and Wellbeing (IHW) Council. According to the guideline document titled “Diagnosis and Management of GDM -2021” by DIPSI, any diagnostic criteria and procedure should be simple, doable, economical and evidence based. The ‘Single Test Procedure’ has been approved by the Union Ministry of Health, World Health Organisation, International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF), stated the DIPSI document. “Diagnosis of GDM with a “Single Test” recommended by DIPSI and endorsed by the Union Ministry of Health is an affordable test to meet the requirement of all strata of society. However, some diabetology groups were not convinced. Now the DIPSI document makes it clear that there is no longer a controversy in acceptance of the single test,” said V. Seshiah, founder patron of DIPSI. Listing out the advantages of the test, Hema Divakar, CEO of ARTIST for Her and former president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), said a pregnant woman need not be fasting for the test. “This test causes least disturbance in a pregnant woman’s routine activities. It serves as both screening and diagnostic procedure. Diagnosis of GDM with this test and subsequent treatment is worthwhile with a decreased macrosomia rate, fewer emergency caesarean sections and serious perinatal morbidity,” she said. The Union Ministry had mandated screening of all pregnant women for GDM as part of routine antenatal package under the national guidelines in 2014. Subsequently, the Ministry revised the guidelines for diagnosing and management of GDM in 2018. “Despite this, implementation of diagnostic procedures has been unsatisfactory. One of the reasons could be the incongruent opinion for the diagnosis of GDM,” she added.  This test causes least disturbance in a pregnant woman’s routine activities. It serves as both screening and diagnostic procedure Hema Divakar, CEO of ARTIST for Her and former president of FOGSI||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/single-test-procedure-to-detect-gestational-diabetes-established/article34041028.ece

11 March 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||LIC IPO, FDI limit hike opposed||Opposing the Union government’s decision to list Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) in the stock market through an IPO, the decision to increase FDI limits in the insurance sector from 49% to 74% and privatise one public sector general insurance company, employees and officers of LIC will observe one day nationwide strike on March 18. According to a press release issued by Krishna Anvatti, Secretary of Federation of LIC Class I Officers’ Association, Dharwad; Laxmikant A. Naik, Secretary National Federation of Insurance Field Workers of India, Dharwad, and Uday Gadagkar General Secretary, Insurance Employees’ Union, Dharwad (AIIEA), the strike has been called by all the unions in the insurance sector. All the Unions in the LIC are opposed to all the three proposals as these are not in the interest of the insurance industry, the Indian economy and the people, they have said in the release. They have said that there was no justification for the Centre’s move. The LIC was created through an Act of Parliament and was given the task of raising resources for faster industrialization of the country by collecting small savings in the form of premiums while giving utmost security to the policyholders. The LIC had been very successful in meeting these objectives. And disinvestment in LIC being the first step towards privatisation, the IPO violated the very objectives of creation of LIC, they have said. Weaker sections The capital invested by the government in LIC in 1956 was a meagre Rs. 5 crore and it was increased to Rs. 100 crore in 2011 to meet the regulatory requirements. Beginning to function on a small capital, the LIC had accumulated assets worth to Rs. 32 lakh crore as on March 31, 2020, they said. “The LIC has given utmost importance to the needs of the weaker sections of the society. It has insured 3.68 crore people under various social security schemes for 2019-20. It holds the distinction for the best claim settlement performance. For 2019-20, it settled 2.16 crore claims for Rs. 1,59,769 crore. Under social security schemes, it settled 68,352 claims amounting to Rs. 901.95 crore during the same period”, the release said. The LIC had been consistently paying high dividends to the government on its paltry investment. The cumulative dividend paid by LIC since 1956 is over Rs. 28,000 crore and for 2019-20, it paid dividend amounting to Rs. 2,698 crore. The LIC IPO would severely impact the economy and vulnerable sections of Indians and affect the objectives of nationalisation and LIC would have to concentrate on delivering increasing profits to the shareholders. They have said that with IPO, LIC, like the private companies, would have to target big policies which bring greater profits and in the process the small size policies which the poor, vulnerable and lower middle classes purchase would no longer be attractive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lic-ipo-fdi-limit-hike-opposed/article34041269.ece

Yediyurappa and the recently-amended laws from the Union and State government, farmers’ leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar said that the Union and State governments had failed to address the farmers’ problems. “The amendments to the Land Reforms Act, APMC Act, Essential Commodities Act, Electricity Act and others that have a direct bearing on the farmers have clearly shown that the governments are serving their corporate masters and not the farming community. These legislations help to safeguard the interests of big corporate companies and not farmers. We don’t accept these laws that were forcibly imposed on us despite our opposition,” he said at a press conference in Ballari on Wednesday appealing to the government to give up its stubborn position and repeal the controversial laws. Dismissing the claims of the governments on Minimum Support Price (MSP) being offered to farm produce, Mr. Chandrashekhar said that the governments were misleading the people with false claims. “We have been demanding scientific MSP as recommended by M.S. Swaminathan Commission and what the government is offering is not scientific MSP. The government is cheating the farmers in the name of MSP. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa are doing everything that serves the interests of big companies and deprives the people of their legitimate rights,” he said. On the recent agitation by the transport workers employed in State-owned transport corporations, Mr. Chandrashekhar said that the demands of the workers had not yet been met. “The main demand of the agitation was considering the transport workers as government workers and extending all the facilities and payscale to them. The government has clearly said that it is not possible to meet the demand. We have set a deadline of April 7. If there is no positive response by then, we will resume the agitation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/centre-state-government-have-failed-to-address-farmers-woes/article34041271.ece

11 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Residents urged to use water judiciously in summer||While exuding confidence that water stored in Thumbe vented dam will last till May end for supply to the city, Mayor Premananda Shetty on Wednesday asked people to adopt water rationing between March and May. Speaking after performing Ganga puja to the Netravati at the dam, Mr. Shetty said that water at the dam has now been maintained at 6 metres and the inflow of water will continue for another 10 days. “With regular monitoring of Thumbe vented dam and AMR dam, which is on the upstream of Thumbe, there will be no problem in meeting the drinking water needs of the city till the onset of monsoon,” he said, while expressing the need for citizens to use water judiciously. Works estimated at Rs. 35 crore have been taken up at the dam premises under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. This includes construction of a 20 MLD (million litres per day) capacity water treatment plant. The jack wells were being upgraded to improve pumping capacity. Under the Jalasiri scheme, an 87.7 MLD water treatment plant was being upgraded. Action is being taken to harness 5% of water that was going to the drain as backwash water and this will get about 8 MLD of water additionally, he said. “Many of the water works will be completed in the next few days and more water will be available for citizens,” he said. Drone survey In response to the demand by former Mayor M. Shashidhar Hegde for storing water at Thumbe upto 7 metres, the Mayor said the MCC has planned to retain water at 6.6 meters. Accordingly, a survey of the lands that will be submerged has been carried out using a drone and reports will be submitted to the tahsildar. “Once the extent of land that will be submerged is known, we will send a proposal to the State government for allocation of funds,” he said. Mr. Shetty said he has spoken to the Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and asked him to advise AMR dam personnel not to generate electricity in these three months and direct them to release water, whenever necessary, to Thumbe dam. Steps have been taken to ensure the right mix of chemicals for water treatment and also ensure supply of clean drinking water to people, he said. Earlier, Mr. Shetty, Deputy Mayor Sumangala, former Mayors Diwakar, Mr. Hegde, and Bhaskar K., Leader of Opposition in MCC Council Abdul Rauf and in-charge MCC Commissioner Dinesh Kumar participated in the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-urged-to-use-water-judiciously-in-summer/article34041489.ece

The park has brought them from Thiruvananthapuram zoo, Kerala, under the animal exchange programme, according to H. Jayaprakash Bhandary, park director. Rheas are largest flightless bird from South America. There is a pair each of White Rhea and Brown Rhea in the park now. A special feature of the rheas is that once the female lays the eggs, the male incubates them. Once the chicks hatch, they flock with the male, he said. Mr. Bhandary said that the park has three swamp deer now. They are also called Barasingha found in the Indian subcontinent. They are endangered species found in certain pockets of North India and Nepal.

11 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||English translation of 50 Tulu short stories released||Tulu literature scaled new heights with the seventh English translated work of two scholars, K. Chinnappa Gowda and late B. Surendra Rao, being released on Wednesday. With this, 2,100 pages of different forms of Tulu literature, translated by the two scholars, are now available for reading in the universal language. The two scholars translated them constantly from 2017. Incidentally Mr. Rao, a critic, a writer and a former Professor of History at Mangalore University, passed away in December 2019, after completing the translation of the latest work titled Heartbeats, released in the Mangalagangotri campus of Mangaluru University on the day. The ‘Prasaranga’ (publication wing) of the university has published their seventh work. The earlier works have been published by different publishers. Speaking after releasing the seventh work in the series, scholar and a former Vice-Chancellor of Hampi Kannada University and also Karnataka State Open University B.A. Vivek Rai said that more than 2,000 pages of Tulu literature being translated into English has brought a national recognition to Tulu literature. Mr. Gowda and late Mr. Rao translating the works constantly in four years like a mission was not a small achievement, Mr. Rai said.  Heartbeats comprises the translation of 50 modern Tulu short stories in 544 pages. In addition to five short stories selected from the first phase of development in the 1930s, the translators have also selected 17 stories by 13 women and stories by four Muslim writers whose tales are important to understanding the cultural uniqueness that exists among the people speaking Tulu and Beary. Mr. Gowda, a former Vice-Chancellor of Karnataka Folklore University, said that the shortest story in the Heartbeats is two-and-half pages and the longest is in 24 pages. He said that the choice of short stories made in the seventh work was governed by their own aesthetic dictates. The stories have complex responses to the ideas of change - some radical, some guarded. “We have merely taken them as the heartbeats of our society, as so many responses to living,” Mr. Gowda said. P.S. Yadapadithaya,Vice-Chancellor, Mangalore University, and K. Abhay Kumar, Director, Prasaranga, spoke. Earlier, the two scholars had translated 114 modern Tulu poems, Ladle in a Golden Bowl (2017), A Tale of a Landlord’s Household - a modern Tulu novel ‘Mittabail Yamunakka’ by late D.K. Chowta (2017), an anthology of 60 Tulu folktales, The Rainboy (2018), and an anthology of 22 Tulu work-songs and 53 dance-songs, When the Moonlight is very Hot (2018). Later, they translated the first Tulu novel, Sati Kamale, by late S.U. Paniyadi (2018) and translated a short story in Tulu by late Polali Sheenappa Hegde as Tale of Narayana the Impostor (2019).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/english-translation-of-50-tulu-short-stories-released/article34041481.ece

According to the complaint filed with the Cyber Crime Police, the retired official said that a person claiming to be an official from the SBI called on his cell phone on March 4. His son picked up the call. The person said that Rs. 2 lakh was deducted from the account holder’s account and he (the official) required the OTP to reverse the amount to the account in the Bunder branch of SBI. Believing this to be true, the son shared the OTP. A few minutes later, he received an SMS about money getting deducted from the account. On checking with the bank, the retired official found that that amount deducted from his account had been credited in different accounts in New Delhi. The police have registered a case. Another case In another complaint filed with the Cyber Crime Police, the father of a research student from Mangaluru alleged that a professor from a university in Guntur in Andhra Pradesh harassed his daughter by posting a morphed photo of hers on social media.

11 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Tourism sector in Mysuru sad over lack of booster dose||The tourism industry in Mysuru appears saddened over the lack of impetus given to the sector in the budget presented by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. The stakeholders said the sector was in badly need of a stimulus through new initiatives, projects and higher allocation for rescuing it from the jolt of COVID-19 pandemic. Ahead of the budget presentation, the stakeholders had met the Chief Minister and the Ministers concerned, including Minister for Tourism C.P. Yogeshwar, and presented their wish list. Also, the demands of the industry are not new as they have been patiently submitting their wish list every year with hopes of giving more to tourists visiting Mysuru, whose economy primarily hinges on tourism growth. Mysuru Travels’ Association President B.S. Prashanth said, “The tourism sector has the strength of returning more to what the government invests on improving tourism. Time and again, it is being proved that tourism is the neglected sector despite being a potential area for reviving the economy.” Barring the allocation for a theme park at Kabini dam, there is nothing to revive the sector. The demand for the expansion of Mysuru airport, setting up of the Dasara Authority and Mysuru Tourism Development Authority involving five districts, and retaining the Film City in Mysuru, which could have helped develop tourism, have been ignored. “Even an allocation of at least Rs. 50 crore would have given a start to the airport expansion which goes a long way in taking the city on the path of progress,” he said, arguing that Mysuru should not have failed in convincing the Chief Minister like other districts in getting the allocation for the sectors of their choice. The hospitality sector is upset over no sops announced to the crisis-hit industry besides lack of drive for improving tourism. “If an authority comprising five districts, including Mysuru, Kodagu, Hassan, Chamarajanagar and Mandya, was formed, it could have focused on pushing tourism development projects. Many initiatives such as circuit tourism covering all five districts could have promoted,” felt Hotel Owners’ Association President Narayana Gowda. Mr. Gowda said the industry wants a clarity on the Film City since the government is neither developing the Film City in Mysuru nor the project in Bengaluru. The stakeholders want the Film City to be retained in Mysuru as this will give more tonic to the tourism sector. “The budget announcements should not remain on paper. The government should implement them the same year of announcement. The Film City project is one such example of how projects remain on paper. The government should clear the uncertainties over the project,” Mr .Gowda opined. The confusion over the fate of the project had worried the stakeholders who had opposed its shifting to Bengaluru. When Mr. Siddaramaiah was the Chief Minister, he had announced the project and set aside 100 acres of land at Himmavu in Varuna constituency. MSME happy The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Council has welcomed certain features of the budget including loan upto Rs. 2 crore for women entrepreneurs at 4 per cent rate of interest and organising week-long exhibition annually to market the products of women entrepreneurs and Self-Help Groups. The MSME Mysuru unit said support to women entrepreneurs and providing hand-holding facilities and 15 per cent subsidy for micro food processing industries and cold storage units were welcome initiatives and would help women emerge in a big way on the industrial scene. The MSME also welcomed the separate slab for property tax payable by industries to local bodies, and financial supportfor theme park development at Kabini and Kidwai hospital in Mysuru and Shivamogga. But it said the budget lacks any programme to revive sick units besides shoring up the fortunes of units on the verge of closure due to the COVID-19 impact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tourism-sector-in-mysuru-sad-over-lack-of-booster-dose/article34041503.ece

The youth – Chandan Mallappa – was brought to Apollo BGS Hospital in Mysuru at 12.20 p.m. on Sunday in a critical condition after a road accident. “Initial CT scan showed brain stem infarct. He was shifted to ICU at 2.20 p.m. for life support and intensive care’’, a statement from the hospital said. Chandan was kept on life support for two days while he was in a very critical state. On the third day, he was declared brain dead due to brain stem failure by a panel of doctors as per the hospital protocol stipulated by the Transplant of Human Organs Act, 1994. Chandan was healthy before the incident and further tests confirmed his eligibility for organ donation. The attenders were counselled for organ donation as per the defined protocol and his mother, brother-i- law and relatives came forward to donate Chandan’s organs, said a statement. As per the organ donation protocol, officials from Jeeva Sarthakathe, which was earlier known as ZCCK or Zonal Co-ordination Committee of Karnataka for organ transplant, initiated the process in accordance with the waiting list of organ recipients, said the statement from Apollo BGS Hospitals, Mysuru, a licensed centre for multiorgan transplant. Around 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, Chandan’s organs (heart valves, two kidneys, liver and pancreas) were retrieved at the hospital. A simultaneous transplant of kidney, pancreas and liver was carried out into the recipients, who had registered with Jeeva Sarthakathe and were waiting for the organs. While simultaneous transplant of kidney, pancreas and liver was carried at the same hospital, one kidney was sent to Manipal Hospital in Bengaluru and the heart valves were sent to Jayadeva Hospital in Bengaluru. The hospital staff formed a human chain on the hospital premises to pay their last respects to Chandan and his family, said the statement issued by N.G.

11 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Pressure group’ need of the hour||Even as the stakeholders have resolved to continue their fight for tourism development despite the State Budget ‘failing’ to respond to their concerns, they are now mulling over setting up a “pressure group” for playing a key role in realising their wish list in the interest of tourism, and also influence the government in taking their ideas forward. Certain projects are being sought by the stakeholders since decades but they are unable to get the budgetary sanction. The Dasara Authority and the plan for establishing round-the-year exhibition at Dasara expo grounds are among the proposals that failed to get the nod. “If things go this way, Mysuru may not see tourism development on the expected lines. We need to exert collective pressure on the government bringing all tourism-related associations and groups under one umbrella and taking the elected representatives along to realise what Mysuru deserves,” a stakeholder of the travel industry opined. Another reason cited was that Mysuru is not represented in the Cabinet. This is also hampering constructive tourism development, he said, adding that a strong “pressure group” appears to be the need of the hour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pressure-group-need-of-the-hour/article34041501.ece

BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad told The Hindu that the civic body has given the management of these religious structures two weeks to respond to the notice. After receiving their response, the civic body will take a decision on a case-by-case basis and issue a summary order for the demolition of these structures. “The management will be required to demolish the respective structures. If they fail to do so, the BBMP will demolish the structures and recover the cost from them,” he said. The civic body had submitted the survey report to the High Court, which is hearing a PIL petition, initiated suo motu by the court to enforce the apex court’s directions on preventing unauthorised religious structures on public property. Of the 2,170 unauthorised religious structures, 1,893 were on government property and constructed before the cut-off date. Of these, 240 have been recommended for demolition, 105 for relocation and remaining 1,548 for regularisation. Incidentally, the affidavit was filed after the third survey of unauthorised religious structures in the city. Following the first survey, the BBMP claimed there were just 111 religious structures of which 17 were constructed after September 2009. After being pulled up by the court, a second survey was taken up where the BBMP submitted a report claiming there were 1,588 religious structures, of which nearly 1,240 existed before September 2009.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/notices-to-277-illegal-religious-structures/article34041011.ece

Based on a complaint filed by Bidri, the cyber crime police tracked down the three men through the bank account they had used. “The accused have been identified as Thia Rit Samong, 31, Seropa Sesai, 27, and Ester Konyak, 28. They are part of a five-member gang that focused on cyber crime and targeted people online,” said a police officer.

However, visitors are worried as they have observed a lack of precautions in places of worship over the last few weeks. For instance, a resident of Kanakapura Road went to a place of worship and was taken aback to see hundreds of people gathered there. “I was worried when I saw that COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, like mask wearing, maintaining social distance and frequent hand-washing and sanitising, was not being followed,” she said. Others pointed that while marshals are being deployed at marriage halls, there are no similar checks at places of worship. Addressing their concerns, N. Manjunath Prasad, Commissioner, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), told The Hindu that marshals have been directed to keep vigil over temples and places of worship where citizens are likely to gather. “Marshals are already monitoring marriage halls and party halls, and similar efforts will be taken up for temples in the city,” he said, and added that the civic administration will ensure that Maha Shivaratri is celebrated in a low-key manner. Marshals had already identified places of worship where people are likely to gather in huge numbers, such as Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple, Halasuru Someshwara temple, Kadu Malleshwara temple, HAL Shiva temple. Chief Marshal Col. (retd.) Rajbir Singh said teams are in place to monitor the crowds. The Bengaluru Rural district administration had directed tahsildars to ensure that gatherings in temples coming under its jurisdiction are restricted to a limited number of people. Deputy Commissioner Srinivasa K. said that given the increase in cases, the annual cart festival in Hoskote that was supposed to be held on Thursday had all but been cancelled. Orders had been issued for just the necessary ceremony and people would not be allowed to gather, he said. For religious places in Bengaluru Urban jurisdiction, the district administration had designated municipal employees to ensure citizens follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and levy fines on violators, said J. Manjunath, Deputy Commissioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/civic-administration-gears-up-for-crowds/article34041016.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Panchamasali quota: Yatnal threatens dharna||Ruling BJP’s senior member Basanagouda Patil Yatnal has threatened to launch an indefinite agitation from Monday, if the government fails to set a deadline to grant reservation for the Panchamasali community under 2A category of OBC reservation in the State. Currently, the community is included in 3B category. The Panchamasali leaders have been demanding inclusion of the community in 2A category for availing benefits out of a total of 15% quota in jobs and education. Speaking at the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday, Mr. Yatnal, a constant critic of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, said the government seemed to be not serious on providing reservation to the Panchamasali community, though their demand was more than two decades old. He criticised the “delay tactics” adopted by forming a high-level committee and urged the government to set the deadline of three to six months or one year to provide reservation to the community. In his reply, Home and Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Basavaraj Bommai said 4% reservation was given under category 1 to 391 castes/sub-castes; 15% under 2A for 393 castes/sub-castes; 4% under 2B for minorities; 4% under 3A for 50 castes/sub-castes; and 5% quota under 3B for 48 castes. The Backward Class Commission headed by former chairman H. Kantharaj had recommended that Panchamasali should remain in the category of 3B and opposed its inclusion in 2A. He said the government was committed to ensure justice to the Panchamasali community but change in the quota matrix should stand before legal scrutiny. Mr. Bommai said a decision was taken to constitute a high-level committee headed by a retired High Court judge to study demands made by communities/castes seeking changes in the existing reservation matrix. The three-member committee will have the retired High Court judge, a retired administrator and a social scientist.  Speaking to reporters after the Assembly was adjourned, Mr. Yatnal said the Chief Minister was “missing” and there was no assurance from the government on reservation. However, jumping to his defence, M.P. Renukacharya, CM’s political secretary, said: “The Chief Minister is not missing. He is working for the welfare of all communities, including Panchamasalis.” ‘Creamy layer is key’ Urging the State government to provide reservation to all communities that are seeking reservation or change in the status, former Minister and BJP member A.H. Vishwanath said the government should impose creamy layer condition for all. Speaking in the Council, Mr. Vishwanath said reservation facilities should reach the last man in the community. “It is not right to seek reservation for both me and my son or senior Congress leader Mallikarjuna Kharge and his son,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panchamasali-quota-yatnal-threatens-dharna/article34041033.ece

Yediyurappa has been “misled” by the Finance Department officials, ruling party member A.H. Vishwanath said the 2021-22 Budget contains nothing, and that the statistics of the last 10 years Budget have been juggled around. “Siddaramaiah, H.D. Kumaraswamy or Mr. Yediyurappa, who have so far held the Finance portfolio and presented many Budgets, are not economists. There has to be a separate Minister for Finance,” Mr. Vishwanath said in the Legislative Council much to the delight of the Opposition benches. “Of the 33 departments, most important departments are finance, DPAR and law. These are departments that take decisions on administration. Two of the departments, Finance and DPAR, are with Chief Minister,” he said. “During the JD(S)-Congress coalition government, I suggested to Mr. Kumaraswamy to hand over the Finance portfolio to someone else. He asked me if he was not capable and that he had handled the portfolio before. My point was he was capable but he would not have time. The department will be dead under a Chief Minister,” he said. Referring to the budgetary proposal to accrual of resources internally by boards and corporations, he said that even last year, the same proposal existed. “Only officials have to tell how much has been raised. In fact, most corporations are dependent on government grants,” he said. On outsourcing staff for government work, he pointed out the contractors supplying outsourced workforce are the family members of retired IAS officers, Ministers and ex-Ministers. “Vidhana Soudha today has become a mall. You can sell or buy anything. It is filled with touts promising transfer or giving tenders,” said the member.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-do-cms-hold-finance-portfolio/article34041034.ece

The accused, Victor Simon, was among nine officials whose residences and offices were raided by the ACB on Tuesday. “While many officials cooperated with us during the raid and search operations, Simon refused to do so even though he is a police officer and is aware of the rules. Hence, the investigating officer in the case decided to arrest him. He has been taken into custody for four days for questioning,” said a senior ACB official. On Tuesday morning, the ACB had conducted simultaneous search operations across 11 districts in Karnataka. The team that raided Simon’s residence in Bengaluru recovered a huge amount of disproportionate assets, which is estimated to be 257.4% higher than his known source of income. During the raid, ACB officials recovered documents pertaining to a flat in National Games Village, Koramangala, as well as a house, two sites and 10 acres of agricultural land in Mysuru. Other seizures included bonds valued at Rs. 1 crore, 500 gram of gold, Rs. 7.2 lakh cash, 21 litres of foreign liquor and household articles worth around Rs. 21.6 lakh. “Lockers and valuables are yet to be verified. We arrested the accused as, given his position, he could hamper the ongoing investigation and intimidate witnesses or disturb evidence,” a senior police officer added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/inspector-held-in-case-of-disproportionate-assets/article34041009.ece

Many factors are behind this and the general reluctance of would-be voters in enrolling their names is a concern, according to officials. They say the COVID-19 situation also could be a reason for the general drop in the number of voters in the district. It is estimated that only 27% of those in the 18-19 age group added their names on the voters list. Officials say though there are 28,135 people in the age group, only 6,443 enrolled as new voters as per the latest list. District Collector H. Dinesan, who is the District Election Officer, said a large number of youths in the plantation segments of Peerumade, Udumbanchola, and Devikulam who went to their native places in Tamil Nadu and had not returned due to the pandemic situation. This might be a reason, he said adding that there was a drop of over 11,000 people from the voters’ list of the Assembly elections in 2016. Prior to the Lok Sabha elections, it was 9,000. Officials said 11,382 voters had been removed from the list of the previous Assembly elections. They included the dead and those who shifted out of the district. The final voters’ list would be published next week and the total decline in the number of voters would be known then. According to the latest tally, there were 8,74,757 voters in the district. Many untraced voters Election managers of political parties, prior to the local body elections, had complained that they could not trace many on the voters’ list in the plantation constituencies, where traditional workers were of Tamil origin who had settled there for generations. A recent government data said the district had been witnessing a drop in population for the past two decades.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/decrease-in-number-of-young-voters-in-idukki/article34041429.ece

11 March 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Rights activist disputes encounter claim||The post-mortem examination report on the death of Velmurugan, a suspected Maoist, goes against the encounter claim of the police, C.P. Rasheed, secretary of the Janakeeya Manushyavakasa Prasthanam, said on Wednesday. Velmurugan, 32, a suspected member of Kabanidalam-2 of the Western Ghats Special Zone Committee of the proscribed Communist Party of India (Maoist), was killed in an alleged police encounter on the Banasura mountains in Wayanad on November 3 last year. The police had claimed that Thunderbolt commandos fired at him when a six-member armed Maoist group opened fire on them. The post-mortem examination report of the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, cited 44 wounds on the body, a testimony to the arbitrary police shoot-out, Mr. Rasheed said. He said food particles in the intestines were not digested, which showed that the police fired at him while he was having food or just after having food. The police said the incident occurred around 9.15 a.m. but there were no hints in the report regarding the time since the body was kept in a cold room for a long time. The report cemented the doubt on the time of occurrence. Moreover, mediapersons were not allowed to visit the site after the killing, he said. The report stated that firearm injuries to chest and abdomen involving heart, lungs, liver, kidney and intestine were the reasons for the immediate cause of death. It said fractures to lower one-third of both thigh bones were post-mortem injuries and not caused by firearms. “The fractured end on the right side was displaced,” Mr. Rasheed said adding that it showed that the police brutally attacked the body even after the death of the youth. The inquiry report of the judicial magistrate about the encounter was not legal and it was against the ruling of the Supreme Court as such an inquiry should be done by an executive magistrate, he said. The report also failed to find the cause for the encounter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rights-activist-disputes-encounter-claim/article34041346.ece
11 March 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||BJP, Cong. undermine growth: CM||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have a ‘‘sadistic attitude’’ of destroying all good works done by his government in the State, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said. Addressing a public meeting on Wednesday at Chembilode in the Dharmadam Assembly constituency from where he is seeking re-election to the Assembly, Mr. Vijayan said the two parties were united in their effort to destroy the development activities in the State. No one who believed in the welfare of the State could take such a stand, he said and added that the Congress and the United Democratic Front had a different mentality in everything. The Opposition UDF extended all support to the BJP’s campaign to annihilate Kerala, he said. The move against the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) was a way for the BJP to undermine the development of Kerala. The government had tried to bring Rs. 50 lakh crore worth of development projects beyond the Budget plans through KIIFB, but the efforts of the Opposition and the BJP were to destroy it. If it was the BJP that turned Central agencies against KIIFB, the Congress supported the move and unleashed a false propaganda, Mr. Vijayan said. The government announced the largest aid in its history when Cyclone Ockhi brought disaster in the State. However, the Opposition only tried to paralyse it. They opposed the Loka Kerala Sabha which was started to unite expatriates. Confidence in voters He expressed confidence in the voters citing that they resisted the torrent of lies in the recent local body elections and this would be repeated in the Assembly elections too. The government had not done anything to tarnish the image of the State. People in the State wanted the Left Democratic Front to come back again for the continuation of development, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-cong-undermine-growth-cm/article34041448.ece
11 March 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||In traditional LDF bastion, UDF hopes to break ground||Kannur district has invariably favoured the Left Democratic Front (LDF), no matter which of the two major coalitions in the State garnered more seats in the State to form the government. The election to the Assembly in 2016 was no different. The LDF had won eight out of the 11 Assembly seats in the district. While the LDF is planning to repeat the winning streak in the Assembly elections, specifically after doing well in the recent local body elections, the United Democratic Front (UDF) is hopeful of changing these equations. While Kalliassery, Dharmadam, Payyanur, Taliparamba, Mattanur and Thalassery are traditional strongholds of the LDF, the UDF has a continuous winning history in Peravoor and Irrikur. A tough battle between the LDF and the UDF is expected this time in Azhikode, Kannur and Koothapuramba. With the sitting MLA K.M. Shaji of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) not willing to contest in the Azhikode constituency, the CPI(M) hopes to take back the seat. Young CPI(M) leader and former district panchayat president K.V. Sumesh is the party's probable candidate in the constituency. Allegations against Mr. Shaji and an investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against him will be a major weapon of the LDF in the campaign. May make ripples The UDF is expected to make ripples in the Kannur constituency after its strong comeback in the Kannur Corporation elections. The constituency is a stronghold of the Congress, which it had won since 1987 till 2011. Minister Kadannappally Ramachandran of the Congress (S), an ally of the LDF, captured the seat from the Congress in 2016. With Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran deciding not to contest in the coming Assembly election, names of probable candidates to take on Mr. Ramachandran in the constituency are a matter of speculation. The LDF candidate in the Koothuparamba constituency is likely to be Loktantrik Janata Dal leader and former Minister K.P. Mohanan, who was in the UDF when he contested from the constituency in 2016 as Janata Dal (U) candidate and was defeated by Health Minister K.K. Shylaja. The constituency before its delimitation had been an invincible bastion of the CPI(M). In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Congress leader K. Muraleedharan secured a margin of 4,133 votes against CPI(M) candidate P. Jayarajan in the Koothuparamba Assembly segment in the Vadakara Lok Sabha constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/in-traditional-ldf-bastion-udf-hopes-to-break-ground/article34041417.ece

11 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Kochi Corporation can’t afford biomining, reiterates Mayor||Legacy waste at Brahmapuram will have to be biomined, but the Kochi Corporation does not have the financial resources to shell out Rs. 54 crore for the process, Mayor M. Anilkumar reiterated after a visit to the yard on Wednesday. Besides, no file with regard to biomining has been submitted to the corporation for its approval, he said. The Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) had carried out the tender process, and once KSIDC submits details to the corporation, a decision on biomining can be taken. “It can take almost two years to biomine the unsegregated mounds of waste at the yard. Some of the waste might have to be shifted to an RDF [refuse-derived fuel] plant. And, for six months of the year, rains might prevent work from happening, prolonging the process. The corporation does not have the financial means to pay for biomining,” he said. Since some of the garbage mountains at the yard caught fire last week, the Mayor along with Deputy Mayor K.A. Ansiya, Secretary, and standing committee chairpersons visited Brahmapuram on Wednesday as a preliminary measure before they discuss the matter and arrive at a plan. The Health Standing Committee is in the process of preparing a master plan for Brahmapuram. While some of the biodegradable waste is segregated and taken to another section of the yard for composting, the rest remains buried with the layers of non-biodegradable waste, including plastic, metal, and hazardous waste. “Since food waste lying with plastic produces methane, even a small spark can flare up into a huge blaze,” the Mayor said. Officers of the Fire and Rescue services have pointed out that the three hydrants at the yard are insufficient, he said. The officers will also submit a list of suggestions to the Health Standing Committee. The corporation will now focus on decentralised waste management and proper segregation at source to reduce the volume of waste arriving at the site. Capping [covering waste with layers of soil and effectively burying it] was done at Brahmapuram in 2012, according to T.K. Ashraf, chairman, Health Standing Committee. The non-biodegradable waste that is now lying at the plant has been accumulating for around eight years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-corporation-cant-afford-biomining-reiterates-mayor/article34041358.ece

The Communist Party of India (CPI) will field Eldho Abraham once again from his sitting seat, Muvattupuzha. The party is yet to announce its candidate for the Paravur seat. The list of UDF candidates is expected shortly. K.J. Maxi, M. Swaraj, and Antony John, CPI(M) candidates who won the last Assembly election from Kochi, Thripunithura and Kothamangalam constituencies respectively in 2016, are being fielded again from their constituencies. The CPI(M) has fielded its State secretariat member P. Rajeev to wrest Kalamassery seat from the Indian Union Muslim League. V.K. Ebrahim Kunju represented the constituency in the outgoing Assembly. The UDF and the IUML are yet to decide on their nominee for the seat even as the controversy over the Palarivattom flyover corruption case, in which Mr. Kunju is an accused, is raging. In Vypeen, the party has rested sitting legislator S. Sarma, who has an impressive track record of getting elected to the State Assembly six times. K.N. Unnikrishnan, CPI(M) district secretariat member, will be the LDF candidate from the coastal constituency. In Kunnathunad P.V. Sreenijan, a former Youth Congress leader and Congress candidate from Njarakkal constituency, is the CPI(M)’s pick for Kunnathunad Assembly constituency. Mr. Sreenijan, son-in-law of K.G. Balakrishnan, the former Chief Justice of India, was defeated by M.K. Purushothaman of the CPI(M) in the 2006 election. Later, Mr. Sreenijan parted ways with the Congress and aligned himself with the CPI(M). The Congress may ask sitting legislator V.P. Sajeendran to once again contest from the seat. The Corporate-backed Twenty20 has also fielded a candidate in Kunnathunad. The Left front is fielding Shaji George from Ernakulam constituency as an independent candidate and the UDF is likely to field sitting legislator T.J. Vinod to take him on. Mr. George is a publisher and former vice-president of the Kerala Regional Latin Catholic Council. J. Jacob, a medical doctor, is the party’s choice for Thrikkakara constituency. Here too, the LDF candidate will have to face sitting legislator and Congress strongman P.T. Thomas. Shelna Nishad, architect and daughter-in-law of of K. Muhamadali, a former Congress MLA representing Aluva, is the party’s candidate for Aluva constituency. It was trade union leader A. Yousuf who ended the winning streak of the Congress in the constituency. However, the party won back the constituency in 2011 through Anwar Sadath, who was again elected in 2016. Mr. Sadath is likely to defend his seat in the upcoming election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-cpi-announce-candidates-for-district/article34041362.ece

They are Angamaly, Aluva, Kalamassery, Thrikkakara, and Thripunitura municipalities, and Vadavucode-Puthencruz, Cheranalloor and Kumbalanghi panchayats. Despite several directives issued by the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management and the board, these civic bodies had failed to evolve their own mechanism to process waste. The board’s recommendation has been placed before the SLMC for follow-up action. Waste collection from other local bodies may be stopped as they are also duty-bound to manage waste. These local bodies have been violating the provisions of the Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000, according to the report. Call for action The board recommended that immediate action should be taken to revamp the solid waste management facility at Brahmapuram in view of the fact that it remains a long-pending issue. Leachate collection and treatment shall be immediately resumed. The leachate problem will turn severe with the onset of monsoon. Fresh loads of biodegradable waste were found being dumped over the heaps of old waste at the site on a daily basis, it said. Joint visit Plastic waste was found dumped openly along the south-east portion at the time of the SLMC-board joint visit on March 3. No facilities were available to process it, except for a shed that is not capable of accommodating the entire plastic waste brought to the yard. The shredding machine installed was seen kept idle. A small portion of the waste is being transferred to some outside agencies for further processing but the quantity or agency details are not obtained from the officials concerned. On the recurring fire breakouts at the site, the board recalled the lack of action on the part of the corporation to check such incidents. A study by the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology following the major fire on February 23, 2019 had found that the levels of dioxin observed in residual ash samples analysed after the incident were in the range observed in various infamous waste dumping sites in Vietnam, Philippines, Cambodia, Netherlands, Greece, and the United States. Dioxins are highly toxic chemical compounds which are harmful to health, and they are known as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stop-dumping-of-waste-from-other-local-bodies-says-pcb/article34041365.ece
11 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||An even game in Perumbavoor||The electorate in the Perumbavoor Assembly constituency has kept equidistance from both the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) since 1957. The scorecard stands at 7-7 as on the Assembly election held in 2016. It was P. Govinda Pillai who opened the account for the Left when he defeated K.A. Damodara Menon of the Congress by 899 votes in 1957. K.M. Chacko of the Congress defeated Mr. Pillai by 2,500 votes in 1960. However, the Marxist ideologue went on to represent the segment in the elections held in 1965 and 1967. Perumbavoor has given its representatives chances multiple times, except in the case of K.M. Chacko and P.I. Paulose of the Congress, who could not make it twice to the Assembly. P.P. Thankachan of the Congress held the constituency as a strong fort of the UDF for four consecutive terms since 1982. His winning streak came to an end when the Communist Party of India (M) decided to reclaim Perumbavoor, which was a seat usually assigned to its allies, in 2001. Saju Paul of the party defeated P.P. Thankachan, Shanimol Usman, and Jaison Joseph in the elections held in 2001, 2006 and 2011 respectively. Eldhose Kunnappilly of the Congress ended the Left reign and wrested the constituency back after a gap of one-and-a-half decades in 2016 when he defeated Mr. Paul by a margin of 7,088 votes. The decline in vote share remains a worry for the UDF and the LDF, as BJP has increased its presence since 2010. Its tally in the Perumbavoor Municipality went up to three in 2015 from one in 2010. The party had sent four of its representatives to the council in the recent local body elections. Despite winning the seat in 2016, the vote share of the UDF went down by 0.63 percentage points, while the Left faced a dip of 8.17 percentage points compared to 2011. The Kerala Congress (M) has staked claim for the seat, while the Congress is likely to give Mr. Kunnappilly a second chance. The position to be adopted by the Jacobite faction amid the Church row and the impact of the growing presence of Twenty20, which had announced its candidate, figure among the factors to count for this time. An increase in the BJP’s vote sharewill have an impact on the outcome going by the slender margin of victory the UDF and the LDF have been getting since 2011.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-even-game-in-perumbavoor/article34041364.ece
11 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||CIAL gets global recognition||Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) has won the Airport Council International (ACI) World’s ‘Voice of the Customer’ award for the health and safety practices it implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Through the global award, ACI recognises airports “that continued to prioritise their customers and remained committed to ensuring that their voice was heard during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020,” said a communication from the airport here on Wednesday. The Voice of the Customer recognition celebrates the commitment of airports that continue listening to passengers, adapting processes and procedures to meet the changing expectations of the customer experience in response to COVID-19, said ACI World’s Director General Luis Felipe de Oliveira. “As our industry works towards recovery, airports that listen to and prioritise the needs and expectations of customers will be better placed to respond,” he said. International standards CIAL managing director V.J. Kurian said that the ACI’s service quality programmes have been helping airport officials to ensure international standards in airport operations management. “The ACI recognition is a great initiative to asses individual organisations’ competence in crisis response. CIAL is always committed to facilitate a safe travel experience for passengers. We are grateful for this honour from ACI,” he said. Cochin International Airport, which had won ACI passenger satisfaction awards for the 5-15 million passenger category consecutively in 2018 and 2019, implemented new benchmarks in hygiene management during the pandemic time. It installed devices and successfully experimented with technologies to ensure hassle-free passenger movement from the public transport alighting points at the airport premises to the aircraft boarding gates. The airport deployed systems like disinfection corridor, automatic sanitiser dispensers, and fumigation machines at the terminal. State-of-the-art ultra violet baggage baths developed by DRDO were also installed in conveyor belt systems. The airport handled 33.38 lakh passengers and 30,737 aircraft movements during 2020. Its cargo division facilitated 48,424 tonnes of cargo during the year of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cial-gets-global-recognition/article34041340.ece
11 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Vypeen swings between rival fronts||Though the Vypeen Assembly constituency has swung between the two major fronts over the years, S. Sarma, the two-time sitting MLA, had turned it into a safe bet of sorts for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the last decade by notching up two back-to-back impressive victories. In the first election in 2011 since the constituency, previously known as Njarakkal, was delimited and rechristened as Vypeen, Mr. Sarma emerged victorious with a margin of 4,958 votes and a vote share of 50.37% against his Congress rival Ajay Tharayil. He further tightened his grip five years later when he improved his vote share to 52.24% and almost tripled the lead to 19,353 against the Congress rival K.R. Subhash, one of the biggest victory margins for an LDF candidate in Ernakulam district in that election. Little impact But the LDF dominance had little impact in the Lok Sabha election held three years later when Congress candidate from Ernakulam constituency Hibi Eden literally swept through the Vypeen Assembly constituency, comprising eight panchayats, to notch up an impressive lead of 23,241 votes against his immediate LDF rival P. Rajeev. Balance of sorts was restored in the last year’s local body poll when both fronts shared the spoils with the United Democratic Front (UDF) winning Mulavukad, Edavanakkad, Nayarambalam, and Elamkunnapuzha panchayats and the LDF bagging Kadamakkudy, Kuzhipilly, Njarakkal, and Pallippuram panchayats. In the 14 elections since 1957, the constituency has voted for the Congress and the Left seven times each though Congress candidate K.C. Abraham made a formidable start by registering a hat-trick of victories in the elections held in 1957, 1960, and 1965. The LDF decision to replace Mr. Sarma, a formidable candidate, with debutant K.N. Unnikrishnan in the forthcoming election seems to have led to a sudden spike in the Congress aspirants for the Vypeen Assembly constituency with numerous names like that of former MP K.P. Dhanpalan, INTUC national secretary K.P. Haridas, former minister and MLA Dominic Presentation making the rounds. Mr. Unnikrishnan is a member of the CPI(M) district secretariat and office-bearer of numerous trade unions. Mr. Sarma’s absence is likely to throw open the electoral arena like never before in the last decade. V4 People and Twenty20 are also likely to field their candidates in the constituency. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is rumoured to take back the seat from its ally Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vypeen-swings-between-rival-fronts/article34041566.ece

Sandeep, a detainee under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, “was in the knowledge of the illegal activity of smuggling of foreign exchange out of India and also abetted such smuggling”, according to a report submitted in the court. Sixth respondent The agency wanted Sandeep, who is incarcerated at the Poojappura prison, to be arrayed as the sixth respondent in the case. A detailed investigation was needed to identify whether more persons were involved in the smuggling of huge quantities of foreign currency out of India, the Customs said. The Customs submitted that statements of Swapna Suresh and P.S. Sarith, accused in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, indicated that Sandeep had abetted with them in awarding the contracts of a LIFE Mission project to Unitac Builders, which facilitated the receipt of commissions by UAE Consulate officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dollar-case-customs-seeks-to-arrest-sandeep-nair/article34041341.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the directive when the case relating to the flooding of Kochi city came up for hearing. The court made it clear that the work on restoration of Mullassery canal, the 12 link canals between Atlantis and Vaduthala and the restoration of Karithodu Kayal and Punchakayal should not be stalled and the works should be commenced and completed in time. It was earlier submitted that the Operation Breakthrough team was facing a predicament because unsubstantiated allegations were often made against them and investigations into some of them were on. Therefore, they were apprehensive of commencing the works. In view of the apprehension of the Operation Breakthrough team, the court felt that it should keep an eye on the works and directed the Superintending Engineer, Minor Irrigation Project, who heads the team, to file reports on the progress of the works in the court biweekly. This would ensure that unnecessary allegations were not levelled when a work of grave and imminent public interest was being carried out by all the stakeholders, the court said. The court also made it clear that the series of orders passed by the court last year with respect to cleaning of the Perandoor canal and steps for prevention of flooding would apply to this year as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-seeks-report-on-city-canals/article34041367.ece
11 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||LDF to exploit UDF dilemma in Kalamassery||The recently concluded elections to local bodies have given a new impetus to the Left Democratic Front (LDF), which is eager to wrest the Kalamassery constituency from the United Democratic Front (UDF). The UDF had comfortably won the segment in 2011 and 2016 Assembly elections. Strong wicket The LDF won 20 seats in the 42-member municipal council in the local body polls and believes it is on a strong wicket as the State goes to the Assembly polls on April 6. Sitting MLA V.K. Ebrahim Kunju of the Indian Union Muslim League, who won both in 2011 and 2016, is unlikely to be nominated to contest from Kalamassery once again as he is one of the key accused in the corruption case related to the Palarivattom flyover. It is also unlikely that anyone of Mr. Kunju’s nominees will be allotted the seat by the UDF leadership in view of the negative impact the flyover scandal has made so far. It is learnt that there is opposition from within the Muslim League itself to allotting the seat either to Mr. Kunju or his nominee. Early-bird advantage The Left front is keen to exploit the situation to the hilt and has fielded P. Rajeev, former member of the Rajya Sabha and former district secretary of the CPI(M), and currently a party secretariat member. Mr. Rajeev is a well-known leader in the district and will surely take advantage of the early announcement of his candidature. Mr. Kunju had defeated popular CPI(M) leader A.M. Yousuf by a margin of more than 12,000 votes in the 2016 elections. In the 2011 polls, he defeated CPI(M) leader K. Chandran Pillai by a similar margin. On both occasions, the UDF candidate had bagged a little less than 50% of the votes. Kalamassery stands out as the industrial capital of Ernakulam, which is the commercial centre of the State. With public sector units like Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore, the Assembly constituency is considered as one of the areas dominated by industrial workers, both in private and public sectors. Industrial areas like Eloor and Kalamassery add weight to the status of the constituency by representing the sentiments of workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-to-exploit-udf-dilemma-in-kalamassery/article34041568.ece
11 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||65% of sitting MLAs have criminal cases||Sixty-five per cent of the sitting MLAs in the present State Assembly have criminal cases against them, according to an assessment by the Association for Democratic Reforms and Kerala Election Watch. The civil society organisation analysed the self-sworn affidavits of 132 elected members out 140 that were submitted prior to the 2016 elections and found that 86 were facing criminal cases, while 21% MLAs had declared ‘serious’ criminal cases against them. The criteria for ‘serious’ criminal cases include offences for which maximum punishment is five years or more, non-bailable cases, electoral malpractices, loss to exchequer, assault, murder, kidnap, rape, cases under the Representation of the People Act (Section 8), Prevention of Corruption Act and crimes against women. Two members had cases related to attempt to murder, while one had declared cases in connection with crime against women. In party-wise analyses, 51 MLAs (91%) of the CPI(M) had criminal cases against them while the corresponding figures for others are CPI (12 or 63%), Congress (9 or 45%), Indian Union Muslim League (5 or 28%) and Independents (4). The party-wise figures of MLAS with serious criminal cases include CPI(M) 18, CPI 3, Congress 5 and IUML 2. Violent acts Several MLAs had faced cases registered under the provisions of the Kerala Prevention of Damage for Private Property and Payment of Compensation Ordinance, 2019 while participating in protests that turned violent. Among the provisions under the Indian Penal Code, some of the common clauses included Sections 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 147, 148, 149 (related to rioting). The Janata Dal (Secular), Kerala Congress (B), Kerala Congress (Jacob), Nationalist Congress Party and Congress (Secular) had one MLA each with criminal cases. The number of MLAs having criminal cases against them jumped from 47% in 2011 to 65% in 2016. Fifty-nine of the 126 members, whose self-sworn affidavits were analysed, had faced criminal cases in 2011. Of these, 11 had criminal cases against them coming under the ‘serious’ category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/65-of-sitting-mlas-have-criminal-cases/article34041428.ece
11 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||‘BJP trying to divide Christian groups’||The CPI(M) is not ready to walk into the trap laid by the BJP on the issue of the dispute between the Jacobite and Orthodox factions of the Malankara Church, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pillai has said. “The BJP is trying to drive a wedge between different Christian groups in Kerala. But the CPI(M) is averse to taking any side on this, as we favour the status quo ante on the historical dispute which, we feel, should be resolved through talks,” he said when asked about the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, believed to have supported the Left traditionally, seemingly gravitating towards the BJP as a quid pro quo for a promise of support. “It’s a trap laid by the BJP and our effort, which is ongoing, is to make the community realise that. We are taking out an elaborate, forceful campaign to sensitise them to its dangers,” Mr. Pillai said, adding that the party was talking to all social groups. The Left campaign, he said, would hinge on the development and welfare steps taken by the Left Democrtic Front government. “The slew of allegations levelled against it to create a smokescreen and mislead the public will not work. Wasn’t it the duty of the Customs Department and the immigration authorities to prevent smuggling? These allegations are a diversionary tactics to steer public attention from the real issues of development and welfare where the government has scored,” he said. The LDF manifesto, he said, would take forward a scheme mentioned in the State Budget to generate employment for the youth, especially in the science and technology, IT and biotechnology sectors and educated, employable housewives enabling them to cash in on the benefits of working from home. The alliance with the Kerala Congress (M) would help the LDF fetch more votes, he said. CPI(M) workers’ protest against conceding the Kuttiyadi seat to the KC(M) was ‘deep’, but the party would overcome the situation. In Ponnani, the clamour was not really serious, as the candidate fielded was a national leader capable of securing votes. “We stuck to the policy of not fielding candidates who have had two consecutive terms in the Assembly to give talented freshers a chance. The general perception that parliamentary positions should be perpetual should change,” he said.  The Congress is breaking apart, with the BJP making wholesale and retail purchase.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-trying-to-divide-christian-groups/article34041420.ece

The pipelines, lying in the area around the Kundannoor junction, were damaged in 2018 when the flyover was being built, cutting off supply to divisions one and two of the Maradu municipality, according to KWA officials. To fix the supply shortage then, water was temporarily diverted to these two divisions from a nearby pipeline stretching from the pump house at Maradu to Karuvelipady, reducing the supply to West Kochi. Around 95% of the work is complete and the finishing work will be done on Thursday, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-supply-to-maradu-set-to-be-restored/article34041359.ece

11 March 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Ettumanur remains a bone of contention||Attempts by the United Democratic Front (UDF) to wrap up seat-sharing talks appears to have suffered a setback following protests over the decision to allot the Ettumanur seat to the Kerala Congress faction led by P.J. Joseph. Official sources said protests within the rank and file of the Congress party had forced the UDF leadership to do a rethink on the decision. Accordingly, the issue has been featured as a special case in the discussions of the State Congress leadership with the party high command in New Delhi. Earlier, the Congress had planned to field Mahila Congress State president Lathika Subhash from the Assembly segment. The party, however, withdrew its claim over the seat, vacated with the exit of the Kerala Congress (M) from the coalition, after the P.J. Joseph faction stuck firm on his demand for at least three seats in Kottayam district. Accordingly, it was allotted Changanassery, Kaduthuruthy and Ettumanur. The decision, however, had drawn sharp protests from Congress workers, who even laid siege to the District Congress Committee office. Adding to the coalition’s woes, the move also triggered an internal squabbling within the Joseph group with at least three leaders — Saji Manjakadambil, Prince Luckose and Michael James — staking claim for the party ticket. Sources said the Congress was now actively considering taking back the seat and allot another seat to the Joseph faction. “Ms. Subhash who has represented Ettumanur in the Kottayam District Council for three terms on a trot from 1991, still stands a good chance to get the ticket,” said a top UDF leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ettumanur-remains-a-bone-of-contention/article34041434.ece

Right now, only the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has announced its candidate. Manayath Chandran, district president of the Loktantrik Janata Dal, will contest. He had lost to C.K. Nanu of the Janata Dal (Secular) in 2016, while he was a candidate of the Janata Dal (United), which was part of the UDF then. Meanwhile, it is not clear if the Congress will field its own candidate or opt for a tie-up with the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP). The UDF had allied with the RMP for the local body polls and captured power in a few panchayats, upsetting the LDF’s calculations. RMP votes were reportedly crucial in the victory of UDF candidate K. Muraleedharan in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as well. The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the Congress faction led by Mr. Muraleedharan want RMP leader K.K. Rema to contest from Vadakara so that the Front can bring back the debate against political violence to checkmate the CPI(M). However, the RMP has been indecisive about it. Initially, Ms. Rema herself appeared in the media, saying that she would not contest, and it was reported that N. Venu, party State secretary, would throw the hat into the ring. Later, the RMP seemed to have a rethink on Mr. Venu’s candidature. But a final decision is awaited.

This coastal segment, known for its port and Uru building, has never returned a Congress candidate, except once in 1977. Then again, the same candidate N.P. Moideen won the seat on the ticket of Congress (U), a breakaway faction of the Indira Gandhi-led Congress (I), in the 1980 Assembly polls, but with the support of the Left parties. Since then, only the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] has been winning hands down in all the Assembly polls. In a bid to break the jinx, the Congress-Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) combine experimented with an Independent candidate, the late K. Madhavankutty, with the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in the 1991 polls. Madhavankutty had served as principal of four government medical colleges in Kerala and was well known in the cultural landscape of Kozhikode city. But, he lost to T.K. Hamsa of the CPI(M) by over 6,000 votes. Not only did the maverick political experiment, now referred to as the ‘CoLeBi’ (short for Congress-League-BJP) alliance, against the Left fail, but it remains an embarrassment for all the three parties to this day. Hindus and Muslims equally share the demographic profile in the densely populated constituency, now considered to be an unbreachable red fortress. It also has perhaps the highest number of voters in the district. The segment comprises 14 divisions of the Kozhikode Corporation, Feroke and Ramanattukara municipalities, and Kadalundi grama panchayat. Of this, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) won 13 divisions in the recent corporation polls. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) is in power in both the municipalities, while the LDF is ruling the grama panchayat. Overall, the LDF managed to secure a moderate lead in the constituency. However, the CPI(M) may slowly be losing grip over the constituency, as was evident in the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls in the recent past. The party has fielded Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) national president P.A. Mohamed Riyas, who is entering the fray after a hiatus following his maiden electoral debacle in the 2009 Lok Sabha election. The Congress is weighing its options on fielding either KPCC general secretary P.M. Niyas or former DCC president K.C. Abu. The BJP, which is making inroads into the constituency, is likely to nominate Prakash Babu, the party State secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-impenetrable-fortress-of-the-left-so-far/article34041325.ece
11 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Protocol for parties to ensure green poll||Maintaining the COVID-19 protocol and the green protocol together throughout the election process is a huge challenge for political parties. Anticipating confusion over what is acceptable and what is not in the protocols, the Haritha Keralam Mission and Suchitwa Mission have brought out a booklet providing a detailed insight into the matter. Starting with the kind of boards used for campaigning, the use of cotton and organic substances such as screw pine mats, grass mats, jute, coconut leaves, and bamboo and areca sheaths has been advised. The use of traditional flex boards has been banned. However, the cotton-paper medium that serves the purpose can be used. Recyclable polyethylene can also be used for boards. Flags should be made of cotton cloth. Besides, there is a warning against the use of non-woven polypropylene that looks like cloth, but is, in fact, plastic. The use of utensils for serving food and water during campaigning needs special attention. Party workers have been asked to carry steel flasks or arrange water dispensers. The popular misconception that disposable cups and plates are safer than reusable ones has been negated. Disposable cups are never sanitised and may have gone through many hands. It is better to ensure cleanliness of utensils manually, the guidelines say. The use of cloth arches for campaigning is approved, but not the thermocol lettering on them. Garlands used to honour candidates can be of real flowers instead of plastic ones. Also, cotton masks can replace those made of polypropylene. Campaigners have also been advised to carry soap and sanitisers. Parties have been asked to remove campaign materials at their own expense after the polls and hand them over to the Haritha Karma Sena for recycling. The assistance of Haritha Keralam Mission, Suchitwa Mission, Clean Kerala Company, and Kudumbashree shall be availed, if necessary. In Kozhikode district, contact 9188120332 (Haritha Keralam Mission) or 9495367008 (Suchitwa Mission) for assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/protocol-for-parties-to-ensure-green-poll/article34041335.ece
11 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||LJD announces list of candidates||The Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) has decided to field its State president M.V. Shreyams Kumar from Kalpetta, former Minister K.P. Mohanan from Koothuparamba, and Kozhikode district president Manayath Chandran from Vadakara for the Assembly polls. This was announced by the parliamentary board of the party which met here on Wednesday. The three seats are now held by the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF). Only the names of Mr. Shreyams Kumar and Mr. Mohanan were considered for Kalpetta and Koothuparamba respectively. However, seven names including State secretary general Sheikh P. Haris and former legislator M.K. Premnath were proposed for Vadakara. Though Mr. Shreyams Kumar suggested that new faces should be given an opportunity to contest, none objected to Mr. Mohanan’s candidature. During the deliberations, Mr. Haris withdrew his candidature saying that Mr. Chandran, who lost the polls last time, should be fielded again. Critical of leadership Meanwhile, the party State committee meeting held in the morning saw members criticising the leadership for not securing more seats for the party. In the 2016 Assembly polls, the then party as the State unit of the Janata Dal (United) had contested seven seats when it was in the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) camp. At the same time, they said its rival political entity, Janata Dal (Secular), was allotted four seats. In the 2016 polls , that party had contested five seats and emerged successful in three of them, they said. A few members said three seats which the LDF had won last time were not actually safe seats as perceived to be. Also the party was denied a Lok Sabha seat in 2019 and then the CPI(M) had said this would be compensated in the Assembly polls, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ljd-announces-list-of-candidates/article34041418.ece
11 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||CPI(M) workers take out march in Kuttiyadi||Hundreds of CPI(M) workers, including women, took out a march in Kuttiyadi town here on Wednesday in protest against the decision of the party to offer the Kuttiyadi Assembly seat to its nascent partner, the Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)], for the upcoming elections. The development comes close on the heels of the cadres taking out a similar protest march at Ponnani in Malappuram district on Tuesday against the State leadership’s selection of a candidate in the constituency. Raising slogans against the decision, the protesters assembled in front of the Kuttiyadi town panchayat office in the evening. However, none of the local leaders holding any position in the party apparatus was part of the agitation. The march was a sequel to the posters favouring the candidature of former district panchayat president K. Kunhahamed Kutty appearing in different parts of the mofussil town on Tuesday. Also, isolated incidents with fewer demonstrators were seen in some areas. Trouble was brewing in the region ever since the seat-sharing process began in the Left Democratic Front. The lower rungs of the party had been clamouring that the CPI(M) field its own candidate to recapture the seat it had lost to the Indian Union Muslim League in the 2016 Assembly polls. The protesters, however, refrained from criticising the CPI(M) leadership but wanted it review its decision on the seat. The grouse was that the local leadership had laid the ground work for campaigning for a party nominee. They said the constituents of the LDF had cornered the seats of Kuttiyadi, Vadakara and Nadapuram, all considered CPI(M) strongholds in Kozhikode districts. The Kuttiyadi segment had witnessed a do-or-die electoral battle in the 2016 Assembly polls that resulted in IUML nominee Parakkal Abdulla defeating CPI(M) nominee K.K. Lathika by a margin of 1,157 votes. Ms. Lathika had won the seat by a margin of 6,972 votes against IUML’s Soopy Narikatteri in the 2011 polls. Incidentally, Ms. Lathika, had won the Mepayyur Assembly constituency also against an IUML candidate by a margin of 15,887 votes in the 2006 polls. The Mepayyur constituency ceased to exist after Kuttiyadi was carved out from this segment during delimitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-workers-take-out-march-in-kuttiyadi/article34041444.ece

Sources said some deft political manoeuvring and solid backing of State president T.P. Peetharambaran helped him secure the seat. However, party president Sharad Pawar and general secretary Praful Patel expressed their displeasure with the organisational functioning of the Kerala unit. While clearing the name of Mr. Saseendran, they also announced the names of two other contestants: N.A. Mohammed Kutty (Kottakkal) and Thomas K. Thomas (Kuttanad).

11 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||World Kidney Day to be observed today||Around a year ago, Kerala imposed restrictions on social life to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, which were followed by the Centre’s national lockdown that went on for two months. Many kidney patients missed their regular check-ups then, developed hypertension and high diabetes, and are experiencing its fallout now. With the World Kidney Day being observed on March 11, doctors are working on the theme ‘Kidney health for everyone everywhere, living well with kidney disease’ to ensure back-up for patients and their care-givers during pandemics and similar challenging periods. According to Vinu Gopal, consultant nephrologist, Meitra Hospital, Kozhikode, the efforts will be to increase awareness about effective symptom management and patient empowerment. “While steps to prevent kidney disease and its progression are important, patients with kidney disease — including those who depend on dialysis and transplant — and their care-partners should also feel supported, especially during pandemics,” he said. Patients with chronic kidney diseases and their family members or other care-partners should be empowered to achieve the health outcomes and life goals that are meaningful and important to them, Dr. Gopal pointed out. He said that kidney patients or those with acute kidney injuries were at greater risk if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is also the risk of worsening pre-existing renal functions. It will push them to early initiation of dialysis and renal transplant. Those on dialysis too are at risk, Dr. Gopal said. Social distancing and proper use of face mask and avoiding crowded places are important. As vaccination has begun, those who get a chance should do it. Even after that, precautions should continue, he said. “There is a need for more effective and integrated holistic symptom management for all patients with kidney disease beyond traditional therapies,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/stress-on-support-systems-to-live-well-with-renal-problems/article34041329.ece

11 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Marathon goes virtual this year||Following the COVID-19 outbreak, several events have gone online or virtual. However, a virtual marathon is a novel concept. The Indian Institute of Management - Kozhikode (IIMK) is all set to organise the 12th edition of the Calicut Half Marathon virtually and keep up with the year’s theme ‘Better Together: United Despite Distances’. The marathon will be held from March 19 to 21, and every participant will run in their own surroundings in three categories — a 21-km half marathon, 10-km mini marathon, and a 3-km Dream Run. The Dream Run has been the most popular one, as the who’s who of Kozhikode participate in it. This year, the participants will be allowed to register as teams — a team of two runners for the 10-km category and a team of four for the 20-km category, where each runner covers 5 km. Thus friends and families across the world can participate together. The timing part will be handled by My Race, which specialises in organising virtual races. Over the years, the Calicut Half Marathon has seen participation from across the globe and has taken up causes such as unity, women empowerment, rights of differently-abled, waste management, organ donation, and healthy living.

11 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Safety and anxiety hand in hand in LDF stronghold||Palakkad district is known for its variety and surprises, be it in politics or culture. The district has some of the safest constituencies for the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF). Yet, it has all the potential to be in the centre of attention by having some constituencies which will witness all-out fights this time. Even before the final battle lines are drawn, two of the 12 constituencies are poised to witness fierce electoral fights — Palakkad and Thrithala. Both are currently represented by two zesty youngsters of the United Democratic Front (UDF) — Shafi Parambil (Palakkad) and V.T. Balram (Thrithala). Both are almost sure to try their luck for a third term. Tough fight The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] is gearing up to give Mr. Balram its toughest fight in the district, especially as the party has a blunt axe to grind against him. A political bête noire for the CPI(M), Mr. Balram defeated CPI(M)’s Subaida Ishac by 10,547 votes in 2016. Since then, Mr. Balram and the CPI(M) have been at loggerheads. They often took to rancorous sallies on social media. Thrithala appears to be one of the most prized for the CPI(M), and it is out at it by fielding M.B. Rajesh, former Palakkad MP. Palakkad too will be a prized catch for the LDF, but Mr. Parambil over the past 10 years has made a solid footing in the constituency, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had bagged the second position by polling 29.08% votes against the winner’s 41.77%. But the UDF’s vote share in the Palakkad Assembly seat had fallen by nearly 5% in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, with a proportionate increase in the LDF’s vote share while the BJP remained almost steady. Shoranur, Ottappalam, Kongad and Malampuzha, which had successfully withstood the UDF sweep of 2019, appear safe bets for the LDF. Although Tharoor, Nemmara, Alathur and Chittur had favoured UDF’s ‘singing sensation’ Remya Haridas, MP, by huge margins in 2019, the LDF is confident about its influence in those constituencies. No threat for IUML While the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) does not see any major challenge against it in Mannarkkad, the UDF is eyeing two key constituencies this time — Pattambi and Chittur. When Pattambi was lost to the Communist Party of India, Chittur was lost to the Janata Dal (S) in 2016. It needs to be seen what strategies the UDF plans to wrest back Pattambi and Chittur. In spite of high hopes for the LDF in Kongad, the fall of the LDF lead in this Scheduled Caste-reserved Assembly segment to 356 votes in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019 has given the Congress fresh hopes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/safety-and-anxiety-hand-in-hand-in-ldf-stronghold/article34041426.ece

11 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M) retains 7 sitting MLAs||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Wednesday announced its candidates for 10 seats in the district, retaining seven sitting MLAs, including Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran. The only sitting MLA who did not find a place on the list is B. Satyan who has had two successive terms as legislator from Attingal, as per the party's policy to not give tickets to those who have successive terms in office. Among the new faces are G. Stephen in Aruvikkara and O.S. Ambika in Attingal, the only woman candidate of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the district. Mr. Stephen (51), the current CPI(M) area secretary in Kattakada, had become the president of the Kattakada grama panchayat at the age of 22. Fifty-four-year-old Ambika, a CPI(M) Attingal area committee member, is now in her second term as the president of the Chirayinkeezhu block panchayat. She had also served two terms as the president of Mudakkal grama panchayat. Mr. Surendran (68) had first won from Kazhakuttam in 1996. Currently holding the portfolios of Tourism, Devaswom and Cooperation, after winning from the same seat in 2016, he is also a State committee member of the CPI(M). He had served as the national vice president of the DYFI and as the district secretary of the CPI(M). Third time from Nemom V. Sivankutty, who had previously served as the Mayor of Thiruvananthapuram, will be contesting from Nemom for the third time. While he won against BJP's O. Rajagopal in 2011, the results reversed in 2016 when Nemom gave the BJP a seat in the Kerala Assembly for the first time. He had won from the erstwhile Thiruvananthapuram East constituency in 2006. A CPI(M) State committee member, Mr. Sivankutty was also the State secretary of the CITU. C.K. Hareendran, the sitting MLA at Parassala, who will be contesting for the second time, is a district committee member of the CPI(M). He was also the party's Neyyattinkara area secretary for a long period and the district vice president of the Kerala Karshaka Sangham. Another sitting MLA contesting for a second term is D.K. Murali in the Vamanapuram constituency. A district committee member of the CPI(M), he has also served as the Venjaramoodu area secretary of the party. Kattakada sitting MLA I.B. Satheesh is also a district committee member of the party and district executive member of the Kerala Karshaka Sangham. Neyyattinkara sitting MLA K. Ansalan, a member of the CPI(M) district committee, had earlier served as the vice chairperson of the Neyyattinkara municipality. Varkala sitting MLA V. Joy had twice served as the president of the Azhoor grama panchayat. V.K. Prasanth (39), the youngest of the lot, had first won from Vattiyurkavu in the byelection of 2019, wresting it from the UDF. He was then holding the post of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation Mayor. With the CPI(M) declaring its 10 candidates, the picture is clear as far as the LDF's candidates are concerned in the 14 constituencies in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-retains-7-sitting-mlas/article34041627.ece

Doctors have been on a path of agitation for the past few months over the alleged denial of pay arrears. Though several discussions were held with the government, the doctors have said the final order on arrears had provided only a nominal amount. Pandemic year The medical professionals pointed out that the pay revision that should have come into effect in 2016 had been delayed till 2020. They pointed out that the government had lavished pay revision and related benefits to other categories of government servants, while doctors, who had worked hard throughout the pandemic year, were left in the lurch. The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association said the doctors would organise a mass protest in front of the Secretariat on March 17. They appealed to the government for a fair deal.

Ms. Mahima, daughter of Anantha Subba Reddy (brother of Anantapur Urban MLA Anantha Venkatarami Reddy), accompanied her uncle to the polling booth in Nehru School on the Court Road to cast her vote. Pursuing her higher studies in the U.S., Ms. Mahima said it was essential for every citizen to vote for ensuring the development of the city. “We will have the moral right to question the candidate whom we vote to the council,” Ms. Mahima said while showing the indelible mark on her finger. Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah exercised his franchise in Ward No.50. Rayadurg MLA Kapu Ramachandra Reddy and CPI(M) district secretary V. Rambhupal too cast their vote along with their family members. Balayya stands in queue, votes Actor-tuned-politician Nandamuri Balakrishna and his wife Vasundhara Devi stood in queue along with others and exercised their franchise at Hindupur. Since the polling booths of many people in Anantapur were not the same as they were in the 2019 elections, they had to depend on the website – https://sec.ap.gov.in/homepage.do – to locate their booths. But as the police and polling officials did not allow them to take their cell phones into the polling booth, they found it difficult to log into the website. When the issue was brought to the notice of District Election Authority Gandham Chandrudu, he permitted the people to carry their cell phones in ‘switch off’ mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mlas-relative-comes-all-the-way-from-the-us-to-vote/article34041545.ece

Inaugurating the International Women’s Day Celebrations, jointly organized by the Rural Organisation for Poverty Eradication Services (ROPES) and Canadian INGO Children Believe, at the ZP High School at Bangarupalem mandal headquarters, Mr. Karuna Kumar said those fighting the social evils of child marriages and gender inequality at the field level should create awareness campaigns among the impoverished families to give top priority to educate the girl children. Voluntary organizations and Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) could revolutionize the rural education scenario with concerted efforts, he said. Later, the organizers distributed prizes and participation certificates to the girl students from 42 villages who took part in various competitions on the theme of “Women Empowerment”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gender-inequality-more-in-rural-areas/article34041532.ece

Roja has said. “In spite of their betrayal, the people of Nagari had voted me to power twice. I shall bring this menace to the notice of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy soon, and I hope to set things right,” Ms. Roja said while addressing the media after casting her vote in the municipal elections at Nagari on Wednesday. Ms. Roja said it was unfortunate that the “backstabbers” had fielded rebel candidates to work for the defeat of the YSRCP in several wards in Nagari and Puttur. “The backstabbers have even canvassed for the TDP candidates to spoil the chances of the YSRCP. But I am confident that the YSRCP will sweep the polls in Nagari and Puttur,” Ms. Roja said. Meanwhile, the comments have created a flutter in party circles.

Mr. Swamy told mediapersons at the Chief Minister’s Camp Office on Wednesday that he had also opposed privatisation of Air India. Earlier, Mr. Swamy was hosted by Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy for lunch. TTD Chairman Y.V Subba Reddy was also present. “Why do you want to disinvest the steel plant, and you can’t go on privatising. We are not selling family silver and you must have a good reason to disinvest. I am in favour of market reforms, but in poor States, the State should come forward to help them out,” Mr. Swamy said. He said that Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy would soon go to New Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. TTD accounts Mr. Swamy said the Andhra Pradesh government, in an unprecedented decision, had taken a decision to get the accounts of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, and thanked the Chief Minister for taking a bold decision. He said that the former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had never submitted the accounts to the courts even when petitions were filed over auditing of the TTD accounts. “We are filing it as a consent order between me and Chief Minister and it has to be converted through a court order. I have two prayers — give Tirupati to the bhakthas to run it, you can talk to Hindu Mahasabha , Sankaracharya or you can a call for a conference and that is a longer process,’’ Mr. Swamy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/swamy-opposes-decision-to-disinvest-vsp/article34041282.ece

Last week, the programme was initiated by Rajamahendravaram MP Margani Bharat and launched by Table Tennis player Naina Jaiswal and it was drawing the attention of students to improve green cover in the city. A few days ago, around 1,500 students of Rajamahendri Degree College joined the mission in the presence of Tridandi China Jeeyar Swamy and planted saplings with a commitment to protect them.  Green challenge “The mission is gaining momentum as thousands of students are realising the need of improving green cover in the city. Until now, the students and some academic institutions have joined it. A green challenge is open for people from other walks of public life in the city to be part of the mission,” said Mr. Bharat. “Those who plant saplings and raise them will share an emotional bond with the city forever as they could always cherish their small act in future. The mission also develops a bond between the city and the citizens,” observed Mr. Bharat, who appealed to the fellow public representatives to accept the ‘green challenge’ of planting saplings in their areas. Names and details of students or academic institutions will be displayed at the plants. The Rajamahendravaram Municipal Corporation supports the mission by providing water for the conservation of the saplings. “My fellow MPs have been briefed about the mission. In coming weeks, the mission will be intensified by throwing the challenge to plant a sapling in the city to people,” added Mr. Bharat. The civic body has identified the places and roads that are thrown open for planting the saplings as part of the mission in the city and public sector units such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation have extended their support for the mission as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/yuvatha-haritha-students-join-the-mission-and-plant-saplings/article34041596.ece

11 March 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP MP to take up the cudgels on behalf of TTD||Noted lawyer and BJP Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy is appearing on behalf of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in a defamation case to be filed against a Telugu daily for publishing “slanderous material” against the custodian of the famed Sri Venkateswara temple in Tirumala. Dr. Swamy was in the Tirupati City Civil Court on Wednesday, as his presence was required to sign the relevant documents, but it turned out to be a local holiday in view of the municipal elections. Known for championing the cause of Hindu temples and waging legal battles to restore their rights, Dr. Swamy accepted the TTD’s request to take up the issue on its behalf. The case pertained to an article published by the daily  in 2019 alleging the presence of “Christian content” in the TTD’s official website, which later turned out to be fake. The TTD had expressed objection and served a notice on the daily in the past for “hurting the religious sentiments” of millions of Hindu devotees across the globe. Addressing the media outside the court complex, Dr. Swamy accused the publication of having resorted to mudslinging owing to its close links with former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu. “Lord Venkateswara is our family God, and my mother used to be a regular visitor to Tirupati. Hence, I thought that such slanderous campaign should be stopped,” Dr. Swamy said. The legal battle includes a criminal case under Sections 153 and 295 of the IPC for creating enmity between communities and a civil case pertaining to publishing objectionable content. When asked about singling out a media house when several dailies and social media carried news of ‘Christianising’ the TTD, Dr. Swamy said the article in question was a direct assault on the institution. “I will not go by the content aired by the social media,” he said. ‘Why State control over temples?’ Calling himself a “Hindutva spokesperson,” Dr. Swamy wondered why should the State governments hold the reins of the temples when they actually had no control over churches and mosques. Dr. Swamy also referred to his recent legal battle against the party-led Uttarakhand government for taking over 53 temples, which included the famed Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/case-against-daily-swamy-to-appear-on-behalf-of-ttd/article34041002.ece

As part of its ‘Hindu Sanatana Dharma Prachara’ programme, the TTD started Sri Venkateswara Gosamrakshanasala in 1956 and began Goshala operations in 400 acres near Palamaner to develop indigenous breeds. Around 3,000 cattle including native breeds such as Gir, Sahiwal, Ongole, Kangeyam and Punganur are grown here. As part of the project, the TTD is using Embryo Derived Pregnancies (EDP) to improve the genetic potential of cattle. S.V. Goshala director K. Haranath Reddy said the EDP procedure has a gestation period of nine months and it takes three years for calves to turn into full-fledged cattle. “The motto is to protect and preserve breeds to meet the milk requirement,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-adopts-embryo-transfer-method-to-produce-milch-cattle/article34041562.ece

11 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Regular check-up can prevent kidney disease, says expert||Children are prone to glomerular diseases (glomerulus are filtering units of kidneys) which are an indication for early stage of kidney diseases, and the disease may be hereditary too. Kidney diseases in children can be identified early by screening urine and blood, particularly if they have pedal edema and facial puffiness. In Japan, kids are screened at regular intervals (before joining school) by nephrologists even if they have no symptoms, so that the disease can be detected at an early stage, said Dr. Ramesh Yelanati, consultant nephrologist and transplant physician at Ramesh Hospitals, Vijayawada. Kidney disease comes on silently, and by the time symptoms are noticed, it is often too late. Prompt treatment and awareness can save patients from permanent kidney failure, Dr. Ramesh said on Wednesday, adding that several awareness programmes have been arranged to mark World Kidney Day on March 11. As of today, serum creatinine is the only best available marker for kidney disease. However, a well performed urine analysis can detect kidney disease at a very early stage, even before any rise in serum creatinine, he said. Dr. Ramesh said that failure of kidneys will affect multiple organs and the organ systems, primarily the bone and heart, which will fail. In fact, many kidney patients die of heart-related ailments even before they reach the stage of dialysis. In India, chronic kidney disease was the eighth leading cause of death. The average life span of a patient on dialysis is 5-10 years with the best of facilities and care. But many of them die very early due to lack of proper treatment, donors, comorbidities and infections. Compared to the last ten years, kidney transplant programmes in India and in Andhra Pradesh have picked up and are going well, the nephrologist said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/regular-check-up-can-prevent-kidney-disease-says-expert/article34041661.ece
11 March 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Primary deficit a worrying factor||The primary deficit (PD) is apparently a cause of worry as it is phenomenally higher than the budget estimates (BE) for the financial year 2020-21. According to information, the PD has been on the higher side since June 2020. It was noticed that PD was Rs. 29,263 crore in June itself while the BE for the entire year was Rs. 27,912.39 crore. Since then, the PD has been on the rise and peaked at Rs. 61,741.68 crore in November, 2020. It was Rs. 55,129 crore in December, 2020 and Rs. 58,781 crore in January, 2021. The PD has remained more the BE throughout the year. Also, the actuals of primary deficit this fiscal have been much higher than all months in the last financial year. The PD to the BE is 210.59% in January. It is 184.72% in the corresponding period in 2019-20. Similarly, the PD to BE was 197.51% in December, 2020 (financial year 2020-21) and 164.47% in 2019-20 fiscal. Primary deficit is the difference between the fiscal deficit of the current year and the interest paid by the government on loans obtained in the past. What it indicates is that the government’s borrowings are utilised to pay the interest on loans rather than on capital expenditure. The rise in the primary deficit is not the sign of a healthy economy. It means the government is spending more on interest payments instead of creating wealth, sources say. When asked whether the rise in primary deficit was due to the payment of interest on the loans borrowed by the government, Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said, “The government did borrow the loans to continue the welfare schemes and help the poor and middle class.” Rising since bifurcation The primary deficit has been on the rise ever since the State’s bifurcation in 2014. The interest payments have increased phenomenally during the last five years. The PD was Rs. 12,014 crore in 2015-16 and it rose to Rs. 19,211.46 crore in 2016-17. It was Rs. 18,525 crore in 2017-18 and touched Rs. 20,098 crore in 2018-19. The revised estimate for the 2019-20 fiscal is Rs. 24,100 crore. The government estimated that the primary deficit will be Rs. 27,912 crore during the current fiscal. “Any borrowing or loan that does not lead to creation of assets, or reduction in liabilities, will not help the economy in the long run,” opines an official, who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/primary-deficit-a-worrying-factor/article34041554.ece

11 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Over 56% votes polled in city||The elections to the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), held on Wednesday, were peaceful with no untoward incident reported from any of the 98 wards, under eight different zones. A total of 8,13,071 voters exercised their franchise, recording 56.01% polling. The total number of voters are 17,26,158. The polling, which began on a dull note with less than 10% voting in the first two hours, picked up gradually. The polling process began sharp at 7 a.m. and in some of the polling stations, senior citizens were the first to reach. Though the polling was dull in many of the wards, some areas such Appughar and Peda Jalaripeta, witnessed long queues by 8 a.m. With the issue of privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant raging, all polling stations around Gajuwaka and the VSP were notified as sensitive and hyper sensitive. In defiance of the Centre’s proposal for 100% strategic sale of the VSP, employees of the plant dropped an extra slip of paper with the slogan ‘Save VSP’ into ballot boxes. District Collector V. Vinay Chand later in a statement urged the voters not to do so, as it was illegal. In general, polling has been peaceful across all the 98 wards in the GVMC and in the 22 wards in Yelamanchali and 28 in Narsipatnam municipalities. The district authorities took COVID-19 precautions. However, social distancing norms were not practised at most of the polling stations. The sprawling campus of the Gajuwaka High School had a number of polling booths but the voters were distributed and hence there was not much crowding. While many of the voters wore masks, some of them, including senior citizens, seemed oblivious to the COVID-19 threat as they moved around the campus without masks. The authorities, however, arranged thermal scanning and sanitisation at all the booths. An ASHA worker said that they have not recorded above normal temperature so far (till around 11.30 a.m.) but did not rule out higher temperatures as the voters in queue were standing in the open with no protection and temperature would rise by noon. Though the Gajuwaka High School campus had lot of open space inside, the roads leading to the school from the Gajuwaka Main Road and the National Highway, on the other side, were narrow. People were seen gathering in groups outside the school campus though 144 Section was in force .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/over-56-votes-polled-in-city/article34041672.ece

11 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Youth enthusiastically cast vote||Despite the overall turnout for voting being moderate, a number of youth came forward to cast their ballot for the first time in the urban local body elections here. Many polling stations saw the youth actively coming to vote since the first hour, taking selfies and uploading them in social media. The first time voters expressed that selecting a candidate was easy in ULB elections compared to Assembly polls. While a few have selected candidates based on their party affiliation, there were many who took the decision based on the work done by the local leaders. “I learnt that the last municipal election was held in 2007, when I was nine-year-old. Now, given the opportunity, I did not want to miss voting this time which could help in developing our smart city. I think I had chosen the right candidate for our locality,” said K. Sirisha, who cast her vote in China Waltair. IT professionals Many IT professionals, who are in the city after being given the option of working from home due to COVID -19, had come to vote too. K. Jaya Kishore, a resident of Akkayyapalem, who had returned from Australia after COVID-19, exercised his franchise in the election at Ward No 41. He said that this was the first time he had taken part in voting for municipal elections and had also experienced how ballot voting would be. “Municipal polls are completely different from Assembly elections. I have gone by the candidate, not by the party. We have close interaction with all the candidates, so deciding a candidate here is easy. We know who can be available for us round the clock, who can help us if there is civic issue in our colony and who will respond immediately if we need some help from the administration,” he said. Kadambala Harish, a resident of Kancharapalem, who works in an IT firm from Bengaluru, said that he had missed taking part in Assembly elections in the year 2019 due to strict work schedule.

Describing the statements of Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Singh Thakur as ‘threats’, party district committee secretary K. Lokanadham said, in a statement here on Wednesday, that the threats had ruffled the feathers of Telugus. He called upon all political parties to condemn the adamant attitude of the Centre. The move of the Union government to privatise PSUs and hand them over to corporates should be condemned by one and all, Mr. Lokanadham said. The YES Bank, a private bank, which was in losses, was nationalised and now the public sector VSP was being privatised though it has assets to the tune of Rs. 2 lakh crore, the CPI(M) leader said. He warned that people would teach a lesson to the BJP leaders from the State, if they do not resign from their posts and join the agitation. The Centre had invested only Rs. 4,890 crore in the VSP but the plant has contributed Rs. 44,000 crore in the form of dividends to the Centre, so far, he said. The plant has 22,000 acres of land and modern equipment besides sea and rail connectivity, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpim-sees-red-over-anurag-thakurs-statement-on-steel-plant/article34041668.ece

11 March 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Voting percentage drops in Vizianagaram||As anticipated by political parties, voting percentage in the elections to the Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation was considerably lower than that recorded in other municipalities that went to the polls in the district on Wednesday. Delay in distribution of voters’ slips, confusion over identification of polling booths and divisions are being cited as the reasons behind the low turnout of 64.50% in Vizianagaram. However, nearby Nellimarla nagar panchayat witnessed a strong turnout at 79.68% followed by Bobbili with 74.64% and Salur municipality with 72.75%. Parvatipuram, the second biggest town in Vizianagaram district, registered 74.43% turnout. Lok Satta Party State executive president Bhisetti Babji sought action against officials alleging that they failed to ensure voting rights for all the people who had enrolled in the voters’ list. “Many voters were disappointed and were forced to return to their homes without being able to exercising their voting right. The administration has completely ignored its responsibility to distribute slips indicating the street and booth numbers which are essential for uneducated persons to help them find their polling centres without any hindrance,” he said. TDP activists led by the party’s minority wing leader Shaik Khadha Basha staged a protest in Kataveedhi over alleged rigging in 11th and 12th wards. Alleging ‘rigging’ of votes done, Mr. Basha said many genuine voters’ returned without exercising their voting right due to confusion in identification of polling booths and called for an inquiry. The district administration heaved a sigh of relief with the completion of polling peacefully barring a few incidents and agitations. The election was peaceful in almost all 70 sensitive and 47 sensitive areas in Vizianagaram city. Vizianagaram Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal, election observer Kantilal Dande and Vizianagaram Superintendent of Police B. Rajakumari monitored the election process.

Godavari stare at drinking water crisis||Around 23% of the habitations in East Godavari district, most of them in the Godavari delta, are staring at drinking water problem this summer. Statistics available with the Rural Water Supply Department suggest that 796 habitations of the total 3,467 in the district are likely to face scarcity of drinking water from mid-May. These habitations mostly depend on the groundwater which they fetch from borewells. The mandal-level committees have already completed a field survey to identify the available surface and groundwater sources and the maintenance status of the summer storage tanks. The irrigation authorities have decided to stop releasing water through the canals by March-end to facilitate the Polavaram project works. Further, the water level in the Godavari river also depletes in the summer months. The authorities have to fill up the summer storage tanks by March-end to ensure supply drinking water for the rest of the summer. “It has been estimated that 796 habitations in the district would be facing paucity of drinking water by May-end. Nearly 80% of these habitations are in the Godavari delta. A proposal seeking Rs. 12 crore grant for the implementation of summer action plan for drinking water supply has been submitted to the government,” Rural Water Supply Superintendent Engineer T. Gayatri Devi told The Hindu.  At a review meeting held recently under the chairmanship of East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy, the district authorities have decided to transport drinking water to the needy habitations by vehicles. “We are well prepared to transport drinking water to the needy habitations including those in accessible tribal pockets in the district. In total, 815 borewells have been identified for cleaning as the water has turned muddy owing to the depletion of groundwater level,” said Ms. Gayatri Devi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/23-habitations-in-e-godavari-stare-at-drinking-water-crisis/article34041559.ece

11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC issues notices to Siddipet Collector||Telangana High Court on Wednesday instructed Siddipet district Collector and other Revenue officials concerned to file detailed counter affidavits in a writ appeal over some persons “voluntarily relinquishing rights over lands assigned to them by State government”. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, passing the direction, issued notices to Gajwel Revenue Divisional Officer and Kondapaka Tahsildar along with Siddipet district Collector. The notices were issued in a writ appeal filed by four farmers of Duddeda village of Kondapaka mandal in Siddipet district. They challenged a single judge order dismissing their writ petition in which they questioned the alleged action of government taking over their assigned lands and allotting the same to one Yapral Narsimha Reddy and others. According to them, the government took over their lands and allotted them to Mr. Reddy and others on whose lands the government had constructed double bedroom houses for the poor. The farmers moved the HC stating that the authorities were interfering with the possession of their lands and sought an order restraining them from doing so. After hearing contentions of the counsels of the petitioners and the government, the single judgement dismissed the petition. He held that the officials followed due procedure in resuming the lands of the farmers. The action of the authorities did not suffer from any illegality, infirmity or irregularity, the single judge said. In the writ appeal, the petitioners’ counsel argued that lands of the farmers were taken over without issuing any notices to them and hence it was illegal. When the bench sought to know to whom the lands of the petitioners were allotted, the government counsel replied the petitioners voluntarily relinquished the lands which were eventually exchanged for lands where double bedroom houses were constructed. The bench wondered how the poor farmers voluntarily gave up rights over their assigned lands. Chief Justice Hima Kohli wanted to know if the government paid any compensation to the farmers whose lands were acquired. Were they provided any alternative lands, the bench asked the government counsel. The matter was posted to June 3 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-issues-notices-to-siddipet-collector/article34041312.ece

Teams constituted by GHMC to take the ballot to voters, who are incapacitated to come to the polling stations to cast their vote in the upcoming elections for Mahabubnagar-RangaReddy-Hyderabad Graduates’ constituency, do not as much care to wear masks, let alone carry sanitisers with them. The process, which had begun two days ago, is continuing in the city without any precautions being observed. Postal ballot As per the directions of the Election Commission, the ballot at doorstep, referred in official release as ‘postal ballot’, is being offered to the disabled, geriatric voters above 80 years of age, and COVID patients. The geriatric and physically challenged patients are being covered for the past two days, with COVID-19 positive patients left till the last so that the last of them is covered. Ballot boxes deployed for the task are being checked and sealed at GHMC circle offices in the presence of political party representatives, after which they are being accompanied by teams headed by higher officials to the voter’s residence. As on Wednesday, a total of 179 such voters have been registered in the city to avail the facility of ballot at doorstep, informed officials. As the number of COVID-19 patients adds up, the number could dynamically be updated. As the teams were set to visit vulnerable people, including senior citizens over 80 years of age, and the disabled, the staff should have been ideally provided with PPE gear and sanitisers. During the thick of the COVID pandemic, PPE kits were provided for all employees coming in direct contact with COVID patients, and also those covering the containment zones for disinfection. However, on the current election duty, several team members visiting homes with ballot boxes are not even wearing basic protective gear such as masks or gloves. When inquired, officials informed that no such instructions have been issued nor PPE suits supplied. While visits to COVID-19 patients are due from Thursday, three days ahead of the actual polling day, the staff are left to their own means to avoid contracting the dreaded infection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/polling-officials-visiting-houses-sans-covid-protective-gear/article34041294.ece

The conclusion of this programme will be a pitch day, followed by graduation. Through the partnership, entrepreneurs can minimise financial risks, get assistance in the selling of pilot products and risk mitigation. The programme has already received 549 applications from across 14 cities around the country. “Three years ago, on the same platform, we have taken that first step in the country to establish a dedicated incubator to foster women entrepreneurship. Today, I am proud to say that WE Hub has emerged as the role model in India to enable women entrepreneurs and has increased participation of women in the workforce. Hoping this partnership with the Australian High Commission goes a long way and benefits women and girls in STEM,” said Mr. Rama Rao.

11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP questions CM’s silence on Bhainsa violence||TS BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar questioned the silence of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the recent Bhainsa incidents and the failure of the government to prevent the recurrent communal violence there. The police too were playing a partisan role, he said, adding that he would tour the six places in the area which witnessed violence. “How did the perpetrators get weapons? There is total collapse of law and order there,” he claimed on Wednesday. Later, participating in a campaign in support of party candidates for MLC elections, Mr. Sanjay Kumar said the TRS government would collapse after the polls. The BJP leader appealed to employees not to get swayed by the “leaks” about high salary hikes, more than what had been proposed by the PRC. He questioned the “sudden love” of Mr. Rao for former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in nominating his daughter against senior lawyer N. Ramchander Rao. At a separate meeting at Ibrahimpatnam and Maheshwaram, BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh accused the Chief Minister of deceiving people in the name of ‘Bangaru Telangana’ by indulging in large-scale corruption and promoting nepotism.  DGP petitioned In a memorandum submitted to Director General of Police (DGP) M. Mahender Reddy on Wednesday, a copy of which was released to the media, a BJP delegation including MPs D. Arvind and S. Babu Rao, senior leaders T. Raja Singh, Ch.

11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Fortified food to be served at anganwadis, govt. hostels||Children in anganwadi centres and government hostels across Telangana would soon be provided fortified food. Besides, the State’s Food Safety Division is coordinating with Civil Supplies department to fortify PDS rice which is distributed to the less privileged. This announcement was made by K Shankar, director, office of the Commissioner of Food Safety, at a press conference here on Wednesday. Fortified food is one that is enriched with nutrients like vitamins or minerals that do not naturally occur in the food. Providing it to children would help improve their health. FSSAI move Senior officials of the Food Safety Division said the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) would soon announce an Act making it mandatory for manufacturers to fortify staple food products such as milk, oil, rice and wheat. Before it is implemented, the officials have taken on the task of explaining the process to food manufacturers and the negligible cost involved. Staff of the Food Safety Division are also being trained in the fortfication process. Long-term effects Gururaj Patil, team lead of Fortification at Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), said a deficiency of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) has consequences on society, and that physical and mental growth of children are affected. “If they are not able to learn well, their education will be affected. As adults, their employability goes down. Health-related complications aggravate which means a lot of spending, and that’s how a vicious cycle is created,” Mr Gururaj said, adding that it is imperative for a ‘young’ nation to be healthy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fortified-food-to-be-served-at-anganwadis-govt-hostels/article34041285.ece
11 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Leave agri reforms to states, says ex-RBI governor||Former Reserve Bank of India governor C. Rangarajan has opined that the agricultural marketing reforms initiated by the Central government should be left to each state to decide whether they want the measures. This is the best course of action for the Centre and that will set the stage for experimental economics, while farmers themselves will be able to see the best possible course of action with respect to agricultural marketing reforms, he argued. He expressed this view while speaking at the 10th convocation of the ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE). Mr. Rangarajan said the Indian economy has to grow at 8.7% in 2021-22 year if the decline in previous year was to be compensated while adding that even in that case economy will reach where it was in 2019-20. “The recent Budget has projected the growth rate for 2021-22 at 10.5%. It sounds a little optimistic. We as a nation really need to organise ourselves to get back to the high growth path as early as possible,” he asserted. 2070 degrees awarded The convocation saw 2,070 students receiving their degrees, including two who were conferred Ph.D degrees. Among them, 1,181 students were awarded MBA degrees; 4 LLM, 84 BBA-LLB (Hons), 141 B. Tech and 574 BBA degrees apart from 84 students receiving their MMS degree. IFHE Vice-Chancellor J. Mahender Reddy said the university plans to start an online MBA programme. Medals were awarded to students for academic and all-round excellence. Aditya Bhat received the gold medal while Arabaze Ali bagged the silver medal for academic excellence in MBA programme. The NJ Yasaswy-Apollo Hospitals Best Student Award went to Rajyashree Kanodia of BBA while second prize went to Mayur Bhargava of BBA, Class of 2020.

11 March 2021||HYDERABAD:,TELANGANA||STPP to commence generation in Jan. next||The first phase of 2×800 MW Telangana Super Thermal Power Project (TSTPP) of NTPC coming up at its existing 2,600 MW Ramagundam plant location is nearing completion and the first unit is set to be commissioned in January next followed by the second unit two months later. This was stated here on Wednesday by Regional Executive Director (South) of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) C.V. Anand. Although it was supposed to have been commissioned by now, the Covid-19 pandemic had affected the work during the lockdown period and a few months later too. However, after re-mobilisation of labour, which was not available during the lockdown, the work was going on in full swing with next January and March schedules in place. “We have plans to commission the first unit of the Rs. 10,600 crore project by January 2022 and the second unit two months later”, Mr. Anand said adding that the project was coming up along with FGD system as it was norm now. Existing arrangement As per the existing arrangement, 85% of the power generated at the project would go to Telangana and 15% unallocated to other southern States. However, Telangana had been requesting for allocation of 100% power generated at the project and it was pursuing the matter with the Centre, Mr. Anand stated. Replying to a question on the fate of second-phase of Telangana Super Thermal Power Project of 3×800 MW capacity, he made it clear that it was not abandoned but was not given clearance yet by the corporate office. “Work on it would go on steam as and when the clearance is given since everything is in place”, he noted. On the payment of bills by distribution companies (Discoms) including those of Telangana, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) executive said it was a dynamic and continuous process and there were no outstanding dues as of now as the utilities had been clearing the bills as per schedule one way or the other including with the help of PFC or REC loans and bill discount method. Mr. Anand said the NTPC was alert against cyber attacks with malware with continuous checks and no plant was affected so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/stpp-to-commence-generation-in-jan-next/article34041302.ece

11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Act against guilty in Bhainsa violence’||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party has demanded strict and stringent action against the culprits responsible for violence in Bhainsa on (March 7 Sunday). It also called for a high-level police enquiry into the series of communal incidents to identify the habitual culprits inciting riot incidents and to open rowdy-sheets against them. In a memorandum submitted to Director General of Police (DGP) M. Mahender Reddy on Wednesday, a copy of which was released to the media, the BJP delegation including MPs D. Arvind, S. Babu Rao; senior leaders T. Raja Singh, Ch. Ramachandra Reddy, Vivek Venkatswamy, NVSS Prabhakar, P.Rama Devi and others, urged him to post permanent police pickets at the incident-prone areas. Beefing up intelligence network to identify anti-national elements and to pre-empt such incidents and withdrawing of false cases foisted against the youth, were the other demands raised by them. “It is a systematic violence being perpetrated by a combination of radical elements and communal fanatics in Bhainsa (Nirmal district) which has had a history of sporadic violence. It is evident that cleverly crafted conspiracies of forces inimical to the idea of India are behind the violence,” they claimed, in the note. Last Sunday evening many houses and shops were set on fire and many people had received severe stab-injuries too with the condition of at least two people undergoing treatment in Hyderabad reportedly being critical. The party charged the government with “failure to safeguard the law and order” with local administration turning a “blind eye to the communal elements present in the area”. The police too have been found wanting due to “political interference” and warned that “laxity towards communal violence would prove dangerous to the communal harmony besides giving a fillip to the anti-national elements waiting for an opportunity to foment trouble and tear up the fabric of the nation, the memorandum added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/act-against-guilty-in-bhainsa-violence/article34041617.ece

Hyderabad is the home for premier scientific research institutions of the country. Several world renowned academic and research institutes and universities are based in Hyderabad, thus creating a vast pool of talent. Hyderabad is a also a hub of quality education, innovation and has one of the highest growth rates in the country. Chief Postmaster General, Telangana Circle, S Rajendra Kumar, released the post cards in the presence of the heads of these scientific institutions. Picture Post Cards of National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB), National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), National Academy of Agricultural Research Management (NAARM), National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research.

11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||UoH-incubated startup awarded for 3D models to study diseases||ReaGene Biosciences Pvt. Ltd., a startup company of ASPIRE-BioNEST incubator at the University of Hyderabad (UoH) was identified as an emerging startup by an independent jury panel of ChemTech-Biopharma conference 2021 in recognition of the unique 3D models focused on the discovery of new products for high value unmet diseases such as sepsis and COVID-19 on Wednesday. With most preclinical research conducted in animals for both efficacy and toxicity, clinical outcomes are not the best. Hence, there is a need for better translational models to improve clinical translation and decrease clinical attrition rates. In-vitro human single-cell static models in use currently do not mimic human physiology, cell-cell and organ-organ communications which play an important role in drug efficacy and toxicity in humans. ReaGene’s mission is to build proprietary ‘Humanised 3D’ proprietary tools containing multiple cell types of different organs to allow communications of different cell types and organs. These models represent closest to human condition recapitulating human physiology to measure efficacy and toxicity simultaneously and make informed decisions on clinical liabilities before moving drugs into clinical trials. These models are much superior to organoids and spheroids to mimic human physiology and communications, said an official release. Founders of ReaGene Biosciences, Uday Saxena, an alumnus of UoH and Subrahmanyam Vangala expressed their happiness at the recognition and are hopeful that these proprietary disruptive 3D bio printing platforms will revolutionise drug discovery research. Both have nearly 30 years of experience in big pharma companies for drug discovery and drug development research. The firm has collaborations with Tech Mahindra, Issar Pharma, ProdigY on Sepsis and COVID projects using human vascular 3D lung model. UoH-BioNEST is managed by ASPIRE (Association for Scientific Pursuits for Innovative Research Enterprises), a not-for-profit organisation managing incubation and innovation activities in the campus, the release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uoh-startup-awarded-for-3d-models-to-study-diseases/article34041289.ece
11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ask for food with +F logo||Having three meals a day does not make one healthy unless the food has the required micronutrients. That the lack of various vitamins and minerals in food can lead to a serious nutrition deficiency was emphasised at a press meet organised by the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT) and Global Alliance for Nutrition Promotion (GAIN), in collaboration with the Food Safety Division of Telangana. People were urged to buy food products with ‘+F’ symbol on it, meaning that the food is fortified. Regardless of an individual’s economic background, people can suffer from nutrition deficiency simply due to their choice of food, speakers at the event said.  Nutrition imbalance Officials of KHPT said rice and wheat constitute a major portion of an Indian’s diet and other categories of food such as fruits, legumes, dairy products and vegetables are consumed in less quantity, leading to deficiency. Apart from traditional choice of food, lack of economic resources too play a role in food selection. A micronutrient deficiency can severely impact one’s quality of life, they said. For example, Vitamin B12 deficiency can have multiple effects such as fatigue and mood swings. According to World Health Organisation, deficiency of iron in children under two years of age can have significant and irreversible effects on brain development.  Rampant anemia According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) data, 70% of children in Telangana aged 6-59 months are anaemic, and 53.2% of pregnant women aged 15-49 years are anaemic. Since both behavioural changes and money are required for an individual to have food from the five groups, Gururaj Patil, team lead of Fortification at KHPT, said fortifying a food product is a viable and affordable option. K. Shankar, director, office of the Commissioner of Food Safety, said food products which are fortified will be stamped with the ‘+F’ symbol. T. Vijay Kumar, deputy Food Controller, said seven milk brands and four oil brands have fortified the products currently. The Food Safety and Security Authority of India (FSSAI) is expected to soon make it mandatory for many more food products to be fortified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ask-for-food-with-f-logo/article34041284.ece
11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Nature provides valuable sanitation services, says study||Should disposal of human waste be allowed into nature or modern engineering solutions of waste water treatment plant? A global multi-city study claims ‘Nature’ can (and does) take the role of sanitation infrastructure and strengthening natural sanitation ecosystem services may be more cost effective than equivalent investments in engineered sanitation infrastructure. “While we are not marginalizing the vital role of engineered infrastructures, we believe a better understanding of how the engineered and natural infrastructures interact is a promising topic for further research and may allow adaptive design and management, reducing costs, and improving effectiveness and sustainability,” said researchers after studying disposal systems in 48 cities across the globe. Prajna Paramita Mishra and Kongala Venkatesh of University of Hyderabad’s School of Economics, Simon Willcock and Indunee Welivita from the School of Natural Sciences, Bangor University, Alison Parker, Charlotte Wilson, Tim Brewer, Sarah Cooper, Dolores Rey and Paul Hutchings of the School of Water, Energy and Environment, Cranfield University, Dilshaad Bundhoo and Kenneth Lynch, School of Natural and Social Sciences, University of Gloucestershire, Sneha Mekala of Fresh Water Action Network South Asia, Hyderabad, were part of the research team whose report was published in the Journal — One Earth.  One billion people or 14% of the global population used toilets where the waste matter is disposed in situ and a further two billion people (>25% of the global population) did not have access to basic sanitation facilities with 673 million of these defecating in the open. While some of this waste may present a danger to local populations, it is likely natural processes contribute to reducing this risk. However, nature’s role in sanitation is poorly understood and difficult to quantify due to data deficiency and hence likely “under-appreciated” is their contention. About 711 million people have sewer connections that do not connect to waste water treatment plants with majority of them living in urban areas. Those connected to waste water treatment plants do not provide effective treatment or comply with effluent requirements, so at least some waste water ends up in water courses. Here too, nature may fill a gap by transporting the high-risk sewage away from human populations, acting as a conduit for untreated sewage into wetlands or the sea, which then further dilutes and treats the waste, the report said. It is important to understand impact of human waste on pollution-carrying capacity of various ecosystems and ensure they are not overloaded like, for example, pit latrines safely manage human waste in rural areas yet, may not be safe in urban areas. It also needs to be looked at what population density can nature no longer be relied upon to safely treat all the human waste produced like what quantities of human waste per unit area can mangrove, natural wetland, and marine environments safely treat. And, at what levels does the human waste risk damaging the natural environment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nature-provides-valuable-sanitation-services-study/article34041291.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao opened the Pragati Bhavan doors to employees in view of the MLC elections and they would close again after the elections. Questioning the Chief Minister's meeting with employee unions when the election code was on, he demanded action against the CM. "What is the idea behind leaking that 29% fitment would be given once the elections are over," he asked and said employees would be ditched once again. He said the KCR government was the only one in the country that has not given interim relief to employees despite the Pay Revision Commission (PRC) scheduled submission time was over. If Srinivas Goud gets Ministry it doesn't mean that justice is done to all the employees, he said and asked Mr. Goud to work for the betterment of the employees. Further attacking the CM, he said in the combined Andhra Pradesh there were just 20% vacancies in the government sectot while it had increased to 40% negating the very fight of the youngsters for better employment opportunities. He said the TSPSC, which had to fill the vacancies, was vacant itself showcasing the government's intentions. He said KCR had given MLC ticket to people who won corporate institutions. Mr. Reddy said it was shameful that KCR was using the picture of late Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao whom he had unfairly targeted during the Telangana agitation as an integrationist. "How can you seek votes in his name now?"||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pragati-bhavan-open-to-staff-for-elections-only/article34041308.ece

Both Left parties organised a huge bike rally in the town on Wednesday afternoon to muster support for CPI candidate Mr Jayasaradhi Reddy. Addressing a meeting, CPI (M) State secretary Tammineni Veerabhadram said the presence of the Left parties in legislative bodies would help articulate the voices of graduates and raise concerns of farmers, working class and common man. It is imperative to send the Left parties’ candidate Jayasaradhi Reddy to the Legislative Council to highlight the issues of graduates, he said. CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy alleged that the TRS was harping on "regional sentiments" and the BJP was pursuing "divisive agenda" to win the MLC elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/left-parties-hold-bike-rally-in-khammam/article34041310.ece

11 March 2021||MOGILICHERUVU TANDA,TELANGANA||Compensation ‘reduced’ for Mogilicheruvu tanda oustees||Banothu Raju is a resident of Mogilicheruvu tanda located in Toguta mandal. This tanda is going to get submerged in Mallannasagar, of which construction is nearing completion. The either side of the road that leads to the tanda is already dug up and is full of water. Last week, the residents of this village had frequent visitors – revenue and police, the latter in large numbers. The revenue officials asked them to vacate the tanda stating that all money due to them from the government will be handed over to them the moment they are shifted to the Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) colony. The officials even showed them the cheques drawn on their name. The amount of the cheques surprised and shocked many inhabitants of the tanda. “In the past I was issued a cheque of Rs. 10,14,481 for my house on June 13, 2019. This time it is Rs. 7 lakh plus. We were not allowed to take any photo of the cheque issued on our name. I do not know the reason. How on earth rates were reduced in two years that too when the government officials fixed a rate in the past deserves to be answered, said Mr. Raju. He said his cheque bounced in the bank for the reasons best to known to the officials. The case of Banothu Laxmi, Lambadi Bhaskar and several others is no different. Fir instance Banothu Laxmi was issued a cheque for Rs. 18,91,777 on June 13, 2019 while Lambadi Bhaskar was given a cheque for Rs. 18,91,777 on the same day. However they didn’t accept the cheques stating that the amount offered to them is less. When villagers questioned the officials, they were informed that they would not get more amount than what the government is government is offering - and that it’s final. “The cheque payment in the past was stopped as the payment was much higher than what actually it was supposed to be. Mistakenly these numbers were mentioned on cheques in the past and that’s the reason for stopping payment. Now we are reissuing cheques with right payment,” said a revenue officer on condition of anonymity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/compensation-reduced-for-mogilicheruvu-tanda-oustees/article34041621.ece
11 March 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||‘Take on leaders for pledging your rightful causes to KCR’||Pradesh Congress Committee president and Member of Parliament from Nalgonda, N. Uttam Kumar Reddy on Wednesday appealed to employees to take on their association and union representatives “for pledging employees’ rightful causes to KCR.” “Instead of mounting pressure on the government for a new PRC and fitment of not less than 43%, they have bartered employees’ vote support for certain benefits. Your union leaders are acting like TRS leaders, while treating you as slaves, dump them and re-elect your bodies,” he told a hall full of employees in Nalgonda. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy took objection to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao reportedly holding discreet talks with employee unions, with just days left for the MLC Graduates’ poll. He said the talks did not hold any validity, as they were held behind the camera, and also Mr. Rao acted as president of TRS and not as Chief Minister. The TPCC chief, joined by Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, senior leader V. Hanumantha Rao and party’s Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda MLC contestant S. Ramulu Naik, described IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s appeals for votes of private teachers as “shameless, when thousands of them were out of jobs during COVID-19.” Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy, addressing a meet by the Federation of Telangana and AP Minority Educational Institutions, alleged that the TRS government had stifled minority educational institutions. ‘A gimmick’ Speaking to reporters at Wyra, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka termed the TRS government’s reported assurance to the State government employees’ unions to ensure ‘higher fitment’ soon as a gimmick. Referring to Tuesday’s reported meeting of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao with leaders of the employees’ unions, the CLP leader said similar promises were made before the 2018 general elections. Meanwhile, Mr Vikramarka’s cycle yatra intended to highlight the woes of people hard hit by soaring prices entered its fourth day on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/take-on-leaders-for-pledging-your-causes/article34041309.ece

The aggrieved employees, working as seniors inspectors, inspectors and assistant inspectors at Sunbeam Lightweighting Solutions Private Limited, have allegedly been denied pay and other benefits at par with the regular workers of the company. Mukesh Sharma, president of Sunbeam Lighweighting Solutions Workers Unions, told The Hindu that the salaries and other benefits of the regular workers were increased twice over the past five years as per the agreements reached with the management in 2015 and 2018, but the same benefits and salary hike were denied to these 160-odd employees.  “The job profile of these 160-odd employees is the same as other regular workers. We have raised the matter with the management on several occasions, but to no avail. The management argues that the employees don’t fall in the category of the workers, but are the staff members,” said Mr. Sharma. The workers’ unions also made a complaint to the Labour Department in this regard in 2019, and the Assistant Labour Commissioner, Circle-4, Gurugram in his report on October 9 last year said that these employees fell within the definition of the “workers” and were entitled to the benefits as per the agreements. The unions’ advocate Monu Kuhar said that these employees were all set to move labour court seeking relief, but it was delayed since the judge retired and no new appointment was made. The company’s human resource vice-president Gunjan Tiwari did not respond to repeated calls and messages to seek his response in this matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/gurugram-employees-up-in-arms-for-pay-parity/article34041192.ece
11 March 2021||Ghaziabad,||U.P. panchayat bans half pants for boys and jeans for girls||At a panchayat called by Bhartiya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan in Charthawal area of Muzaffarnagar, its national president Thakur Pooran Singh said boys should refrain from wearing half pants and girls should not wear jeans in villages. “If they do not follow this order, they could be punished socially,” he said, while addressing the meeting at Peepalshah village on Tuesday. As the news spread, Mr. Singh said his intention was to preserve the village culture. “We have no problem with girls wearing jeans when they are on job in cities but when they come to their village, they should follow the rural tradition and not bring the western influence to the village,” said Mr. Singh, who is also the face of the Thakur community in the region. He told The Hindu that he was all for girl education and girls working in sectors where they are required to wear western outfits. “Our girls work in the police. They also go to schools where they wear skirts as part of the uniform. My only concern is that at home we should celebrate our traditional wear,” Mr. Singh said.  ‘Only counselling’ Agreeing that crime against women had nothing to do with what they wear, he said by the punishment he only meant counselling of such families who didn’t follow the panchayat’s advice. Mr. Singh took on the media that it didn’t highlight that he also appealed at the same meeting that during the panchayat elections people should not vote for candidates who seek their vote by distributing free liquor. Mr. Singh, who led a march against the BJP government’s agriculture policies in the past, is also keen on farmers and the government returning to the table to sort out the issue on the contentious farm laws. “It is fine if the government amends the laws as long as it comes up with a law guaranteeing the MSP,” he said.

The board, under the Social Welfare Department, has also advised a meeting for addressing a few issues, including the possibility of transgender voters being turned away for mismatch of photo in the voter identity card and present appearance. According to the data provided by the State election office, 442 out of a total of 2,31,86,362 voters in the State are transgender or third gender. “…we haven’t seen any concrete steps being taken towards the transgender community… the most vulnerable and marginalised community, always neglected and side-lined by the authorities,” said Swati Bidhan Baruah, the board’s associated vice-chairperson and the first transgender lawyer in the Northeast, wrote in the letter to Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Nitin K.S. Khade on March 8. ‘Taunting, bullying’ Ms. Baruah said members of the transgender community faced issues such as taunting and bullying when they went to cast their votes, justifying the board’s demand for a separate line for transgenders at the voting centres.

11 March 2021||Guwahati,||Call to protect people from second-hand smoke||Doctors, cancer victims and restaurateurs in Assam have asked the Centre to amend the COTPA 2003 for removing designated smoking rooms in hotels, restaurants and airports to protect people from second-hand smoke. COTPA expands to Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. The doctors, cancer victims and restaurateurs made the appeal at a function in Guwahati to mark World No Smoking Day on Wednesday. Appreciating the government for initiating the process to amend COTPA 2003, they sought immediate removal of a current provision that permits smoking areas to make India 100% smoking-free and check the spread of COVID-19 infection in the country.  ‘Risk of infection’ “There is growing evidence that smoking is a risk for COVID-19 infection. Smoking worsens lung function and reduces immunity. Smokers who develop COVID-19 infection have more complications and greater risk of fatality,” Munindra Narayan Barua, managing director of North East Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, said. “All designated smoking areas in hotels and restaurants and even airports should be abolished to ensure a 100% smoke-free environment. Most of these designated smoking areas rarely comply with COTPA requirements and are actually putting our public at great health risk from exposure to second-hand smoke,” he added. Section 4 of the COTPA 2003 prohibits smoking in any place to which the public has access. But the Act allows smoking in designated smoking areas of certain public places such as restaurants, hotels and airports. Anti-tobacco activists said exposure to passive smoking happens in hotels, restaurants, bars, pubs and clubs, risking the lives of thousands of non-smokers. “As cigarette smoke seeps from smoking areas to common areas, COTPA needs to be amended to not permit smoking on any premises. Second-hand smoking is as harmful as smoking and designated smoking areas facilitate the spread of COVID-19 infection as smokers cannot socially distance or wear masks and are trapped in close proximity in a smoke-filled environment,” Guwahati-based anti-tobacco activist and lawyer Ajoy Hazarika said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/call-to-protect-people-from-second-hand-smoke/article34041219.ece

Addressing a press conference on the last day of the budget session, Mr. Thackeray said, “I don’t change my stand on a whim. It may be a beneficial project for the State, but locals are against it. A few people met me saying they had purchased plots near the proposed site. I am not going to change my decision for them. We are committed to the locals.” Mr. Thackeray said the oil refinery would not come up at Nanar. “I appeal to all of you to no longer call this the Nanar oil refinery project. This is only an oil refinery project now,” he said. The Chief Minister said the project will go ahead at an alternative location with consent from the locals. He said, “The government knows it cannot give up a big project like this. Projects do bring money, but the environment is also an issue. The locals have opposed it over environmental concerns.” Mr. Thackeray’s stand comes days after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray wrote to him requesting that the project not be shifted out of Nanar. The Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited was proposed to be set up in Ratnagiri district in 2015 as a joint venture between Indian investors and the Saudi-owned Aramco.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/oil-refinery-project-will-be-shifted-from-nanar-uddhav/article34041389.ece

11 March 2021||New Delhi,||CM promises free trips to Ram Temple||Patriotism gave way to devotion for Lord Ram a day after the ‘Deshbhakti Budget’ was passed at the Delhi Assembly with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal promising free trips to Ayodhya’s Ram Temple to senior citizens and terming the AAP’s six-year rule in Delhi an attempt at replicating an ideal ‘Ram Rajya’. The Chief Minister also attacked the BJP and the Congress accusing both of deliberately keeping the people of the country “poor and illiterate” so they could be “hired” for political rallies and events, demarcated into votebanks and incapable of questioning their government. The BJP, on the other hand, sought to corner the government for seeking to steal credit from the Centre for its achievements on the management of the pandemic and social welfare sector during the lockdown. “All of us worship Lord Rama. Personally, I worship Lord Hanuman who was a devotee of Lord Rama. Hence I am a devotee of both. Lord Rama was the emperor of Ayodhya. During his rule, people were content as they had access to all basic facilities. This was called the ‘Ram Rajya’…we have been constantly striving to establish this model of ‘Ram Rajya’ in Delhi for the past six years,” Mr. Kejriwal said in his address to the House. 10-fold path The AAP government’s efforts at implementing the ‘Ram Rajya’ were based on 10 principles, including rights related to food, electricity, water, education, health, employment, houses, respect for women and the elderly, Mr. Kejriwal said. People belonging to various castes, class, and religious backgrounds were equal for the AAP government just like in the Ram Rajya where equality was the main principle with no tolerance for discrimination, he said. “After the judgment of the Supreme Court, a magnificent temple is yet to be constructed and I would like to put forth in front of the senior citizens of Delhi that once the temple is constructed, I would ensure that all of you are able to visit the Ayodhya temple free of cost,” he added. In the past 70 years, the country was primarily ruled by “two different parties at the Centre”, he said in reference to the Congress and the BJP, both of which had “conspired” to keep the education system in a “dismal” state. Learning revolution They “deliberately” kept the people poor and the students illiterate as they believed this would ensure cheap labour for factories owned by the affluent. They could be easily hired for rallies of various political parties and not question them in return, he said. “The revolution in Delhi’s education system in the past six years has shaken the very roots of both the parties. In the previous Assembly elections, Congress could not win even a single seat and in the recent byelections that the BJP did not win any,” Mr. Kejriwal said. “If the people of this country are educated, both these parties would have to face the same fate throughout the country,” he also said. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, however, termed it “sad and unfortunate” the failure of the Delhi government to mention the “massive contribution” of the Narendra Modi-led Centre, including a COVID-19 relief package for Delhi. “Everyone knows the Delhi government mishandled the situation and were reprimanded by the courts. The cases were rising and had reached a peak when the Central government stepped in and under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, provided relief to the people of Delhi,” Mr. Bidhuri said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-promises-free-trips-to-ram-temple/article34041210.ece

11 March 2021||New Delhi,||Punjabi Academy gets highest share in budget||Among the 20-odd language academies, Punjabi Academy has been allocated the highest share — Rs. 40 crore — in the 2021-22 budget, followed by Rs. 18 crore to Hindi Academy and Rs. 15.5 crore to Urdu Academy. Through language academies, the AAP government reaches out to different communities and promotes their language. Most of the other academies have got Rs. 2 crore each. After Delhi, Punjab is the State where the AAP has had the most success and the party is the main Opposition in the State. Higher expenditure Also, due to a 33.56% expected drop in tax collection in 2020-21, the expenditure of the government in 2020-21 is likely to be higher than its earnings by Rs. 255.91 crore, according to the budget documents. But since there was an opening balance or surplus of Rs. 5,900.94 crore at the beginning of the financial year, the overall budget will still be in surplus, but the amount is likely to be reduced to Rs. 5,645.03 crore. Mainly due to the effect of the pandemic, the government expects lesser revenue from taxes on vehicles and excise in the coming financial year. The expected tax revenue collection from excise was Rs. 6,300 crore in the 2020-21 budget, but it has been brought down to Rs. 6,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget. Similarly, the taxes on vehicles have been brought down to Rs. 2,000 crore from Rs. 2,500 crore.

Anil Kumar said. The Delhi Congress reiterated its demand for free COVID-19 vaccination to all Delhiites in both government and private hospitals. It said that instead of tackling the existing crises like pollution, drinking water, transport, unemployment, loss of livelihood, the Kejriwal government was dreaming big, as dreams cost nothing.

11 March 2021||Pune,||PIFF postponed amid spike in COVID-19 cases||In the backdrop of soaring COVID-19 cases, the Pune Film Foundation has decided to postpone the 19th edition of the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF), the organisers announced on Wednesday. While physical film screenings in theatres and multiplexes have been postponed until further notice, the festival will be held in its online format between March 18 and 25, said PIFF director and eminent filmmaker Jabbar Patel. “Owing to the current pandemic situation and the alarming surge in cases, cineastes have expressed apprehensions about enjoying PIFF screenings inside theatres. A lot of delegates have enquired to check if their registration for the festival could be converted to the online format. As organisers, we would always want the festival to be enjoyed by the maximum number of film aficionados and have thus decided to postpone the physical screenings of the PIFF to be held in theatres,” he said. Second postponement This is the second postponement of the festival since the pandemic situation in Pune, seemingly under control a fortnight ago, took a turn for the worse. The week-long PIFF, which is Maharashtra’s official film festival and biggest cinema extravaganza, was originally scheduled to be inaugurated on March 4 when Pune was reporting a marked decline in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. The organisers were compelled to alter this schedule to stage the PIFF between March 11 and 18 as novel coronavirus cases steadily rose in the city. Dr. Patel said that the new dates of the physical screenings would be declared in due course of time. “However, we also believe that the show must go on and have instead decided to host the PIFF in its online format between March 18 and 25. The online format is getting postponed by a week primarily to facilitate the conversion of delegate registration from the ‘off-line’ to the ‘on-line’ format,” Dr. Patel said. As informed earlier, 26 films from the ‘World Cinema’ category would be showcased in the online format. These films are to be screened using a secured foreign platform called ‘Shift 72’, which has been used earlier in international film festivals held at venues such as Cannes, Berlin, Venice and Toronto. The PIFF has become the first international film festival in India to utilise this secured platform for the screening of the films. Through this, viewers will be able to log in from a single device only. Links to be emailed The films shown each day would be available to online viewers any time in a 24-hour period and a link would be sent to the registered audience on their email in order to preclude the risk of downloading or recording movies. The district has been reporting daily average case surges of more than 1,800 for the last 10 days, with the result that Pune district’s active case tally has zoomed to 15,000 from its erstwhile total of 5,000 at February-end. Of this, Pune city has over 7,000 active cases. The district’s death toll has crossed 9,300.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/piff-postponed-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases/article34041392.ece

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Indo-Pacific is key priority: White House||The scheduling of the first-everQuad leaders’ summit-level meetingwithin 50 days of the Biden administration signified the importance the administration places on the Indo-Pacific, the White House said on Tuesday. “That President Biden has made this one of his earliest multilateral engagements speaks to the importance we place on close cooperation with our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters about Friday’s virtual meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan. The White House is expecting a range of issues to be discussed, includingCOVID-19, economic cooperation and the climate crisis. In his interim strategic guidance to administration agencies and departments issued earlier this month, President Biden had said China was “the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system.” Yet, the Biden administration has been careful to portray the Quad as something bigger than a grouping centred around the China challenge. It reiterated this position on Tuesday. “It (Friday’s meeting) will showcase the Quad’s ability to pool our capabilities and build habits of cooperation to address some of those urgent challenges we face. At the same time, I would just note that the Quad is not about any single challenge. It’s not about any single competitor,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. He was responding to a question on the extent to which the China-U.S. adversarial relationship would be discussed on Friday. Common interests “This is an entity forged and formed because we share common interests. There, maritime security is, of course, an important one, but our shared interests go well beyond that. And I think you will see reflected in the agenda, the breadth of those shared interest in the aftermath of the Quad meetings,” he said. Mr. Price also said the fact that President Biden was due to meet with his counterparts on Friday and that Mr. Blinken had already held discussions with his Quad counterparts in February, signalled the U.S.’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific. “It was important for us to underline in the early days of this administration, our commitment to the Indo-Pacific as we’ve said from this podium, it’s a region that holds tremendous promise for the U.S. Also tremendous challenge. We see ourselves as a Pacific nation, we see ourselves as engaged in this region. We want to deepen that engagement and this is an important forum with important partners with whom we share a good deal of interest,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/indo-pacific-is-key-priority-white-house/article34040837.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||What does Biden’s peace plan mean for Afghanistan?||The Joe Biden administration has proposed a new peace plan to the Afghan government and the Taliban, seeking to bring violence to a halt. Secretary of StateAntony Blinken has written a letter to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, detailing the proposal. American proposal In the letter, which was first published by Afghanistan’s TOLOnews , Mr. Blinken has asked the Afghan President to show “urgent leadership.. in the coming weeks”. Mr. Blinken has proposed a UN-led conference of representatives of Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and the U.S. “to discuss a unified approach to support peace in Afghanistan”. Second, Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S.’s special envoy for Afghanistan, will share written proposals with the Afghan leadership and the Taliban to accelerate talks. It urges both sides to reach a consensus on Afghanistan’s future constitutional and governing arrangements; find a road map to a new “inclusive government”; and agree on the terms of a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”. Mr. Blinken has also proposed a senior level meeting of the Afghan government and the Taliban in Turkey.  According to the agreement theU.S. signed with the Taliban in February 2020, American troops are set to leave Afghanistan by May 1. The Taliban and the Afghan government started peace talks in Doha in September last year but reached no breakthrough. The Biden administration is concerned about the slow pace of the talks. The U.S. assessment is that if American troops are pulled out of Afghanistan, the Taliban would make quick gains. In his letter to Mr. Ghani, Mr. Blinken was blunt. “We are considering the full withdrawal of our forces by May 1, as we consider other options. Even with the continuation of financial assistance from the U.S. to your forces after an American military withdrawal, I am concerned that the security situation will worsen and that the Taliban could make rapid territorial gains,” he writes. So, the Biden administration’s assessment is that the Taliban are on the ascent. It hopes that the best way to prevent a complete Taliban takeover is a regional peace process and an interim unity government. The Taliban are yet to respond to America’s proposal. Afghan govt.’s stand The Ghani administration has consistently been critical of the U.S.’s direct outreach to the Taliban. The Trump administration held direct talks with the Taliban, excluding the government. Later, Washington put pressure on Kabul to release Taliban prisoners as part of an agreement it reached with the insurgents. Even when the Doha talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government were under way, Mr. Ghani made it clear that he, as elected President, is the only legitimate representative of the Afghan people and he resisted making concessions to the Taliban. When Mr. Blinken’s letter was leaked, Mr. Ghani was quick to respond. He reiterated his opposition to any transfer of power except through elections. His Vice President Amrullah Saleh, a hardline critic of the Taliban, said the U.S. “can make a decision on their troops, not on the people of Afghanistan”. What’s next? While the Afghan government’s opposition to sharing power with the Taliban is well known, it is not clear whether Mr. Ghani could continue to resist American pressure, especially if the U.S. brings regional powers, including India, on board. And if the Biden administration decides to withdraw troops by May, Mr. Ghani would be in a tougher spot. He doesn’t have any good options. If he rejects the American offer, the war will continue. The Taliban have already taken over much of the country’s hinterlands and are breathing down the neck of its cities. If he accepts the proposal, he will have to share power with the Taliban and discuss amendments to the Constitution and the future governance framework. Either way, the Taliban are set to make gains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/what-does-bidens-peace-plan-mean-for-afghanistan/article34040839.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||China hopes Quad meet will be ‘conducive to peace’||China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing hoped Friday’s first- ever summit of the leaders of the Quad framework — India, Australia, Japan and the U.S. — would be “conducive” to regional peace and stability “rather than the opposite”. The comments from Beijing on Wednesday came days after China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in his annual press conference on March 7, said China was “open-minded to explore and deepen cooperation with the U.S.” under the Biden administration after four turbulent years, and hoped “the U.S. will move in the same direction and remove all its unreasonable restrictions on bilateral cooperation as early as possible, not create new obstacles”. Without mentioning the Quad, Mr. Wang hit out at what he called “building small circles in the name of multilateralism”, which was “in fact 'group politics’.” “Multilateralism with one's own interests taking precedence is still unilateral thinking,” he said. “'Selective multilateralism’ is not the right choice.” Friday’s virtual summit will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Asked about the summit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China “believes that any regional cooperation architecture should follow the principle of peaceful development and win-win cooperation, which is the prevailing trend of the times”. “We hope the relevant countries will keep in mind the common interests of the regional countries, uphold the principles of openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, and do things that are conducive to regional peace stability and prosperity, rather than the opposite,” he said. High-level meeting The U.S. and China, meanwhile, are preparing for the highest level face-to-face official meeting following the U.S. election, which reports said could take place as early as next week. Mr. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke for two hours on February 11, and a Chinese delegation led by the top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, who is a member of the Politburo and director of the Central Committee’s Foreign Affairs Commission, may travel to Alaska, the South China Morning Post reported. He may be accompanied by Mr. Wang, the Foreign Minister, and meet with their counterparts, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. The report noted the selection of the two topmost Chinese officials for the meeting “would reflect the importance Beijing puts on rebuilding China-U.S. ties” and the meeting in Alaska would be at “the geographical halfway point for the two sides, away from the global media’s glare”. On reports that the four Quad countries were exploring coordination in their supply of vaccines to countries in the region, Mr. Zhao, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said China “is a steadfast advocate of equitable vaccine distribution”. “We have joined COVAX [the World Health Organization-backed global initiative] under which China has undertaken to provide an initial 10 million doses for emergency use in developing countries,” he said. “So far, China has donated or is donating COVID-19 vaccines to 69 developing countries in urgent need and is exporting vaccines to 43 countries... Now a number of vaccines are available around the world. It up to each country to decide to choose...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-hopes-quad-meet-will-be-conducive-to-peace/article34040830.ece
11 March 2021||London,||Royal family contests Harry and Meghan’s racism claims||Britain’s royal family has begun a fight back against explosive racism claims made by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, indicating the couple’s comments will not go unchallenged as the country divides into partisan camps. A keenly awaited statement from Queen Elizabeth II issued on Tuesday was conciliatory towards her grandson and his mixed-race spouse after they had an interview with U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey. But it also stressed that “some recollections may vary”, as the Buckingham Palace vowed to look into the couple’s assertion that an unidentified royal had asked how dark their unborn son Archie’s skin would be. The Queen’s statement said the charge of racism was “concerning” and would be “taken very seriously”, but added that it would be “addressed by the family privately”. “Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members,” Queen Elizabeth stressed. But The Daily Telegraph newspaper said that in noting that people’s memories may diverge, the palace statement suggested that the person behind the remark on Archie’s skin may already have been identified. It said the public were unlikely to learn more, as this was “expected to be Her Majesty’s final word on the matter”. The Sun said the Queen was to investigate further through “private conversations” with senior royals. A YouGov poll of 4,656 people indicated a third (32%) felt the couple was unfairly treated, the same proportion thought the opposite.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/royal-family-contests-harry-and-meghans-racism-claims/article34040832.ece
11 March 2021||COLOMBO,||Sri Lanka invites Myanmar junta’s Minister||Sri Lanka has invited Myanmar’s junta-appointed Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin for a virtual meeting of members of regional body BIMSTEC, which Sri Lanka currently chairs. Pro-democracy activists in Myanmar slammed the move on social media, as Colombo’s outreach comes just over a month after Myanmar’s military seized power in Yangon. Sri Lanka has not commented on the development so far. In a March 2 letter addressed to Mr. Wunna Maung Lwin, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunwardena said a ministerial meeting of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation would be held on April 1. “The 17th ministerial meeting will greatly benefit from your Excellency’s valued participation, and I look forward to our close engagement over the course of the meeting,” the letter said. Critical comments Hundreds of Facebook users identifying as citizens of Myanmar left a trail of critical comments on the official page of Sri Lanka’s Foreign Ministry. They urged the Sri Lankan government to stand with the people of Myanmar, and not recognise or accept the military junta as legitimate government.  Commenting on Colombo’s invitation, Admiral (Retd.) Jayanath Colombage, Secretary to the Foreign Ministry, said Sri Lanka has invited the incumbent Foreign Ministers of all the fellow BIMSTEC members — Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and Thailand. “Our invitation to the incumbent Foreign Minister of Myanmar is only within the ambit of BIMSTEC. Unless BIMSTEC expels Myanmar, Sri Lanka has no mandate to exclude them,” he told The Hindu on Wednesday. Seeking to make a distinction between Colombo’s BIMSTEC summit invite to Myanmar, and its stance on the junta takeover, Mr. Colombage said the government was yet to decide on its position on the latter. “We are busy battling the Geneva [UN Human Rights Council] session, so we have kept that decision in abeyance,” he said. Close ties Sri Lanka and Myanmar share close religious and cultural ties, as the majority community in both countries follow the Theravada strand of Buddhism. Meanwhile, nearly 40 Sri Lankan activists staged a demonstration outside the Myanmar Embassy in Colombo on Wednesday, in solidarity with Myanmar’s protesting civilians.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-invites-myanmar-juntas-minister/article34040835.ece
11 March 2021||Paris,||U.K. variant 64% deadlier than earlier strains: study||The coronavirus strain that first emerged in Britain and is now spreading internationally is 64% more deadly than pre-existing strains, according to a study published on Wednesday that confirms earlier advice to the British government. The variant, detected late last year, is one of several to have emerged in recent months from countries with large epidemics, raising the stakes in the race to rein in the pandemic. Findings from one of those studies, led by the University of Exeter, were published in the BMJ on Wednesday. Researchers compared data for nearly 55,000 pairs of participants who tested positive in the community — rather than in hospitals — between October and January and followed them for 28 days. Participants were matched on a range of factors like age, sex and ethnicity. They found that those infected with the new variant, known as B.1.1.7, were 64% more likely to die, representing an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 in every 1,000 detected cases. Simon Clarke, Associate Professor at the University of Reading, said the increased lethality added to its faster spread meant that this virus version poses a “substantial challenge”. “It also makes it even more important people get vaccinated when called,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-variant-64-deadlier-than-earlier-strains-study/article34040917.ece

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Nepal at a crossroads||Politics in Nepal took a dramatic turn following two significant decisions made by the Supreme Court on February 23 and March 7, 2021. The first verdict overturned Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives (lower house). The second verdict invalidated the registration of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP). Challenge to Oli The first verdict reinstating Parliament cast a slur on the Prime Minister who, without respecting the letter and spirit of the 2015 Constitution, dissolved the lower house and called for a general election to be held, which was an irony given the huge majority in his favour. Mr. Oli, in fact, wanted to marginalise his party detractors, especially Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda) and Madhav Kumar Nepal, as they were challenging him for his arrogance and flawed style of governance. This was also a conflict between the communist pattern of conducting party affairs, as Lenin did while maintaining democratic centralism, and a multi-party parliamentary system that stresses on accountability and tolerance. Mr. Oli tried to run the show in his own way maintaining that the huge electoral mandate gained by the party in 2017 was due to his own popular image. Yet, pointing fingers at his party colleagues for not allowing him to function effectively, he opted to dissolve Parliament. There was overwhelming public opinion against this decision, including by former Chief Justices. Hectic political campaigns both for and against dissolution followed, as if the mid-term elections were around the corner. Mr. Oli claimed that the court could not enter into the political domain as this was not exclusively a constitutional issue that needed new interpretation. But to their credit, Mr. Oli and his followers accepted the court’s decision with grace. One positive aspect of the episode was the broad national unity forged against Mr. Oli’s unconstitutional move. Nearly all the political parties, intellectuals, civil society leaders, legal professionals and sections of the media made this a common cause for democratic safeguard. Following a two-track policy towards dissolution, the Nepali Congress (NC), the main opposition party, passed a formal resolution against the dissolution but its President, Sher Bahadur Deuba, wasn’t as vocal against the dissolution as his senior colleagues. Mr. Deuba played the role of a reluctant opposition leader because the case was subjudice and also perhaps because he wanted to play an effective role during the elections in case the court ruled in favour of dissolution. The Janata Samajvadi Party (JSP) also followed a wait-and-watch policy as the NCP was still not legally split into two parties: one led by Mr. Oli and the other by Mr. Prachanda and Mr. Nepal. Thus, when the NC and JSP were approached by Mr. Prachanda and Mr. Nepal for devising a joint strategy against Mr. Oli or for forming a government after reinstatement of the lower House, the leaders of the two parties asked Mr. Prachanda and Mr. Nepal which party they belonged to as the legal status of the NCP would remain unchanged after restoration of Parliament. The Election Commission did not make any decision to determine the status of the NCP in either Mr. Oli’s favour or in Mr. Prachanda and Mr. Nepal’s favour, despite the fact that the Prachanda-Nepal group submitted a list of the 40% of central committee members required to split the NCP. According to the two leaders, the Commission didn’t take any decision due to pressure from Mr. Oli. Muddied political scenario What was more surprising was the court’s second decision rejecting the existence of the NCP which was formed when the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) came together. The court said the two parties would return to the pre-merger stage with separate identities and symbols. The timing and content of the decision were significant. The verdict, which came on the day the reinstated Parliament was meeting, added confusion and complexity to the already muddied constitutional politics. Now, Mr. Oli is the chairman of the CPN (UML) and Mr. Prachanda heads the CPN (Maoist Centre). Since many leaders and members of different organs of the integrated party were elected as NCP members, what will be their new party identity? Will Mr. Nepal or any other person belonging to the previous CPN (UML) join Mr. Oli or can the present ministers belonging to the former CPN (Maoist Centre) continue in government when both parties have legally, if not politically, parted ways? The alternative is to split the CPN (UML) in order to integrate with the Maoist Centre under a new party name. Possible scenarios The new developments have offered a few possibilities for coalition politics. First, the CPN (UML) led by Mr. Oli is incapable of forming a government on its own strength of 120 members, which includes members of the Madhav Nepal group. If the NC decides to side with Mr. Oli’s CPN (UML), then he or the NC can form the government. Many NC members are not well disposed towards Mr. Oli because of his authoritarian style and past deeds. Although the Madhav group will be under pressure to obey the whip, it seems unlikely that it will support Mr. Oli even under pressure. An option could be for the NC to form a coalition government with the JSP and the Prachanda group without Mr. Nepal in case the latter continues to be a member of CPN (UML). Another scenario would be for the NC (60+), CPN (Maoist Centre) (53), JSP (34) and four members of other smaller parties and individuals to form the government with the NC heading it. If Mr. Oli steps down from the prime minister’s post or from the party chairmanship, another senior leader, probably Mr. Nepal, may form the government with the support of the previous Maoist Centre. If this course is followed, it may help the process of reintegration of both parties. However, Mr. Oli’s obduracy may stand in the way as Mr. Nepal continues to be Mr. Oli’s bête noire. Nepali politics is always full of surprises and uncertainty. The myth of communist invincibility and stability has exploded in less than three years. This has led to fragmentation of the Left parties. Some other parties also suffer from this malaise but not to the extent of the Left parties. The conflict of political cultures inherited by the various Left groups have contributed to political instability to a great extent. The recent political crises are also the fallout of intolerance and Mr. Oli’s failure to manage his own party.

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Tectonic turbulence in Dravidian politics||Though every State (and one Union Territory) of India that will have Assembly elections this year represents a uniquely eclectic matrix of power across the contesting parties and challenges to status quo , nowhere has a sea change in ground realities swept across the political landscape more than in Tamil Nadu. For the first time in half a century, the land of the Dravidian movement is joining the democratic fray sans the towering personalities of leaders in both the major parties that have historically ruled it — the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The passing of M. Karunanidhi (DMK) and Jayalalithaa (AIADMK), respectively, the heads of these two parties, who had delivered multiple victories at the hustings and set the template in terms of an autocratic style of managing the cadres, has created a power vacuum that has opened up the politics of the State to a historic opportunity for change. To better understand this opportunity, it is instructive to examine the vectors of change. Inheritance of leadership First, retaining our focus on the DMK and the AIADMK, there has been a dramatic shift in the fundamental nature of leadership. It is true that the DMK has had a more successful ‘business continuity plan.’ Its current president, M.K. Stalin, was the duly anointed successor to step into his father’s shoes after Karunanidhi’s passing. Karunanidhi’s final gift to his party, the orderly transition of the mantle of leadership to his son, helped swiftly see off an early challenge to Mr. Stalin from older sibling and southern-region strongman, M.K. Alagiri. However, despite Mr. Stalin’s many years of experience in Tamil Nadu as the Mayor of Chennai, MLA, Minister for Rural Development and Local Administration, Deputy Chief Minister, Leader of the Opposition and, since August 2018, the President of his party, he is yet to deliver a single State Assembly election victory. Karunanidhi led the DMK to victory in elections no fewer than 10 times. By comparison, there remain unanswered questions about whether Mr. Stalin could rise to the formidable standards of his father in terms of organisational shrewdness and personal charisma — at least in the realm of State politics. It augurs well for Mr. Stalin that he presided over the DMK’s thumping victory in the parliamentary election in 2019, with the DMK and its allies capturing 38 out of 39 seats in play. But will voters be convinced by Mr. Stalin’s promise of leadership to the extent that they will vote the same way in 2021 as they did two years ago? Contrarily, the AIADMK, as it remained after the passing of Jayalalithaa, was a pale shadow of its former self. The responsibility for that rests squarely on the shoulders of the late leader herself, for it was Jayalalithaa who systematically degraded at least four rungs of potential future leaders beneath her within the party organisation. It was Jayalalithaa who institutionalised a culture of abject servility and compulsory public displays of fealty and subservience to her persona, among every member of her party, high or low. More than that, she formalised an unapologetically dictatorial style of decision-making within the party, and within the government when the AIADMK was in power, making a mockery of whatever party and administrative structures were in place. However, the past four years of leadership under the AIADMK have seen the survivors of this unipolar period in their party’s politics pull themselves together and deliver a measure of what could genuinely be described as ‘good governance’ to the people of the State, whether in terms of flood management, negotiating with the Centre regarding funds to fight the COVID-19 pandemic or allowing industries more space to operate rather than extorting them out of business. That they did so despite the rumblings of dissatisfaction and dissent within their ranks in the early post-Jayalalithaa days is nothing short of remarkable. What was considered a fragile peace between Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam at the start has turned out to be surprisingly robust. The looming question that this analysis begs is this: will Tamil Nadu voters recognise and reward good governance of this sort, or will other factors determine their election preferences? Reading the voter Voters in this State have periodically proved that they have a penchant for putting into power at the State level a different party to the one that swept up a majority of seats in the parliamentary elections. A close review of this split in voting preferences suggests that a pattern may have emerged: since the start of the 21st century, the DMK and the AIADMK have, respectively, cornered a majority of seats in the parliamentary and State Assembly elections for 15 years each. It would not be unreasonable to surmise that this points to a collective belief on the part of voters in the State that the AIADMK is a party with strong governance credentials at the State level, whereas the DMK has proven its mettle as a bulwark against a heavy-handed central government. Yet, given the dramatic change in the balance of power and prevailing political ideologies in Tamil Nadu over the past few years, even this assumption now stands on wobbly ground. A signpost hinting at potential election outcomes this time is the C-Voter survey, which has most recently indicated a sweep by the DMK. Impending ideological clash This brings us to the second major change in the political landscape — the growing national footprint of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its brand of muscular Hindutva politics, which is now attempting to storm the bastions of the southern States and West Bengal. To understand the position that the BJP occupies in the pantheon of political parties in Tamil Nadu, it is necessary to go back to the very roots of the Dravidian movement. What began as an aggressively anti-Brahmin, anti-caste, anti-religion, anti-North Indian, anti-Hindi imposition policy orientation in the early days of the Dravida Kazhagam under Periyar E.V. Ramasamy and the DMK under C.N. Annadurai, was transformed through the 1970s and beyond, under the pressure of political competition from the rival AIADMK, into a far more inclusive, accommodationist bent of leadership. As many additional lower- and middle-castes were integrated into the broad Dravidianist agenda as fronted by both the DMK and the AIADMK, the priorities shifted from the “assertive populism” capitalising on hostility toward the central government and its tenets to the entrenchment of “paternalistic populism” comprising a charismatic but self-enriching autocrat distributing mass welfare goods. While some of the historical elements of assertive populism have faded away as the populace has adjusted to the socio-economic realities of post-liberalisation India, a persistent echo of Tamil exceptionalism remains deeply embedded within the collective psyche of the common woman and man of this State. Not only does this exceptionalism have to do with the uniqueness of the Tamil language, traditions, cinema, rural subcultures and the complexities of caste politics, but there is also a shared visceral aversion to the idea of the Tamil people genuflecting to the diktats of a distant, Hindi-speaking, upper caste- and Hindu-dominated government in New Delhi. To an extent, the implied preference for ideologically committed leaders who are exceptionally skilled at managing the party organisation is inconsistent with the quality and tenor of leadership seen in the AIADMK recently. The concern over political arrangements that might dilute the prospects for realising the dream of Tamil exceptionalism is also inconsistent with the AIADMK’s election alliance with the BJP. The BJP has done itself few favours in terms of its own political positioning in the State, as it has tried to score points on issues relating to Hindutva politics rather than Dravidianism. If a majority of voters are fundamentally hostile to the Sangh Parivar ideology, why would they care? Ultimately, the notion of perceived exceptionalism bolstered by a strong preference for regional politics capable of pushing back against overzealous, homogenising ideologies of national parties, could be the wind beneath the wings of the DMK at the hustings next month. narayan@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/tectonic-turbulence-in-dravidian-politics/article34040818.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A case for a revamped, need-based PDS||The Economic Survey, tabled in Parliament in January, rightly flagged the issue of a growing food subsidy bill, which, in the words of the government, “is becoming unmanageably large.” The reason is not far to seek. Food subsidy, coupled with the drawal of food grains by States from the central pool under various schemes, has been on a perpetual growth trajectory. During 2016-17 to 2019-20, the subsidy amount, clubbed with loans taken by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) towards food subsidy, was in the range of Rs. 1.65-lakh crore to Rs. 2.2-lakh crore. In future, the annual subsidy bill of the Centre is expected to be about Rs. 2.5-lakh crore. High drawal rate During the three years, the quantity of food grains drawn by States (annually) hovered around 60 million tonnes to 66 million tonnes. Compared to the allocation, the rate of drawal was 91% to 95%. As the National Food Security Act (NFSA), which came into force in July 2013, enhanced entitlements (covering two-thirds of the country’s population), this naturally pushed up the States’ drawal. Based on an improved version of the targeted Public Distribution System (PDS), the law requires the authorities to provide to each beneficiary 5 kg of rice or wheat per month. For this financial year (2020-21) which is an extraordinary year on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, the revised estimate of the subsidy has been put at about Rs. 4.23-lakh crore, excluding the extra budgetary resource allocation of Rs. 84,636 crore. Till December 2020, the Centre set apart 94.35 million tonnes to the States under different schemes including the NFSA and additional allocation, meant for distribution among the poor free of cost. Importantly, the government has decided to abandon the practice of extra budgetary resource allocation and include in the food subsidy amount itself, arrears in loans outstanding of the FCI drawn through the NSSF. Even in the figure of revised estimates for 2020-21, the arrears constitute a portion. Issue prices and politics It is against this backdrop that the Survey has hinted at an increase in the Central Issue Price (CIP), which has remained at Rs. 2 per kg for wheat and Rs. 3 per kg for rice for years, though the NFSA, even in 2013, envisaged a price revision after three years. What makes the subject more complex is the variation in the retail issue prices of rice and wheat, from nil in States such as Karnataka and West Bengal for Priority Households (PHH) and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) ration card holders, Rs. 1 in Odisha for both categories of beneficiaries to Rs. 3 and Rs. 2 in Bihar for the two categories, according to an official document. Needless to say, in Tamil Nadu, rice is given free of cost for all categories; this includes non-PHH. The Centre, by stating through the Survey that it is difficult to reduce “the economic cost of food management in view of rising commitment” towards food security, does not want the NFSA norms to be disturbed. But, a mere increase in the CIPs of rice and wheat without a corresponding rise in the issue prices by the State governments would only increase the burden of States, which are even otherwise reeling under the problem of a resource crunch. Political compulsions are perceived to be coming in the way of the Centre and the States increasing the prices. The politics of rice has been an integral feature of the political discourse. Promises by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the 1967 Assembly election in Tamil Nadu — three measures (approximately 4.5 kg) at Rs. 1 — and the Telugu Desam Party during the 1983 poll in Andhra Pradesh — Rs. 2 per kg — captured the imagination of the voter. One should ponder over the advisability of keeping so low the retail prices of food grains at fair price shops, even after the passage of nearly 50 years and achieving substantial poverty reduction in the country. As per the Rangarajan group’s estimate in 2014, the share of people living below the poverty line (BPL) in the 2011 population was 29.5% (about 36 crore). Recast the system In this context, it is time the Centre had a relook at the overall food subsidy system including the pricing mechanism. It should revisit NFSA norms and coverage. An official committee in January 2015 called for decreasing the quantum of coverage under the law, from the present 67% to around 40%. For all ration cardholders drawing food grains, a “give-up” option, as done in the case of cooking gas cylinders, can be made available. Even though States have been allowed to frame criteria for the identification of PHH cardholders, the Centre can nudge them into pruning the number of such beneficiaries. As for the prices, the existing arrangement of flat rates should be replaced with a slab system. Barring the needy, other beneficiaries can be made to pay a little more for a higher quantum of food grains. The rates at which these beneficiaries have to be charged can be arrived at by the Centre and the States through consultations. These measures, if properly implemented, can have a salutary effect on retail prices in the open market. There are no two opinions about reforms implemented in the PDS through various steps, including end-to-end computerisation of operations, digitisation of data of ration cardholders, seeding of Aadhaar, and automation of fair price shops. Yet, diversion of food grains and other chronic problems do exist. It is nobody’s case that the PDS should be dismantled or in-kind provision of food subsidy be discontinued. After all, the Centre itself did not see any great virtue in the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode at the time of giving additional food grains free of cost to the States during April-November last year (as part of relief measures during the pandemic). A revamped, need-based PDS is required not just for cutting down the subsidy bill but also for reducing the scope for leakages. Political will should not be found wanting. ramakrishnan.t@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-case-for-a-revamped-need-based-pds/article34040821.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Towards peace on the border||Things seem to be looking up for India in the neighbourhood. China has withdrawn its troops in eastern Ladakh across the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Pakistan has voluntarily come forward for a ceasefire across the Line of Control (LoC). The new U.S. administration has been issuing positive statements. Shift in strategy This is the second time in the last few years that China has been forced to make a reassessment of its ground strategy. Earlier in 2017, at Doklam where there was a 72-day stand-off, mobilisation of Indian forces led to the withdrawal of Chinese equipment and troops from the disputed area. It took almost 10 months for this to happen in Ladakh. It began at Pangong Tso; Depsang Plains and Hot Springs are yet to see the withdrawal. This can be attributed to a conspicuous shift in India’s strategy. Prior to 2014, India used to engage in diplomacy and close matters through a quiet give and take in such conflicts along the LAC. In 2013, India was allegedly forced to dismantle some military structures as a part of the resolution process when China encroached into Depsang Valley. Indian troops used to generally avoid a face-off. That was the kind of peace we managed to maintain along the LAC. But under the new policy, the Indian forces practice active engagement on the ground while their leadership engages in negotiations with their counterparts. This revised strategy of ‘proactive diplomacy together with strong ground posturing’ seems to be working well with our northern neighbour. Long ago, Chairman Mao Zedong had conveyed an important message to India through his Premier, Zhou Enlai. In August 1962, Mao had asked his army commanders to prepare for war with India. Zhou, a good friend of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, reminded Mao about the Panchsheel Treaty signed by the two countries, which mandated ‘peaceful coexistence’ as the core principle. Mao told Zhou to convey to Nehru that India and China should practice ‘armed coexistence’. This must always be remembered in dealings across the LAC. The LoC too has seen some pleasant manoeuvres. In a sudden development, the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGsMO) of India and Pakistan decided on February 22 to strictly implement the 2003 ceasefire agreement. Coming after one of the worst years of ceasefire violations across the LoC (more than 5,000) and just before summer, this decision must be a greatly reassuring one for peace. On its part, India has always demonstrated its commitment to peace. A similar agreement was reached between the two DGsMO in 2018 too. However, there were violations by Pakistan, including the Pulwama attack. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan insisted that there would be no engagement with India until the status quo was restored in Jammu and Kashmir. All that seems passe now. There seems to be equal enthusiasm in Pakistan over the ceasefire. Just as China’s withdrawal cannot be second-guessed, Pakistan’s climbdown too cannot be explained conclusively. The FATF sword is still hanging over Pakistan’s head, the economy is in precarious condition, COVID-19 has impacted exports, and there is a repayment crisis. China is helping its friend, but it looks unhappy about the uncertainty over the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Political pundits predict that when besieged from all sides, Pakistan has a propensity to spread terror and violence in India. India has enough experiences to appreciate Pakistan’s potential for mischief. That is why India has reiterated that there will be no let-up in counter-terror operations. But there is discernible change in General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s tone and tenor. Moeed Yusuf, Special Adviser on National Security in Pakistan, cryptically told journalists: “Do you think this could happen without pressure?” Biden administration’s approach Pakistan must be under pressure from India, the new U.S. administration as well as China. There are indications that the Biden administration will adopt a nuanced approach with China. In its own economic and strategic interest, China would prefer to give that a chance. It probably wants Pakistan also to fall in line. Contrary to fears, the Biden administration seems to be largely siding with India in its South Asia policy. “We are concerned by Beijing’s pattern of ongoing attempts to intimidate its neighbours. As always, we will stand with friends, we will stand with partners, we will stand with allies,” a State Department official stated recently on the border stand-off. In another statement, the U.S. State Department said it “welcomes” the steps taken to return Jammu and Kashmir to “full economic and political normalcy consistent with India’s democratic values”. India should seize this opportune moment. Taking a leaf out of Vajpayee’s statesmanship in 2003 may not be a bad idea.

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Diagnosing gestational diabetes||Diabetes is a major public health problem in India with an estimated 7 crore adults with diabetes and half as many with prediabetes. Unfortunately, over half remain undiagnosed till late complications set in. The consequences of this for the health system, economic productivity and the individual’s life and family are well documented and well known. Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, is primarily preventable among those at risk through proper lifestyle changes.  Transitory form of diabetes What is less well known is that pregnancy is a diabetogenic stress and as a consequence, some women develop a transitory form of diabetes during pregnancy called gestational diabetes. Women of Indian (South Asian) origin are considered to be at highest risk of gestational diabetes. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that up to 25% of pregnancies in South Asia may be affected by hyperglycemia in pregnancy. In India it varies from about 10% in rural areas to about 30% in urban areas. Given that there are approximately 2.7 crore to 3 crore pregnancies each year in India and assuming a modest gestational diabetes rate of 10%, this means that about 27 lakh to 30 lakh women develop it each year. Gestational diabetes is associated with significantly increased risk of complications during pregnancy such as preeclampsia (fits during pregnancy), prolonged and obstructed labour, need for assisted delivery, postpartum haemorrhage and sepsis, stillbirths, premature delivery, increased risk of neonatal deaths due to respiratory distress, neonatal hypoglycaemia and birth injuries. All these conditions contribute to high maternal and new born morbidity and mortality. If a woman gets gestational diabetes, it is easier to identify her as being at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Almost half the women with gestational diabetes go on to develop Type 2 diabetes within 10 years without preventive care. Children born to women with gestational diabetes are also at very high risk of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, addressing gestational diabetes has an impact at three levels: it will help lower maternal and new born morbidity and mortality; reduce the risk of future diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in women with gestational diabetes; and possibly break the chain of ‘diabetes begetting diabetes’ by addressing the issue of trans-generational transmission.  Test procedure However, there is lack of public awareness about gestational diabetes as well as low awareness and capacity within the health systems for testing and providing care. This is despite the availability of national guidelines and diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Professor Dr. V. Seshiah, a pioneer in the field of diabetes and pregnancy, along with the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group of India, suggested a single test procedure which is economical and doable. The World Health Organization, the IDF and the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics have also approved this test procedure. A recommendation Being conceived by healthy parents and born to a mother in good health is the best gift a child can receive as this provides a health advantage. To build a healthy future for the nation, this becomes very important. Several academic associations such as the Diabetes Study Group of India, the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India and the South Asia Initiative for Diabetes In Pregnancy have recommended that we observe a National Gestational Diabetes Awareness Day on March 10, which is Dr. V. Seshiah’s birthday, in recognition of his service and contribution to the field of diabetes and pregnancy for more than 40 years. V.

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Regulation redux||The Supreme Court’s notice to the Centre on a public interest plea to set up a national environmental regulator under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 revives an issue that successive governments have preferred to ignore, in spite of specific orders passed by the same court more than nine years ago. There is no consensus on what a new regulator can achieve, since official policy privileges ease of doing business. The draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification 2020, which seeks to advance that goal, makes no effort to disguise the desire to virtually eliminate civil society’s role. It does not encourage the public to voice its views and report violations, while independent scrutiny of proposals is weakened. In fact, the EIA process, especially after the notification in 2006, has been heavily critiqued for conflicts of interest - the proponent of a project is responsible for producing the EIA report — while clearances under forest, wildlife, air and water quality laws are heavily weighted in favour of promoters. Rather than reform the system, in 2011 and 2014, the Centre rebuffed the apex court on the question of forming an independent regulator, contending that its orders in the Lafarge mining case were only in the nature of a suggestion, and later sought time but decided not to act. The current PIL is forcing the government to come up with a fresh explanation on why it has been sitting on its hands all along. Yet, for a national regulator to work, the government must recognise the limits to extractive growth, respect a neutral body and preserve the integrity of the environment. A key issue raised by the PIL is the lack of credibility of the EIA process, leading to reports that are often produced with the help of dubious expertise and manipulated data. In most cases, the proponents also ignore the views of communities that would be displaced, and are ill-equipped to assess the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services such as clean air, water and farm productivity. The Centre and States must acknowledge the conflict arising from pressure on scarce land and ecosystems from polluting projects, which has already created clusters of industrial locations that are doing badly on the CPCB’s Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index. It is striking that this did not stop approvals for further polluting activity in some of these places, such as large coal-based power plants cleared in recent years in Kanpur, Cuddalore, and Angul in Odisha. What should concern the Centre is the laggardly pace at which multiple departments process project proposals, raising transaction costs and resulting in the clamour to dispense with regulation. The remedies lie in administrative reform. It is eminently feasible, for instance, to produce a whitelist of lands for industry, reclaiming polluted areas. What India cannot afford to do is further degrade its forests, rivers, wetlands and air, whose health is vital for its large population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/regulation-redux/article34040812.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Uphill rescue||Four days short of four years after he was sworn in, Trivendra Singh Rawat was asked by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central leadership to make way for Tirath Singh Rawat as Chief Minister of Uttarakhand. The new CM was sworn in on Wednesday. The outgoing Mr. Rawat failed to keep the house in order; party workers and MLAs had distanced themselves from him. In fact, his very selection as CM in 2017 had less to do with his popularity or leadership skills than the central leadership’s liking for him. He was seen as an imposition from above. Far from building bridges with the BJP workers and MLAs, his style of functioning further alienated him from the party ecosystem. Party leaders felt ignored in decision making, and power was increasingly concentrated. While party functionaries were sidelined, governance fell more into the hands of bureaucrats. The BJP has 57 MLAs in the 70-member Assembly and at least half of them had turned against the outgoing CM. Allegations of corruption hastened his downfall, but the determining factor was his singular failure to hold the party flock together. The State goes to elections next year and the BJP could not have afforded to let him lead it. Success or failure will now be in the kitty of the incoming Mr. Rawat. The change of guard in a State, giving up on its handpicked person, is uncharacteristic of the BJP leadership, and hence marks discontinuity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity continues to be the key driver of BJP politics, and he has held tight control over the party, including on State units and Chief Ministers. Leaders with an autonomous political base have been seen as rivals, at best tolerated and rarely encouraged or promoted. But this model has proven costly in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, where the party’s setbacks were attributed to the style of functioning of former CMs. Therein lies the paradox and dilemma of the BJP’s approach to leadership. The party’s rise as a behemoth has been advanced in significant measure by regional satraps and Mr. Modi himself was one. Since 2014, the BJP and Mr. Modi became synonymous, and the party’s national profile is now built on the notion of a strong leader. In States where leaders project strength without corresponding skills and popularity, the disenchantment brews in the ranks. On the other hand, leaders with limited mass appeal have helped the party maintain balance among rival social groups within its camp. Uttar Pradesh, where CM Yogi Adityanath is building his own style of strong leadership, is a notable exception. The change in leadership in Uttarakhand is indicative of the limits of running a State from Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/uphill-rescue/article34040813.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The Trichur outbreak||Our Cochin Correspondent writes to us that a public enquiry into the recent disturbances at Trichur has not yet been taken up in earnest. The Durbar, we are told, has not instituted any investigation apart from that of the Police Department. The accounts of the outbreak that have found their way to the Press trace its origin to causes which, while they vary and conflict, implicate some of the high officials of the State as being of the fray. The Hindus and Muhammadans appear to hold that the Christians started the aggression and had the connivance of the police and magistracy, these being under Christian officers. The Christians in their turn pose as victims of Non-Co-operation and caste. The Diwan is reported to have attributed the whole thing to the tyranny of caste exclusivism and there are people who say that official attempts at hasty social reform must be held responsible. There is yet another reading of the occurrence which interprets it as but one incident of a general upsurge that has been gathering for some time throughout Malabar and has evidenced itself in the series of recent temple-burnings in Travancore and Cochin. Perhaps the Trichur outbreak is innocent of these alleged deeper connections and may be purely a local madness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-trichur-outbreak/article34040822.ece

If enforcement proceedings are initiated, India is confident of addressing them and will strongly defend its interests, the sources said, adding it is open to a constructive settlement of tax disputes within the existing legal framework. India is in the process of filing an appeal in the Cairn arbitration award case, they said, adding it was well within India’s sovereign powers to redress the situation of Double Non-Taxation and tax abuse. Cairn CEO Simon Thomson had last month met the then Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey to discuss the arbitration award. The sources said Cairn is yet to respond based on the discussions. Cairn set up a tax abusive structure and did not pay taxes anywhere in the world on the gains that it made in India, they added. An international tribunal had in December ruled that India violated its obligations under the U.K.-India Bilateral Investment Treaty in 2014, when the income tax department slapped a Rs. 10,247-crore tax assessment using legislation that gave it powers to levy taxes retrospectively. Soon after seeking taxes over alleged capital gains made by the company over a 2006-07 reorganisation of the India business before its listing, the tax department seized Cairn’s residual 10% stake in Cairn India. Cairn had on Tuesday said it had identified Indian assets overseas, which it could seize in the event of New Delhi failing to pay up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-filing-appeal-against-cairn-arbitration-award-say-sources/article34040805.ece

The main allegation is that there has been a history of gender discrimination in the Murugappa Group and Ms. Arunachalam was denied a board seat. Valli Arunachalam family’s plea for equal representation in the company’s affairs had been denied since her father M.V. Murugappan’s demise a few years back, Mr. Raman said.

11 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘BoM on course to expand, tap markets’||Bank of Maharashtra is pursuing plans to grow footprint by opening a branch each in 320 districts across the country — where it has no presence — by next fiscal. By this fiscal, 135 such districts are to be covered and the remaining, in 2021-22, as part of a hub-and-spoke model involving the branch and banking correspondents. This approach, said a senior executive, would help the state-owned bank, which is reportedly being considered for privatisation, foray into new geographies. “We are going ahead with expansion,” MD and CEO A.S. Rajeev said. Of the 150 new branches planned this fiscal, 120 have been opened, with many in districts where the bank has no presence. By March, the target will be be exceeded and BoM will close the year with 2,000 branches as against about 1,850 in April 2020. On likely privatisation of the bank, he said, “My feeling is, it is yet to be finalised,” adding these were policy decisions and the government, as owner, will decide. In view of the comfortable capital adequacy ratio — 13.76% and expected to cross 14% by this fiscal — BoM has already conveyed to the Centre that it did not require further capital. “We will be able to grow without further capital for 1-1.5 years at the same rate,” he said, adding the bank may go to the market next fiscal to raise funds via a follow-on offer or a QIP. The board has already approved raising Rs. 3,000 crore, of which Rs. 1,000 crore would be via equtiy and Rs. 2,000 crore, through bonds. “We have... raised Rs. 450 crore tier II bonds. We will go for Tier I bonds when required,” he said. On growth, he said the bank had gained from higher focus on the RAM (retail, agriculture and MSME) sectors. The ratio between the corporate and RAM business segments had changed from 50:50 to 61:39 over the last two years in favour of the latter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bom-on-course-to-expand-tap-markets/article34040803.ece
11 March 2021||Mumbai,||LIC-owned IDBI Bank exits PCA framework||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday removed IDBI Bank from its enhanced regulatory supervision, or the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, after almost four years, on improved financial performance. The RBI had placed IDBI Bank under the framework in May 2017, after it had breached the thresholds for capital adequacy, asset quality (net NPAs were over 13% in March 2017), return on assets and leverage ratio. It was noted as per published results for the quarter ended December 31, the bank was not in breach of the PCA parameters on regulatory capital, net NPA and leverage ratio, the RBI said. “Taking all the above into consideration, it has been decided that IDBI Bank Ltd. be taken out of the PCA framework,” the RBI said. The LIC-owned IDBI Bank had reported a standalone net profit of Rs. 378 crore for the December quarter. The lender had reported a net loss of Rs. 5,763 crore a year earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/lic-owned-idbi-bank-exits-pca-framework/article34040808.ece

11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||PV dispatches rose 18% in Feb., says SIAM||Passenger vehicle (PV) makers dispatched more than 2.81 lakh units to dealers in February, a growth of almost 18% over the same period last year, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). The growth was driven by utility vehicles, whose sales rose 45.4% to more than 1.14 lakh, followed by a growth of about 4% in both cars and vans to more than 1.55 lakh units and 11,902 units, respectively. Two-wheeler wholesales rose 10.2% to 14.26 lakh units, motorcycles 11.5% to over 9.10 lakh units and scooters 10.9% to 4.64 lakh units. Three-wheeler sales, however, fell 33.8% to 27,331 units.

Rajesh Menon, director general, SIAM, noted that total PV sales for April-February were still below the FY16 levels and that of two-wheelers, below the FY15 levels. “Supply-chain challenges, including rising price of steel, unavailability of semiconductors and higher container charges, continue to be obstacles in the smooth functioning of the industry,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pv-dispatches-rose-18-in-feb-says-siam/article34040799.ece

11 March 2021||Turin,||Porto dumps Juventus in a thriller||Juventus crashed out of the Champions League last 16 for the second year running on Tuesday, losing to 10-man Porto on away goals despite winning the second leg 3-2 in Turin. Sergio Oliveira’s extra-time free-kick sent twice former winner Porto through to the quarterfinals as the tie finished 4-4 on aggregate. Leading 2-1 from the first leg in Portugal, Oliveira’s first-half penalty increased Porto’s advantage but Juventus levelled the tie through two goals from Federico Chiesa, which came either side of Porto striker Mehdi Taremi’s red card. Oliveira then rifled home a low free-kick on 115 minutes, which passed through the legs of Cristiano Ronaldo, with Adrien Rabiot’s header in reply coming in vain for Juventus. Fastest to 20 Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland on Tuesday became the fastest player to reach 20 goals in the Champions League, as well as the youngest, after scoring twice against Sevilla in the last 16. Haaland’s goals helped Dortmund secure a 2-2 draw in its second-leg match that sent it into the quarterfinals 5-4 on aggregate. The 20-year-old Norwegian has been sensational, needing just 14 matches to reach the 20-goal mark, with 10 fewer appearances than the previous record holder, Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane. He is also more than a year younger than Paris St Germain’s Kylian Mbappe when he reached that mark just short of his 22nd birthday. Haaland has netted 10 times in six Champions League games this season. For Dortmund the aggregate win secured its first quarterfinal spot in four years, with Haaland hungry for more goals. Tap in Haaland’s first goal was a tap in from a Marco Reus cutback but his second was a retaken penalty after his first effort was saved. The penalty was controversially awarded after a lengthy VAR review involving a foul on Haaland minutes earlier. Haaland has now scored two goals in each of his last four Champions League appearances.  The results: Borussia Dortmund 2 (Haaland 35, 54-pen) drew with Sevilla 2 (En-Nesyri 69-pen, 90+6). Dortmund wins 5-4 on aggregate.   Juventus 3 (Chiesa 49, 63, Rabiot 117) bt Porto 2 (Oliveira 19-pen, 115). 4-4 aggregate, Porto progresses on away goals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/porto-dumps-juventus-in-a-thriller/article34040988.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The magic of Eden in the eyes of its prime architect||When Thursday dawns, it will mark the 20th anniversary of the magic of Eden! And it looks as though just yesterday V.V.S. Laxman was essaying his silken drives against Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens in that Test for the ages, one which perhaps scripted India’s greatest triumph in cricket’s longest format. On March 11, 2001, the second Test between India and Australia commenced with the host trailing 0-1 after the loss at Mumbai. The woes continued as Australia posted 445 in the first innings with skipper Steve Waugh’s 110 and Harbhajan Singh’s hat-trick enlivening the proceedings. Destiny changed Sourav Ganguly’s men replied with 171 in which Laxman, stepping in at six, top-scored with a 59. Waugh, keen on securing the ‘Final Frontier’, enforced the follow-on and the rest is history. Promoted to number three, Laxman’s incredible 281 (452b, 44x4) and his 376-run fifth-wicket partnership with Rahul Dravid, whose 180 (353b, 20x4) was equally important, altered the contest’s destiny. India’s second innings score of 657 for seven declared left Australia with a target of 384 on a fifth day pitch. Harbhajan claimed six wickets and India won by 171 runs in a turnaround that had magic and grit woven into it. Twenty years later, Laxman rewinds the clock as he talks over phone from Mumbai and, true to the man, the over-riding theme is one of modesty: “The first thing I feel is about how lucky and blessed I was to be part of such a wonderful Test.” And as he remembers that surreal phase, Laxman admits to a sense of wonder: “Just the magnitude of the situation and to play in that fashion against a tough Australian side, even today it gives me goose-bumps and sort of teaches us that nothing is impossible in life.” Not many would know that he almost missed the game and Laxman recalls: “Three days before the match, while batting I had a stiff back. Later in the hotel, our physio Andrew (Leipus) asked me to see myself in the mirror after asking me to remove my shirt. I was shell-shocked, my entire upper body had tilted to the left-side. I almost cried. Andrew reassured me and, thanks to him and to John’s (coach Wright) desire that I play even if I was 70 or 60 per cent fit, all that worked in my favour, otherwise probably I wouldn’t have played.” Resolve-breaking stand His alliance with Dravid was the one that broke the Aussies’ resolve. “When Rahul came in, I was nervous, he was batting at number three and now he was coming at six. Usually Rahul doesn’t talk much when he comes in but this time he does the fist-bump and tells: ‘good going, let us keep up the fight’. We had a decent partnership on the third day evening and I got to my 100 and while walking back Rahul told me, ‘I am so proud about the way you batted the whole day’.” The duo extended its heroics into the fourth day and Laxman narrates: “Jamy (Dravid) mentioned let’s have a goal of batting the whole day! And like the way we batted together for South Zone, there was a certain amount of calmness with Rahul. The toughest phase was after tea, Rahul came into the Test with a viral fever and I was struggling with my back. The Australians were coming hard at us. We endured the pain and kept motivating each other.” While snuggling into nostalgia, Laxman lauded Harbhajan: “Bhajji had great rhythm, the ball was drifting towards slip, turning and bouncing sharply. With Sourav’s ability to give security to a youngster, Bhajji bowled with a lot of freedom.” And as the interview wound down, Laxman felt that the can-do spirit is evident in the current team too. As for his 281, all that he feels is infinite gratitude for being part of one of the greatest Tests ever and a series which India won 2-1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-magic-of-eden-in-the-eyes-of-its-prime-architect/article34040914.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Focus on the present, future will be bright: Rohit Sharma||India cricketer Rohit Sharma believes that it is too early to think about the ICC T20 World Cup, scheduled to be held in India in later this year. The Mumbai batsman stated that the team will instead focus on the immediate task — a five-match T20I series against England, which commences at Ahmedabad on Friday. Not think too far ahead “When you play for India, there is no question of rehearsal. It is important for us to win this series, and not think too far ahead. If you focus on the present, the future will be bright. We need to have the mindset of trying to win each and every game we play,” Rohit said in a media interaction on Wednesday. Rohit was open to the idea of the ICC appointing neutral umpires for international fixtures, though he praised the Indian umpires for doing a great job in the recent home Test series against England. “If players can travel, umpires can travel as well. Make them quarantine, make their lives difficult as well (laughs). But I think the umpiring in this Test series was brilliant. It wasn’t easy for them, given the nature of the pitch. They had to consider so many things — it was turning square, bouncing, the odd ball went straight. Considering all these factors, I think they did a terrific job,” Rohit said. The 33-year-old is happy with his form, and the patience he showed in a 144-ball 49 in the fourth and final Test last week. “Whenever you do something that you are not used to, it counts as a small victory. When this happens, your confidence will rise. In the fourth Test, I made only 49, but I played 144 balls. That was a victory for me, because I curbed my instinct to play attacking shots. I didn’t fall victim to playing a bad shot,” Rohit said. Hardik raring to go The vice-captain explained that Hardik Pandya is raring to go. Pandya, who had stopped bowling after suffering an injury in 2019, recently posted a video where he is seen bowling at full tilt. “He (Pandya) has been working on his bowling and batting. He has been with the India team in the bubble for over a month now, and has done everything to get ready for this limited-overs series,” Rohit said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/focus-on-the-present-future-will-be-bright-says-rohit/article34040911.ece

The club’s record goalscorer, 32, is back in contention after a season ravaged by injury and illness but is short of match fitness and there is little opportunity for the City boss to ease him back into action. There is growing uncertainty over the Argentine forward’s future, with his current deal expiring at the end of the season. Asked if he hopes Aguero stays longer at the Etihad, Guardiola said: “As a human and as a person, even as a player, of course — but we have to see what happens at the end of the season. “We cannot forget how long he was out. He has started getting better. I know he needs minutes to get to his best condition but we are not maybe in the moment to give him minutes for minutes’ (sake) because it is an important part of the season. “We have to be calm. The club will speak to his agent to know the situation and we are going to talk at the end of the season.” The City boss said he did not know how the issue would be resolved as his focus was firmly on the rest of the current campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/aguero-struggling-to-get-back-into-action/article34041353.ece

11 March 2021||LUCKNOW,||Stick to the basics is Jhulan’s mantra||In victory or defeat there is no dearth of effort from the 38-year-old Jhulan Goswami. In the two one-dayers against South Africa at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium, Jhulan has taken six of the 12 wickets, conceding 80 from 20 overs. Tons of experience in the international arena has taught her to “stick to the basics”, especially when returning to cricket after a long gap. The World Cup next year may be a target, but Jhulan believes in “performing every day”. Motivation “Representing India is the biggest motivation. My job is to perform each and every day, and maintain fitness. I am doing a lot of training and following a routine,” said Jhulan after India’s victory in the second one-dayer. Jhulan conceded that the Indian bowling was a little wayward in the first match and quite “disciplined” in the second. Jhulan herself bowled six wides and two no-balls in the second match, one of which cost her a wicket. That was because she was really bending her tall frame to extract every bit of juice the pitch offered in the first session. Jhulan pointed out that it was not easy to play shots early in the day, because of the moisture, and that batting was a lot easier in the warm afternoon, when the players could hit through the line. Thrilled Obviously thrilled to hear the Board’s announcement of a Test match against England, Jhulan said that the whole team was “excited and looking forward” to it. “There is a lot of challenge, mental and physical, in playing a Test. Things change every session. We will be playing a Test after 2014,” said Jhulan, who has played only 10 Tests as compared to 184 ODIs. India had beaten South Africa in that last Test in Mysuru by an innings. The team, however, is focused for now on sustaining its upper hand against South Africa in the one-day series.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/stick-to-the-basics-is-jhulans-mantra/article34040916.ece

11 March 2021||Coimbatore,||Racing Team India all set for 24 Hours of Le Mans||Racing Team India is set to become the first all-Indian-driver team to race in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, after having been granted a provisional entry for this year’s edition of the twice-round-the-clock classic. The team, consisting of Narain Karthikeyan, Arjun Maini and Naveen Rao, will compete in the LMP2-AM category. The #74 car will be prepared and run by Eurasia Motorsport, making it a true-blue Asian effort. “It’s a proud moment not just for our team, but for our nation as a whole. Racing at Le Mans with an Indian team is a dream I have nurtured since 2009 when I first visited the Circuit de la Sarthe,” said Narain. He also thanked the sponsors and partners and especially the ACO and the Asian Le Mans Series team. Support  “This would not have been possible without their support. It’s been a long time coming but finally we’re all set to put Indian motorsport on the global endurance racing map.” Racing Team India made its debut last month, competing in the Asian Le Mans Series where it finished fifth. The 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 89th running of the race at the Circuit de la Sarthe, is scheduled for August 21 and 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/racing-team-india-all-set-for-le-mans/article34040979.ece
11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||It means a lot be an Olympian: Mary Kom||Boxer Mary Kom said the Tokyo Games will be her last Olympics, regardless of her desire to carry on or not. The London 2012 bronze medallist said: “Tokyo will be my last Olympics. Age matters here. I am 38 now. Four (three) more years is a long time," Mary Kom told the Olympic Channel. For participation in Tokyo 2020, the age-limit for boxers was initially 40. With the Games deferred by a year, it was extended to 41. Having turned 38 in March, Mary Kom will be above the current limit by the time the next Olympics in 2024 roll around. “Pretty sure I won’t be allowed to even if I am willing to carry on till Paris 2024,” she said. She said it means a lot to her to be an Olympian and her career as a boxer would have diminished “if I didn’t compete in the Games”. “It means a lot for me to be an Olympian. I have been boxing for 20 years. I have participated in many international tournaments. I have been the world champion. But I had to wait for my turn to take part in the Olympics as women’s boxing wasn’t in the Games until 2012. “Finally, it happened and I am glad it did. I think the value of my career as a boxer would have diminished if I didn’t compete in the Olympics,” Mary Kom added. A dream She said winning a medal at the Olympics is a dream and it changes lives. “Olympics is huge. For any sportsperson, participating and winning a medal at the Games is a dream. It changes lives. “Becoming an Olympian and winning the bronze changed my life too. It also inspired many women to take up sports, especially boxing. “I feel proud. I want more girls to come out and fight. I hope there are no restrictions to come out and fight for themselves and their country.”  I want more girls to come out and fight.

11 March 2021||MIAMI,||Neville era begins at Miami as MLS opens training camps||Phil Neville said the excitement for his new gig at Inter Miami still feels fresh, even though he took the job in January. Neville led England to the Women’s World Cup semifinals in 2019. It was expected that he’d take the team to the Olympics in Tokyo this summer, but he left early to join David Beckham’s Major League Soccer team. “I think I came here three or four weeks ago, and even now when I walk into the building, it makes me really proud,” Neville said. “It makes me feel as if I’m part of something really special.” Inter Miami officially opened training camp this week, along with most other MLS teams. Neville, 44, takes over for Diego Alonso, who guided Miami through its inaugural season last year. Miami made the playoffs, marking just the seventh time that an expansion franchise reached the post-season, finishing the regular season 7-13-3. But the club fell to fellow expansion team Nashville in the opening round. Reunion Miami parted ways with Alonso, paving the way for a reunion between Neville and Beckham, who played together with Manchester United and on England’s national team. As a player, Neville’s Manchester United teams won six Premier League titles and three FA Cups. He appeared in 59 matches with the national team from 1996 to 2007. His new job ramped up considerably on Monday, even though the team had trained unofficially for a week. “I think as a coach, what you look for, you look for reactions, you look for people trying to make an impact, you look at the conversation that you have, and about the words being spoken. And everyone is doing and saying the right things at this moment in time,” Neville said of his first impressions. “We have a long way to go.” Neville is among six coaches taking over MLS teams this year.   Neville is embracing the challenges of his new job. “We’re going to make sure that we push the players, we raise the level of expectations, and we put high demands on them. We’re training a lot of double sessions this week,” he said. “We want to make sure that from the first week we hit the ground running really fast.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neville-era-begins-at-miami/article34041397.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Nathamuni and Alavandar||Vaishnava Acharya Alavandar wrote a work called Stotra Ratna. What is a stotra? People might define it as attributing to someone, qualities which they do not possess, or exaggerating their qualities. But when it comes to the Supreme One, no praise is exaggerated. He is the repository of all auspicious qualities, and no praise can be enough to capture the greatness of His qualities. Stotra Ratna speaks of His infinite good attributes. There are three gems in sacred literature — Mantra Ratna (Dhvaya mantra); Purana Ratna (Vishnu Purana) and Stotra Ratna of Alavandar — said Valayapet Ramachariar, in a discourse. Alavandar was named Yamuna and was the grandson of Nathamuni, who recovered the Divya Prabandham. The verses were set to music and taught to Nathamuni’s nephews Melaiyagathazhvan and Keezhaiyagathazhvan and became a part of temple worship in Vaishnava temples. Vedanta Desika, in his Adikara Sangraha, says that by studying the Divya Prabandham we obtain clarity with regard to difficult portions of Vedic literature. In Adikara Sangraha, Vedanta Desika says none is equal to those who worship Nathamuni. Now the question might be asked if this is not pride, to claim that there is none equal to devotees of Nathamuni. There are three types of pride — sattvika ahamkara, rajasa ahamkara and tamasa ahamkara. To take pride in one’s scholarship or one’s wealth would fall in the category of undesirable ahamkaras, namely rajasa or tamasa ahamkara. But to be proud of one’s Acharya is not wrong. We must have a sense of pride in the greatness of our Acharyas. This is sattvika ahamkara, and it is a desirable pride. Desika says that those who follow Alavandar’s teachings do not study anything unnecessary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nathamuni-and-alavandar/article34040904.ece

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A cheesy affair||Käse The goatherds of Chotila are a world away from the vineyards of Akluj. For Chennai cheesemaker Namrata Sundaresan, however, they both offer exciting opportunities to create unique terroir-influenced cheese for a rapidly expanding, and appreciative, market. Run by Namrata and Anuradha Krishnamoorthy, Käse recently collaborated with winemaker Fratelli to release three distinctive styles of cheese. “I went to Akluj, where they have their vineyards, and came back with so much inspiration, grape skin and leaves,” laughs Namrata, adding that she created the Cheddarg, a combination of cheddar and Cornish yarg, by wrapping it in Sangiovese leaves and aging it for up to five months for a complex, smoky character that pairs best with red wine. Her mild, nutty Syrah-rinsed Gusto pairs with both red and white, while her Sunburst, with its fruity, salty notes goes best with crisp white wines. All three are available on the Fratelli website. Now, she is working on an intriguing project with Sahjeevan’s Centre for pastoralism. “The shepherds and goatherds in Gujarat are being exploited by middle men,” she says, adding that the milk they collect is “fresh and so delicious”. Just back from Chotila, which is about 160 kilometres from Ahmedabad, she is training them in cheese production, making halloumi, feta and chevre out of goat milk, which Käse will then help market. Till that is ready for sale, try the five-year-old company’s locally made ‘clean’ offerings, created out of milk from indigenous breeds and sourced from ethical farms. Constantly inspired by the city, the collection includes cheddar blocks speckled with milagai podi , moringa crusted feta and Namrata’s favourite creamy CamBlu.

Stacked with gourmet produce, Medium Rare is positioned at Chennai’s  first deli, offering everything from marinated T bone steaks to freshly baked pies. Holding up a charcuterie platter featuring delicate ribbons of ham and discs of salami, COO Sanjoy Das says they offer raw meat and marinated meats as well as a wide range of ready-to-eat food in the style of a European delicatessen. “We also do roasts, cured meats, salads… and then there is our seafood,” he says, pointing at tanks of live crabs and lobsters. If you prefer to leave the heavy lifting to the chefs, they will grill your lunch and serve you in the deli’s road-adjacent, pocket-sized garden. Try the savoury pies, featuring buttery pastry that breaks open to release its steamy, meaty contents. Corporate chef Prabhu Dhananjayan, brings together his experience at luxury hotels and cruise liners to create a range of tarts, quiches, sausages and roasts for the deli.

Like everything else at Porky’s, Chef Koushik says the sauce is “home made” — which normally means made from scratch. In his case, however, the ingredients are also inspired by what he has growing at home. Like his bhoot jalokia chicken wings, which deliver a fruity, scorching heat with every bite. “We wanted it hot, but not scary hot,” he chuckles. The American style menu, delivered from a cloud kitchen, focusses on pork and the team makes an effort to ensure quality ingredients, sourcing meat from Mysuru and Bengaluru. Thirukumaran Roopkumar, who owns Porky’s, also launched two other cloud kitchens recently: Bhukkad Singh and the tongue-in-cheek, Fooking Kitchen. All three focus on relaxed, popular dishes, featuring menus that constantly evolve as Chef Koushik enjoys experimenting with new ingredients. He is currently waiting for a stash of Carolina Reapers, one of the hottest peppers in the world, to arrive. Anticipate a marinade that is exciting, but also potentially terrifying!

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||The yazh sings again||It begins with the call of the conch shell, “just like people always do when, culturally, introducing something new,” says Chennai-based musician and luthier Tharun Sekar. Sekar, who made headlines last year for having designed and crafted the almost-forgotten, ancient traditional string instrument yazh, has now come out with a song featuring the same instrument — in collaboration with two artistes from Madurai. Titled ‘Azhagi’, the Tamil song is being touted by the trio as the first song ever recorded on the yazh — which it might just be, since written records date the instrument back by 2,000 years, well before any equipment might have made recording possible. The harp-like instrument carved out of wood, has a hollow base and finds mention in many pieces of Sangam-era literature, with different variants described as having different numbers of strings. Tharun’s yazh has seven, and creates enough of an aura to dominate the song. The creative process for the musical track began in Madurai in December, between Tharun, rapper Syan Saheer, and Siva Subramanian aka The Nomad Culture. While Syan and The Nomad Culture wrote the lyrics, Tharun handled music production and played the yazh. The latter is a feat unto itself: with no one available to train or guide him through the ancient instrument, Tharun picked up what he could on his own. “I figured that the notation system is similar to that of the guitar, so that helped in a way. I had to practise it for about two or three months before I was able to play it,” recalls the musician who has been honing his lutherian skills since the age of 17 and has created a number of instruments besides the yazh. All three artistes lent their voice to the song — a minimalistic number with sombre tones that lets the yazh strings and lyrics take forefront. Tharun says, “The song tells the story of a girl called Azhagi. She has superpowers — she can defy gravity. It was originally written for a comic book… since she comes from the past, we thought we could relate her story to that of the yazh.” The lyrics, while heralding the arrival of this weapon-wielding beautiful and powerful character, also delve into questions of truth, dissent and absolute power. The visuals, of sweeping fields, slow-moving boats and religious backgrounds, add to the prophetic vibe. “The teppakulam [temple tank] where we shot is supposed to be around 2,000 years old. It is away from the city, so we thought it would be a great place to shoot. The fields, woods and other spaces we shot at were near Alagar Koil,” informs Tharun. Video production was handled entirely by In Frame, which also premiered the song on its channel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-yazh-sings-again/article34040771.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to roots||Using the banana leaf, mandarai leaf ( Bauhinia variegata ) and panai olai (palm leaves) to pack food was once traditional in South India. The pandemic, which prompted a surge in the use of plastics, reiterated the need for sustainable packaging alternatives. Palm leaves, as restaurants and cloud kitchens launched in the past year have found, are a practial option. Chennai-based cloud kitchen, Karigar Biryani offers perunchoru packaged in palm leaf boxes. This rice dish cooked with meat finds mention in Sangam literature. “Over a period of time, biryani that used to be served on special occasions, has come to be a common, easily available dish. We wanted to offer something different; therefore in order to make our dish distinctive from other types of biryani available in the market, we pack it in palm leaf boxes,” says Girish Subash, co-founder, Karigar Biryani. “We initially decided to go in for bamboo boxes, but our research led us to understand that maintenance was a major issue,” he continues, “While travelling in Sattur and Kovilpatti region, I came across many families that were weaving panai olai petti , which was predominantly used for packing palm jaggery.” Palm leaves are available in abundance in the region in and around Tiruchendur, but it is during the summer months that craftspersons collect, clean and sun dry the leaves for making various products through the year, shares Jariya Aziz, who runs a crafts collective Abati, at Kayalpattinam. “In this region, palm leaves are commonly used to store snacks and food items such asidiyappam. Wedding favours are also given to guests in mittai petti , made of palm leaves. Traditionally, these pettis have been a practical and cost effective way to store palm jaggery. Box making is a cottage industry in this region, and it is mostly women who engage in this work,” she says. “There are few artisans who are now actively weaving palm leaf boxes, but for the past few months the demand has surged,” says 32-year-old D Anto Brighten, an Engineering graduate, who took up his family vocation of making palm leaf products at his hometown, Adikalapuram, near Tiruchendur. Some of the regions in the State where artisans still make products with palm leaf are Thoothukudi, Vilathikulam, Vembar and Nagalapuram, and Pazhaverkadu near Chennai. The craftspersons make six to eight baskets per day, earning a daily wage of Rs. 200. “We have supplied over 3,000 boxes so far for packaging biryani. Though it is a labour intensive craft, completely hand made, it is reusable, durable, and has high flexibility. I am glad that it is gaining popularity as a packaging option,” says Anto. Chef Koushik S of Eatitude Consultants, points out that mandarai leaves, banana leaves and palm leaves have been part of our culture; these have only regained popularity during the pandemic. “Apart from being sustainable and biodegradable, palm leaves also impart an unique earthy flavour when I add it and cook it along with biryani,” he says. Not just as boxes, palm leaves can be used to make spoons, cups and even wedding garlands. Anto’s most popular innovation last year was a Christmas star made of palm leaf. “These don’t require any sort of chemical treatment. Just sun drying would suffice,” says Koushik. “We have to ensure that they do not come in contact with water,” says Girish. The leaves are sun-dried to ensure there is no moisture, cut into strips, with the help of a machine, and then woven. Girish says that they have adopted a sterilisation method in their restaurant, where they pre-heat their pizza oven to 300 degrees, flash heat the boxes in batches for a few seconds and then pack the food in them, after layering it with banana leaf. A palm box’s life does not end there, Girish has learnt: “The boxes we send out our biryani in are being repurposed by our customers as planters, dust bins and for storage.”  Did you know? Palm leaves can be classified into kurutholai (soft variety used for intricate weaving), elaolai (commonly used for crafts) and saarolai (hard variety used for making boxes).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/back-to-roots/article34040788.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Cop in the act||“A policeman’s wife is missing.”  That is the one-line film idea that producer MM Chandramouli pitched to author Prraveen Khumar N, after being impressed reading his debut novel, An Incredible Indian Rescue . The producer wanted a slapstick comedy revolving around that line, but Prraveen found it really hard. “I just could not make it funny. So, I wrote a thriller in the form of a book and presented it to him when it was 70% complete.” The producer leafed through it, and was convinced that it was “global content”. A film on the subject is in the works currently, but Prraveen is currently basking in the good vibes he is receiving for its written version. His second book, Battle for Power (Emerald Publishers), set in Chennai, revolves around how life changes for Thilak Ratnagar, ACP Crime, when he investigates a dead body in a lake. “Most of the events portrayed are taken from reality,” says Prraveen, about the mysterious deaths of scientists in the book. “My story is fictional, but the events surrounding it are based on relevant topics. I believe that it will kickstart discussion.” A civil engineer from IIT-M, Prraveen began his tryst with books rather late, as recently as 2011. He has no qualms admitting that the first major English book he read was Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. “He’s my hero. He broke convention by reducing the page count and wrote in a simple style that was easy to follow.” Prraveen has another connection with Chetan; they both studied in IIT. “After leaving academia, we IITians slog for 18 hours a day for a company. If we do not have a creative outlet, we would become like robots. Writing gives us the satisfaction that our material will be discussed long after we pass on from the world,” says the 30-year-old, who works as the country head of a leading housing finance company. Coming up, he already has two subjects lined up: one on oil fields, and another that explores a father-son relationship. But he has one grouse: that there are not enough collaborations between film production houses and authors. “Every writer wants to see their product on the big screen. If this marriage happens, it would be a great platform for material to reach audiences.”  With Kamal Haasan in mind Prraveen Khumar is a big fan of actor Kamal Haasan. He wrote the protagonist of his debut novel keeping his favourite Kamal character (Adhi Narayanan of 1995 Tamil film Kuruthipunal ) in mind. His latest novel, Battle for Power , was released by the actor at the recently-concluded Chennai Book Fair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cop-in-the-act/article34040790.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Breathe in, get out||Everyday at 4 am, Hari Ramakrishnan straps on a helmet and sets out on his Cervelo S3 bicycle. From his house in T Nagar, he pedals to East Coast Road-Old Mahabalipuram Road (ECR-OMR), aiming to cover around 70 kilometres. His weekly target is about 350 to 400 kilometres. But Hari has not always been a cycling enthusiast. In mid-September, when the pandemic was raging through Chennai, this former MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) trainee discovered the joy of biking. Many untrodden paths and a number of bike upgrades later, the theatre actor-director says, “I feel I have more control over cycling than any other workout that I have ever done.” Like many of us, Hari too felt lethargy creep in during lockdown before he realised it is vital to remain active. Though he wanted to get back into a fitness routine, MMA being a contact sport was not ideal at a time that mandated physical distancing. That is when he discovered cycling. In a few months, he was a part of multiple, mushrooming groups in the city, offering people company to ride with. Same was the case with Dr Naveen Alexander, a general surgeon at Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre. “When you get hooked on to going to the gym at least six times a week, and suddenly a lockdown starts, you feel lost,” he says. Though he had bought a bicycle in 2014, he had not got around to using it, until last year. Now, he easily touches upwards of 60 kilometres a day. And when training for cycling challenges, even hits 100-odd kilometres. “A four-hour ride is nothing for me now. My resting heart rate has drastically reduced. I get through my days much better than I did before,” he adds. Much like Hari and Dr Naveen, people across the country are reclaiming the outdoors to stay fit. Since November last year, Chennai-based actor Shabeer Kallarackal has been participating in group treks. To make the treks more challenging, he incorporates parkour moves to scale around obstacles. “We see how efficiently we can move while on the trek,” he states. Thus, as much as it is an adventure, the trek also becomes an extension of his carefully-constructed fitness regimen. A breath of fresh air While the pandemic has certainly given way to a sense of appreciation for the outdoors, it has also been a wake up call for many to remain healthy and active. Meanwhile, the paranoia that comes with exercising indoors in the presence of others, has only just begun to wane. All combined, outdoor activities — everything from an easy walk to an acquired skill like surfing — are seeing many more takers now. “I started enjoying the small things — like looking at ants and spiders... I feel very connected to these treks now. Even though the climb is physically exhausting, the positivity it brings is something else,” says Shabeer, who also runs on the beach, as part of his strength and conditioning routine. His next goal? A course in mountaineering. Outdoor sports, earlier overlooked by people who preferred air-conditioned gyms, have been getting increasingly popular. Especially with WFH (work from home) enabling people to save time on commuting, which they can then use on self care. Since December, Varshaa Rajan has been surfing twice every week; she vouches for its positive effect on her mental health and says she does not see herself returning to the gym. Being cooped up at home for months together for the first time ever, has only increased the vast ocean’s appeal, she says. She travels from Virugambakkam to Kovalam twice a week for her classes. Making parks cool again “You don’t even realise that you are exercising. It’s so much better because you have your own little pocket of space in this ocean,” says Varshaa, who spotted dolphins once. Young adults have a misplaced perception that working out in parks, beaches and other public spaces is not ‘cool’ enough, says Dr Rohini Rau, who set out on regular walks along Panayur beach during the lockdowns. She was pregnant at the time and these walks were deemed essential. “These spaces were usually considered for people who are above 40 or so. That is changing,” says Dr Rohini. Playpens in parks and beaches being repurposed as pull-up bars and props for mobility exercises is a testament to the same, she adds. There are many benefits to training outdoors. Vikram Menon, founder and coach at Chennai-based SimpleSTRONG, a functional strength training and calisthenics outfit explains, “There is a huge mental health aspect to training outdoors. There are less distractions — you are not looking at your phone, or being troubled by anyone at home. You can call it meditation in many ways, where it’s just you and Nature. You will feel more refreshed and recharged.” Apart from the physical and mental health benefits, outdoor fitness can also open doors to acquiring unexpected hobbies and skills. “It [cycling] also gave me an excuse to do a lot of photography!” says Dr Naveen. He has been steadily documenting sights along the trails. As for Shabeer, new streams, lean waterfalls and unusual picnic spots came his way while scaling up the Nagalapuram falls in Andhra Pradesh. He says, “We tried three to four routes to scale the peak. Every time we go uphill, we find a new waterfall! These are the experiences that we take back even if we don’t succeed in scaling the peak.” As more people breathe in the fresh air and sights, and carefully clock in hours of activity, there is a renewed sense of fitness among the city’s residents. Meanwhile, it’s time to work around our excuses, fellow homebodies!  Apart from the physical and mental health benefits, outdoor fitness can also open doors to acquiring unexpected hobbies and skills||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/breathe-in-get-out/article34040776.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||A good day to dive hard||The Special Forces (SF) are the Jedi knights of the Indian armed forces: elite warriors accustomed to volunteering for missions impossible. Trained to survive, stabilise and thrive in extraordinary situations, they retire in their mid-30s with skill sets such as sky diving, scuba diving, mountaineering, unarmed combat and emergency medical response. In the hinterland from where most hail, and in the corporate jobs that are their second careers, these skills rust. In January 2019, Major Vivek Jacob, a Para SF officer who had to hang up his boots following a combat skydive injury, founded CLAW Global (Conquer Land Air and Water), to teach life skills to adventurers and people with disabilities (PWD). Its core team, mostly in their 30s, also comprises Major Arun Ambathy and five soldiers drawn from the Para, Para SF and the Navy’s marine commandos (MARCOS). “Team Claw comprises soldiers who have extended exposure to hard combat, and civilian volunteers who swell our ranks,” says Chennai-based Arun who retired after a slew of injuries. “There are no ecosystems to absorb these men and CLAW helped them fit into a job profile they are comfortable with. In February 2019, CLAW’s Operation Blue Freedom began teaching PWDs to scuba dive to secure their dignity.” Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, team CLAW has offered free scuba diving training for more than a 100 PWDs paralysed by spinal cord injuries. It is now assembling a team for the first of the Triple Elemental World Record scheduled to be held in Maldives in April. “We first train in a pool, move to quarry diving and then to the open sea. PWDs will also be trained in adaptive skydiving [Dubai] and in adaptive mountaineering [Siachen glacier]. We hope to complete the three records by end-2021,” says Arun over phone, adding that this is an open call to PWDs and the able-bodied to join them for the record. “PWDs have the spirit — like the SF they learn to thrive in a tough world — but sometimes not the money or the circumstances. We want to bridge that. Going forward we hope NGOs and corporates can directly sponsor the PWDs.” In Puducherry an unlikely smattering of enthusiasts — teenagers, doctors, college students and veterans — has banded together to learn diving. “The level of disability has never been a problem as we are trained in adaptive diving. We have mixed batches — able-bodied, amputees, wheel-chair users, some paralysed neck down... But their spirit is intact and we want that to diffuse through to others,” says Arun, adding that the venture has been lauded by the Government of India. “When we took Salma Salmath diving in Lakshadweep, the powerful image of her in a hijab underwater opened the gates for others.” In the Bay of Bengal, a boat chock-a-block with diving apparatus rocks about, revealing little of the calm cobalt-blue waters beneath. Coorg-based Dr Deepa Venkatesh, a 34-year-old dentist with polio who uses crutches, follows her instructor retired Havildar Prabash Kumar as she gingerly lowers herself into the ocean where visibility is 12 metres on a good day. “Our instructor to student ratio is 1:1. We descend to 18 metres through eight progressive immersions and monitoring of vitals — people with spinal cord injuries cannot thermo-regulate and may lack bladder and bowel control,” says Arun. Adventure is for all Instructors use a combination of encouragement and instruction. “This was the first time I had heard of adaptive scuba diving in India and now want to participate for the record too. CLAW worked around my disability, weighing down my legs so that I didn’t keep floating up. The instructors are empathetic and make us practise on a par with others; that makes a world of difference,” says Dr Deepa, adding that she is keen on sky diving as well. “Apprehensions abound but CLAW also addresses issues of phobia and sudden ascent that can be dangerous. They are very systematic. Adventure is for everyone.” That is something Petty Officer Pardeep Ritwal, MARCOS veteran, believes in. Pardeep lost his leg to an accident but now helps PWDs dive. He hops to the edge of the ocean and dives deep emphasising that if you are not living life on the edge you are taking up too much space.

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Bring on the originals||A Tuesday night at a city pub was Somdev Devvarman’s second-ever public performance as a musician. His first was at Covelong Surf, Music and Yoga Festival in 2019, two years after he retired from professional tennis. Unlike at Covelong and at his matches, not everyone at Barracuda Brew was there to see him. Many had no qualms talking over his music, but Somdev held his own enough to make the gig a success. In a set peppered with tennis callbacks and personal stories that inspired each song, what stood out was the stark imagery in Somdev’s lyrics — “one fine day when I don’t wake up, my body’s going to break up with my soul”.  The seasoned musicians by his side also helped. Guitarist and producer Keba Jeremiah and drummer Vinay Ramakrishnan completed the trio on stage, playing a set of about eight songs as a sneak peek into Somdev’s upcoming album. “I don’t have a name for it yet, and there is no set release date,” said Somdev, adding that he is in no rush. The former sportsman wrote his first song for the album four years ago, and so far has about 13 tracks raring to go. This relaxed focus on just singing, songwriting and performing is exactly what Original Dog is all about. The Chennai-based platform, which focusses on crowdfunding for original music creators, has indie talent from across the country on its roster. Co-founders Keba Jeremiah and Navin Dorai, in a step to take it beyond funding and help artistes get an audience, plan to introduce a different talent at Barracuda Brew every alternate Tuesday. Adds Navin, “Some of them are established, some are up-and-coming. Regardless, we want to give all of them similiar audience numbers to play for. Which is why all our gigs will be anonymous — you won’t know who you will be listening to, until you show up.” One glance at the platform’s list of artistes and genres — soul, electo-pop, hip hop, fusion, rock and more — is enough evidence that this is a chance worth taking. Somdev’s set was deliberately kept non-anonymous to draw in the crowds, explains Navin. “Now that people know the kind of talent we are supporting, the idea is that they might trust us enough to show up for the surprise performers, too.”  For details, check out the Instagram pages @originaldogofficial and @barracudabrewbar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bring-on-the-originals/article34040731.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Celebrating the forgotten||A call to our ancestors, a celebration of our roots — or in other words, a recall to the things we have forgotten — is what singer Dhee and rapper Arivu’s track ‘Enjoy Enjaami’ is about. The recently-released track is produced by maajja, the platform started by composer AR Rahman — to support indie musicians — and composer Santhosh Narayanan. Dhee is currently managed by maajja who is also producing her upcoming début album in English. “They (maajja) asked me if I wanted to do a song for the YAALL festival (maajja’s music fest), and I thought it would be nice to do something in Tamil. Arivu and I had wanted to collaborate [for some time]; he is an amazing musician and appa (Santhosh) was kind enough to produce this,” says the singer, who has sung tracks in films like Madras , Irudhi Suttru , Soorarai Pottru and the upcoming Jagame Thandhiram . The music video for ‘Enjoy Enjaami’, shot in Arivu’s hometown in Tiruvannamalai district, is the “first-ever time” 22-year-old Dhee has been filmed on camera for an independent track. Predictably, the camera shy singer was nervous. “I have always been [camera shy], even now on this Zoom call,” she laughs. “It was pretty scary at first but when you get there [and start filming], you just vibe to it and then it becomes fine. At the end of the day, I didn’t want to leave and didn’t want to stop.” Only the beginning Her début album is expected to be out by the end of this year; at the very least, a few tracks from the album will be released, she assures. Dhee does not elaborate but she lets on that the tracks will be “contemporary jazz laced with different things”. On it being in the English language, she adds, “I wish I could write in Tamil but it would probably take five to 10 years for me to learn Tamil. I can speak the language but not creatively write. Maybe, I will do it one day.” One would assume that life has changed for Dhee since ‘Rowdy Baby’ released; the track from the film Maari 2 , which she sung alongside Dhanush, has over a billion views on YouTube. When she steps out, kids call her the “ Goli soda akka ”, she tells us (‘Rowdy Baby’ begins with “Hey... en goli soda ve ”), but she will not concede that her career has been progressing in a way that is not organic. Dhee has been in Chennai since the national lockdown was enforced in March 2020. Under normal circumstances, she would have split her time between Sydney, Australia, where she is based, and Chennai, where her parents live. “My dream is to see South Asian artistes excel. When festivals like YAALL happen, it will promote South Asian indie musicians all over the world. I would like for it to become our Coachella.” What else has Dhee got on her checklist? She remarks that she does not view the fame brought on by ‘Rowdy Baby’ as a measure of success. “I’m only just starting out. I don’t think there will ever be a point of ‘This is it!’ for me because it might make you not want to create music,” she concludes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/celebrating-the-forgotten/article34040768.ece

11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Let’s ‘chaat’ about samosa||The pantheon of India’s lip-smacking street food scene is headed by the samosa. Whether it is being served in its three-dimensional spiced potato-filled avatars to prospective grooms in ‘bride-seeing’ functions in north India, or as a smaller, flatter, and crisper triangular ‘patti’ (pastry strip) version withnonbu kanjiduring Ramzan in the south, the samosa’s universal appeal is undisputed. The samosa travelled to India from central Asia and the Middle East in the 12th or 13th centuries via Arab traders. In his account, the 14th century traveller Ibn Batutta mentions samosas filled with nuts and minced meat being served before the third course of pulao at the court of Mohammad bin Tughlaq. Samosa is also known as sambousek in Arab cuisine, while within India, it also goes by the names of shingara (in Odisha and West Bengal), lukhmi (in Hyderabad), and somasi (in Tamil Nadu). Despite its foreign origins, the samosa today has assumed a quintessentially Indian identity. Bringing order to the market The ubiquity of street food that is prepared and served on the spot in India has also been its undoing: this sector has remained unorganised for far longer than the pre-packaged fried snacks industry. India exports frozen samosas to over 140 countries, according to trade market figures. The Indian snack market is worth Rs. 42 lakh crore, and of this 65% is unorganised. In recent years, food startups operating through cloud kitchens have tried to bring some order into the business of selling freshly fried samosas.“In India, samosas are consumed more commonly than pizzas and burgers. Our research has shown that we eat around five crore every day. But a common problem with this snack, as with most street food in India, is the perception that its preparation is unhygienic, and because it is deep fried, it is unhealthy. This is where we are trying to bring in change,” says Amit Nanwani, who co-founded the startup Samosa Party with Diksha Pande in 2017. With a centralised cloud kitchen that has automated at least 75% of the process of making samosas, the Bengaluru-based startup offers freshly fried orders in 12 locations across the city, and is planning to expand to Delhi-NCR area this month. “The samosa looks very easy to assemble, but it is actually an artisanal hand-crafted product, and much of its appeal is based on its visual appearance. A ‘good-looking’ samosa won’t have a single blister on its body. This can be found only in halwai shops or traditional kitchens because there’s a lot of skill involved in how it is fried, how the dough is kneaded and so on. We haven’t tampered with the soul, which is how it is folded, because we still do it by hand,” says Nanwani. Changing perceptions The desire to package traditional quick-serve snacks like samosas and chaat items like panipuri ( golgappa ), aloo tikki and the like for a new generation has seen the growth of companies that are working harder on food-grade packaging, and hygiene standards, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. “The food market had been evolving in India, even before the lockdown. Customers’ perception of what street food should be, has also changed. Where people would once queue up around the vendors to be served, in the pandemic-alert world, they have begun to dislike the idea of having others handle their food before they eat it,” says Nidhi Singh, who began the startup Samosa Singh in Bengaluru with her husband Shikhar Veer Singh in 2016. The extra costs incurred in terms of greater hygiene compliance cannot be shifted to the customer, she says, because there are far too many options to replace them. “Unlike a few decades before, we can no longer expect to serve samosas dripping with oil in recycled paper packets. In fact, one of our earliest challenges was to figure out how to retain the crispness between the time it was fried and delivered to the customer,” says Nidhi. Beginning with a 300-square feet kitchen, Samosa Singh today operates from a factory-type facility of 5,500 square feet that serves lakhs of samosas daily through its 30 outlets in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. It is set to expand to Mumbai and Pune shortly, having recently raised funding of Rs. 19 crore. Filling it up Though the Punjabi aloo (potato) version remains the ‘hero’ for startups, there is a greater variety of fillings on offer these days. Samosa Singh, for example serves masala corn, achari chicken, cheese chilli, Manchurian and Schezwan chicken options, while Samosa Party’s bestsellers include mutton keema, barbecue chicken, achari paneer and chocolate. “We are soon launching a baked version for health-conscious customers who may not want to eat fried snacks,” says Nanwani. The conscious shift towards a more hygienic standard operating procedure (SOP) is a welcome change in the Indian street food industry, but its indigenous culinary heritage should be respected, says Mumbai-based chef Ritesh Tulsian. “Historically, street food wasn’t just supposed to be pocket-friendly, but also hygienic, tasty and nutritious. The essence of Indian street food is dying because everyone is trying to create a fusion cuisine out of it,” he says. “Processed cheese is being used now in Indian dishes to mimic the ‘umami’ of non-vegetarian food. They have become loaded with ketchup and mayonnaise to make up for the lack in taste profile.” Aided by social media exposure, street food in India today is vastly different from what used to be a simple gastronomic experience a few decades ago. “Portion sizes were smaller then, because chaat was a mid-day snack. But nowadays, they have become the meal. If we eat anything at any time of the day, we lose the purpose of street food,” says Tulsian.  A cultural marker of everything Indian In February, former adult film star Mia Khalifa hit back at trolls by tweeting ‘I can be bought with samosas’, as she relished an Indian meal sent by her celebrity friends. The predominance of Indian-American lawmakers in the new U.S. government headed by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is being referred to as the ‘Samosa Caucus’. Last year, artist Sofia Karim expressed solidarity for the Shaheen Bagh protests in Delhi with her art project titled ‘Samosa Packet Movement’ in the U.K., featuring paper covers with political messages. In January, an Indian restaurant in Bath, U.K., tried to launch its samosa into outer space with the help of helium balloons fitted with a camera and GPS tracker. The devices helped record the crash landing of the would-be space flight on a field in neighbouring France.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/lets-chaat-about-samosa/article34041374.ece
11 March 2021||March 11 2021 00:00 IST,||Dreams upcycled||“Yavi in Sanskrit means the conjoining of the heavens with the earth. This is the mindspace I am in while I create — dreamy and perfect,” says designer Yadvi Agarwal, who launched her label Yavi in 2016. She first launched in the international market and then in India in 2018. British journalist and fashion critic Suzy Menkes and the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, were the first buyers of her brand, she adds over call from Delhi.    Yavi will be showcasing a selection of its contemporary clothing in Chennai, which will be part of The Armoire Trunk Show. “We will be showcasing the Impressionist story and the shibori stories, studded by some statement pieces,” she says. Yadvi’s collection is eclectic. “The idea was to be able to express what I feel and dream in the form of tangible, wearable artistic garments,” she says. Her apparels comprise jackets, coats, dresses, crop tops, capes, pants, and cover a spectrum: from sporty, chic, and peppy to those that spell Bohemian grace. “Our USP is hand-painted jackets; no two are the exact same. They are made by composing layer after layer of printing, with blocks and found objects. These hand-painted surfaces have been adapted as impressionist prints on luxurious silks, linens,chanderiand cotton,” explains the alumna of National Institute of Design. There are also accessories such as textile jewellery and stoles in Yavi’s range. With a design philosophy that believes in mindful designs for conscious customers, the Delhi-based designer says, for her, being mindful means working keeping in mind the environment and ecosystem. “We work with mostly natural fibres that are easier to disintegrate or leave a lesser carbon footprint. I work with handloom fabrics, handspun yarns and with various craft sectors from West Bengal, Gujarat, Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. This not only helps create awareness of our textile traditions by putting them on a global market, but also sustains the craft and the livelihoods of various craftspersons,” says Yadvi. A proponent of upcycling, she ensures that all the scrap fabric is used and refashioned into upcycled garments. “I believe in throwing nothing. The upcycled story has been a part of Yavi collections from the beginning, each season with a fresh inspiration and approach. We have made patches for jackets, placement patches, coasters, bags... the list goes on. This is again in an attempt to not pollute the environment. In my SS21 collection, I have used recycled polyester that has been made using PET bottles,” she says. Among Yadvi’s signature techniques is the Impressionist one-thread embroidery, which is an innovative way of constructing new fabric by overlapping threads.

11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two more arrested in Red Fort violence case||Two more persons have been arrested for their alleged involvement in Red Fort violence in January, said a senior police officer on Wednesday. Maninderjit Singh, (23), and Khempreet Singh (21), who were actively involved in the violence at Red Fort were arrested on Tuesday. Forged documents According to the police, Maninderjit, a Dutch national, settled in Birmingham, U.K., was arrested at Indira Gandhi International Airport while he was trying to flee from India on forged travel documents and posing himself as Jarmanjit Singh. He originally hails from a village in Gurdaspur district of Punjab. As per his plan, he was going to fly to Nepal from Delhi and then head to the U.K. A look out circular was also issued by the police against him in connection with the case and he is previously involved in two criminal cases, the police said. Khempreet is a resident of Swaroop Nagar, who the police said had assaulted personnel on duty inside the well area of Red Fort with spear. He was absconding and wilfully evading his arrest. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Monika Bhardwaj said the presence of Maninderjit at Red Fort was established through electronic evidence. There are video footage on record, which shows his presence alongside the unlawfully assembled unruly riotous mob at Red Fort carrying spear during farmers agitation on January 26, the police said. The police said Maninderjit is settled in Birmingham and is employed as labourer in construction field. In December 2019, he visited India and due to the lockdown in 2020, he could not return. He was produced before the court and a four-day police custody remand has been taken. Khempreet, who stays in Swaroop Nagar here, is a close accomplice of arrested accused Maninder Singh, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-more-arrested-in-red-fort-violence-case/article34041198.ece
11 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Protesting farmers make their ‘homes’ green||After installing semi-permanent structures on the highway, several protesting farmers at the Singhu border have now started beautifying the perimeters of their “homes” by placing potted plants, among other things. Farmers have been camping at the Capital’s borders for over three months now, demanding a legal guarantee of minimum support price and a repeal of the three controversial agriculture laws brought in by the Centre last year. The protesting farmers have maintained that they will not vacate the various highways unless their demands are met and that they are ready for a long haul. With the onset of summer and the mercury rising, among other provisions, like installing semi-permanent structures on the highway, several of the units are now bordered with potted plants. The flowers, farmers say, are equivalent to beautifying their “homes” which is now at the border. Manjeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Fatehgarh Sahib district, said: “We have tried to adapt with the changing circumstances. With each passing day, it is becoming evident that our struggle will be a long one. Now that we have to live here indefinitely, we thought of beautifying the place as well, which is similar to what we would have done back in our villages.” A garden with shaded seats has also been built by some of the farmers near the main stage at Singhu Border with the aid of NGO United Sikhs. It will be made open for the public over the next week. Plants from Murthal Sarabhjit Singh, a 70-year-old farmer from Punjab’s Ludhiana district, said: “Around 10-15 of us worked for over two weeks to help transforming this area into a garden. Three trolleys were put to use and we brought soil from around 4km away. The plants were brought from Murthal.” “We have even installed generators and lights over here. While the garden has not been opened yet for the public, as the grass needs to grow a little more, we hope that in another 10 days, people can come and sit over here,” said Mr. Singh. Balgovind, a volunteer with United Sikhs, said: “This area had earlier become a dumpsite of sorts. The waste water from the ‘ langars ’ was getting accumulated over here and with the changing weather it had started emitting a foul smell. It was then that it was decided to transform the place.” Volunteers said that while this was the first such project, other such parks can also be created if there is availability of requisite space on the highway. “This is the first such project but if other farmers, who are further down the highway, want such a facility, then we will make similar ones for them too,” said Mr. Balgovind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/protesting-farmers-make-their-homes-green/article34041201.ece

She added that even her acquaintances and family friends have also been summoned by the agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/will-not-seek-mehboobas-presence-ed-tells-court/article34041188.ece
11 March 2021||New Delhi,||Search warrant against advocate Pracha stayed||A Delhi court on Wednesday stayed the operation of search warrants issued against advocate Mehmood Pracha, who is representing some of the accused in the cases related to the riots that took place in Delhi last year. Mr. Pracha’s office was raided by the Delhi Police on Tuesday in connection with an FIR alleging that the advocate tutored a witness to initiate a false riots case. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Pankaj Sharma, who passed the directions on an application filed by Mr. Pracha, said: “Till the pendency of this application, the search warrants issued against the applicant is stayed.” The court reserved its order for March 12 on the advocate’s plea, which has also sought a direction to the police to retrieve only the relevant information from his hard disk in the presence of a Magistrate. Mr. Pracha said that a soft copy of the materials was as good as a hard copy under the Information Technology Act. “They want to threaten my clients. That is their purpose. In the main Delhi riots cases, they say soft copy is equal to hard copy and we would not give hard copy of chargesheet. Here they don’t want soft copy,” he said. During the course of arguments, the advocate argued that it was clear from the video of the riots in question that his complaint was not false.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/search-warrant-against-advocate-pracha-stayed/article34041194.ece
11 March 2021||New Delhi,||Provide cover to homosexual woman, court directs police||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the police to provide protection to a 23-year-old homosexual woman, who on Sunday escaped from her marital home in the Capital after her parents tried to conduct experimental “cure” for her sexual orientation. The woman, in her plea, said that she was forcibly married to a man in 2019 despite her on many occasions apprising her parents about her sexual orientation and about her identification as a homosexual. She said her parents and extended family refused to acknowledge, accept and respect her sexuality and instead kept insisting that homosexuality is an illness of which she needs to be cured. In her petition, filed through advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, she said her previous attempts to put an end to the marital relationship with her husband were not successful. “The marriage was never consummated. On some pretext or the other, the petitioner’s husband delayed breaking this news to his family and the petitioner continued to live in the misery of a life she did not identify with,” the plea said. ‘Disgrace to family’ Things started getting difficult for her in early 2021, when her in-laws stopped permitting her to speak to her friends on the phone and started controlling all her social interactions. Her parents even told her that divorcing her husband because of her sexual orientation would lead to the family being shamed and it will bring disgrace to them in the society.  On March 7, her mother called her up to inform her that she has contacted a religious guru, who will “cure” her of her sexual orientation. .“Fearing for her safety, the petitioner decided on the same day to leave her matrimonial home so that her family cannot find her and force to undergo dehumanising rituals and ceremonies,” the plea said. She approached an NGO-Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD), seeking a safe house. The NGO then informed the local police station that she has left her matrimonial home on her own accord and approached their office for help. The petition stated that the police, “in brazen breach of law and their statutory obligations, leaked the information of the petitioner’s escape/departure from her matrimonial home and also leaked the contact details of the activists of ANHAD NGO to the petitioner’s father and other family members”. Taking note of the plea, Justice Mukta Gupta directed the police that no NGO members are harassed or harmed for helping her. The court also issued notice to the Delhi government on the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/provide-cover-to-homosexual-woman-court-directs-police/article34041191.ece

Rajasthan has not been getting 1,917 cusecs of water from the Tajewala barrage stipulated by the Central Water Commission (CWC) in 2003. The State government has sent a proposal to the CWC with a detailed project report for bringing water from Tajewala head through pipelines, along with a memorandum of understanding forwarded to the Haryana government for the project’s implementation. Project report Public Health Engineering Minister B.D. Kalla said here that the detailed project report, originally drafted in 2019, had been revised with a provision of Rs. 31,366.86 crore for the project’s two phases. The CWC had earlier approved the proposal on the condition of the Haryana government’s consent to the plan. “The Haryana government didn’t even allow us to conduct a survey. We were forced to carry out the survey with our experts riding in a helicopter,” Mr. Kalla said. He said he had also spoken to Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat about Haryana’s “intransigent attitude”. Deputy Leader of the Opposition Rajendra Rathore moved a call attention motion on the issue in the Assembly on Monday and was assured of the BJP’s support to the government’s efforts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/congress-bjp-in-rajasthan-demand-river-water-share/article34041189.ece
