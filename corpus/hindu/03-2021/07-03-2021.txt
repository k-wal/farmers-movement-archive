07 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||COVID-19 cases breach 18,000 again amid Maharashtra surge||New COVID-19 infections reported on Saturday crossed the 18,000-mark for the first time since January this year. According to the Union Health Ministry, 18,327 new cases were reported, with Maharashtra registering the maximum at 10,216, followed by Kerala at 2,776 and Punjab at 808. The Centre has dispatched teams to Maharashtra and Kerala to visit hotspots and “ascertain reasons for the surge”. India has 1,77,435 active cases and more than 1.11 crore confirmed cases. Last week, a Union Health Ministry team visited Maharashtra and reported that among the possible reasons for the growing number of cases were COVID-inappropriate behaviour due to “lack of fear of disease”, pandemic fatigue, missed cases, super-spreading events, gathering of crowds due to the recent gram panchayat elections, marriage season and the re-opening of schools, and crowded public transport. The report stressed that the situation in Maharashtra was not unique, and a similar combination of events was responsible for a surge in the other States too. ‘New areas’ “The virus is spreading to hitherto unaffected areas and most cases are asymptomatic. People are not forthcoming for strictly following quarantine or getting tests done. Sense is that the current wave is less virulent. The health machinery also may have become lax after cases came down after September,” said the report, based on the visit by a three-member team of epidemiologists and health experts on March 1 and 2, which has now been made public. “Some amongst the doctor fraternity — especially private — may not be counselling patients for testing or following protocols, dismissing it as flu. District/State-wise participative plan, engaging the community may yield better results rather than knee-jerk reactions,” the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-cases-breach-18000-again-amid-maharashtra-surge/article34010048.ece
07 March 2021||Bengaluru,||HC quashes private complaint on 2010 Mangaluru air crash incident||The High Court of Karnataka has quashed a private complaint and cognisance of offences taken by a trial court in 2013 against the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Air India Ltd. (AI) and its executives on the Air India Express 812 plane crash incident outside Mangaluru airport on May 22, 2010, in which 158 persons on board were killed. The judicial magistrate first class, on February 19, 2013, had taken cognisance for offences like culpable homicide not amounting to murder, causing death by negligence under Indian Penal Code against AAI, AI and their executives based on the private complaint lodged on March 6, 2012, by Mangaluru-based 812 Foundation. Justice Ashok G. Nijagannavar passed the order while allowing the petitions filed in 2013 by AAI and its executive Ansbert D’Souza, and AI and its executive Peter Abraham, who had questioned the legality cognisance taken by the magistrate court merely on the basis of “deemed sanction” for their prosecution. The High Court has held that trial court had failed to consider that the charge sheet, filed by the jurisdictional police on the air crash incident, was closed by the trial court on February 13, 2012, as the two pilots of the aircraft, who were the only two named as accused, had also died in the crash. Besides, the magistrate did not consider the report of the Court of Inquiry, conducted as per the law into the air crash, which had specifically pointed out that the crash occurred due to failure of the pilot, the High Court said, while pointing out the trial court, before taking cognisance of offence against the petitioners, had also failed to take into consider that petitioners were not named either in the charge sheet or in the report of the Court of Inquiry. The High Court said the magistrate was not correct in holding that there exist “deemed sanction” for their prosecution as authorities did not decide complainant’s plea for grant of sanction within a specific period. The High Court said there is no concept of “deemed sanction” in law as the period of three to four months suggested by the apex court under Prevention of Corruption and such a suggestion has not been translated into a law by the Central government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-quashes-private-complaint-on-2010-mangaluru-air-crash-incident/article34010561.ece
07 March 2021||Mumbai,||Opinion on Hiren’s death reserved in autopsy report||Opinion on likely cause of the death of Mansukh Hiren, who is said to be the owner of the vehicle with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai last month, was reserved in his post-mortem report on Saturday, a Thane police official said. Viscera of Hiren has been sent to a forensic laboratory in Mumbai for analysis, he said. The body of Hiren (46) was fished out of a creek along Mumbra-Reti Bunder road in Thane on Friday morning, the police had said. The post-mortem report received on Saturday mentioned that there were no visible external injuries on Hiren’s body, the official said. “Hiren’s viscera has been preserved and sent for chemical analysis to the forensic sciences laboratory at Kalina in Mumbai,” he said. The official said drowning was suspected to be the cause of Hiren’s death. On Saturday, senior police officials visited Hiren’s residence at Naupada in Thane with the post-mortem report and convinced his family members to take possession of his body which they had refused to accept earlier for want of autopsy report, he said. “The post-mortem report has been handed over to Hiren’s family members and further process is on,” DCP Avinash Ambure said. Meanwhile, a team of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad probing the recovery of the vehicle outside Mr. Ambani’s residence and Hiren’s death visited the spot at Mumbra creek where his body was found, the official said. Earlier in the day, Mumbai unit BJP president Mangal Prabhat Lodha, MLC Niranjan Davkhare, and local MLA Sanjay Kelkar visited the residence of the deceased. A large contingent of media personnel and relatives of Hiren was also present. A Thane police official had said that Hiren had left his shop around 8.30 p.m. on Thursday in an autorickshaw and since then his phone had been switched off. “His family members had lodged a missing person’s report on Friday morning after he did not return home and a case was registered at Naupada police station. By that time, a body was found at Mumbra and it was later confirmed that the deceased was Hiren,” he had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/opinion-on-hirens-death-reserved-in-autopsy-report/article34010575.ece
07 March 2021||GUNTUR,||Students pursuing professional courses staring at an uncertain future||As the new academic year 2021-22 is dawning, students pursuing professionals courses in the State are staring at an uncertain future. The State government is yet to clear the arrears in lieu of fees reimbursement to the tune of Rs. 2,700 crore, out of which Rs. 700 crore is in lieu of fee reimbursement arrears for 2019-20. Later, the State government has cleared Rs. 500 crore, but Rs. 200 crore is still due. Colleges hit hard “Most of the college managements are at their wits’ end and are having no clue on how to address the situation. On the one hand, the State government is controlling the admissions, and the Andhra Pradesh Fees Regulatory Commission had recommended reduction in the fees, and on the other hand, we are denied the arrears in lieu of fees reimbursements worth crores of rupees. The pandemic had further dealt a blow and we are forced to pay half salaries to the faculty members and all this severely affects the future of students,” said the secretary and correspondent of a noted pharmacy college in Guntur. Some of the college managements have even gone to the extent of taking huge sums of money as credit. The pandemic has forced the college managements to reduce salaries of faculty members and even as the academic year 2020-21 is coming to a close, the State government has not released a single rupee citing financial constraints. Panel recommendations Adding to the woes of the college managements is the recommendation of A.P. Fees Regulatory Commission, suggesting that the tuition fees be reduced by 30% to 50%. Some of the engineering college management had approached the court. The delay in releasing arrears of fees reimbursement is in contrary to the assurances given by the State government that it would take complete responsibility of the tuition fees in professional colleges. Fee Reimbursement is one of the pet schemes of the former Chief Minister Y.S Rajasekhara Reddy, which had made it possible for lakhs of students belonging to socially, economically backward sections to pursue professional courses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/students-pursuing-professional-courses-staring-at-an-uncertain-future/article34010042.ece
07 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||As campaign picks up, people fear increase in COVID cases||With the municipal election campaign picking up momentum, people in the city fear increase in number of COVID-19 cases. A large number of public meetings and rallies are being organised as part of the election campaign in which safety norms are totally ignored. “We were confined to our houses for almost two months, when the pandemic was at its peak last year. Smell of sanitisers and bleaching powder emanated from our colonies. Over 100 people were affected due to the virus and more than 10 persons died. We hope those dreadful days didn’t recur. But the news of second COVID wave is frightening us,” said K. Sagar, a resident of Kobbarithota, which was a hotspot last year. The cases were at the peak stage during July, August and September 2020. In mid week of September, the district had 717 clusters, including over 100 very active and active clusters. Fortunately, cases started to decline from the end of September and since the second week of November 2020, the COVID-19 single day tally has never crossed 100 in the city. During January and February, it further dropped to a single digit. A few areas, which have been witnessing vigorous election campaign, were earlier containment zones. After a few States like Maharashtra started to witness the second wave, a few locals, especially those from containment zones, are in a panic mode. For the last 10 days, Peda Jalaripeta, Appughar and a few areas in One Town have been witnessing election campaigning almost every day. Party activists are conducting door-to-door canvassing, organising rallies, roadshows and public meetings with entertainment programmes. “Yes we do fear a second wave, but these cannot be avoided. None of the locals here follow safety norms. Many are not taking COVID-19 seriously since the recovery rate is high,” said Sudhakar (name changed), a shopkeeper from MVP Circle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/as-campaign-picks-up-people-fear-increase-in-covid-cases/article34010605.ece
07 March 2021||Mumbai,||State’s active cases rise to 92,897||With the addition of more than 10,000 fresh COVID-19 cases on the second consecutive day on Saturday, Maharashtra’s tally crossed the 22 lakh mark and reached 22,08,586, the State Health Department said, adding that the last one lakh cases were reported in just 13 days owing to the fresh outbreaks in Vidarbha, Mumbai and Pune. The State added 10,187 cases during the day and counted 47 deaths, taking the overall toll to 52,440. The previous day, Maharashtra reported 10,216 new infections, which were the highest additions in a single day in the last five months. COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra crossed the 21 lakh mark on February 21 after adding over one lakh cases in almost 31 days to its previous tally of 20,00,878. However, owing to the fresh outbreak of infections in the Vidarbha region and in Mumbai and Pune, the next one lakh cases were added in just 13 days after February 21 to breach the 22 lakh mark on Saturday, as per the data. Of the 47 fatalities, 30 occurred in the last 48 hours while 10 had occurred in the last week. Remaining seven deaths had been reported before last week, a Health Department official said. In comparison to 10,187 new cases during the day, 6,080 patients were discharged from hospitals, taking the overall number of recoveries in Maharashtra to 20,62,031, the department said. The State is now left with 92,897 active cases while the case recovery rate is 93.36%. The fatality rate was 2.37%, it said. Mumbai city reported 1,188 fresh cases in the day while five persons died due to COVID-19, taking the case tally to 3,32,208 and the toll to 11,500, the department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-active-cases-rise-to-92897/article34010576.ece
07 March 2021||Kochi,||Accident prevention steps at 14 black spots||The National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) is set to commence rectification measures for 14 of the 39 high-risk accident-prone black spots in Ernakulam that the agency had identified based on data from 2016 to 2018. High-risk spots The 14 locales are part of the total 75 high-risk black spots that the agency had identified on State highways and other roads, which it will rectify using funds provided by the Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA). The 25 other black spots in Ernakulam are in national highway corridors that are maintained by either the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) or the PWD (NH Wing). These agencies that avail funds provided by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) will have to take steps to mitigate accidents. Ernakulam has 19 moderate-risk black spots, which take their total number to 58. “NATPAC has completed data collection on the 14 locales, while rectification of [unscientific] design of accident-prone roads and junctions is under way,” said Ebin Sam, scientist in charge of NATPAC’s Kozhikode regional centre. He had led a team that mapped high-risk black spots and readied their list in 2019. “In addition, KRSA issued a work order to us on Friday, to identify more high-risk accident spots like the steep curve at Elamkulam on Sahodaran Ayyappan Road [which claimed the life of nine young two-wheeler riders and an autorickshaw driver during the past six months], based on data from 2018 to 2020 and to take rectification measures,” he added. Black spots are identified based on accident data during a three-year time span, as per MORTH guidelines. The locales are then prioritised on the basis of their accident-prone nature. It generally takes six months to conduct a detailed study of black spots, following which NATPAC suggests both short- and long-term measures to avert accidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/accident-prevention-steps-at-14-black-spots/article34010550.ece
07 March 2021||New Delhi,||HC denies extension of interim bail, orders 3,499 prisoners to surrender||The Delhi High Court has directed 3,499 undertrial prisoners, who were granted interim bail to decongest jails here amid the COVID-19 pandemic, to surrender on expiry of their bail period. The court’s order, passed on March 3 and made available on Saturday, was based on the recommendation of a high-powered committee constituted on the direction of the Supreme Court. ‘Not inclined’ A Bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh said it was “not inclined” to further extend the period of interim bail granted to the undertrial prisoners under various criteria laid down by the committee in its several meetings. “It is therefore directed that all the 3,499 undertrial prisoners, who have not obtained regular bails from their court concerned, or any other superior court to its court concerned, shall surrender before the jail superintendent upon the expiry of the period of their interim bail commencing from March 7,” the Bench said. The High Court considered the observations and recommendations made by the committee and the improved COVID-19 situation in Delhi-NCR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-denies-extension-of-interim-bail-orders-3499-prisoners-to-surrender/article34010276.ece
07 March 2021||Kolkata,||Six BJP activists injured in bomb blast in Bengal||Six BJP activists were injured, two of them critically, in a bomb explosion in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district, police said on Saturday. Family members of the injured have alleged that a few members of the local Trinamool Congress hurled bombs at them while they were returning home in Gosaba area of the district from a wedding ceremony late Friday night. Police, however, claimed that the accident occurred inside the house of a BJP activist where the crude bombs which were being manufactured went off accidentally. “We have listened to the claims of the family members of those injured but it seems that they were manufacturing bombs when it exploded. We are investigating the matter and talking to locals,” an officer said when contacted over the phone. Unconfirmed reports said that on Friday night, Gosaba witnessed clashes between TMC and BJP activists when bombs were hurled at each other, leaving six injured. Nobody had been arrested in connection with the blast, the police officer said. The injured were undergoing treatment at Canning Sub-Divisional Hospital, he said. A large number of policemen had been deployed there as sleuths of the bomb squad and forensic department reached the spot, the officer said. Gosaba is scheduled to vote in the second phase of the Assembly elections on April 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/six-bjp-activists-injured-in-bomb-blast-in-bengal/article34010171.ece
07 March 2021||Kolkata,||WB parties locked in fight to the finish||West Bengal is poised for a high stakes, historic Assembly polls for 2021 that will be held over a record 33 days in eight phases. The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) that has been in power for ten years is not only grappling with anti-incumbency but is also faced with the challenge of a dramatic rise of the BJP. This is the first time in the political history of West Bengal that the BJP has emerged as a challenger to the ruling party. The TMC, which in the past few months has been dealing with a series of defections, is relying on the charisma of West Bengal Chief Minister and party chairperson Mamata Banerjee to tide over the toughest political challenge the party has ever faced since 2011.  Even after ten years in power Mamata Banerjee remains the tallest leader and the biggest crowd puller in the State. The TMC government under Ms. Banerjee claims to have launched 70 welfare schemes, including conditional cash transfer to girls and women and the much-touted universal health scheme Swasthsathi where cards have been issued in the name of the eldest woman of the family. A carefully crafted campaign of the TMC aims to retain people’s faith in Ms. Banerjee by projecting her as “Bengal’s own daughter”. The ruling party has also brought to fore the issue of identity in the polls, dubbing the BJP an “outsider” party, emphasising that “Bengal will be governed by people of the State and not by people from Gujarat”. Slogans like “Joy Bangla” raised at public gatherings are coupled with projecting Ms. Banerjee as crusader for “Bengali pride”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/wb-parties-locked-in-fight-to-the-finish/article34010173.ece
07 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||Maoists kill former militia member||Members of the banned CPI (Maoists) allegedly killed a 35-year-old tribal person and former militia member after branding him as a police informer, at Kothapalem village near Mandipalli under G.K. Veedhi police station limits in the Agency area of Visakhapatnam district, late on Friday night. The deceased was identified as Korra Pilku, a resident of Kothapalem According to ASP of Chintapalle, Ch. Vidhya Sagar Naidu, Pilku allegedly was an active militia member about a year ago. He allegedly used to supply food, provide accommodation and make other arrangements for the Maoists. However, since the last six months, he started to stay away from Maoists. The ASP said that since he stopped working for the Maoists, the rebels grew suspicious about him. They put pressure on him several times to cooperate with them, but Pilku reportedly refused. Suspecting that he had become a police informer, the extremists tried to kill him on couple of occasions, but he managed to escape. About 15 Maoists, reportedly led by Kakuri Pandana alias Jagan of Galikonda area committee, came to the village late on Friday night and asked him to accompany them. His family members and other villages protested and urged the Maoists to leave him. But they promised to return him back after questioning him, said Superintendent of Police B. Krishna Rao. The Maoists killed him by beating him with sticks and hacking him with axes late in the night. “They wanted to set an example and create fear among other villagers,” Mr. Naidu said. The victim is survived with a wife and four children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maoists-kill-former-militia-member/article34010045.ece
07 March 2021||Silikote /Balkote,||Villagers relish peace as guns fall silent along LoC||Living just 850 metres away from the Pakistan Army positions on the hill slopes of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), villagers of Balkote and Silikote, near the Line of Control (LoC) in Baramulla’s Uri, are finally picking up the threads of life, left frayed by frequent shelling and sniping in the past three years. It has been more than a week since the guns have fallen silent on the LoC, after the renewed pact on the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. However, people here are waiting and watching how long the ceasefire will hold, as the two countries take tentative steps after a gap of five years. Tentative calm While the soldiers manning the LoC in Uri remain on guard, a sense of calm is visible on their faces. Keeping a close watch on the movement on the other side of the LoC, many soldiers, not officially authorised to talk to the media, told The Hindu that the ceasefire was being strictly adhered to by both sides. “The free hand given to the soldiers earlier is no more in vogue,” a soldier, on the condition of anonymity, said. At a number of posts with small boards reading ‘No open movement, sniper zone’, relaxed soldiers could be seen milling around. Earlier, such zones were no-go areas to escape Pakistani snipers positioned on the hill slope. Deep wounds For the scores of border residents, the peace may come as a time for healing, though many scars remain fresh. The eldest of five siblings, 15-year-old Shahista Bano, daughter of labourer Bashir Ahmad Dar, has been forced to take on the role of a mother. Her mother, Farooqa Begum, was killed on November 13 last year by a powerful shell fired from PoK that hit their home as she was climbing to the attic to store firewood. “There was a loud explosion. The house was filled with light followed by dust. I turned into a stone. What I saw later was the mutilated body of my mother. She was lying dead, while the smoke had turned every wall black,” recalled Shahista, her voice overcome with grief. Now she takes care of her siblings, as her father goes to work. “I doubt if I can continue my schooling. My dream of donning the uniform of a policewoman was dashed with the killing of my mother,” the teenager said. Officials said 22 civilians were killed in the more than 5,133 incidents of border skirmishes along the LoC in 2020, the highest number of violations since the Karg il W ar . Uri — like the border villages of Rajouri, Poonch, Samba, Kathua, Bandipora and Kupwara districts — too turned into a theatre of war at least 21 times last year. Five civilians and three soldiers lost their lives, five suffered major injuries, and around 16 houses were damaged in the cross-border firing, according to official figures. Nadir Hussian Shah, a resident, said both his legs had to be amputated after being hit by shell shrapnel. In a changing pattern, Pakistan resorted to unprecedented heavy calibre artillery shelling in June and November last year. “It was no more a minor picket-to-picket skirmish but would engulf a wide range of area immediately after the first bullet was fired. It was a bloody year in 2020, where civilians were finding it hard to find shelter. We did our best to save their lives,” said Junaid Wali, Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Uri, showing a sophisticated, lead-heavy bullet that hit his office in June last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/villagers-relish-peace-as-guns-fall-silent-along-loc/article34010049.ece
07 March 2021||Mumbai,||BJP plans public meetings to highlight MVA govt. failures||A day after demanding a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the death of Mansukh Hiren linked to the Scorpio found with explosives outside the house of Mukesh Ambani, the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday said that the party would hold 20,000 small public meetings across the State, claiming that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government was criminalising politics. “The State government is extending protection to criminals. Even ministers are being named in cases related to atrocities against women. Those ministers are being provided protection. The State seems to be playing a suspicious role in the Hiren death case,” BJP State president and MLA Chandrakant Patil said. Mr. Patil on Saturday held a meeting with State and district-level office-bearers of the party. The objective behind the BJP’s public meetings is to create public awareness of the lawlessness due to failures of the State government and its anti-people policies. On Friday, former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis demanded an NIA probe into the case of vehicle laden with explosives and death of Hiren. While Mr. Fadnavis said that the car belonged to Hiren, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh denied it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjp-plans-public-meetings-to-highlight-mva-govt-failures/article34010574.ece

MDMK leader Vaiko signed the agreement with DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday. With this, the MDMK will, for the first time, contest in an Assembly election as part of the DMK-led front. Coming out of the DMK headquarters, Mr. Vaiko, who created the MDMK after he quit the DMK in 1994, told journalists that the decision to contest on the DMK symbol was due to a “practical necessity”. Mr. Vaiko reasoned that a party needs to contest in 12 Assembly constituencies if it requires a symbol of its own and it needs to garner 5% of the votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dmk-gives-six-seats-to-vaiko/article34010278.ece

The Congress was left with not many options after the DMK refused to concede its demand for 30 seats. Many in the Congress had been talking of walking out of the alliance if the demand was not met. Some leaders also floated the option of tying up with actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam as a last resort. Pushed to the wall owing to the lack of strong alternatives, the Congress settled for 25 seats. The development came nearly three hours after Mr. Alagiri told reporters on the sidelines of a public meeting that a seat-sharing arrangement would be announced soon. Several leaders told The Hindu on Friday evening that the possibility of signing a deal was likely only on Monday since the DMK’s mega rally in Tiruchi was scheduled for Sunday.    “We have reached an agreement.

In the past week, several Congress leaders had been insisting on “dignity for the party in the alliance and the number of seats”. On Friday, a senior leader told The Hindu that back-channel talks were taking place between the two parties. A source in New Delhi said the central leadership was miffed at the State unit for fumbling on the seat-sharing exercise though it was given a free hand. The central leadership felt that winning a higher number of the allotted seats was more important than contesting in more seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cong-settles-for-25-seats/article34010459.ece

Manjula in Hindupur on Saturday. On the third day of his election campaign in Hindupur Municipality, Mr. Balakrishna was reportedly unhappy with the low turnout of people for his ‘road show’ and decided to hold some private conversation with the candidate and other party leaders, when Somu was reportedly recording video on the cell phone. Allegedly enraged at the act, Mr. Balakrishna slapped him and asked him to delete the video. The party functionaries immediately rushed the fan out of the house, who later identified himself as the brother-in-law of the candidate.

07 March 2021||CHENNAI,||DMK allots six seats to MDMK||The DMK has given its ally, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), six seats to contest on its Rising Sun symbol. MDMK leader Vaiko signed the agreement with DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday. With this, the MDMK will, for the first time, contest in an Assembly election as part of the DMK-led front. Coming out of the DMK headquarters, Mr. Vaiko, who created the MDMK after he quit the DMK in 1994, told journalists that the decision to contest on the DMK symbol was due to a “practical necessity”. A symbol of its own Mr. Vaiko reasoned that a party needs to contest in 12 Assembly constituencies if it requires a symbol of its own and it needs to garner 5% of the votes. With six seats, the MDMK might be forced to contest on six different symbols. With not much time left for campaigning, it was decided to contest on the DMK symbol to avoid unnecessary complications, he said. Asked whether he would undertake a State-wide campaign for the DMK, Mr. Vaiko said he would certainly do so. Sanathana Hindutva forces were making a massive effort to establish themselves in Tamil Nadu, the land of Periyar and Anna. They were trying to impose not only Hindi and Sanskrit but also Sanathana dharma, he said. In the past, thousands had suffered to protect the Dravidian movement. Their efforts should not go waste, and there was a necessity to counter and defeat the BJP’s slaves, he said. Stand united Furthermore, when DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi was in hospital, he visited him along with Mr. Stalin, Mr. Vaiko said. “I promised to stand by brother Stalin as I stood by Kalaignar,” he recalled, adding that he had been campaigning since then for the DMK. Asked whether it was a challenge to contest as part of the DMK-led front for the first time, Mr. Vaiko said, “He was happy.” Questioned how he viewed Mr. Stalin as a chief ministerial candidate, he said the DMK president was an efficient legislator who had all the qualifications to be a Chief Minister.

07 March 2021||Kolkata,||Hard-charging BJP and unrelenting Trinamool||West Bengal is poised for a high-stakes, historic Assembly election that will be held over a record 33 days in eight phases. The ruling Trinamool Congress, which has been in power for 10 years, is not only grappling with the anti-incumbency factor but is also faced with the challenge of a dramatic rise of the BJP. This is the first time in the political history of West Bengal that the BJP has emerged as a challenger to the ruling party. The Trinamool, which in the past few months has been dealing with a series of defections, is relying on the charisma of West Bengal Chief Minister and party chairperson Mamata Banerjee to tide over the toughest political challenge the party has ever faced since 2011. Biggest draw Even after 10 years in power, Ms. Banerjee remains the tallest leader and the biggest crowd puller in the State. Her government claims to have launched 70 welfare schemes, including conditional cash transfer to girls and women and the much-touted universal health scheme Swasthsathi that issues cards in the name of the eldest woman of the family. A carefully crafted campaign of the Trinamool aims to retain people’s faith in Ms. Banerjee by projecting her as “Bengal’s own daughter”. The ruling party has also brought to the fore the issue of identity in the polls, dubbing the BJP an “outsider” party, emphasising that “Bengal will be governed by people of the State and not by people from Gujarat”. Slogans like “Joy Bangla” raised at public gatherings are coupled with projecting Ms. Banerjee as a crusader for “Bengali pride”. The BJP’s rise in West Bengal has been at the centre of a political churn in the State for the past few years. From a miniscule 4% in 2011 and 10.16% in 2016, the BJP’s vote share increased to 40.3% in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, enabling the party to win 18 of the 42 seats. Since 2019, the BJP, which lacked an organisational base in the State, has used defections as a political tool and inducted senior Trinamool leaders like Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee who have a significant support base and acceptability among the masses. The saga of defections has continued even after the election dates were announced. In a State starved of industry and employment, which sees a huge migration for work, the BJP is selling the dream of a Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal)”. The party has also relentlessly targeted the Trinamool, accusing it of denying benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi and non-implementation of Ayushman Bharat schemes in the State. The party has promised Rs. 14,000 — the sum of seven instalments of the PM Kisan scheme since it was started — to each of the 73 lakh farmers if it comes to power. Apart from the development plank, the BJP is not shying away from using religious rhetoric to polarise the electorate. While the BJP is raising issues of “illegal infiltration” and accusing the Trinamool of indulging in “appeasement politics”, it is maintaining a strategic silence on the implementation of the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which Ms. Banerjee has vehemently opposed. The BJP is also trying to reach out and placate the Matua sect, largely Hindu refugees from Bangladesh who are pressing for CAA implementation. Both the Trinamool and the BJP are also locked in a bitter contest on appropriation of cultural icons of West Bengal, a process that started months before the polls were announced. The tussle was visible on several high-profile occasions including the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and recent events at Rabindranath Tagore’s Visva-Bharati University. The third player in the political matrix, the Left-Congress alliance, which was the main Opposition force till 2019, has got a new lease of life as fresh political equations emerged after they roped in influential Islamist leader and Furfura Sharief peer Abbas Siddiqui’s newly formed party Indian Secular Front. What makes the combination of the Left and the Congress with the ISF effective is their ability to influence Muslim voters. By the last Census, the Muslim population in the State is about 27.01% There are 75 Assembly seats out of 294 where Muslims are in a majority. Even in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Trinamool maintained a lead in 80% of these Assembly seats. Any possible split in Muslim votes will pose a challenge for the ruling party. The significance of the Left-Congress-ISF combine became clear, particularly after the Brigade rally on February 28, indicating that the polls were not going to be a bipolar contest. For both the Left and the Congress whose support base has been going down, the 2021 Assembly poll is a battle to re-establish their relevance in State politics. Leaders of both parties say that they are presenting the real alternative to the people against the “competitive communalism” of the BJP and the Trinamool. The Left still has a dedicated cadre base that was evident in the recent Brigade rally and other programmes, while the Congress has maintained its dominance over certain districts in central Bengal such as Malda and Murshidabad. As the campaign gains momentum, another provocative slogan has been raised by both the Trinamool and the BJP — Khela hobe (the game will be played) — implying a threat of political violence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hard-charging-bjp-and-unrelenting-trinamool/article34009946.ece
07 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala CM ups the ante in Customs stand-off||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday upped the ante in the Left Democratic Front government’s stand-off with the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate over the alleged "role" of the top political executive in the foreign currency smuggling aspect of the UAE consulate-linked illegal gold importation case. The Customs had taken over the task of disseminating political hyperbole to advantage the BJP-Congress axis in Kerala. The Customs Commissioner (Preventive) now spearheaded the propaganda campaign against the LDF government, he said. The official had wrongfully impleaded in a case in which the Prisons and Correctional Department, COFEPOSA detainee Swapna Suresh and an Assistant Commissioner, Customs (Preventive), were respondents. The official had thus created a fig leaf of an excuse to insinuate that Swapna had ‘‘stated with clarity about the smuggling of foreign currency at the instance of Hon'ble Chief Minister (Pinarayi Vijayan) and Hon'ble Speaker (P. Sreeramakrishnan).’’ He had cherry-picked portions of Swapna's sworn statement to tarnish the government. The official had acted like the cat’s paw of the Congress-BJP axis, he said. The Chief Minister said the official leaked the statement to the media to advantage the Opposition. The official had violated the confidential nature of sworn depositions. The government would seek legal recourse to counter the unabashed act of defamation and violation of the election code. Mr. Vijayan's defiant take on the Central agency came against the backdrop of LDF protest marches to Customs offices in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode. The government also seemed set for a run-in with Commissioner Customs (Preventive) Sumit Kumar, who remarked about the LDF protests in a Facebook post: "A political party is trying intimidation, will not work". The Chief Minister said Swapna had given the sworn statement under duress. She had not raised such allegations in her initial statements to the Customs, Enforcement Directorate (ED) or National Intelligence Agency (NIA).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-cm-ups-the-ante-in-customs-stand-off/article34009978.ece
07 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Inoculations inch close to 2 crore||Close to 2 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered since the programme began on January 16 with 7.6 lakh senior citizens and 1.4 lakh persons aged above 45 and with comorbidities getting their first dose on Saturday. Nearly 70 lakh healthcare workers (HCWs) have been vaccinated with at least one dose of either Covaxin or Covishield and 34 lakh of them have got their follow-up doses after at least four weeks, the recommended schedule. Nearly 63 lakh frontline workers (FLWs) have been inoculated with one dose with 14 lakh getting a second dose. The second phase of the vaccination drive appears to be inoculating more people than during the first phase of the exercise. Close to 7 to 8 lakh have been inoculated for most days last week as opposed to the 1 to 3 lakh HCWs workers in the early weeks of the vaccination programme. The second dose of COVID-19 vaccination started on February 13, 2021 for those beneficiaries who have completed 28 days after the first dose. Vaccination of the FLWs started on February 2. The second phase of COVID-19 vaccination commenced from March 1, 2021 for those who were over 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions. So far 3.5 lakh beneficiaries aged more than 45 years with specific comorbidities have got their first dose and 24 lakh who are 60 and above have got their first doses. The government plans to inoculate at least 300 million of the HCW, FLW, seniors and the specific subset of those over 45 by September. Unless there is a massive acceleration in vaccination this exercise might extend well into 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/inoculations-inch-close-to-2-crore/article34010016.ece

This comes a day after Ms. Banerjee announced that she will contest from Nandigram instead of Bhawanipur in Kolkata. The Trinamool supremo is expected to arrive in Nandigram on March 9 and will file nomination papers on March 11. The constituency will go to the polls in the second phase on April 1. Soon after the announcement, the BJP supporters in Nandigram came out on the streets hailing it. Nandigram came into prominence in March 2007 when 14 villagers were killed in police firing and subsequent violence while protesting against forcible land acquisition by the CPI(M)-led Left Front government. Both Ms. Banerjee and Mr. Adhikari were the most prominent faces leading the fight against the Left regime. The BJP on Saturday announced the list of 57 candidates out of the 60 Assembly seats that will go to the polls in the first two phases. This included former IPS officer and State vice-president Bharati Ghosh from the Debra seat and former cricketer Ashok Dinda from the Moyna seat. The BJP left Baghmundi in Purulia district to its ally All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU). It is yet to announce candidates for three seats in the first and second phases on March 27 and April 1 respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/its-adhikari-vs-mamata-in-nandigram/article34009996.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||‘BJP is the only party to better performance in Kerala’||Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan speaks on the BJP’s chances in the Assembly election in Kerala.  What is the thinking around pushing for a chief ministerial candidate on behalf of the BJP in the Kerala Assembly polls, specifically with regard to E. Sreedharan? On Thursday, I had seen some news media reports that Mr. Sreedharan was decided on as a chief ministerial face. But later on, when I spoke to the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) State unit president, who said that during the course of his speech, related to issues of development in Kerala, he had said that people would like to see a Chief Minister like E. Sreedharan in place of Pinarayi Vijayan or Oommen Chandy. This was misunderstood by the media as an announcement and it was reported, but since no such announcement has been made, a clarification was made. But is the Kerala unit veering around to the view that a chief ministerial face needs to be projected? It has not been discussed with me at least, possibly with the State unit president, whatever the case, it will be acceptable to me as a party worker. The BJP claims that it has up to 15% vote in Kerala, but your performance in the recently concluded local body polls has not been encouraging. How do you square your claims with what happened in the local body poll? First of all, even in the local body polls we polled a similar number in poll percentage, and we can’t say that the BJP’s performance was not good. We are the only party that improved its performance from the last time around, we saw an increase in the number of seats we won. Who do you consider your main rival in Kerala, the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) or the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF)? Both. We don’t differentiate between the two, as we don’t think that they are in any way different from each other. Governments led by both parties have had corruption allegations laid against them. But whose victory will be more advantageous to your future expansion? We like to think that our growth will be regardless and we would like to win decisively. The Sabarimala issue had given a lot of traction to the BJP in Kerala but the local body polls again did not reflect this traction. Is the Sabarimala issue still alive for the BJP? I don’t think that any issue is there for years together, issues keep on changing, but BJP is the only party in Kerala that has grown steadily from 6% vote to 15%-16%. We have almost tripled our strength. In Sabarimala in the 2019 polls, people felt that the Left Front government should be taught a lesson, and though BJP was at the forefront of the agitation, they felt that for them to ensure the defeat of CPI(M), they should vote for the UDF. But in the local body polls, the LDF did well in areas around Sabarimala. See, Lok Sabha elections are different from local body elections and, going ahead, issues in the Assembly polls will be even more different. So one cannot compare one election to another. Then, if not Sabarimala, what will be the main plank for your campaign? Development that the BJP can bring and the misrule by both the LDF and UDF governments. On the question of development, Kerala ranks quite high in all sorts of development indices and the current government has gathered kudos for its handling of the pandemic as well, so won’t that be a difficult narrative to defeat? See, you also might have read the reports, that now almost 70% of COVID-19 cases are from Kerala and Maharashtra. Secondly, if Kerala ranks so high on development indices, how come Kerala has the largest number of expatriates? People [are] not finding jobs in the State and [are] having to travel out. Yes, the State ranks high in term of human capital, it’s an educated society with hard working people, called ‘God’s Own Country’, but this hard work is not used up in Kerala. So, development is not there in the way that it should be.  We don’t differentiate between the UDF and LDF, as we don’t think that they are in any way different from each other||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-is-the-only-party-to-better-performance-in-kerala/article34009944.ece
07 March 2021||Hyderabad,||Now, a help desk for transgenders||In what is claimed to be the first-of-its-kind gender inclusive community policing initiative in the country, Cyberabad police on Saturday inaugurated a ‘Transgender Community Desk’ at Gachibowli police station. Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said the desk will be managed by a police liaison officer and a transgender person who is designated as community coordinator. “It will be the focal point for all grievance redressal among transgender community in Cyberabad Commissionerate. The desk will provide support to file cases in offences related to violence or discrimination against any transgender person,” he said. Among other services the desk will also provide counselling, legal aid, life skills, soft skills training, job placements, and referral linkages to welfare schemes in partnership with the Department of Women and Child Welfare, and District Legal Services Authority. Creating jobs, safe spaces According to Mr.Sajjanar, a couple of multi-national companies have already come forward offering jobs, and the Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) will also organise monthly training, employability, life-skill training and facilitate access to job opportunities, while Prajwala, a non-governmental organisation, would assist the desk to facilitate safe space for any transgender person who needs emergency transit stay. Over 200 transgender persons participated in the event, during which Mr. Sajjanar spoke about the need to build an inclusive society ensuring equal opportunities for all. He assured to facilitate meetings with all government departments to converge the existing government welfare schemes for the benefit of the transgender community. Further, the Commissioner urged the district administration to consider the transgender community for the weaker section housing scheme and advised the community members to find exit options from alms-seeking and prostitution. Earlier, Sunitha Krishnan of Prajwala said, “This is a historic moment and paves the way for a long journey of building bridges to create an equitable society for all. As the first-ever initiative in the country, the community desk will play a critical role in not just addressing the violence but also providing access and referral linkages to all existing welfare schemes.”  This is a historic moment and paves the way for a long journey of building bridges to create an equitable society for all.

07 March 2021||Hyderabad,||CEO among 24 persons arrested for MLM fraud||Twenty-four persons, including three government school teachers from Telangana, associated with Indus Viva (IndusViva HealthSciences Pvt. Ltd.), a Rs. 1,500 crore multi-level marketing business with over 10 lakh members across the country, were arrested by the Cyberabad Commissionerate’s Economic Offences Wing here on Saturday. Over Rs. 20 crore in various bank accounts were frozen. Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said that the arrested include Indus Viva’s CEO Abhilash Thomas (40), COO Prem Kumar (39), director Mandalanen Subramanyam (57) and government teachers, Mulugu Venkatesh (45) from Yadagirigutta, Kasani Shesha Rao (47) from Khammam and Manepu Hari Prasad (40) from Miryalaguda. The government teachers availed long leaves from their service to promote the MLM trade and were earning more than Rs. 10 lakh per month. Their wives were also taken into custody. Based on the complaint lodged by a victim, Gachibowli police registered a case against the firm on February 20 and launched a probe. The victim told the police that he was cheated by the company that promoted its products like coffee and juice by offering attractive income. He got attracted to the schemes and invested Rs. 12,500 in Indus Viva through his promoters Hari Prasad and Rajabanoth. “The complainant didn’t receive any commission on his investment. Later, he realised that he was cheated,” Mr. Sajjanar said. He said that the scheme was to earn money by enrolling members in Indus Viva Plan. To become a member, one has to pay Rs. 12,500 and buy their products and then, they will get 100 point value. Then he/she would be issued a user ID and password for continuing the scheme. More than one lakh people were duped from Telangana. “Thus, the member has to enrol others with one person to the left and one person to the right by paying Rs. 12,500 each, and would earn Rs. 1,000 as bonus. To get these benefits, the member has to enrol two other members in the scheme and within a week he can get Rs. 1,000 as an additional bonus. Thus, the member has to enrol more members to earn money,” the commissioner said. The accused company also offered a President Club Member (PCM), which attracts a lot of people. “One can join PCM by paying Rs. 1.5 lakh and the company would provide 50 products besides giving products worth Rs. 25,000 free. The organisers say that a person who joins PCM could get an opportunity to dine with the CEO of the company in Bengaluru,” the officer said. Depending on the enrolment, promoters would get ruby, sapphire, star, black diamond ranks. Every year, the company conducted a star summit with employees, who earn Rs. 1 lakh and above as commission, and sent them to foreign trips. “This is a family business, if a wife becomes a member then automatically the husband would be a member and vice versa,” the officer said. He said that the company has its own production unit ‘Olive Life Sciences’ in Bengaluru for health, beauty, and dietary products, which do not have approval by any government agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ceo-among-24-persons-arrested-for-mlm-fraud/article34009982.ece
07 March 2021||NEW DELHI/Colombo,||India, Japan cool to Colombo offer of new port project||Days after the Sri Lankan Vabinet decided to allocate Colombo’s West Container Terminal (WCT) to an Adani Group consortium to compensate for cancelling the East Container Terminal (ECT) agreement, previously signed by India and Japan, both New Delhi and Tokyo have signalled their distancing from the decision. “Our High Commission in Colombo has already conveyed to the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) that their media release, in so far as their reference to the approval of the (Indian) High Commission, is factually incorrect,” Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on Friday, speaking about the Cabinet notification issued on March 1 (https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/cabinet-decisions) that had said the proposal presented by the Adani group and Special Economic Zone Ltd, a consortium called APSEZ, had been “approved” by the Indian High Commission. “We understand that GoSL has engaged directly with investors on this project,” added Mr. Srivastava, indicating that New Delhi had not been apprised of the negotiations directly. The Japanese government has not yet responded officially to the Sri Lankan offer for the WCT, but it had reacted sharply to being ousted from the previous Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) with India and Sri Lanka for the neighbouring ECT project, and had called the decision “regrettable”. “We (Japan) have been in touch with (governments of) India and Sri Lanka, but Japan has not made any decision regarding the West Coast Terminal (WCT),” a senior diplomatic official told The Hindu on Friday. However, another diplomatic source said both India and Japan were keen to remain engaged in Sri Lanka. When it was signed in May 2019, the trilateral MoC between India, Japan and Sri Lanka for the ECT was a government-to-government agreement, expected to send a strong strategic signal in the region, as India and Japan planned to collaborate to fund and develop infrastructure projects in South Asia, where thus far China had a bigger role. Japan is understood to have offered very generous terms at the time, for a 40-year soft loan with a 0.1% interest rate to help fund the ECT. Japan’s reluctance to accept the WCT offer instead of the ECT could be a blow to the new agreement, which is now a public-private partnership driven by the Adani group. “In the Sri Lanka port project, Adani group is committed to make investment to the tune of $400 million (approximately Rs. 3,000 cr) to develop the terminal and other infrastructure,” a senior Adani Group representative said in response to a query. He added that the investment would be met from the company’s own resources, and not linked to funding from Japan.

07 March 2021||HYDERABAD,||Double-deckers to delight Hyderabad again||Acting on nostalgia of double-decker buses which once plied the city roads, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) had called for tenders for 25 such buses. While four companies engaged in vehicle, or bus body manufacturing had taken tender forms, only one has sent its bid. The transport juggernaut had issued a notice inviting tenders (NIT) for 25 fully built, non-AC, intra-city, double-decker buses, and adhering to BS–VI emission standards. As a part of the NIT, bidders would have to design, build, manufacture, test, supply and commission the buses. The pre-bidding was scheduled to be on February 18, and the last day of submitting the bids was February 25. According to those who are familiar with recent developments, the four companies which had connected with the transport juggernaut in connection with the bidding are Eicher, Veera Vahan, M G, and Ashok Leyland. The sources confirmed that only Ashok Leyland sent the tender. The bidders are expected to make their submissions in two envelopes — one would be the technical bid and the other a financial bid. So far, the TSRTC has accessed only the technical bid. “The officials have to first scrutinise the technical bid. Opening the financial bid comes later. We will see what happens as a decision will have to be taken by the top management,” a TSRTC official said. Soon after the NIT was announced, TSRTC officials studies possible routes on which these buses could ply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/double-deckers-to-delight-hyderabad-again/article34009975.ece
07 March 2021||Kolkata,||Many Trinamool MLAs denied ticket keen on joining BJP||Several leaders of the Trinamool Congress including half a dozen MLAs have come out in the open protesting against the party decision to deny them ticket. Some of them broke down before journalists while expressing disappointment and some expressed willingness to join the BJP. The list includes Sonali Guha, Satgachia MLA and close confidant of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. “Why did she do this to me. I was like her family member… She did not even call to tell me why I was denied ticket,” Ms. Guha said. She said she approached BJP leader Mukul Roy and was keen on joining the saffron party. Dipali Saha, MLA from Sonamukhi in Bankura, who was also denied ticket joined the BJP on Saturday. The MLAs who could not hide their emotions include Moinuddin Shams (Nalhati), Naresh Barui (Dubrajpur) and Shampa Daripa (Bankura). Jatu Lahiri, 84, MLA from Shibpur in Howrah district, also announced his decision to quit the TMC. Party strongman and former MLA Arabul Islam has also made his disappointment public after being denied ticket from Bhangar in South 24 Parganas. Not only were there protests but supporters blocked prominent roads and national highways and in places like Bhangar attacked party offices. Sources in the Trinamool said there was no question of any alterations to the list announced on Saturday. The list is a result of careful surveys conducted over the past several months and the party has given importance to winnability. More than 26 MLAs have been dropped from the list.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/many-trinamool-mlas-denied-ticket-keen-on-joining-bjp/article34009998.ece
07 March 2021||GURUGRAM,||Farmers in Haryana block highway||Hundreds of farmers, including women, held a blockade at five points on the 135-km Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway, connecting five districts of Haryana, on Saturday to mark 100 days of the agitation around Delhi in protest against the farm laws. The protests led to traffic snarls at a few points and the police diverted traffic to avoid inconvenience to the commuters. In response to a call from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, joint front of the farmer unions, the farmers from various protest sites along the highway assembled at different points on the road around 11 a.m. They blocked the traffic at two points each in Sonipat and Jhajjar districts, besides at a toll plaza in Palwal. No blockades were reported in Nuh and Gurugram. Sonipat SP Jashandeep Singh Randhawa told The Hindu that hundreds of protesters had laid a blockade at Kundli and Kharkhoda leading to traffic snarls. He said the traffic headed to Delhi from Chandigarh was diverted at four points: Haldana, Gannaur, Murthal and Bahalgarh. The police had also issued a traffic advisory on Friday. In Jhajjar, the farmers laid blockade at Badli and Asoda and traffic was diverted at 10 points. The police, however, claimed the traffic flow was smooth. In Gurugram, the traffic headed towards the KMP Expressway was diverted at Farrukhnagar. Many farmers supported by “Khaps” walked to the toll plaza on the KMP Expressway in Palwal and laid blockade  .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-in-haryana-block-highway/article34010006.ece
07 March 2021||Kolkata,||Tollywood divided ahead of polls||The BJP’s ambition to form its first government in West Bengal and the TMC’s bid to seek a third term in power in the State has politically polarised the Bengali film industry and turned it into the parties’ new battleground. The TMC’s influence over the Tollygunge-based film industry, known by its portmanteau Tollywood, since even before Mamata Banerjee’s ascendance to power in 2011, seems to have been waning with several celebrities shifting their allegiance to the saffron party. Ironically, the BJP, which seeks to unseat the TMC from power, has taken a leaf out of Ms. Banerjee’s strategy of soliciting the tinsel town’s support towards causes and fielding actors in elections. The BJP, which is attempting to shed the “outsider” tag and make a place in the Bengali psyche, has left no stone unturned to attract big names of the film industry into its fold. The TMC, which always had an affinity for celebrities and has several actors as its MLAs and MPs, has been inducting more film personalities to retain its ground. Both the parties believe that while film personalities may not be “vote-catchers” among the politically conscious electorate of the state, they can influence voters, especially in rural and semi-urban areas. ‘Can never go together’ “We want our party to have people from all walks of life. People from the film industry have fan-following. The TMC government has let loose anarchy in Tollywood just like the entire state and actors seek freedom from it,” BJP State chief Dilip Ghosh said. Dismissing Mr. Ghosh’s claims, the TMC said “time-servers” are switching camps as those who relate to the Bengali culture would never join an “outsider party” like the BJP. “The BJP and Bengali culture are anti-thesis of each other. Both can never go together. Those joining the BJP will soon realise this and regret their decision,” senior TMC leader and minister Aroop Biswas said. Filmmaker-turned-BJP Mahila Morcha leader Sanghamitra Choudhury alleged that air of fear prevails in Tollywood due to the tight control of Aroop Biswas and his brother Swarup. “Frustrated with the state of affairs, many Bengali film actors are joining the BJP for fresh air and to be free from intimidation. We promise them that we will change the situation,” she said. Denying the allegation, Mr. Biswas claimed that the TMC government has worked for the benefit of artistes and technicians without seeing their political colour. “The BJP seeks to divide the film industry, which was known to be progressive and united all along,” he said. Actor Soham Chakraborty, also a TMC candidate in the elections, said only “self-seekers and opportunists” are joining the BJP after enjoying the fruits of power in the TMC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tollywood-divided-ahead-of-polls/article34010174.ece

Earlier on Friday, ahead of the expected announcement of the list of party candidates, All India Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev expressed her resentment to party president Sonia Gandhi. “I feel hurt because I have not been consulted in the process of selecting candidates and was not even invited to related meetings,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trouble-brewing-in-congress-over-selection-of-candidates-in-assam/article34010008.ece
07 March 2021||Khajurbanni (Gopalganj),||After death sentence, a pall of gloom in Khajurbanni||Twenty-four hours after a local court in Gopalganj district of north-west Bihar convicted 13 accused persons — sentencing nine of them to death and four women to life imprisonment — in the Khajurbanni hooch tragedy, tears have refused to fall from the vacant eyes of Sarita Devi. She has been wailing since Friday evening, with her three bemused children looking up to her, at a total loss. Her 13-year-old sister-in-law is the only person by her side to console her. “For the last four years, I have been dying each day. Death has many faces for me. Now, after the court verdict on Friday, it has come as a full stop in my life,” she said. After a long, haunting pause, she looked at her three children and added: “What will happen to them? Does the court care and consider such innocent lives?” Four of family convicted Ms. Devi is the wife of Sanjay Pasi, 23, who, along with his two younger brothers, Ranjay and Munna Pasi, has been sentenced to death by the Gopalganj court of Additional District Judge-2 Luvkush Kumar. Their mother, Indu Devi, too, has been awarded a life sentence in the case. Their father, Shiv Narayan Paswan, died long ago, and now only Sarita Devi, her three sons, and a sister-in-law are left to be haunted by their absence, and to earn a living. A few yards away is the house of Rita Devi, who too has been sentenced to life, and her two sons, Sanoj and Rajesh Pasi, have been sentenced to death. Rita Devi’s husband Nandji Pasi also died a long while back, and both her convicted sons are married men with small children. A group of neighbours gathered at their home on Saturday evening and they all wailed together to mourn the court verdict. “No male member is left in our house to go anywhere to take further legal steps. It seems like a death warrant for us as well,” said Sharda and Guddia Devi, wives of Sanoj and Rajesh Pasi, respectively, while crying inconsolably with a group of gathered women. Similarly, Maya Devi, along with her four daughters and one son, has been sitting outside the locked iron gate of her house ever since the court verdict was delivered. Her husband Chhatu Pasi, 50, too, has been awarded a death sentence in the case. “My father used to sell sattu (gram flour) on a wheel cart near the railway crossing, earning about Rs. 2,000 every month to run the family. But the police made him the accused in the hooch tragedy case, and now he has been served a death sentence for no fault,” rued the son, Rajan Pasi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/after-death-sentence-a-pall-of-gloom-in-khajurbanni/article34010012.ece
07 March 2021||New Delhi,||Only NRI quota seats for OCI cardholders||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has reiterated through a gazette notification that Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders can lay claim to “only NRI (Non Resident Indian) quota seats” in educational institutions based on all-India entrance tests such as National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), Joint Entrance Examination (Mains), Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced) or other such all-India professional tests. The notification also reproduced a part of the guidelines issued by the Ministry on November 15, 2019 regarding benefits to OCI cardholders, which said that OCIs are not entitled to undertake any “missionary, mountaineering, journalism and tabligh activities” without prior permission of the Government of India. The notification provides legal teeth to the guidelines. The notification says that the OCI cardholder shall be required to obtain a “special permission or a special permit” from the competent authority or the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) or the Indian Mission “to undertake research, Missionary or Tabligh or Mountaineering or Journalistic activities, undertake internship in any foreign diplomatic missions or foreign Government organisations in India or employment in any foreign diplomatic missions in India and visit any place which falls within the Protected or Restricted or prohibited areas as notified by the Central Government or competent authority”. OCI citizens are of Indian origin but they are foreign passport holders and are not citizens of India. India does not allow dual citizenship but provides certain benefits under Section 7B(I) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 to the OCIs. The fresh notification replaces three previous notifications issued on the subject on April 11, 2005; January 5, 2007; and January 5, 2009, respectively. The previous notifications did not specify the special permission required for “missionary, Tabligh, mountaineering or journalistic activities” and were merely part of the November 2019 guidelines. Petitions filed A Ministry official said that several OCI cardholder students have filed petitions in courts that they are eligible to get admission against general seats in medical, engineering and other government colleges if they clear the all-India tests. In March 2019, the MHA clarified to the Karnataka High Court that students with OCI cards had “parity with Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and can lay claim only on the NRI quota seats based on the all-India tests”. However on December 15, 2020, the High Court of Karnataka directed that students under the OCI category are to be considered as “citizens of India” for admission to professional courses and asked the State government to admit them to undergraduate professional courses, including engineering, medical, and dental, even under the government and institutional quotas, and not to restrict their admission only under the NRI quota. The March 4 notification by the MHA said that OCI card holders will have parity with NRIs in the matter of “appearing for the all India entrance tests such as National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, Joint Entrance Examination (Mains), Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced) or such other tests to make them eligible for admission only against any Non-Resident Indian seat or any supernumerary seat: Provided that the OCI cardholder shall not be eligible for admission against any seat reserved exclusively for Indian citizens.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-nri-quota-seats-for-oci-cardholders/article34010019.ece
07 March 2021||Kochi,||EVMs made a shaky start in a Kerala constituency in 1982||The use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in some booths of the Paravur Assembly constituency in Ernakulam is etched in the electoral history as they were introduced in the constituency in the 1982 polling, a first in the country. The EVMs were introduced in 50 polling stations in the election in which the late A.C. Jose of the Congress and the late N. Sivan Pillai of the Communist Party of India were locked in a tight contest. The Congress candidate was defeated by a razor-thin margin of 123. Jose challenged the election of Sivan Pillai in the Kerala High Court, arguing that the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 did not empower the Election Commission to use EVMs. The High Court refused his plea. But on an appeal by Jose, the Supreme Court in 1984 ordered a re-poll in the 50 polling stations using conventional ballot papers. Jose won the seat. In 1992, Parliament inserted Section 61A in the Act and rules validating the use of the EVM and paving way for their use in elections. The EC started using EVMs widely since 1998. The new generation of EVMs has Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT), which prints a small slip of paper that carries the name, symbol and the serial number of the candidate. Supreme Court lawyer Kaleeswaram Raj says the plea for abolishing EVMs has been repeatedly rejected by the top court. The top court has issued directives for using VVPAT to ensure accuracy and fairness in the EVM practice in 2013. “The problem, however, is that only a minuscule number of votes are now subjected to VVPAT scrutiny across the country and the Election Commission has to increase the sample test reasonably and substantially to achieve the very objective of VVPAT,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/evms-made-a-shaky-start-in-a-kerala-constituency-in-1982/article34009942.ece

07 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Companies told to conserve medicinal plants, bio-resources||Ayurvedic pharmaceutical companies have been urged to contribute and conserve medicinal plants and bio-resources, while also working towards providing affordable medicines. At a workshop on the implementation of biodiversity rules, organised by the Karnataka Biodiversity Board here on Saturday, Minister for Environment, Ecology and Tourism C.P. Yogeshwar stressed upon the need to conserve and preserve biodiversity in the State, given the challenges. Plan ready Board chairman Ananth Hegde Ashisar said companies exploiting bio-resources should join hands with the government and conserve them. “We have formulated a plan to fund conservation activities at the micro level, i.e. gram and taluk panchayat levels,” he said. To conserve biodiversity at the micro level, the board released Rs. 57.23 lakh to eight TPs across the State. More funds will be released to many Biodiversity Management Committees constituted at the micro level. Tara Anuradha, chairperson, Forest Development Corporation, said with disappearing green cover, it was imperative for various departments to work together to protect forests in the State. Under the Access Benefits Sharing (ABS) clause of biodiversity rules, companies that benefit from extracting medicinal plants from villages have to ‘share’ a small portion of the same with the Biodiversity Management Committees. Though most companies try to evade paying, the board has collected around Rs. 4 crore, it is said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/companies-told-to-conserve-medicinal-plants-bio-resources/article34010460.ece
07 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Women of Bilal Bagh cast in Aurat||Safdar Hashmi’s play Aurat , a commentary on patriarchy, was first staged in 1970, but remains relevant even five decades later. On International Women’s Day, celebrated on March 8, the Bengaluru-based Theatre for Change will be staging their version of Aurat . What makes iteration of the play different is their decision to cast members from the Bilal Bagh community. Bilal Bagh in Bengaluru, and notably its women residents, made national headlines in early 2020, for their protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). It eventually came to be known as the Shaheen Bagh of the South. Sujatha Balakrishnan, one of the directors of Aurat , said her decision to work with the women from Bilal Bagh stemmed from her firsthand experience of seeing them in action during the anti-CAA protests. “They were just amazing out there. I immediately thought I should do our next production for Women’s Day with them,” she said. It proved to be an eye-opener for Ms. Balakrishnan. “Working with them showed me they enjoy far more freedom than many women from ‘privileged classes’,” she said. She added that the experience has only strengthened her belief that it is a lack of opportunity that holds people down. Theatre cannot be the privilege of a particular class, she said. The usual trajectory of a girl’s life — childhood, higher education and marriage — form the premise of Aurat . “We wanted it to be a multi-lingual effort. So, each act will be performed in a different language,” she added. The first part of the play, where a girl and her father are discussing the necessity for her to go to school, is in Tamil and has been directed by Sujatha. “Alfiya Shaikh, a 10-year-old from Bilal Bagh, is playing the daughter in the first act. I was pleasantly surprised by the way she picked up Tamil to deliver her lines, even though it is not her mother tongue,” she said. The second act portraying a young girl’s fight to study in college is in Hindi, and is directed by Vandana Amit Dugar. The final act depicting her life as a married woman is in Kannada, and has been directed by Sachin Sreenath. The play touches upon harassment, patriarchy, the toll of childbirth and other everyday problems of women. Apart from Theatre for Change’s rendition of Aurat , actor Urvashi Goverdhan will be reading a few of Maya Angelou’s poems. This will be followed by school children from different sections of Bengaluru reciting from an anthology of Safdar Hashmi’s work Duniya Sab Ke , which deals with social justice. ( Venue: Lahe Lahe, HAL 2nd Stage, Bengaluru from 6-8 p.m. on March 8. Entry free )  They were just amazing out there. I immediately thought I should do our next production for Women’s Day with them.

07 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Court’s fiat to media on Ministers’ appeal||A City Civil and Sessions Court here on Saturday granted temporary injunction restraining 67 media organisations, including print, television, digital, and social media platforms, from putting out any defamatory news or showing video footage and pictures of six Cabinet Ministers. It also restrained the media from committing any act or intentional omission causing character assassination of the plaintiff-Ministers on the basis of unverified material. D.S. Vijaya Kumar, 26th Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, passed the interim order on a suit filed jointly by A. Shivaram Hebbar, B.C. Patil, S.T. Somashekar, K. Sudhakar, K.C. Narayana Gowda, and Byrathi Basavaraj. The court noted that the Ministers had alleged in their suit that Ramesh Jarakiholi resigned from his Cabinet post after CDs containing video clips purportedly showing him getting intimate with an unidentified woman flooded the media, which termed the episode as “sex scandal for showing official favour for a woman before verifying the news, its sources and authenticity”. “... Some of the media houses are telecasting/publishing news that there are other CDs containing several sex scandals pertaining to MLAs and Ministers, and there are around 19 CDs of different MLAs and Ministers including that of an influential politician from Old Mysore region. On the basis of such false news being telecast, members from the respective constituency of the plaintiffs have started calling them and presuming their involvement in such sex scandals,” the court observed in its order. The court also observed that family members of the plaintiffs were being put in an embarrassing situation as a result. Recording the Ministers’ claims made in the suit that “...recently, by a process of deep fake, using artificial intelligence, videos of worldwide politicians such as Barack Obama, Queen Elizabeth have been morphed and have gone viral. Similar videos of some Indian politicians have also been made. Innocent people who are unaware of such process tend to believe the videos and its contents to be true,” the court said that the Ministers were apprehensive that by using fake CDs their reputation could be harmed. ‘19 more CDs’ Referring to screenshots of headlines in news channels produced along with the suit, the court said that prima facie it appeared that the “media is sensationalising the news about 19 more CDs stating that they relate to 19 influential persons and they relate to sex scandal and even there are reference to some Ministers” apparently in the nature of sensationalism of the unverified material. Observing that though the citizens had the right to know about their leaders and the media had the right to freedom of expression, the court said the plaintiff-Ministers had the right to be protected against their character assassination on the basis of unverified material. A similar order of temporary injunction restraining the media from carrying defamatory reports against Mr. Jarkiholi was passed by the 72nd Additional City Civil and Sessions Court on March 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/courts-fiat-to-media-on-ministers-appeal/article34009976.ece
07 March 2021||Pilibhit (U.P.),||Nepal hands over body of man||The body of the young man allegedly killed in firing by the Nepal police was handed over to Indian authorities after several rounds of talks following which his family performed the last rites here, officials said on Saturday. Govinda Singh, 24, was shot at on Thursday in a village in Nepal near the border. His body was given late Friday night after a post-mortem by Nepalese authorities, said Pilibhit SP Jai Prakash Yadav. He said Nepalese officials were terming it a case of smuggling, but locals maintain the firing took place following a minor argument. Though authorities had initially said the Nepalese police had fired at three people, the police said late on Friday the incident in a market in Kanchanpur district involved four men, all in their 20s. They were from Bhumidan Raghavpuri Tilla Chaar village in Pilibhit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nepal-hands-over-body-of-man/article34010000.ece
07 March 2021||Ghaziabad,||‘The Shabnam I knew was different from the one the world hates’||“The Shabnam I knew was very different from the one that the world loves to hate.” Usman Saifi makes this statement many times during the conversation. The Bulandshahr-based freelance journalist is the foster father of death row convict Shabnam Ali’s son Taj. Shabnam along with her lover Saleem was convicted of killing seven members of her family, including a 10-month-old nephew, in 2008. If executed, she will be the first woman in independent India to be hanged for a crime. On February 18, Shabnam filed a second mercy petition with the Governor of Uttar Pradesh and the President of India, both of whom had earlier rejected her plea. Around the same time, news spread that preparations are being made in Mathura jail, the only one in the country where female convicts could be hanged. The news of her review petition and Taj’s appeal to spare her mother from the gallows once again turned the focus on Taj, and Mr. Saifi had to plead for privacy from the probing media. Having spent the first six years of his life with his mother, Mr. Saifi said Taj understands everything. “But still he needs to be saved from unnecessary questions. We were leading a normal life but now it seems everybody in the neighbourhood is looking at us,” says Mr. Saifi. He also appreciates his wife Vandana’s role in tiding over social pressures. “It was she who decided not to have our own child.” People in Amroha district of western Uttar Pradesh call Shabnan stone-hearted, the judiciary described her crime as “the rarest of rare”, particularly because she committed parricide despite being educated. But Mr. Saifi remembers Shabnam, a double MA in English and Geography, as a caring senior who used to treat him as her younger brother. “We would often travel on the same bus from our respective villages in Amroha to college. When I failed in the second year of graduation and wanted to quit education, she pushed me to fill the improvement form and paid my fees. Once when some criminal elements got into a spat with me in the bus, she intervened and stood by me.” So, when the news of the sensational murder broke out in April 2008, Mr. Saifi refused to believe that how a Shiksha Mitra (assistant teacher in primary school) could commit such a heinous crime. “From 2012, I tried multiple times to meet her in jail, but she refused.” When Shabnam was arrested, she was about three months pregnant and gave birth to Taj in December 2008. “As a friend, I felt it was my social responsibility to adopt the child.” It was after Taj moved with Mr. Saifi that Shabnam started opening up. “When she was in Moradabad jail, she used to cover her face. It was difficult to read her face.” When she was shifted to Rampur jail, Mr. Saifi says her attitude changed. “She would not talk about what led to the crime. This February, she said that she didn’t commit the crime and that she wanted a CBI inquiry.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-shabnam-i-knew-was-different-from-the-one-the-world-hates/article34010280.ece

It also visited Amravati, Yavatmal, Nagpur, Pune and Thane. According to the report, the State “desired” that the Centre should indicate the total numbers to be vaccinated and leave actual process to the State, with “more flexibility” in vaccination, including use of private hospitals, time flexibility and data management. The Central team suggested that Maharashtra involve revenue and police officials in “mission mode and zeal.” In Nagpur, the team reported, some senior doctors and specialists were not attending on COVID-19 patients and leaving management to juniors. “Some private doctors, Ayurveda practitioners, unqualified quacks which are first point of contact [for patients] may not be advising/ managing as per protocol. They also have to be reached out to, retrained and reoriented regarding protocols,” the report noted. State officials reported problems in the CoWIN portal and app and ascribed the rise in cases in Amravati to a “possible internal mutation (of the virus).” Early management AYUSH (traditional medicine including Ayurveda and Homeopathy) practitioners were still not part of deliberations, according to feedback from the States and they suggested “mainstreaming of AYUSH” for managing cases at an early stage. “Role of media has been erratic — focussing on non-issues such as AEFIs (Adverse Events Following Injection (with vaccine) and ignoring issues such as promotion of vaccination now that vaccine has arrived,” the report said. The report noted that people believed that this was a disease only of urban areas and were, therefore, not following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covid-19-cases-breach-18000-again/article34009987.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Villagers relish peace as guns fall silent along LoC||“The free hand given to the soldiers earlier is no more in vogue,” a soldier, on the condition of anonymity, said. At a number of posts with small boards reading ‘No open movement, sniper zone’, relaxed soldiers could be seen milling around. Earlier, such zones were no-go areas to escape Pakistani snipers positioned on the hill slope. Deep wounds For the scores of border residents, the peace may come as a time for healing, though many scars remain fresh. The eldest of five siblings, 15-year-old Shahista Bano, daughter of labourer Bashir Ahmad Dar, has been forced to take on the role of a mother. Her mother, Farooqa Begum, was killed on November 13 last year by a powerful shell fired from PoK that hit their home as she was climbing to the attic to store firewood. “There was a loud explosion. The house was filled with light followed by dust. I turned into a stone. What I saw later was the mutilated body of my mother. She was lying dead, while the smoke had turned every wall black,” recalled Shahista, her voice overcome with grief. Now she takes care of her siblings, as her father goes to work. “I doubt if I can continue my schooling. My dream of donning the uniform of a policewoman was dashed with the killing of my mother,” the teenager said. Officials said 22 civilians were killed in the more than 5,133 incidents of border skirmishes along the LoC in 2020, the highest number of violations since the Karg il W ar . Uri — like the border villages of Rajouri, Poonch, Samba, Kathua, Bandipora and Kupwara districts — too turned into a theatre of war at least 21 times last year. Five civilians and three soldiers lost their lives, five suffered major injuries, and around 16 houses were damaged in the cross-border firing, according to official figures. Nadir Hussian Shah, a resident, said both his legs had to be amputated after being hit by shell shrapnel. In a changing pattern, Pakistan resorted to unprecedented heavy calibre artillery shelling in June and November last year. “It was no more a minor picket-to-picket skirmish but would engulf a wide range of area immediately after the first bullet was fired. It was a bloody year in 2020, where civilians were finding it hard to find shelter. We did our best to save their lives,” said Junaid Wali, Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Uri, showing a sophisticated, lead-heavy bullet that hit his office in June last year. Caged community Circled by multi-layered barbed fencing on three sides and the PoK pickets on the fourth side, the people of Silikote village live in a grim gated community. All members of around 16 households in the village have to share their biometrics with the Army every time they pass through the single, well-guarded entry. “No one would like to live in a cage. The Army closes the gates by 9 p.m. Our children, many times, get stuck in schools for the night when shelling takes place. But it has been a week and we hear no exchange of fire. We can finally have a calm sleep in the night,” Ghulam Qadir Chalkoo said. The 67-year-old retired employee has come face-to face with trauma often. He lost his wife to Pakistani shelling in 2003 and his son lost both his legs in 2001 when a shell exploded. About half of the villagers, out of the more than two dozen houses, have already left their property in Silikote and shifted to safer locations in Uri town. But not all can afford to do that. “Where will we go? We are farmers and depend on fields. We lost our concrete house in shelling last year and now live in a relative’s house,” said Saja Begum, pointing to the mound of debris which once was her home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/villagers-relish-peace-as-guns-fall-silent-along-loc/article34009989.ece

As part of the drive, those who receive the vaccine can download a certificate from the centralised CoWIN portal and app. The certificate carries the photo which, according to sources, goes against the EC’s standing instructions on use of images of living political functionaries in government advertisements during elections. A senior EC official said the Ministry was asked to follow the MCC in letter and spirit. The EC asked the Ministry to come up with a technical solution to remove the photo in the next couple of days. Elections to the Assemblies of Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry were announced on February 26, while the vaccination drive began in January. Asked for comment, a Health Ministry official said: “We will peruse the instructions of the ECI and then comply with its directions.” The Trinamool Congress had taken up the issue with the EC on March 2, demanding removal of the photo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/remove-pms-photo-ec-tells-health-ministry/article34010026.ece

Officials said that the phone was among the six devices given as a part of a kickback to Swapna allegedly by Santosh Eapen, owner of Unitac Ventures, for wangling the UAE-Red Crescent contract to build 40 apartments for the homeless at Wadakkancherry. ‘Swapna, a stranger’ Ms. Balakrishnan said that she was not in receipt of any Customs summons. Swapna was a stranger to her, she added. Mr. Eapen has also denied any links with the Kodiyeris. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that Mr. Balakrishnan owed him an apology.

07 March 2021||Hyderabad,||Former Ranji player held for impersonation||Former Ranji Trophy player of Andhra Pradesh cricket team was arrested on Saturday for allegedly cheating corporate companies by impersonating as the personal secretary of IT and Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao. Budumuru Nagaraju, 25, from Andhra Pradesh’s Yavvaripet village in Srikakulam district was apprehended by the sleuths of the Hyderabad Commissioner’s Task Force (North Zone), after he reportedly extorted Rs. 39.22 lakh from nine corporates in Hyderabad. Impersonating the IT Minister’s personal secretary Bandari Tirupathi, Nagaraju recently phoned the company heads informing them that Mr. Rao would soon be sworn in as the Chief Minister of Telangana and they have to arrange money for his swearing-in-ceremony, which will be held in LB Stadium, the investigators said. “He demanded money from them (corporates) for erecting hoardings, giving advertisements in print and electronic media and for the swearing-in-ceremony,” Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said, adding that Nagaraju was apprehended by the team led by inspector K. Nageswar Rao. He said that since 2018, the accused was involved in 10 cases in both Telangana and AP, and this year alone, nine more cases were booked against him. “Nagaraju had a habit of targeting corporate companies, hospitals, realtors, and educational institutions, and extorting money from them by introducing himself as the Minister’s personal secretary Tirupathi over the calls,” Mr. Kumar said. An MBA graduate, the 25-year-old represented Andhra Pradesh in Ranji trophy matches between 2014 and 2016. “Despite being released on bail, he didn’t change his attitude, and continued to dupe people,” the officer said.

The agency will question her based on the inference that she has been using one of the expensive mobile phones handed over by Santhosh Eapen, managing director, Unitac Builders, to Swapna Suresh, second accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case, as bribe. The Central agency has come across evidence showing that the phone is in possession of Ms. Balakrishnan though it was not used after the gold smuggling case hit the headlines. Mr. Eapen had earlier filed a statement before the Kerala High Court that five expensive phones were given along with Rs. 4.8 crore as commission to bag the UAE consulate’s contract to construct 140 dwellings in Thrissur via the State government’s LIFE Mission to provide free housing for the poor. The UAE Red Crescent had offered to underwrite the project through the country’s diplomatic mission in Thiruvananthapuram. The Customs arrested the builder on February 16 in the case related to the smuggling of dollars worth Rs. 1.30 crore while stating that he had information that the money he gave as commission for obtaining the contract of the LIFE Mission project was illegally converted into foreign exchange and smuggled abroad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kodiyeris-wife-to-be-questioned/article34009985.ece

In a statement on Friday, the EGI said it was “deeply concerned” about the recent notification of the rules and asked the government to consult the stakeholders. “The Rules, issued under the Information Technology Act, 2000, fundamentally alter how publishers of news operate over the Internet and have the potential to seriously undermine media freedom. They empower the Union government to block, delete or modify published news anywhere in the country without any judicial oversight and mandate all publishers to establish a grievance redressal mechanism,” the EGI said. It said some provisions of the rules could put unreasonable restrictions on digital news media. “The EGI is concerned that the government did not consult stakeholders before notifying these far-reaching rules. The Guild urges the government to put the rules in abeyance and conduct meaningful consultation with all stakeholders.

The arrested have been identified as Bharati Manjunath Walmiki, 48, Ramesh Manjunath Walmiki, 48, Ravi Bhimsen Hegde, 38, Vinayak Arjun Madar, 27 — all from Dharwad — and Vijay Basappa Negalur, 41, and Chitra Vijay Negalur, 37, residents of Udupi. According to the police, the accused had given a hand loan of Rs. 50,000 to a couple and had demanded Rs. 1,50,000 in return. The couple could not pay back the amount and the accused forcibly made them sell their one-month-and-ten-day-old baby boy to an unidentified couple for Rs. 2.5 lakh and had taken back their money. Subsequently, the distraught mother complained to the police on Friday about the incident. Payment for custody Following this, the police arrested the six persons. The infant has been entrusted to the custody of the Child Protection Committee in the district. The couple from Udupi had allegedly paid money to get the child’s custody. Meanwhile, Police Commissioner Labhu Ram has appealed to people to approach banks and recognised financial institutions for loans instead of moneylenders operating illegally. He has also sought information from the public on such moneylenders. The Police Commissioner has also said that it is illegal to adopt children without following the legal procedure, and such couples were liable for punishment.

07 March 2021||Bengaluru,||Poet Lakshminarayana Bhatta passes away||Well-known Kannada poet, critic, and translator N.S. Lakshminarayana Bhatta, 85, passed away here early on Saturday. The poet, many of whose bhavageethes (lyrical poems) were set to tune and popularised through cassettes in the 1980s, was ailing for some time. He is survived by wife and two children. Born in 1936 in Shivamogga district, he had several collections of poems to his credit, besides critical works and translations. He taught Kannada literature at Bengaluru University until his retirement. Though he was a contemporary of “Navya” (modern) poets, many of his popular songs reflect that he was “Navodaya” (romantic) in his sensibilities. “He was a poet who expressed the sensibilities of Navodaya in the idiom of ‘Navya’. We were also called neo-romantics by Ramachandra Sharma,” said B.R Lakshmana Rao, poet. Dr. Lakshminarayana Bhatta would be most remembered for his contribution to Sugama Sangeeta, the tradition of singing poems. “Though the Sugama Sangeeta movement was flagged off by K.S. Nisar Ahmed’s album ‘Nityotsava’, it was Lakshminarayana Bhatta who took over from there, sustained the movement and probably wrote the most bhaavegeetes,” Mr. Rao said. Some of his best known songs are “Nanna iniyana neleya”, “Nee sigade baalondu baale Krishna”, “Thaye ninna madilali”, “Marege ninthu kayuthiruva karulu yaavudu”, “Baare nanna Deepika” among others. Ratnamala Prakash, who sang many of his popular songs, said: “He had immense respect for music composers and singers who took his poems and songs to the people. He used to take keen interest in composing as well and often asked the composer to change tunes if he was not happy,” she recounted. Dr. Lakshminarayana Bhatta compiled and edited the works of the saint-poet Shishunala Sharif which C. Ashwath composed to music, which took the 19th century poet to the masses, much beyond North Karnataka. In academic circles, Dr. Lakshminarayana Bhatta was recognised for his translations of Shakespeare’s sonnets, and poems of T. S. Elliot and W.B. Yeats. He was also a literary critic and his works Horalu Daariyalli Kavya (1974) and Samagra Kannada Sahitya Charitre (2014) are critically acclaimed. His last work was his autobiography, Niluvugannadiya Munde (2020). He won several awards, including that of the Karnataka Sahitya Akademi, Masti Prashasti, and Kannada Rajyotsava Award among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poet-lakshminarayana-bhatta-passes-away/article34009991.ece
07 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rising polymer prices pose new challenge for MSMEs in State||Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) across Tamil Nadu, which spent huge sums on raw material procurement after the lockdown was lifted, face a new challenge: the rising polymer price and a huge shortage of the material. With the Tamil Nadu going to the polls, these units feel they are being orphaned, and any further delay in relief will worsen their lot. R. Selvam, a plastic components manufacturer at the Thirumudivakkam Industrial Estate, says there is an acute shortage of polymers, especially engineering polymers such as nylons, polybutylene terephthalate, polyacetal and polycarbonate that are used in the automotive industry. “All the raw materials mentioned are imported from various countries. We have been experiencing the shortage for the past 5-6 months owing to the gap in demand and supply, and issues of logistics,” he says. Mr. Selvam says Indian companies making commodity polymers such as polyolefins and polypropylene have increased their prices significantly for no major reason. He suggests that the government regulate the prices until the demand and supply return to the normal levels. The government can also reduce the import duty and restrict the exports of the locally made polymers. This particular raw material is a key component for industries like automotive, aerospace, electrical and electronics and home appliances. A.N. Rajasekar of the Oragadam Industrial Estate, says the high cost is affecting the units’ working capital. “Buyers are not willing to take the impact,” says Renny Jose, managing partner of Core Plasto Enterprises, which operates from the Guindy Industrial Estate. K. Jagadeesan, secretary of the SIPCOT Pillaipakkam Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association, says his business requires over 300 tonnes of polymer a month. “We have been making dashboard parts for an automobile major. The high price, coupled with the shortage, has affected our export market,” he says. He wants the government to form a price regulatory council to control the abnormal price increase and help the units meet their requirements from alternative sources. S. Senthil Kumar, a supplier of polymers from the Thirumudivakkam Industrial Estate, explains that the situation worsened in the last one month owing to the cold wave that gripped Texas, U.S., where many companies have halted production. The market is good, but MSMEs have to cut production for want of raw materials. According to the data given by MSMEs, the price of ABS polymer has gone up 100% to Rs. 260 a kg, compared with Rs. 130 before the lockdown. The prices of the other variants have gone up by 40%-75% a kg.  We have been experiencing the shortage for the past 5-6 months due to the gap in demand and supply, and issues of logistics  R.

07 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘I didn’t want to break the alliance over a few seats’||Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan has been at the forefront of organising several protests against various issues of relevance to Tamil Nadu — NEET, CAA-NRC-NPR, farm laws, Manusmriti — and shaping the ideological opposition to the BJP and the ruling AIADMK in the State in the last five years. A few days ago, he formally committed himself to staying in the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance, and was allotted six Assembly constituencies. While his party cadre has expressed displeasure at the DMK’s decision to allot just half the number of seats sought by the VCK, Mr. Thirumavalavan told The Hindu that it was crucial to keeping the alliance intact and be a part of the winning alliance. Excerpts:   The VCK has played a strong role in shaping the ideological opposition to the BJP-AIADMK combine. Yet, the DMK has allotted it only six seats. Are you happy? I am happy that the alliance is intact. For five years, we created an impression among the people that this is not an alliance built just for elections but for an ideology. After the 2016 Assembly election, we have protested together on many issues — NEET, the hydrocarbon project, environmental issues, federal rights, Eelam Tamils, Manusmriti and farm laws. I didn’t want to break the alliance over a few seats as it would have nullified the efforts we had made over the last five years. There is a view that the number of seats allotted to your party is not commensurate with the efforts that you have put in the last five years to build a narrative against the AIADMK and the BJP… There is no need for the DMK...to honour the work that we have done in the interests of the people. The right honour would be to gain the respect of the people. The DMK’s logic was that it does not want its next government to be a minority one and it shouldn’t be subjected to harassment by the BJP. While the DMK has to accommodate the alliance partners, it must also win enough seats not only to form a government but also to have enough strength to safeguard it. It has decided to contest in 180 constituencies... Further, this is a winning alliance — the AIADMK faces anti-incumbency after ruling the State for 10 years and the people’s aversion to its alliance with the BJP. There is a difference between contesting in 12 seats as part of a losing alliance and in 6 seats as part of a winning alliance. Though the PMK and the VCK are perceived as representatives of two major communities, many of your critics have said that while the PMK sealed the alliance with the AIADMK only after the government passed a law guaranteeing reservation for the Vanniyars within the MBC quota, the VCK plays only a marginal role when it comes to electoral politics. Why? There is no need to compare the two parties. The PMK has been pursuing caste-oriented politics. Its politics is centred on a single caste. It says the Vanniyars account for 20% of the State’s population. But I think the party has never won more than 6% of the vote share. So, are 14%-16% of the Vanniyars voting for other parties? The 10.5% internal reservation has been fixed on the basis of the 1931 census. What is the Vanniyar population today? What is this reservation based on? What are the findings of the Kulasekaran Committee? This is a well-planned move by the AIADMK and the PMK. The MBCs have been split into three groups without their consent — this is the BJP’s agenda to divide the MBCs. They don’t want the Scheduled Castes and the OBCs to come together as one community. VCK had previously demanded that the reservation for the SCs be increased to 21% from 18%. Did you place any demand to the DMK before finalising the alliance? We have not placed any such demand. We cannot make such demands to an Opposition party. If the alliance wins, we will demand that a caste population census be carried out and the reservation policy be recalibrated. The DMK and the Congress are struggling to conclude their seat-sharing talks. It has been said the Congress has been significantly weakened in India and Tamil Nadu. What should the Congress’s strategy be now? The Congress should strongly oppose BJP ideologically. It has a leadership crisis, and is unable to expose the BJP and its policies. The Congress feels that if it opposes the BJP and its policies, it will be portrayed as opposing the Hindus and Hinduism. It feels that it will lose the Hindu vote... It feels that if it is anti-Hindutva, it wouldn’t be understood as anti-BJP, but as anti-Hindus. The BJP continues portraying itself as protectors of Hindus. The Congress is losing out to the BJP. Though the Congress is secular, the only way it can establish its secular credentials is by vehemently opposing the BJP and the RSS ideologically. It can expose how both are pro-capitalist, anti-social justice, anti-workers, anti-federal and anti-farmers. It is not doing it properly. Its protests and criticism are mainly defensive. A long-standing criticism against mainstream parties is that Dalit candidates are confined to the reserved constituencies. Will the VCK field Dalit candidates in general constituencies? We have asked for 1 or 2 general constituencies out of the six allotted to us. We don’t have enough seats to field Dalit candidates. In this election, we will not do it. We will only field non-Dalits in the general constituencies. What do you think is the future of the third front in Tamil Nadu, which is now being led by Kamal Haasan? He has also criticised the DMK for allotting just 6 seats to the VCK and said “My younger brother Thirumavalavan should be here.” If the third front is formed just before the election, it will not receive support. A front has to emerge and contest in two or three elections continuously. Only such a front will have the support of the people. If political parties come together just before the election and claim that they are the alternative, people don’t accept it. Secondly, any election becomes a bipolar contest. If there is the AIADMK, the one opposing it, DMK, becomes the main rival. People don’t even consider the other parties as significant. The third front also invariably ends up splitting anti-incumbency votes. Despite the electorate wanting to defeat a party, they are unable to defeat it because a third front will split the votes. Actor Kamal Haasan is facing his first Assembly election [after contesting in the Lok Sabha election]. Only now a third front is being formed. It is impossible for it to emerge as a credible alternative and it will only end up splitting votes. I can thank Kamal Haasan not for criticising the DMK for not giving us enough seats but for taking a favourable view of the VCK...  The Congress has a leadership crisis, and is unable to expose the BJP and its policies||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-didnt-want-to-break-the-alliance-over-a-few-seats/article34010081.ece
07 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Picking up the stick again||This year, for a group of women and girls, Women’s Day will be all about proving their hockey skills on the field. A total of 15 veteran women players of a hockey club have pooled in money to organise a tournament for women teams from Chennai and neighbouring districts on Sunday. The tournament, named “We are For Hockey Trophy - Women Nine A Side”, is being hosted by “We Are For Hockey Club” and it will be played at Mayor Radhakrishnan Hockey Stadium in Egmore from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The winners and runners-up will be given trophies. “We wanted to celebrate the Women’s Day in a unique manner and as we are all veteran players, who picked up the hockey sticks again after nearly two decades, we decided to host a hockey tournament,” said Rekha J., president of the club which has 15 members, including Sheela Sukumar, vice-president, Lakshmi Vaikunth, secretary of the club, Rasna Anthony, joint secretary, members Thilagam Karthik, Teena Sumesh, Thenmozhi Varadarajan, Menaka Munisekhar, Mecklish James, Teresa Bella, Menega, Meghalatha N., Lakshmi Prabha, Rajeshwari L. and Sarumathi Ramesh. Sixteen teams from Chennai and neighbouring districts, including Chengalpattu, will be taking part in the competition. “Usually, a team will consist of 11 players and seven substitutes and a match will be held for an hour split into four quarters. But, since it is a one-day tournament, we are organising match with nine members per team and a match will last half an hour,” added Ms. Rekha. The team members said they pooled in money to organise the event. “We asked for money from our relatives. Some people offered banners at subsidised prices. We just want people to come for the match and enjoy it. There will be many stalls too,” she added. M. Renuka Lakshmi, general secretary, Hockey Unit of Tamil Nadu, said the future was bright for women’s hockey. “Many senior players want to take part in the tournament,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/picking-up-the-stick-again/article34010600.ece

07 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Year after first COVID-19 case, there is still cause for concern||It has been a year since Tamil Nadu recorded its first case of COVID-19 on March 7, 2020. The State has come a long way in the control and management of the pandemic but the rise in the number of fresh cases in a few districts has raised the level of alert. As a sense of complacency has set in among the public, the emergence of clusters and continuing non-adherence to safety norms is posing a challenge for public health authorities. The journey has not been easy. In March 2020, the State’s positivity rate was 5.2%. This rose to 10.5% in June, and went on to decline gradually from September, reaching 1.7% in December. After dropping below 1% in February 2021, for the first time since last March, the positivity rate is currently 1%. Today, the State accounts for 8,54,554 — 8,38,085 recoveries, 12,517 deaths and 3,952 active cases. Between 50,000 and 55,000 tests are being done every day in the State. “The last one year was a 360-degree challenge as it was not just a pandemic affecting the health sector but it affected all sectors and individuals one way or the other. Initial phases of lockdown helped in ramping up the health infrastructure. Clinical management improved tremendously reducing the case fatality. “Sticking to RT-PCR testing was unique to T.N. and helped in restricting the spread,” Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said. Among an array of initiatives were the aggressive focussed testing, developing COVID-19 Care Centres to handle asymptomatic cases, setting up fever camps and screening centres for positive persons to decide who to send to hospitals, starting daily house to house survey with pulse oximeter and thermal scanners, he said. “Challenges of handling unlock with different levels of relaxation, and the recent tendency to ignore masks and Standard Operating Procedures considering the decline in the numbers after the peak in July and August, fatigue among people to adhere to public health guidance and despite awareness, not changing behaviour is the challenge,” he said. “We need to understand that while vaccination is a milestone, we need to continue to wear masks and avoid creating clusters by not being careless to the risks due to newer variants,” the Health Secretary said. T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, listed various measures that helped in handling the pandemic during its peak — temporary appointments to support COVID-19 control activities, expanding bed capacity and oxygen beds, fever camps, triage centres, interdepartmental co-ordination and conduct of serosurvey for epidemiological purposes. “We moved from complete lockdown to unlocking because of the support from everyone including the government and citizens. The same is needed for some more time, or otherwise, we need to face further waves. COVID-19 appropriate behaviour should continue,” he said. It has been a challenging year, Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director of Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology, said. “The State stepped up case detection, testing, hospital facilities and took several public health control measures along with restrictions and lockdown. In a nutshell, Tamil Nadu has done reasonably well when compared to many other settings,” she said. According to T. Jacob John, retired professor of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, the State has not done too badly although there were some hiccups now and then. “Due to the early high-handed response across the country, people were tired and became complacent when the time came for an actually needed high-handed response. There was a mismatch in the timing when we needed strict control measures and when we actually applied strict control measures,” he said. With the rise in the number of fresh COVID-19 infections in specific regions, Dr. John calls for a need-based approach in vaccination targeting these areas. The main problem is that the risk perception was low, Dr. Kaur said. “We do not know whether a second wave will happen or not. The risk is high and the new variants have a tendency to spread faster. Wearing masks, avoiding crowding, trying to meet people in open spaces and getting vaccinated should be the priority.” She highlighted the need to detect clusters early. “If we need to prevent outbreaks, we will have to pick it early and do extensive contact tracing. Sustaining testing and tracing is key. We need to see if we are testing where we need to test — contacts, households and closed settings,” she said. “While healthcare and frontline workers can be proud of what they could do despite severe scientific limitations in the initial period, there is still a long way to go before we can afford to relax,” Dr. Radhakrishnan added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/year-after-first-case-there-is-still-cause-for-concern/article34010481.ece
07 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Police looking out for movement of explosives||The police have launched an intense search across the State to curb the illicit movement of explosives. After reviewing the security arrangements at the police headquarters here on Saturday, Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy issued an elaborate plan in the run-up to the April 6 polling for the Assembly election and the counting of votes. The focus will be more on roads leading to inter-State borders and coastal zones along the eastern seaboard. Armed guards had been deployed at checkpoints, and multi-departmental officials were conducting surprise checks, police sources said on Saturday. Acting on intelligence inputs, senior police officials devised the strategy for managing the election campaign in the backdrop of perception of increasing threats to the VVIPs and congregation of people amid the COVID-19 safety measures, the sources said. In a note to all Commissioners/Superintendents of Police, Mr. Tripathy ordered vehicle checks to intercept the movement of explosives, especially on two-wheelers after it emerged that they were being used with false registration numbers. The police were asked to conduct an expenditure audit at licensed explosive shops to detect any illicit or suspicious transaction in the recent past. Mr. Tripathy said members of communal or caste organisations were likely to occupy lodges or marriage halls in large numbers under the pretext of doing election work. The situation could allow fundamentalists or miscreants to plan anti-social activities. Surprise checks should be conducted to prevent such congregations. Since violence broke out during the filing of nominations in the past, the DGP ordered an assessment of places where problems might occur and preventive measures in coordination with the Revenue Department and other law-enforcement agencies. The advisory asked senior police officers to ensure adherence to the COVID-19 protocol, including thermal scanning, sanitation of polling booths and maintenance of social distancing, at public gatherings or rallies and also during canvassing, filing of nominations, polling and counting of votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-looking-out-for-movement-of-explosives/article34010482.ece

From frayed tempers to ignorant people, they encounter different issues while checking vehicles for unaccounted-for cash, gifts and contraband. Spot visits by The Hindu to some checkpoints threw light on the challenges they face. On Thursday night, a FST of revenue officials and police intercepted a car on the GST Road, Chennai. The driver and the passenger of the high-end vehicle threw their weight around for some time before the team pacified them and checked their vehicle. “Not all are like this. If the passengers are drunk, they create a ruckus. At times, drivers refuse to remove party flags from the vehicles but oblige after we tell them that we are empowered to take action. The Election Commission should make it clear that party flags can’t be seen on auto rickshaws and cars,” said a revenue official. Each district has three FSTs, three SSTs and two Video Surveillance Teams (VSTs) that work on three eight-hour shifts. Each team comprises six officials, including those from the police and other government departments. Movement of cash “The FSTs go around a constituency checking for movement of cash above Rs. 50,000 and gifts worth over Rs. 10,000 without documentation. The SSTs are stationed at checkpoints and check for violations. We also check for party flags installed in public places without permission of the Returning Officer. The VSTs record election expenditure, but their role has not started yet,” said an official of the Co-operative Department who is part of a FST in Vellore district. A SST member from Tiruvallur district said vehicles from Andhra Pradesh had no clue about the election. “We explain the details to them, and they allow us to check the vehicles. Sometimes we stumble upon ‘gutkha’ and other banned products, which are also seized,” said the official.

Mr Stalin could take a final decision keeping in mind that sons of second line leaders such as K.N. Nehru, E.V. Velu and M.R.K. Panneerselvam have also sought tickets to contest this time. While other panellists came out in support of Mr. Udhayanidhi, Mr. Stalin put his foot down saying that he could not be given the ticket.

Radhakrishnan is the BJP’s candidate for the bypoll to the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha constituency. The constituency fell vacantfollowing the death of Congress MP H. Vasanthakumarwho won the election to the seat in 2019 by nearly 2.6 lakh votes. The announcement of Mr. Radhakrishnan’s candidature comes barely 12 hours after theAIADMK-BJP sealed their poll pactfor Tamil Nadu. With 20 Assembly seats and the Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha seat allotted to it, the BJP has announced its candidate. Reacting to the announcement, Mr. Radhakrishnan said that he was familiar with the constituency. “I need no introduction to the people of Kanniyakumari. More than the victories, I have lost many times here. Still, the people have always come to me for any help. Be it at the State or Central or overseas level, I have always reached out to the needy during times of crisis irrespective of whether I was in power or not.” Banking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity, he said, “We have a good number of educational institutions here but the students have to move out for employment. We will try to bring in more industries to southern districts as the BJP government is at the Centre.” Congress functionaries here expect the high command to select a member from the family of Vasanthakumar for the Lok Sabha seat, which would give them an edge over the BJP. Karti names Priyanka Meanwhile, Sivaganga Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, in a tweet, suggested that the party nominate Priyanka Gandhi as the candidate for the constituency. Activist and writer Antony from Nagercoil said from 1951, the constituency had mostly favoured the Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pon-radhakrishnan-is-bjps-by-poll-candidate/article34010073.ece

07 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No physical hearings due to surge in cases, says HC||The Madras High Court has decided to conduct its proceedings virtually or through the hybrid (part physical and part virtual) mode from Monday in view of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in certain pockets of Chennai and other parts of the State. The decision has been taken as a precautionary measure and to ensure a safe working environment, a notification issued by its Registrar-General said on Saturday. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee has ordered all judges in the principal seat of the High Court as well as those in Madurai Bench to hear cases either virtually, with both the government counsel and the private lawyers appearing through videoconference, or through the hybrid mode where only the government counsel would appear in a physical court, the notification stated.  Law officers and the standing counsel alone would be permitted inside the court campus. “Entry of all other advocates, advocate clerks, litigants and parties-in-person inside the High Court is prohibited from March 8. All the law chambers will remain closed from March 8. Advocates who wish to take the case papers may do so on March 6 and March 7,” the notification, issued by C. Kumarappan, read. It also stated that special counters would be established inside the court for filing of case papers, applications for copies of order copies and for receipt of order copies. Meanwhile, unhappy with the notification, the Madras High Court Advocates Association (MHAA) as well as the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) have called for a boycott of all courts and tribunals on Monday to protest against the High Court’s decision to close the lawyers chambers situated inside the court campus. MHAA president G. Mohana Krishnan said the lawyers had been finding it very difficult to continue their profession without being allowed access to their chambers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-physical-hearings-due-to-surge-in-cases-says-hc/article34010087.ece

07 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Signal glitch sends Metro train on the wrong track||Around 12.30 p.m. Friday, several commuters from Airport Metro station, who were bound to Anna Nagar, Thirumangalam, Koyambedu and CMBT, boarded a metro train. But to their disbelief, it went on the wrong track and headed towards Guindy. Perhaps, for the first time, a Metro train went on the wrong route, sources said. The train in question left Airport, passed through Meenambakkam, Nanganallur, Alandur and then had to turn left to proceed to Central via Ekkattuthangal and Koyambedu. But the train crossed Alandur after which the operator realised he had taken the wrong route and was going towards Guindy. “At a point, the operator realised the train had entered the wrong platform at Alandur Metro station. The train had to be rerouted to another track and brought back in the reverse direction,” a source said. Such issues should never occur in public transport systems, the source said. “If someone were to catch a bus or a train, they would have missed it and they will lose trust in this system. We cannot afford to let this happen, because we promise commuters that we will ensure they reach their destination on time,” the source added. Many commuters lost nearly 15-20 minutes of their time as the train had to return to Alandur and then rerouted to the right track. Chennai Metro has two corridors — Central to St. Thomas Mount via Koyambedu and Washermenpet to Airport via Guindy. Apart from this, there are direct trains between Airport and Central. Alandur Metro station serves as a junction for all three corridors and has two levels — trains going from Airport to Washermenpet take the lower level and those going on Airport-Central line via Koyambedu operate on the upper level. This train went to the lower level because of a technical glitch. Action being taken’ According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Ltd., failure of the automatic route setting signal system caused the route to be set in the straight direction instead of diversion towards Koyambedu. “This is a rare case and the department concerned is taking action to avoid such a snag in future,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/signal-glitch-sends-metro-train-on-wrong-route-from-alandur/article34010478.ece

Some leaders in the party feel breaking the alliance would create issues for the Congress in Parliament, where floor coordination with the DMK would become difficult. Multiple sources in the Congress indicated a softening of its stance from its demand of 30 seats, but the current offer of 24 seats, which the Congress claims has been offered by the DMK, is not likely to be accepted, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/seat-sharing-agreement-soon-alagiri/article34010091.ece

Sources in the know of the development said that the judges visited the house of the deceased, the house of the convict and the place where the seven-year-old girl was found dead. The scene of crime was matched with the findings of the police against the accused in the case, Santhosh Kumar of Thondamuthur, who was awarded capital punishment by the Special Court for the POCSO Act cases in Coimbatore on December 27, 2019. The case pertains to the sexual assault and murder of a seven-year-old girl who went missing from the neighbourhood on March 25 evening. Her body was found in an alley close to her house the next morning. Kumar, who had been staying at her grandmother’s house in the neighbourhood of the girl, was arrested by the All Women Police Station, Thudiyalur, as the sole accused in the case. The source added that the judges’ visit of the scene of crime on Saturday was part of the Referred Trial -- a procedure wherein a division bench of the High Court hears a case where the death penalty has been awarded by the trial court. As per Section 366(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, when the Court of Session passes a sentence of death, the proceedings shall be submitted to the High Court and the sentence shall not be executed unless it is confirmed by High Court. Under the procedure, the trial court’s verdict against the convict would automatically be taken up by the High Court Registry as a Referred Trial and listed before a Division Bench for hearing even if the convict does not prefer an appeal. If the convict prefers an appeal, the appeal and the Referred Trial would be clubbed and heard together.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-judges-visit-crime-scene-as-part-of-referred-trial/article34010117.ece

Road, workers restored the paintings on Saturday. Paintings of Mahatma Gandhi, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj were drawn on the walls of the school to enlighten the students on their contribution to the nation. Citing model code of conduct, workers smeared limestone powder on the paintings. Election officials said since the school would be converted into a polling station for the Assembly election, wall paintings were asked to be cleared. However, instead of covering the paintings, the workers smeared limestone powder on them that led to opposition from the residents and parents. On Saturday, the workers repainted and restored the paintings. C. Nallasamy, secretary, Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturalist Associations, has condemned the covering of statues with cloth and termed it as a disrespect to the leaders. In a release, he said covering the statues of political leaders in public places as part of enforcing the model code of conduct was an act of disrespect to them.

07 March 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Vehicle to replace donkeys to transport poll materials to Kathirimalai hamlet||As conducting polling at Kathirimalai hamlet in the Anthiyur Assembly constituency that can be reached after passing through the nine-km jungle terrain has always been a challenging task, election officials have decided to replace donkeys with a pickup vehicle to transport poll materials to enable the 133 odd electors to exercise their democratic right. Located inside the reserve forest area of Chennampatti Forest Range of Erode Forest Division, the hamlet has 70 families comprising 276 members belonging to Soliga community who depend on farming and cattle rearing. They have to reach Kathiripatti or Thanda village at the foothills by foot to purchase essential commodities. In the past elections, the electors walked for five hours to reach Elakiyampatti, a village at the foothills in Salem district, and travelled 85 km again to Anthiyur and exercised their franchise. During the 2016 Assembly elections, a booth was established at the Government Tribal Residential Middle School at the hilltop and donkeys carried the electronic voting machines and poll materials. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, five donkeys transported poll materials from the foothills to the hamlet and back. Last month, the Forest Department allowed repair works in the Right of Way path and a pickup van was operated on trial basis. Presence of boulders and steep terrain posed risk and the vehicle could not be operated. Later, a few repair works were carried out in the pathway and trial run of the vehicle was conducted. Rathna of Kathirimalai who owned the donkeys had sold them recently and purchased a pickup vehicle to commute people in the hilltop. An officer who was part of the team that conducted polling in 2019 told The Hindu it was an arduous task to walk for 12 hours with the help of walking sticks in the reserve force. He expressed happiness over vehicle replacing the donkeys. Election officials said the pickup van would transport the materials for the polling to be held on April 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vehicle-to-replace-donkeys-to-transport-poll-materials-to-kathirimalai-hamlet/article34010104.ece
07 March 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Wireless sets to be used in hilly areas||The Forest Department’s wireless sets will be used in all the 16 polling stations in Bhavani Sagar Assembly constituency that has no mobile connectivity to pass on the polling percentage to the returning officer during polling on April 6. Of the total 2,215 polling booths located at 926 locations in all the eight constituencies in the district, 16 booths in Bhavanisagar and 20 in Athiyur are located in remote hilly areas and have no mobile connectivity. Since polling percentage on the poll day needs to be informed to the election officials, a meeting was held recently in which it was decided to utilise the service of the wireless sets of the Forest Department for passing the details. District Revenue Officer P. Murugesan inspected the booths at Kalithimbam, Bejalatti, Kottadai and Gethesal where mobile connectivity is not available. He inspected the arrangements for the conduct of polling and told officials to use wireless sets to pass on polling data once an hour to the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wireless-sets-to-be-used-in-hilly-areas/article34010106.ece
07 March 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘Present elections crucial for political parties’||Only the present general elections to the Legislative Assembly can stop the Bharatiya Janata Party from stepping into the southern States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, said senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram here on Saturday. Speaking to reporters, he said that this elections were crucial for all the political parties, which opposed the BJP. "The Bharatiya Janata Party should not grow beyond the Vindhyas. At no cost, they should be allowed to penetrate south," he stressed. In Puducherry, they have been trying their gimmicks. In Kerala, they were trying to create confusion among the electorate. Thus, the cadres here in Tamil Nadu should be vigilant and chase them away in the electoral process. Remaining indifferent or nonchalant may give them (BJP) the space, he cautioned. Together it is possible, the senior leader said and added that he would campaign in the constituencies, where the BJP contested for the Assembly seat. "Unfortunately, the AIADMK had pledged its self-respect with the BJP. No point in accusing them. With the support of the DMK, the party [BJP] should be shown the door in the south," he reiterated. For some wrong reasons, the BJP had been let inside and rule in Karnataka. In other States in the Hindi belt, they ruled. "The BJP is not a party. It is something like a poisonous plant. Allowing it to grow is a dangerous phenomenon to the society and the nation," Mr. Chidambaram said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/present-elections-crucial-for-political-parties/article34010088.ece

07 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||A large number of women are anaemic: doctors||Around 57% of Indian women in the age group of 15 to 49 years were anaemic and India had the highest number of anaemic pregnant women. So steps must be taken to bring down prevalence of anaemia among women, stressed medical experts at Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre here on Saturday. S. Padma, Head, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and P. L. Alagammai, Consultant, Medical Gastroenterology, addressed mediapersons on ‘Improving women’s health: challenges, treatment and prevention of health issues’ in connection with International Women’s Day, which falls on March 8. They said there was an increase in prevalence of anaemia among women aged between 15 and 49, according to a recent National Family Health Survey as compared to 2015-2016. Anaemia during pregnancy is also linked to a preterm or low-birth-weight baby, blood transfusion, postpartum depression and poor neonatal health. Indian women and children are anaemic as their diet does not have sufficient iron, folic acid or vitamin B12, the doctors said. On poor menstrual hygiene, they said only around 36% of women in India have access to proper menstrual hygiene products. Non-availability of clean sanitary pads and lack of access to clean toilets and water were major areas of concern, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-large-number-of-women-are-anaemic-say-doctors/article34010093.ece

Though with limited attendance, the family members from retired persons to two-year-old girl child had come to the temple town from different parts of the State and Odissa to join the centenary birthday celebrations of M. Palanimmal of Koomapatti. “It was a joyous occasion for all us, it is a rare function,” said one of the grand nephews, Saravanan. Wife of a landlord, Mahadevan, the woman has a big family of seven children – four sons and three daughters. Through them she has got 19 grandchildren, 25 great grandchildren. “Two little children of one of the great grandchildren too took part in the function,” said Mr. Saravanan.

07 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘Prices should match rising cost’||Alongside the protest against the three new farm laws, issues concerning agriculture have dominated the political discourse in Tamil Nadu as the government came up with one announcement after another in the run-up to the Assembly election. Although measures such as loan waiver and compensation for crop damage provide succour to farmers, many in the Cauvery delta region believe the agrarian crisis runs deeper. Vagaries of monsoon and the uncertain flow in the Cauvery, labour shortage and rising wages, spiralling cultivation costs and poor returns have all worn down the farmers. “The foremost concern is that returns do not match production cost — be it of paddy, sugar cane, cotton or any other crop,” says Cauvery S. Dhanapalan, general secretary of the Cauvery Farmers Protection Association. The crop loan waiver is, no doubt, a big help, but not enough by itself, argues P. Ayyakkanu, president of the Desiya Thennidia Nadigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam. “What we need is remunerative prices. The Swaminathan Commission recommended providing a 50% profit to farmers over and above the cost of cultivation. The Narendra Modi government promised to double the income of farmers. But they have not materialised,” he rues. Some contend that not all farmers stand to benefit from the crop loan waiver. “What about those who have raised loans from commercial banks and other sources. Besides, medium-term loans are not covered under the waiver. Honest farmers who have been repaying loans do not stand to benefit. Significantly, the short-term loans were rescheduled as medium- term loans at the behest of the government after Cyclone Gaja,” points out Mr. Dhanapalan. He suggests that the government extend incentives for cultivation, on the lines of the schemes being implemented in Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry, as a direct support measure. With discontent over hydrocarbon exploration dominating electioneering in the delta in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the government sought to garner some goodwill by declaring the delta region a protected agricultural zone. “But we are yet to see any tangible benefit out of it. For instance, illegal sand mining from rivers continues at many places,” says V. Jeevakumar of Thanjavur. There are also apprehensions over the farm laws, the Mettur-Sarabanga Lift Irrigation Project and even the Cauvery-Gundar link project, which has been largely welcomed in the Pudukottai district though. “Any talk of diversion of surplus water of the Cauvery raises apprehensions among delta farmers,” points out Mr. Jeevakumar. P.R. Pandian of the Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam alleges that the Mettur- Sarabanga Project to divert “surplus” flows from the Mettur dam would render the delta a desert. A few farmers in Karur, too, question the diversion of surplus waters for the Cauvery-Gundar link project. “Is it worth the investment? They can at best divert flood waters for 10 days in a year,” says M. Shanmugam, a farmer of Marudur. However, farmers’ representatives welcome the prominence given to agriculture.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prices-should-match-rising-cost/article34010076.ece
07 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘Poll results will bring BJP’s downfall’||The results of the forthcoming Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and other States would herald the downfall of the BJP government at the Centre, D. Raja, general secretary, Communist Party of India, said in Tiruchi on Saturday. “The results of the elections in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry will signal the beginning of the end for the BJP regime. In Tamil Nadu, it is apparent that people are eager to usher in a change and vote for a good government,” Mr.Raja told reporters after participating in the State council meeting of the CPI here. The Assembly elections are being held at a time when the country’s Constitution, secular fabric and democratic polity have come under threat from the RSS-controlled BJP government. The Constitution declares India a secular, democratic republic and a welfare state, but the RSS was trying to make it a theocratic state, Mr. Raja alleged. He also accused the Union government of trying to privatise the country’s resources. Public Sector Units built with the sweat and toil of the people were being privatised and only corporate interests were protected. The Modi government was not willing to listen to the demands of labourers and farmers who were fighting for their rights, he added. Contending that the continuation of the BJP rule was not good for the country, Mr. Raja said voters had a big responsibility to protect democracy in the country as the BJP was trying to win a mandate misusing its authority and money power. Every government institution, be it the Income Tax Department, the Enforcement Directorate or the Central Bureau of Investigation, was being misused for political ends, Mr. Raja charged. Voters in Tamil Nadu, with its unique history of fostering social reforms, social justice and rationalism, would reject communal forces and any party which joined hands with them. People were waiting to bring in an alternative to the “corrupt” AIADMK government which had failed to protect the rights of the people, he said. To a query on the number of seats allotted to the CPI in the DMK-led alliance, R. Mutharasan, State Secretary of the party, observed that only the goal was important and not the numbers. “The object is to ensure the victory of secular forces and the defeat of communalism,” he maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poll-results-will-bring-bjps-downfall/article34010082.ece

Stating that PSU banks had been enjoying the trust of the people, they said it would deprive many services enjoyed by them for so long without any cost. Privitisation would impact the general public to a great extent. It would take banking beyond the reach of the common man. The customers would have to pay for each and every transaction.

Commissioner of Police T.S. Anbu, during a review meeting held on Saturday, said that action had been initiated against 215 persons, who were charged with IPC offences during this year and another 118 suspects who had indulged in serious crimes. Special teams have been formed to secure the suspects. The Commissioner said that in the last four to five days alone, officers in the respective stations and sub-divisions under the city limits had detained 45 persons wanted in many crimes. “The combing operations will continue and no one, who violated the laws, can escape,” he warned. In the recent past, when a gang had hurled bombs against the police station in Thatchanallur, six persons were arrested, including Praveenraj (28), Rajasekaran (27) and Vikram (26). Based on the recommendations of the police officers, the Commissioner had ordered detention of the accused under the Goondas Act and jailed them in Coimbatore Central Prisons. Senior officers in the city and the district said that special check posts had been installed and flying squads formed jointly with officials from revenue and other departments. So far, the teams had seized 7.72 kg of silver, and Rs. 1.25 lakh in cash among others. The police said that the public should carry valid documents while carrying cash and failure to substantiate it with proof would lead to seizure as per the guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tirunelveli-city-police-intensify-combing/article34010628.ece
07 March 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Bird count records eight new sightings||Even as anti-nuke activists blame the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP) of irreparably damaging the environment and posing a serious threat to marine wealth in areas surrounding an upcoming nuclear park, KKNPP organised its fifth episode of ‘Kudankulam Bird Count’ recently where eight new sightings were recorded. The Pelican Nature Club of KKNPP, formed under the aegis of the Environment Stewardship Programme (ESP) of Nuclear Power Corporation of India, organised the bird count on February 28. KKBC, an annual birding event, is being organised since 2017 immediately after winter when the population of birds in the region swells owing to arrival of migratory birds. Keeping the KKNPP’s Anuvijay Township as base, all major habitats and birding spots around are surveyed by bird watchers. After KKBC-2021 was flagged off by Rajeev Manohar Godbole, Site Director, KKNPP, at 6 a.m. on February 28, in the presence of M. S. Suresh, Project Director, KKNPP -5 and 6, and R. Ramdoss, president of Pelican Nature Club, 49 bird enthusiasts, including members of Pelican Nature Club, employees and teachers of Atomic Energy Central School, KKNPP, took part in the exercise. Participants were divided into five teams and each team was led by an experienced birder. Each team visited their predefined transects, essentially important birding spots in and around Kudankulam, and carried out the bird count. The idea was to make a one-day-record of bird species in the region. After returning from the survey, each team presented their observations and shared their experience . All field observations were compiled and analysed. In total, over 23,000 birds were counted at 25 different locations in the region including Manakudy, Puthalam, Swamithope, Suchindaram, Rajakkamangalam, Koonthankulam, Kaadankulam, Nanguneri, Anuvijay Township and KKNPP Site. As many as 137 species of birds were seen during the one-day study, said volunteers. Interestingly, eight new sightings — Brown Flycatcher, Crested Serpent Eagle, Oriental Magpie Robin, Blue-Throated Flycatcher, Orange-headed Thrush, Black-headed Cuckoo Shrike, Chestnut-bellied Sand Grouse and Loten Sunbird — were recorded. With this, the checklist of bird species in the region has gone up to159. “It means, at least 159 kinds of birds can be seen in this region where KKNPP and its Township are located. In Anu Vijay Township of KKNPP alone, 88 species of birds were sighted. Some of the birds seen are Oriental Darter, Painted Stork, Spot-billed Pelican, Osprey, Chestnut-bellied Sand grouse and Crested Serpent Eagle. A large number of migratory birds such as Barn Swallow [over 400], a winter migrant from The Himalayas, and Crested Terns [over 200], another winter migrant from Pale Arctic region, have also been seen on the premises of KKNPP site,” said Mr. Godbole. Since 2000, KKNPP has improved the eco-system on its premises through a green-belt development programme. And since in nuclear power generation no pollutants are released to the environment, the surrounding fauna is flourishing. According to the findings of the study, the KKNPP site and its township alone are home to about 90 species of birds including migratory and rare species. “This is a testimony to the fact that nuclear power technology is benign to nature,” the Site Director said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fifth-episode-of-kudankulam-bird-count-records-eight-new-sightings/article34010092.ece

07 March 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Idols seized in Tiruppur||Flying squad officials seized two idols made of brass from a car during a vehicle check at Kulathupalayam within the Tiruppur North Assembly constituency on Saturday. Revenue Department sources said that the flying squad officials found the idols of two deities in the car, which were around two-and-a-half feet tall. Syed Rasool (40), who was present in the car, claimed that these were being taken to Bengaluru for polishing. As he did not possess any valid documents to carry these idols, the incident was referred to Tiruppur Revenue Divisional Officer and Returning Officer for Tiruppur North Assembly constituency M. Jaganathan, the sources said. After examining the idols, Mr. Jaganathan referred the case to Tiruppur City Police. The idols and the vehicle were seized and kept at the Tiruppur North police station on Saturday evening.

07 March 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||One more arrested in registration dept. scam||The Tiruppur City Police on Friday arrested another accused for his alleged involvement in the case related to committing forgery and misappropriating funds to the tune of nearly Rs. 69 lakh in the Registration Department. According to police, R. Prakash was employed as an assistant in a private typing office in Tiruppur. He was the college-mate of R. Shankar, a former assistant at the Sub-Registrar Office (Joint-I), who was arrested in January. Shankar and an assistant at the Thottipalayam Sub-Registrar Office Panneerselvam allegedly gave the idea to Prakash on the possibilities of irregularities in the e-payment receipts used during document registration to misappropriate money. Prakash also sought the help of a document writer from the private typing office to commit the crime. The case was filed in December 2020 based on the complaint by Tiruppur District Registrar R. Ramasamy regarding the misappropriation of cash worth Rs. 68,93,432 paid by the public for the registration of 47 documents at four Sub-Registrar Offices in Tiruppur. The Central Crime Branch of the city police arrested government employee Shankar and Jaishankar, a document writer at a private typing office, on January 27. Panneerselvam, who is also a government employee, is absconding and efforts to nab him are on, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/one-more-arrested-in-registration-dept-scam/article34010506.ece

Chellamuthu announced on Saturday that his party will back the AIADMK in the Assembly election. Speaking to reporters in Palladam, he said that the outfit will no longer back the DMK due the alleged lack of respect for its allies. “We have no interest to stay at a place that has no respect for us,” he said. Mr. Chellamuthu cited pro-farmer initiatives by the State government such as the recent crop loan waiver, works done under the Kudimaramathu scheme and launch of Athikadavu-Avinashi project as reasons for the UUK to support the AIADMK. If elected back to power, the AIADMK must ensure waiver of farm loans from nationalised banks and inauguration of Anamalaiyar-Nallaru scheme for the benefit of farmers in the State, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-party-to-back-aiadmk/article34010116.ece
07 March 2021||Tiruvannamalai,TAMIL NADU||We will not allow ‘dark regime’ of DMK to return: Murugan||“Our aim is to win all the 20 seats in the Assembly election and ensure victory for our alliance. We will ensure that the dark regime of the DMK does not happen again,” said BJP president L. Murugan. He was addressing the media in Tiruvannamalai during the ‘Velvom Tamilagam’ rally conducted by the BJP. “We have been allotted 20 seats. After further discussions we will decide where our party members will be contesting from. We will work hard for the victory of our alliance partners too,” said Mr. Murugan. Answering a question on why the BJP was given fewer seats despite being a national party, Mr. Murugan said that the party was growing rapidly and making its presence felt in Tamil Nadu. “Depending on this we have got the seats,” he explained. ‘Scams rampant’ Stating that land grabbing, kangaroo courts and other scams were rampant during the DMK regime, Mr. Murugan said that the party was against Tamils and its culture. “They were mute spectators when Tamils were killed in Sri Lanka. The DMK was behind Karuppar Kootam that tarnished the image of Tamil god Murugan. The party is against the development of Tamils,” he added. Reacting to a question on the alleged unhappiness in the Congress camp over less number of seats allotted by the DMK, the BJP president said the DMK’s alliance would break any time. “This shows that the DMK does not respect its partners,” he added. Speaking about the farmers’ protest, he said that farmers in Kerala, Assam and West Bengal had no problems at all. “In Tamil Nadu too DMK tried to instigate the farmers, but as they did not get support they could not succeed,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/we-will-not-allow-dark-regime-of-dmk-to-return-murugan/article34010090.ece

With six seats, the MDMK might be forced to contest on six different symbols. With not much time left for campaigning, it was decided to contest on the DMK symbol to avoid unnecessary complications, he said. Asked whether he would undertake a State-wide campaign for the DMK, Mr. Vaiko said he would certainly do so. Sanathana Hindutva forces were making a massive effort to establish themselves in Tamil Nadu, the land of Periyar and Anna. They were trying to impose not only Hindi and Sanskrit but also Sanathana dharma, he said. In the past, thousands had suffered to protect the Dravidian movement. Their efforts should not go waste, and there was a necessity to counter and defeat the BJP’s slaves, he said. Furthermore, when DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi was in hospital, he visited him along with Mr. Stalin, Mr. Vaiko said. “I promised to stand by brother Stalin as I stood by Kalaignar,” he recalled, adding that he had been campaigning since then for the DMK. Asked whether it was a challenge to contest as part of the DMK-led front for the first time, Mr. Vaiko said, “He was happy.” Questioned how he viewed Mr. Stalin as a chief ministerial candidate, he said the DMK president was an efficient legislator who had all the qualifications to be a Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mdmk-allotted-six-seats/article34010118.ece

We will be signing the agreement tomorrow around 10 a.m.,” Mr. Rao told The Hindu after the meeting. The Congress was left with not many options after the DMK refused to concede its demand for 30 seats. Many in the Congress had been talking of walking out of the alliance if the demand was not met. Some leaders also floated the option of tying up with actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam as a last resort. Pushed to the wall owing to the lack of strong alternatives, the Congress settled for 25 seats. The development came nearly three hours after Mr. Alagiri told reporters on the sidelines of a public meeting that a seat-sharing arrangement would be announced soon. Several leaders told The Hindu on Friday evening that the possibility of signing a deal was likely only on Monday since the DMK’s mega rally in Tiruchi was scheduled for Sunday. A senior Congress leader attributed the climbdown to a lack of better options for the party. “What other options do we have? The other options are not great...,” the leader said. In the past week, several Congress leaders had been insisting on “dignity for the party in the alliance and the number of seats”. On Friday, a senior leader told The Hindu that back-channel talks were taking place between the two parties. A source in New Delhi said the central leadership was miffed at the State unit for fumbling on the seat-sharing exercise though it was given a free hand. The central leadership felt that winning a higher number of the allotted seats was more important than contesting in more seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cong-settles-for-25-seats/article34010480.ece

07 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. may not permit big protests, gatherings||Following recommendations from the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), Karnataka is likely to stop giving permission to hold mass protests involving over 500 people. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar told presspersons on Saturday that he would speak to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in this regard. “The TAC has warned that the next two months are crucial for the State, especially as the neighbouring Maharashtra and Kerala are witnessing a spike in cases. Along with strict enforcement of measures on the borders, restrictions on large gatherings, including protests/agitations, social, religious, and political gatherings, and weddings, will be tightened,” he said. Asked if this meant that the government would stop giving permission for protests, the Minister said, “Yes... The TAC has recommended that not more than 500 people should be allowed at large gatherings. I appeal to people, all religious heads, and political leaders and parties to follow these guidelines strictly and stop coming to Bengaluru for protests for at least the next two months.” Starting from Monday, vaccination will be provided at over 3,000 centres. Urging people to come forward in large numbers to take the vaccine, he said the target was to vaccinate 1.5 lakh people each day. “We hope to vaccinate all the people of the State in the next two months,” he said.  Surge in Bengaluru  Dr. Sudhakar, who pointed out that the number of new cases in Bengaluru was on the rise, said, “The city had been reporting 200 to 250 cases a day for several weeks. This suddenly increased to 444 on Friday. Moreover, 12 clusters have been identified in BBMP limits, and this is a concern.”  “Contact tracing will also be intensified. The Central team that recently visited the State has recommended that at least 20 primary and secondary contacts should be traced for each positive case. All these 20 contacts should be tested,” the Minister said. He said the Chief Minister would hold a videoconference meeting with Deputy Commissioners of districts where the test positivity rate is high. “As there are more inter-State travellers to Mangaluru, testing will be ramped up there. Instructions have been issued to Bengaluru Urban, Dakshina Kannada, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Udupi, Kodagu, Belagavi, and Tumakuru to be more vigilant,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-may-not-permit-big-protests-gatherings/article34010134.ece
07 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Hike in taxes unlikely in Budget||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who will be presenting the State Budget for 2021–22 on Monday, is expected not to increase the taxes on fuel and other essential commodities. With a shortfall in revenue this year owing to COVID-19, however, the Budget is also unlikely to give relief to consumers by reducing taxes.  Bypoll impact Keeping an eye on the bypolls in three Assembly segments of Basavakalyan, Maski and Sindagi and the Lok Sabha constituency of Belagavi, Mr. Yediyurappa is expected to announce a slew of projects in these constituencies. With elections to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike council likely to be held this year, Bengaluru, which contributes more than 60% of the State’s revenue, is expected to get huge funds for infrastructure. Focus on women Since the Budget is to be presented on March 8, which marks International Women’s Day, the Chief Minister has promised to give priority to women’s welfare. A large number of women working as anganwadi and ASHA workers, who played a vital role in the containment of COVID-19, are expected to get increased allowances. The Budget numbers during 2020–21 have undergone massive revisions as the State has had a shortfall in revenue collection amid the pandemic and constrained economic activities for most of the months. To overcome the shortfall, the government is expected to raise borrowings in the form of special development loans from the RBI and other sources such as NABARD. By increasing the borrowing limit from 3% to 5% of the GSDP by the Centre, the State is expected to borrow nearly Rs. 86,000 crore this year (2020–21). Fuel taxes However, increase in fuel prices is likely to compensate to some extent the shortfall in revenue collection in commercial taxes, motor vehicles, stamps and registration, and excise. Hike in fuel prices — the prices have increased 21 times in 2021 — would result in the State mopping up an additional Rs. 2,500 crore annually. Revenue from taxes on fuel will fetch Rs. 15,000 crore in 2020–21. The State has imposed 35% taxes on petrol and 24% on diesel. Collections from commercial taxes is expected to cross Rs. 70,000 crore against the target of Rs. 82,443 crore for the year 2020–21. The Budget is expected to give focus on reducing committed expenditure, including salaries, pensions, subsidies, and interest payments, which is nearly 90% of the State revenue by introducing administrative reforms. Subsidy cuts With huge amounts going the way of subsidies, the Budget is likely to announce measures to crack down on “bogus beneficiaries” of pensions, ration cards, and subsidies under various welfare schemes. The CM, presenting his eighth Budget, has hinted that the Budget size would be slightly bigger this time, considering that the State has been allowed to borrow more. The size in 2020-21 was Rs. 2,37,893 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hike-in-taxes-unlikely-in-budget/article34010137.ece
07 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Law to prevent malicious attacks on public figures being planned’||Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, one of the six Ministers who got an injunction order on Saturday on the media against publishing defamatory news on them, said the State government was mulling over bringing a strong law to prevent such “false and malicious attacks and blackmail”. Dr. Sudhakar also said more Ministers were likely to approach courts seeking similar injunctions. The appeal came days after Ramesh Jarkiholi had to resign from the ministry following the airing of his intimate moments with a woman who had allegedly been promised a government job. Discussion with CM “We have discussed it with the Chief Minister and the Law Minister. This has become a new trend, blackmailing and tarnishing the image of a person in public life with CDs and false accusations. Not just politicians, many celebrities have faced this. A strong law needs to be brought to end this,” he said. Dr. Sudhakar alleged a “political conspiracy” was under way to carry out a smear campaign against them by “misusing media”. “With today’s technological advances, anyone can be falsely targeted. If they have a case anyone can go to the courts. But people are indulging in hit-and-run attacks, tarnishing our image built for several years of hard work. This is immoral and illegal,” he said, defending his move of seeking a gag order on the media. Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil tweeted that the injunction order “was only a precautionary measure to prevent a defamatory campaign against him”. Other Ministers who approached the court and have been successful in getting an interim injunction order, also claimed “political conspiracy” and that technology could be “misused” to tarnish them. Dr. Sudhakar and Youth and Sports Minister K.C. Narayana Gowda also defended Mr. Jarkiholi, expressing suspicion that he was also a victim of such a conspiracy. ‘No incident in Mumbai’ Urban Development Minister B.A. Basavaraj said a few Ministers, including him, were being targeted for leaving the Congress and joining the Bharatiya Janata Party, thus facilitating the latter to form the government. He denied rumours of the existence of a CD recorded during their stay in Mumbai, after they quit the Congress and before they joined the BJP. Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekhar said the “truth behind the conspiracy” to defame them would be out in the next three or four days. “All the 15 of us who went to Mumbai will hold a press conference together and tell the people what happened in Mumbai and who are behind the smear campaign now,” claimed Mr. Somashekhar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/law-to-prevent-malicious-attacks-on-public-figures-being-planned/article34010251.ece
07 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Theft in Customs strongroom||The Customs department has initiated an internal inquiry into the alleged theft of a gold bangle from the strongroom at its headquarters on Queens Road. The gold bangle had been seized from a passenger in July last year. However, officials are yet to identify the perpetrator or pinpoint when the theft took place. It was only when they opened the seal of the seized items before the magistrate on February 23 that officials realised one bangle weighing 50 grams and worth Rs. 2.3 lakh was missing. “This is a major embarrassment and an internal inquiry has been initiated to ascertain the identity of the thief,” said a source. Rajiv S. Kittur, Deputy Commissioner, Custom vigilance, has filed a complaint with the Commercial Street police on Wednesday. The police have filed an FIR against the unknown accused. “We are waiting for the internal inquiry report as well as CCTV footage for further investigations,” said a senior police officer. According to the FIR, Customs officials deployed at Kempegowda International Airport had seized three bangles from a passenger who had arrived from San Francisco last year. After she was unable to provide documentation for them, they seized the bangles and sent it to the Customs office August 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/theft-in-customs-strongroom/article34010470.ece

The loco pilot of the passenger train alerted the guards and the Baiyappanahalli railway police. “Suneel left home around 6 p.m. after informing his mother that he was going for a walk,” said a senior police official. When he did not return, even by midnight, his parents started searching for him, only to be informed by the police of his death. “We are trying to ascertain why he would take such an extreme step,” said the official. The police are consulting medical professionals after the boy’s father, Suryanarayana Swamy, said that Suneel was hospitalised for COVID-19 a month ago. “The family says that he underwent a personality change. He stopped interacting with them and remained aloof. Worried about his mental health, his parents sought professional counselling,” the senior police official added. The Baiyappanahalli police have taken up a case and are investigating.

07 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ploy to create political instability: Bommai||Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai has expressed suspicion that “a large political conspiracy to create political instability” could be at play in the State. “Amid strong rumours of a smear campaign, some Ministers who have got a whiff of this have approached the courts as a precautionary measure to protect their reputation. More Ministers and legislators will likely follow them,” he said on Saturday, defending their “right to legal recourse”. “Four days after the issue came into the public domain, the woman not coming forward and recording her statement has raised suspicions,” he said. He said the police were investigating the case from all angles, including the allegation by the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy of a “deal” of Rs. 5 crore in the case. However, Union Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda said the Ministers approaching the courts “is not a good development”. “Everyone will have their future interests in mind and we cannot restrict anybody from seeking legal recourse. But this is not a good development,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ploy-to-create-political-instability-bommai/article34010252.ece
07 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Multilayer masks offer best protection: IISc. study||A team of researchers from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) with the help of a high-speed camera to track the impact of individual cough-like droplets on protective wear, has concluded that multilayer masks are the most effective. When a person coughs, large droplets, greater than 200 microns, hit the inner surface of a mask at a high speed, penetrate the fabric and break up or atomise into smaller droplets, said IISc. in a press release. These droplets have a greater chance of aerosolisation, where they are converted into smaller particles that are light enough to be carried into air, along with the virus load. The team used a custom droplet dispenser to mimic a human cough. “We could generate droplets ranging from 200 microns to 1.2 mm in size,” said Shubham Sharma, a PhD. student in the department and first author of the study, in the release. They then tracked the impact of the droplets on single-, double- and multilayer masks. They noted the size distribution of the smaller droplets generated after they entered the mask fabric. For single- and double-layer masks, most of these atomised droplets were found to be smaller than 100 microns, with the potential to become aerosols, which can remain suspended in the air for a long time and potentially cause infection, said the release. “You are protected, but others around you may not be,” says Saptarshi Basu, Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering and senior author of the study, which was published in the peer reviewed journal, Science Advances . Single-layer masks could only block 30% of the initial droplet volume from escaping. “Double-layer masks were better, with about 91% blocked,” said the release. But more than a quarter of the atomised droplets that were generated were in the size range of aerosols. Droplet transmission and generation was either negligible or zero for triple-layer and N95 masks. “Triple-layer masks even those made of cloth and N95 masks were found to successfully prevent atomisation, and therefore offered the best protection,” said the researchers in the press release. However, they noted that in the absence of such masks, people should use even a single-layer mask, as they may offer some protection. Previous studies looked at how these droplets ‘leak’ from the sides of masks, but not at how the mask itself can aid in secondary atomisation into smaller droplets. “Most studies also don’t look at what is going on at the individual droplet level and how aerosols can be generated,” said Prof. Basu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/multilayer-masks-offer-best-protection-iisc-study/article34010467.ece
07 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Congress, BJP spar on Twitter||While most senior leaders of both the ruling BJP and Opposition Congress remained cautiously silent over six Ministers seeking a gag order on the media from court, the party units fought it out on Twitter on Saturday. ‘Murky dealings’ “Why have ministers sought gag orders even before anything incriminating against them is revealed?” tweeted Karnataka Congress, arguing that it shows how the BJP had come to power on the back of several alleged murky dealings. “Now we understand why your own people called you Blackmail Janata Party,” said another tweet. Congress also attacked Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje for refusing to comment on the issue. BJP hits back BJP Karnataka hit back posing a series of questions as to whether seven JD(S) MLAs cross-voting during Siddaramaiah’s tenure or further back in history, toppling of the Devaraj Urs government was not “Operation Hasta”. ‘Sack them’ Meanwhile, JD(S) leader S.R. Mahesh has demanded all the six Ministers who have approached the court seeking a gag order must be sacked from the Cabinet.

In her complaint filed on Saturday, K.H. Indira, who said she was an activist, sought the arrest of both the activists on the grounds that they are part of a “deep-rooted conspiracy”. ‘Part of a network’ It is Mr. Kallahalli who has sought an investigation against Mr. Jarkiholi and submitted a CD with audio and video clips purportedly of the Minister’s interactions with a woman. Ms. Indira claimed that as both the activists had reportedly said they were aware of many more scandals and CDs, they were part of a larger network that was taking advantage of gullible women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/complaint-against-kallahalli/article34010259.ece

CITU district president Dharmesh said the farmers’ protest had the support of all citizens of the country. The protest would grow strong if the government did not fulfil the demands.

Speaking to presspersons at KIMS Hospital in Hubballi on Saturday after getting a shot of the COVISHIELD vaccine, Mr. Horatti said nothing was more important than life and it would be better if all aged above 60 got the vaccine. He said if the issue of inoculation came for discussion in the Council, he would request the government to make it mandatory for government employees. On the suspension of a Congress MLA for ‘misconduct’ in the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Horatti said the elected representatives should behave responsibly on the floor of the House. If anyone has an issue, they should have patience and it should be brought to the notice of the Speaker or chairman of the Legislative Council. Behaving irresponsibly on the floor of the House does not suit an elected representative, he said. Regarding six Ministers of State approaching the court for prohibiting any defamatory news on electronic, print and social media, Mr. Horatti said the elected representatives should be cautious while in public life. “Those in public life should learn to behave properly and also responsibly. One should discharge the responsibilities given to them by the people properly,” he said. His wife Hemalath Horatti also received the vaccine at the hospital.

Led by the officebearers of RKS, farmers and farm labourers staged a demonstration wearing black badges and forming a human chain condemning the continued apathy of the Union government towards the rightful demands of the farming community. Addressing the protesters, Dharwad district secretary of RKS Sharanu Gonawar said although farmers were protesting braving cold weather and rains, the Centre was bent on protecting the interests of the corporate companies. He said instead of helping the farmers and safeguarding their interests, the Centre was giving a red carpet welcome to the corporate companies and was bent on handing over the farm sector on a platter to corporate firms. Farmers of the country were waging a no-compromise agitation in New Delhi and it was the duty of every farmer to support them and be with them morally till they succeed in the fight, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-observe-black-day-in-dharwad/article34010127.ece

07 March 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Despite vaccination, follow safety protocol’||While expressing the need for private hospitals and non-governmental organisations to get involved in the ongoing vaccination drive, M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State COVID-19 Technical Committee, on Saturday said despite vaccination, people should continue wearing masks, and follow other safety protocols. In his virtual talk on ‘My reflection COVID-19 in Karnataka’ at Dr. B.S. Sajjan Endowment Oration organised by Kasturba Medical College here, Dr. Sudarshan said Covishield and Covaxin were being given following the Central government authorising emergency use of these vaccines. “Data on these vaccines is being compiled. Taking the jab does not exempt from wearing of masks and not complying with other safety protocols,” he said. Dr. Sudarshan said unless people follow safety protocols, it will be inevitable to go once again for lockdown, which will be difficult for people. Giridhara Babu, member of State Vision Group on health and medical education, said though virulent stream of COVID-19 has not been noticed so far, it should not lead to lowering of safety protocols. “Wearing of masks is a good thing and it should continue,” he said. The vaccination, he said, prevents deaths and serious infection from COVID-19. With good number of Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANMs), staff nurses and other ground level staff, the country can easily cover 300 million people in a month, he said. While expressing his concern over poor turnout of health workers for vaccination, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Ramachandra Bairy said so far only 60% of the 52,381 health workers have taken the jab. “This is not a number we should see in the region known for literacy.” As many as 80% of frontline workers have received the jab, while senior citizens are coming in good number to receive the first dose of vaccine in urban and rural areas of the district, he said. Case load While the burden from COVID-19 on the health establishments in district has come down, Dr. Bairy said they are now tasked with the tough job of preventing spread of COVID-19 from Kerala and Maharashtra, where the case loads are high. “There is every chance of (COVID-19) case load increasing for the second time in the district,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/despite-vaccination-follow-safety-protocol/article34010568.ece

07 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC to further promote ‘green’ weddings||In an attempt to promote “green weddings” and encourage more people join its campaign that aims to generate less or zero waste, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), which is eyeing a top ‘Swachh’ rank this time, has constituted a dedicated team to facilitate the weddings and other events go the ‘green’ way. The core team, comprising environment engineers, health staff and others, assists families in putting up a green wedding right from the planning stage till its execution. Shortly, a devoted website is being launched by the MCC with all the details on such events along with the guidelines. Whom to approach in MCC, how to plan and so on will be available on the website. Green weddings are not new to the MCC but it wants to make them effective and encourage more to join the campaign of generating less or zero waste. Importantly, they are plastic-free events. After Shilpa Nag took over as Commissioner of MCC, more thrust is now being given for the concept which got attention in her earlier stint as Commissioner. Now, with a team available to guide the events, it’s easier for the parties to plan besides save cost. MCC Health Officer Nagaraj told The Hindu that the team is ready and the website is getting ready. With ‘Hasiru Dala’, the MCC successfully conducts zero-waste green weddings and the minimal waste generated is processed for composting at the zero waste management plants. Recycled as compost Last month, the team assisted a wedding and also ensured that the waste generated was minimal. A total of 475.5 kg of waste was generated in a two-day event, including banana leaves and flowers. Segregated food waste and flower waste were recycled into compost. What is notable is that the MCC does this service for free, to encourage more people to join the campaign which is gradually catching up in Mysuru, Dr. Nagaraj said. The green wedding in February this year was the first such wedding post-pandemic. By the end of 2019, Mysuru had witnessed six ‘green’ weddings, a ‘green’ housewarming ceremony and a ‘green’ thread ceremony (upanayanam) and they were by and large “plastic-free”. Whoever conducts the green wedding, shunning plastic use, and reducing bulk waste generation, is awarded with a ‘Green Wedding Certificate’, certifying the “environment-friendly” initiative, which is handed over to the newly-married couple acknowledging their concern. “We have the database on making green wedding possible. It could be the suppliers of steel plates, steel cups, and so on. The idea is to discourage the use of plantain leaves and paper or bottled water, to minimise waste. If more such people in the food industry and event organisers come forward, it will turn most weddings eco-friendly,” Dr. Nagaraj said. The quantum of waste generated in the wedding halls can be radically reduced by way of green weddings, which are memorable and special too. The leftover food is distributed among the orphanages here by an NGO who has tied-up with the MCC for the purpose. Organic detergents for washing steel plates and cups for reusing the waste water, cloth bags and hand-made invitation cards are now being promoted to endorse green weddings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-to-further-promote-green-weddings/article34010247.ece
07 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Action likely against those who shouted slogans against ex-CM||Mysuru City Congress Committee president R. Murthy has said that action would be taken against partymen who shouted slogans against former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah following a rift in the party over the recent mayoral polls here. Amid speculation over the suspension of six partymen close to former Minister Tanveer Sait, Mr. Murthy said he had received no such directions so far. But he said he expected action against the office-bearers who shouted slogans against Mr. Siddaramaiah, in a gross violation of party discipline. “Action will be taken. But against whom and how many is not known. No directions have come so far from the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee in the regard,” he said. He said the guilty would be identified on the basis of media reports and CCTV camera footage. The nature of action will be based on the directions from the party leadership after receiving a report from AICC secretary Madhu Goud Yakshi, who was in Mysuru to gather opinion from party leaders. KPCC working president R. Dhruvanarayan said he had not heard from the party leadership after the AICC observer submitted his report on the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/action-likely-against-those-who-shouted-slogans-against-ex-cm/article34010133.ece

Minister of Animal Husbandry and district in charge Prabhu Chavan chaired the meeting. The Minister strictly warned the Education Department officials to provide basic needs to government-run schools. Drinking water, toilets, compound, and playground should be provided in each school. To ensure greenery, different types of trees should be planted on school premises, he said. “The district continues its poor performance in SSLC. Teachers are engaged in politics instead of teaching students. What actions or initiatives have you taken so far,” he asked Srishail Bhajantri, Deputy Director of Public Instructions. Sharanabasappa Gowda Darshanapur, MLA, said the district received only Rs. 1.33 cr in 2020-21 for improving basic infrastructure.

Manjunath Prasad, at an emergency meeting on Saturday, directed zonal officials to take proactive steps to prevent further spread of COVID-19, especially in outer areas of the city. Officials have been directed to study COVID-19 reports of the past two months to identify localities, areas and wards where more cases had been detected and look into the measures in place to curb the spread. More citizens should be identified for testing, said Mr. Prasad. The number of tests has dropped over the weeks with only around 38,000 conducted on Friday. Health officials have been directed to identify people with symptoms of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI), and ensure they get tested for COVID-19. The number of tests should increase in areas where more cases were being reported, the civic chief said. The Commissioner also stressed on the importance of tracing primary and secondary contacts. Health officials have been directed to seek assistance from personnel of revenue, engineering and other departments. In densely populated areas, the civic officials have been instructed to ensure that COVID-19 protocols are being followed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-to-increase-testing-contract-tracing/article34010465.ece

Similar videos of some Indian politicians have also been made. Innocent people who are unaware of such process tend to believe the videos and its contents to be true,” the court said that the Ministers were apprehensive that by using fake CDs their reputation could be harmed. ‘19 more CDs’ Referring to screenshots of headlines in news channels produced along with the suit, the court said that prima facie it appeared that the “media is sensationalising the news about 19 more CDs stating that they relate to 19 influential persons and they relate to sex scandal and even there are reference to some Ministers” apparently in the nature of sensationalism of the unverified material. On rights Observing that though the citizens had the right to know about their leaders and the media had the right to freedom of expression, the court said the plaintiff-Ministers had the right to be protected against their character assassination on the basis of unverified material. A similar order of temporary injunction restraining the media from carrying defamatory reports against Mr. Jarkiholi was passed by the 72nd Additional City Civil and Sessions Court on March 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/defamatory-news-on-six-ministers-courts-fiat-to-67-media-organisations/article34010256.ece

07 March 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Absence of Ministers Isaac and Sudhakaran in focus||The Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s decision to enforce the two-term norm in candidate selection is aimed at bringing fresh faces, but it is set to keep away Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac and Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran from the Assembly poll fray. The absence of Dr. Isaac and Mr. Sudhakaran, two senior leaders, will give a new dimension to the electoral battle in the district, especially in the fight for Alappuzha and Ambalappuzha constituencies. In 2016, Dr. Isaac had won from Alappuzha by a margin 31,032 votes and Mr. Sudhakaran was elected from Ambalappuzha by a margin of 22,621 votes. The CPI(M) considers both Alappuzha and Ambalappuzha as ‘safe’ seats, but without the sitting MLAs it will become ‘battleground’ constituencies. “Isaac and Sudhakaran have done tremendous development work in their respective constituencies. Both have a clean image and are extremely popular with the electorate. Without them contesting the polls, the electoral battle in these constituencies will be closer,” said a party source. After the CPI(M) decided not to field those who had contested consecutively and won twice, the party district secretariat last week sought relaxations in the norms to field Dr. Isaac and Mr. Sudhakaran. However, the party State secretariat, which met on Thursday, refused to budge. Further, the State committee on Friday reportedly decided to enforce the norms strictly and exclude two-time contestants. Dr. Isaac who contested the Assembly polls in 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 had won on each occasion. Mr. Sudhakaran was elected to the Assembly in 1996, 2006, 2011, and 2016. Although the party is yet to make a formal announcement, party workers seem to be disenchanted with the decision. On Saturday, posters supporting Mr. Sudhakaran and questioning the party decision appeared at Valiya Chudukad in Ambalappuzha. Reportedly, there were calls in the CPI(M) district secretariat and committee, which met here on Saturday to discuss probable candidates, to field the duo considering the winnability factor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/absence-of-ministers-isaac-and-sudhakaran-in-focus/article34010231.ece

07 March 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Summer triggers wildlife migration to Wayanad sanctuary||The seasonal migration of wild animals from the adjacent wildlife sanctuaries in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS) has started with the onset of summer. Elephants and gaur usually migrate to the sanctuary from the adjacent Bandipur and Nagarhole national parks in Karnataka and the Mudumalai national park in Tamil Nadu owing to the drought-like situation there. “The WWS is a haven for wild animals during the summer owing to easy availability of fodder and water throughout the year. The better summer rain in February was a boon to the wild guests as the majority of waterholes in the sanctuary have sufficient water,” says WWS warden S. Narendra Babu .  “We have made highly structured measures at an estimate of Rs. 1.3 crore to ensure fodder, water, and protection measures for animals,” he says. The sanctuary has at least one waterhole every two sq km and they are being monitored with GPS every week to ensure availability of drinking water. Now, steps are on to construct 35 brushwood check-dams to mark International Day of Forests on March 21. As part of fodder management, around 390 ha of coarse grasslands have been trimmed to grow soft grass. Sanctuary authorities are also planning to map vayals and waterbodies to ensure fodder supply during the dry season. Alert to forest fire Fire lines have been erected along 70 km on the State border and controlled burning has been done in 150 ha on forest fringes to prevent forest fire. Apart from 25 permanent anti-poaching camps and five watchtowers at strategic points, 27 new treetop machans (temporary watchtowers) have started functioning on the four forest ranges of the sanctuary. As many as 250 watchers have been deployed inside the sanctuary with essential equipment. A round-the-clock control room set up to issue alert in case of forest fires can be reached at 04936 223500 and 8547603486.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/summer-triggers-wildlife-migration-to-wayanad-sanctuary/article34010230.ece

07 March 2021||KASARAGOD,KERALA||Equations could see a change in Kasaragod||In Kasaragod district, the key question this Assembly election is whether there will be a distinct departure from the familiar terrain. In the past elections, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) had consistently won from the Thrikkarippur, Uduma, and Kanhangad seats while the United Democratic Front (UDF) dominated in Kasaragod and Manjeswaram. However, in 2016, Manjeswaram witnessed a close battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the UDF, with the latter scraping through by 89 votes. The BJP was not exactly a novice in Manjeswaram. The party began to make its presence felt in the constituency in 1987 when its candidate H. Shankara Alva finished runner-up to Indian Union Muslim League’s (IUML) Cherkalam Abdullah, who won by 6,746 votes. Since, then the party has made considerable inroads into the segment, as was evident in the nail-biting contest of 2016 between P.B. Abdul Razak of the IUML and K. Surendran, now BJP State president. This time, the BJP will be hoping to cash in on the investment scam charge against IUML’s sitting MLA M.C. Kamaruddin (who won in a bypoll following Mr. Razak’s death) and investigations into the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, in which the present LDF government is embroiled, to bolster its prospects in Manjeswaram. Left’s expectation The LDF, on its part, is confident of repeating its good performance in the local body elections. It won 376 of 877 wards across the three-tier panchayats and municipalities in the district — 25 more than its tally in 2015. The front has won all the elections in Uduma and Thrikkarippur since 1974 and in Kanhangad since 2011. The ruling front will be projecting the Rs. 2,289-crore development works executed in the five constituencies in past five years. The UDF hopes to pose a strong challenge to the LDF and the BJP by highlighting corruption charges and the ‘anti-people and anti-farmer policies’ of the State and Union governments. The front’s hope of retaining its strongholds of Kasaragod and Manjeswaram has been given a fillip by its victory in the Periye-Pullur panchayat in the local body election. Periye case The UDF believes that outrage among the local people at the murder of two Youth Congress workers at Periye in 2019 will work in its favour in Uduma. In 2016, the UDF candidate, K. Sudhakaran of the Congress, increased the front’s vote share in Uduma to 41.55% from 39% in the previous poll. The LDF vote share had dipped to 43.99% from 48%, kindling UDF’s hopes further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/equations-could-see-a-change-in-kasaragod/article34010211.ece
07 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||UDF bastion that went the LDF way last time||When the Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate K.J. Maxi won from the Kochi constituency in the last Assembly election, it was an aberration of sorts. For, the constituency in its earlier avatar as Mattancherry and then as Kochi from the 2011 Assembly election following the delimitation exercise, has always been a United Democratic Front (UDF) bastion. Before Mr. Maxi’s victory, the LDF was able to breach it only in 1996 when M.A. Thomas emerged victorious as an LDF-backed Independent. But even Mr. Maxi’s victory was by a slender margin of 1,086 votes despite the rumblings within the Congress against the candidature of Dominic Presentation. That the Congress rebel candidate M.J. Leenus and even NOTA (None Of The Above) polled 7,588 votes and 1,002 votes respectively put the result in perspective. 2019 Lok Sabha polls The general election held three years later in 2019 witnessed UDF dominance being restored when Congress candidate from the Ernakulam Parliamentary constituency, Hibi Eden, notched up an impressive lead of 29,313 against his LDF rival P. Rajeev in areas within the Kochi Assembly constituency. The local body polls held last year witnessed a swing of sorts towards the LDF, which won nine out of 20 Corporation divisions within the Kochi Assembly constituency, while the UDF was reduced to four with the BJP and Independents bagging two and four seats respectively. The LDF is also in power at Kumbalanghi and Chellanam panchayats, which also form part of the constituency. While the LDF has announced the candidature of the incumbent Mr. Maxi, former mayor Tony Chammany seems the frontrunner for UDF candidacy though Mr. Presenation’s name is also doing the rounds. Till before the delimitation, the constituency was held by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). But, in the first Assembly election in 2011 after the formation of the Kochi constituency, the IUML swapped the constituency with the Congress, and the incumbent MLA V.K. Ibrahim Kunju moved to Kalamasserry Assembly constituency. In the maiden election to the newly formed constituency, Mr. Presentation registered an impressive victory against LDF candidate M.C.

Since the formation of the Kochi constituency, both fronts have religiously fielded candidates from the Latin Catholic community, and that communal equation is unlikely to change this time too as both vie for the backing of the church. Other parties V4 People, the reloaded version of V4 Kochi that appeared on the political horizon during the last local body polls, has thrown its hat into the ring by fielding its topmost leader Nipun Cherian from the constituency. The party had failed to create much of an impact in 18 of the 20 divisions where it contested in the local body polls, emerging second and third in two divisions alone. Twenty20 is also planning to contest in the constituency, backed by an impressive show in Chellanam panchayat where it bagged eight wards. The BJP, though having won two Corporation divisions, remains a marginal player with its vote share remaining more or less static. The BJP vote share had dropped from 15,212 in the 2016 Assembly polls to 14,747 in the 2019 Lok Sabha election despite the presence of a formidable candidate like Alphons Kannanthanam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-bastion-that-went-the-ldf-way-last-time/article34010552.ece
07 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||SLMC slams govt., Corpn. for continuing Brahmapuram fiasco||The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has held the government and the Kochi Corporation responsible for the continuing sorry state of affairs at the Brahmapuram waste dumping yard. Committee Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, who had visited the site on March 3 along with officials of the State Pollution Control Board, will submit a report to the Southern Bench of the tribunal soon by including the incident of a massive fire breakout at the yard on Friday. “No meaningful action has been taken by either the government or the civic body. It is the constitutional obligation of the authorities to provide clean environment to the citizens,” Mr. Pillai told The Hindu on Saturday. The committee found that the Corporation authorities were dumping biodegradable waste generated under its jurisdiction and from other local bodies over the heaps of old waste lying at the site. The biodegradable waste was not segregated properly. Despite repeated directions by the committee, it was found that the civic body failed to carry out spot treatment of fresh waste, it said. The SLMC pointed out that the damaged windrow composting sheds at the site were the root cause for the malfunctioning of the solid waste management facility. During rains, water makes its way to the old waste owing to the poor condition of the composting sheds. It will eventually be directed to the nearby Kadambrayar, which has been identified as one of the critically-polluted river stretches in the country by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Stating that no actions were taken to install proper effluent treatment facilities at the site, the committee found that the temporary plant was non-functional. The Corporation had claimed that it had taken steps to ensure proper treatment of leachate flowing out from the windrow sheds by connecting it to the nearby septage treatment plant. The inspection held on March 3 revealed that the septage treatment facility was not functioning properly. The team found that untreated or partially treated sewage was discharged into a nearby marshy area located nearly 50-60 metres away from the septage plant. The plant was in idle mode, and the untreated sewage was discharged using a hose directed towards the marshy area located close to Chitrapuzha, another polluted river stretch identified by the CPCB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/slmc-slams-govt-corpn-for-continuing-brahmapuram-fiasco/article34010557.ece

The nine peedikas located near the Paliam gate of the Shiva temple were restored to their old-world charm as part of the Muziris Heritage Project. It is part of the restoration work of different structures that have historical importance and of those associated with the Paliath Achans, who were prime ministers to the Kochi kings. The shops have been restored using, among other items, wooden door panels, which are secured together using a lengthy iron rod. They were once commonly used as doors of shops until rolling steel doors became popular. The shops also have a veranda, where wares were once displayed. “Much care has been taken to ensure that the aesthetics of the old shops are retained,” said Krishnabalan Paliath, the manager of the Paliam Group Devaswom Trust. The shops were renovated at a cost of Rs. 54 lakh, as per the agreement between the Paliam family and the State government. 300 years They date back to roughly 300 years. The nine peedikas have been allocated to nine craftspersons who are skilled in traditional crafts such as pottery and handloom, apart from temple arts and the making of different artefacts. It will go a long way in preserving traditional crafts. The craftspersons would not have to pay rent, said Mr. Paliath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/giving-muziris-visitors-a-glimpse-of-the-past/article34010146.ece

Only a few scholars understand Old Dutch even in the Netherlands. The situation is grimmer in India, and the KCHR wants to build a team of scholars who will decipher the thousands of files generated during the days the Dutch ruled parts of India. In the archives These files, sources said, were of great significance in understanding the past because they were prepared with elaborate observation and contained a lot of details of the day. The old files are available in great numbers in the archives in India and the Netherlands. A history of the late medieval west coast of India will emerge with greater clarity and certainty from these historical documents. The KCHR has proposed a collaboration with the prestigious Leiden University in the Netherlands to provide opportunity to six students from India to do a master’s in colonial history. Six students from the Netherlands too will be part of the programme.  The course will cover, among others, epigraphy and palaeography, to enable the students unravel the mysteries of the past. Old Dutch too will be part of the curriculum. The programme is being envisaged for a period of seven years and Leiden University and the KCHR will share resources to support it. Most of the programme will be in conducted in Leiden University, and a part is being proposed to be held on the Pattanam KCHR campus near Kochi. The programme is awaiting clearance from the Union government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/old-dutch-is-in-demand-with-the-history-council/article34010241.ece

The Bench led by its Chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel had said that the “fact remains that the administration is patently a failure in protecting citizens’ right to clean environment, which is in no way less important than the right to live in a crime-free environment”. “There is no meaningful action for complying with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and handling of solid waste in spite of repeated directions in the last two years. As shown from the report of the State Pollution Control Board, the samples clearly show that the parameters of environment are not being met. The municipal corporation is still continuing unauthorised operations. Work is yet to start for biomining,” it said. The Bench recalled that environment compensation for failure to comply with its directives against those responsible for the situation has been assessed but not recovered. “Windrow composting plant is in a dilapidated condition. The affidavit of the Chief Secretary does not show that any effective action has been taken on the ground. Thus, the situation is far from satisfactory,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/failure-to-protect-citizens-rights-ngt/article34010555.ece
07 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Role of civil defence volunteers in focus||The firefighting at the dumping yard of the Kochi Corporation at Brahmapuram since Friday has driven home the significance of the Kerala State Civil Defence volunteers in assisting the Fire and Rescue Services Department in dealing with emergencies. As many as 53 civil defence volunteers drawn from the limits of 13 out of the 18 fire stations in the district actively assisted firefighters at Brahmapuram where a major blaze broke out at the dumping yard on Friday afternoon. Having turned up around 2 p.m., they were active till around 3 a.m. on Saturday. Ernakulam accounts for 3,036 civil defence volunteers spread over 18 fire stations, of whom 260 have undergone the fire station and district-level training, while 180 had completed the State-level training as well and were part of the passing-out parade held in the city on February 16. The volunteers are imparted three levels of training in six subjects related to disaster management, rescue, and administration of first aid. “The Fire and Rescue Services Department is engaged in a sanitisation process separating active members from the inactive while encouraging more volunteers to join the ranks. Each fire station is supposed to have a minimum of 50 civil defence volunteers, with another 50 in reserve,” said Binu Mitran, Ernakulam divisional warden, Civil Defence. A systematic communication process is in place to mobilise volunteers as soon as an emergency is reported. The alert is communicated to the post warden, deputy post warden, and five group captains under whom civil defence within each fire station limits is organised and they in turn mobilise the available volunteers mainly through social media and inform the Fire Force authorities. “Civil defence volunteers play a vital role in enhancing manpower available for fighting disasters and rescue missions, making it possible to rotate the force without exhaustion in trying conditions,” said K.K. Shiju, Regional Fire Officer. Around 150 civil defence volunteers, including 23 from the district, were active in rescue operations at Pettimudi near Munnar that was struck by a devastating landslide in 2019. Amal Paulose, a 26-year-old civil defence volunteer enlisted under the Piravom fire station, was at his home when the alert about the fire at Brahmapuram reached him on Friday afternoon. “Around 15 of us rushed to the fire station to go to the site in the station vehicle. However, by then the team had left, and then we reached Brahmapuram by our motorcycles,” he said. Having joined as a volunteer only last year, Mr. Paulose has already participated in multiple operations, including a major fire at a super market at Piravom soon after completing his training. Anyone aged between 18 and 60 years can join as a civil defence volunteer through an online link offered by the Fre and Rescue Services Department.

In 2006, the number of crorepati candidates was 20, while it went up to 69 in 2011. In the 2016 election, the corresponding figure rose to 198. As much as 6% of the crorepati winners cleared the electoral test in 2006, while it rose to 27% in 2011 and 59% in 2016. The data are based on an analysis of self-sworn affidavits by candidates submitted before the Election Commission of India. In 2011, the Congress topped the crorepati club with 14 candidates followed by the Muslim League (13), CPI(M) (19), and the BJP (9). The Kerala Congress (M) had six crorepati candidates, while the corresponding number of Independents was five. The number of candidates with total assets of over Rs. 2 crore in 2011 was 26. The Congress had 38 crorepati candidates in 2016. Independent candidates were in the second position in the overall tally, with 29 of them figuring on the list. The CPI(M) had 25 crorepati candidates, while the corresponding figure of BJP candidates was 17. The new entrant to the club in 2016 was the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), an ally of the NDA. G.

07 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Report on Elamkulam curve soon||The National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) will submit a rectification report on the Elamkulam curve on SA Road at the earliest to the Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA), District Road Safety Committee, Kochi Corporation, and Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL), so that they can implement measures at the earliest, according to Ebin Sam, scientist in charge of NATPAC’s Kozhikode regional centre. Friday’s visit to the locale and a visual observation show that inadequate banking curve and inconsistent carriageway (varying width of the road due to encroachments or other reasons) could have triggered accidents involving fast-moving vehicles. A detailed inquiry, based on data generated by equipment measuring the angle of the curve and the gradient, will shed more light on the cause of accidents. Both sides of the median at the curve are vulnerable to accidents, and it is vindicated by the crash data, he added. Inconsistent carriageway is a major cause for accidents in Ernakulam, said sources in the Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA) and the traffic police. The Ernakulam District Private Bus Operators Association had repeatedly flagged many such spots on arterial roads, which considerably taper down at junctions, as compared to their average width. “A short, severely-tapered down stretch on Banerjee Road, just before the left turn towards Paramara Road is a prominent bottleneck. This is being cited as a reason for the police diverting buses proceeding from Kacheripady to North overbridge through alternative roads. This causes wastage of fuel and time per trip, apart from accidents,” said K.B. Suneer of the body. The accidents could have been prevented had KMRL acquired a few cents more at the spot, when it widened Banerjee Road before the Kochi metro work began.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/report-on-elamkulam-curve-soon/article34010553.ece

District health authorities and panchayat officials are jointly executing measures to contain the infection. It is suspected that the children might have contracted the infection through contaminated water. Samples of water from the wells in the area have been collected for testing. Symptoms of the infection include diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, and stomach ache. It can spread through food prepared in unhygienic spaces and contaminated water. People have been advised to maintain hygiene, wash hands regularly, boil water thoroughly before drinking, avoid stale food, and chlorinate drinking water sources.

While figures were not yet available on the number of people who took the shot on Saturday, health officials estimate that around 10,000 people took it. On Friday, a total of 10,500 people took the vaccine. A total of 326 people, both senior citizens and officials likely to be on poll duty, took the first dose at a mass vaccination camp that was held at the YMCA Hall on Chittoor Road on Saturday. Only the Covishield vaccine is currently being administered in the district since Ernakulam has not received a fresh supply of Covaxin. For now, the district has two days’ worth of stock of the vaccine and additional supply is expected to arrive on March 9. While around 30 private hospitals are participating in the vaccination drive at present, another 60 hospitals are likely to open up their centres once more stock of the vaccine becomes available. No serious adverse events following vaccination were reported in the second phase of the drive, that began earlier this week for senior citizens and people over 45 with co-morbidities. As the demand for vaccination climbed, stock of the vaccine was low at private hospitals and most private hospitals might not be able to have sessions on Monday and Tuesday, said Dr. Junaid Rahman, medical director at Sree Sudheendra Medical Mission.

Cashing in on the COVID-19 situation, many drivers have reportedly been misusing the privilege to navigate heavy traffic. As per statistics, ambulances fall into the top four categories of vehicles that cause accidents. Cracking the whip "Kollam will be the first district in the State to implement regulatory measures and the enforcement team has started working on it. We decided to crack the whip after a recent accident in which two persons lost their lives due to negligent driving by an ambulance driver," says T C Vinesh, Joint Transport Commissioner (Enforcement). In the first phase of the programme, traffic enforcement officials will focus on data collection to gather a clear idea about ambulances operating in each area. "Earlier, emergency services were handled by experienced drivers, but now any license-holder can drive an ambulance. Since the job requires a certain level of social commitment and civic sense, we plan to conduct training sessions for drivers and issue them certification to operate," says A.K. Dilu, RTO (Enforcement), Kollam. Since launching the exercise, it was noted that many drivers indulge in rash driving, disregarding the norms, while some vehicles also lack proper documents. "In their attempt to save one life, they risk the safety and well being of several others and this cannot be encouraged. In some cases, the vehicles are not equipped to be driven at such high speeds,” says Mr. Dilu. After receiving reports about ambulance drivers turning on beacon lights and siren for non-emergency situations, Enforcement officials upped surveillance. Logbook mandatory "Ever since we started monitoring, the use of siren has come down considerably, especially on the Kollam bypass. There is no need to use siren and lights if you are transporting a dead body or dropping a COVID-19 patient at a first-line treatment centre," he says. Since it is difficult to trace violators on the job, the department plans to make logbook entries mandatory, while another proposal mooted is police clearance certificate from drivers. Drivers typically put forth the argument that they were rushing to attend emergencies and there is no system in place to confirm such claims. "Drivers of unoccupied ambulances often claim they are on the way to pick up a patient, but they can actually be running errands with the lights and siren on. We have instructed them to make detailed logbook entries after completing each trip. These will be cross-checked against hospital records. Action will be taken against discrepancies," adds Mr. Dilu.

In the 2016 Assembly election, the erstwhile Meppayur constituency took an unexpected ‘U-turn’ and supported the United Democratic Front (UDF) by ending its 25 years of loyalty to the Left Democratic Front (LDF). The key factor Seasoned politician K.K. Lathika’s failure in the contest against the UDF’s first timer and businessman Parakkal Abdulla was a hot topic of discussion for years. Though there were political justifications and claims over the thin victory margin of the UDF candidate, the obvious reason for the LDF’s failure was the growing discontent among farmers. Kuttiyadi continues to be an “agriculturally-sensitive” constituency, according to leaders of farmer organisations. Even a small fluctuation in the market price of coconut or its by-products affects farmers here. Though political parties have promised the setting up of a mega coconut park in the area, it appears to be a distant dream even now. However, the LDF camp exudes confidence. Discussions are in the final phase to select the candidate for the constituency. The LDF camp believes that farmer welfare measures initiated by the State government will help the front wrest the constituency back this time, which it lost by a margin of 1,157 votes to the UDF in 2016. The LDF had won the constituency in 2011 with a majority of 6,972 votes. UDF leaders claim that welfare projects implemented in the constituency in the past five years will help them retain it, this time with a better margin. Voter turnout in the last election was 1,57,810, which is expected to increase with the entry of new voters. Now, there are 1,96,176 voters in the constituency. Voters in eight local bodies within the constituency hold the key in determining the fate of candidates in the Assembly elections. Farmer-dominated Ayanchery, Kunnummal, Kuttiyadi, Purameri, Maniyur, Thiruvallur, Velom and Villiappally are With its increasing presence, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is posing a challenge to both the UDF and the LDF.

Muneer, MLA, has said. Addressing a protest demonstration organised by Thekkepuram Development Forum on south beach on Saturday demanding alternate arrangements for lorry parking in the city, he alleged that the arrogant attitude of some LDF leaders was behind the project being put off again and again. The unauthorised lorry parking on south beach has reportedly caused several accidents and loss of lives on the south beach stretch of Beach Road over the years. Besides, miscreants have been using the space as a cover for their activities. Waste management issues in the area are also attributed to unauthorised lorry parking. For over half a decade, residents of Thekkepuram have been demanding that the lorry stand be shifted to another location, and that the unauthorised parking be checked. The corporation had decided to shift the facility over a year ago, but it is yet to be implemented. Opening the protest earlier, actor Mamukkoya pointed out that lorry parking was a disturbance to those who came to the beach to spend evenings. Councillors from the Thekkepuram region K. Moideen Koya, P. Usha Devi, and S.K.Aboobakker led the protest. Councillors K.C. Shobhita, K. Nirmala, and Omana Madhu were present. Meanwhile, lorry drivers under the aegis of trade unions took out a protest march demanding that lorry parking be authorised on south beach, as it was most convenient for transportation of goods to and from Valiyangadi. They also sought better facilities at the existing lorry stand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/protest-gains-steam-against-illegal-lorry-parking-on-south-beach/article34010143.ece
07 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Will the CPI(M) continue its winning streak in Koyilandy?||The CPI(M) had a winning streak from the Koyilandy Assembly constituency in Kozhikode district since 2006. The election results on May 2 will tell if the party can repeat its feat this time as well or if the Congress can stage a comeback. P. Sathidevi, State secretary of the All India Democratic Women’s Association, and Kanathil Jameela, Kozhikode district panchayat president, are reportedly the front runners as candidates from the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Vidya Balakrishnan, Youth Congress leader, and U. Rajeevan, Kozhikode district Congress committee president, and K.M. Abhijith, Kerala Students Union president, are the probable candidates from the United Democratic Front (UDF). From the National Democratic Alliance, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha State president C.R. Praful Krishnan and BJP Mahila Morcha leader Ramya Murali are learnt to be among the contenders. The constituency has Koyilandy and Payyoli muncipalities and Chemanchery, Chengottukavu, Moodadi and Thikkodi grama panchayats within its limits. The UDF is in power only in Payyoli. The constituency is often found to have favoured the LDF in recent Assembly polls and reversed the choice in the Lok Sabha polls. History Neither the Congress nor the Communists could win the Koyilandy seat in the first four Assembly elections. Kunhiraman Nambiar of the Praja Socialist Party, K.B. Menon and P.K. Kidavu of the Samyukta Socialist Party were elected in the 1957, 1960, 1965, and 1967 polls. E. Narayanan captured the seat for the Congress for the first time in 1970. Manimangalath Kuttiali repeated the feat for the party in 1980 and 1982 elections and M.T. Padma in 1987 and 1991 polls. Though P. Viswan won the seat for the first time for the CPI(M) in 1996, he lost to P. Sankaran of the Congress five years later. However, Mr. Viswan staged a comeback in 2006. In the last two elections, K. Dasan has been winning the seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/will-the-cpim-continue-its-winning-streak-in-koyilandy/article34010153.ece
07 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||LDF likely to miss crowd-puller VS||Less than a year after the 1957 Assembly election victory in Kerala, the Communist Party of India (CPI) faced a crucial bypoll for the Devikulam seat. CPI’s then Alappuzha district secretary Velikkakathu Sankaran Achuthanandan, or VS, ensured the re-election of Rosamma Punnoose and, decades later, he went on to become a campaign mascot of sorts for the Left Democratic Front. But the 2021 election is likely to be the first Assembly poll without the presence of the veteran communist. Since 1991, Mr. Achuthanandan has been leading the LDF’s election campaign. He had been the party’s Chief Ministerial face as well for long. Thumping victory Emboldened by the thumping victory in the District Council polls, the LDF decided to dissolve the Assembly in 1991 ahead of its term and called for early elections. The untimely death of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and a subsequent sympathy wave helped the Congress-led United Democratic Front romp home that time. Five years later, though the LDF won the Assembly polls, Mr. Achuthanandan lost to P.J. Francis in his home turf Mararikulam. In 2001, he shifted to Malampuzha and won, but the front could not come to power. It took another five years for the veteran to get a chance to be the State’s Chief Minister. What changed in between was Mr. Achuthanandan’s image in the minds of the Malayali. From a hard-liner party boss with a Stalin-styled grip on the CPI(M) in the State, he had a makeover as a crusader against corruption, protector of ecology, guardian of women’s rights, and a champion of the oppressed sections of society. His popularity among the masses and its electoral impact was so much that Mr. Achuthanandan’s photo was a must in the LDF’s campaign material in the past three elections. This time, however, the pandemic situation and advancing age may force the 97-year-old leader to avoid public meetings. Mr. Achuthanandan has also not been active in public life for some time. Now, it remains to be seen if the LDF will make use of his charisma through online platforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-likely-to-miss-crowd-puller-vs/article34010212.ece
07 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Vallikkunnu, an IUML bastion by default||Though it has been barely a decade since the Vallikkunnu Assembly constituency came into existence, it has clearly expressed its political affiliations. The constituency had favoured Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in the last two Assembly polls. Part of the Malappuram Lok Sabha constituency, Vallikkunnu was formed as part of the delimitation in 2010 and consists of Chelembra, Pallikkal, Peruvallur, Thenhipalam, Vallikkunnu and Munniyur grama panchayats of Malappuram district, most of which was part of the Thirurangadi Assembly constituency and the rest part of the Kondotty Assembly constituency before the delimitation. Kondotty has always been a League bastion, so has been Thirurangadi. That makes Vallikkunnu another IUML bastion by default. In the recent local body polls, the United Democratic Front (UDF) had come to power in all but one grama panchayat in Vallikkunnu constituency. The CPI(M) wrested the Vallikkunnu panchayat from the IUML this time. Institutions The presence of high-profile institutions such as the Calicut International Airport, Calicut University, the LPG plant of Indian Oil Corporation at Chelari and the KINFRA industrial park makes the constituency special. The coastline, though small, is demanding development as well. With a voting population of around 1.93 lakh, Vallikkunnu had polled well in both the Assembly elections it faced, with a voting percentage of 72.5 and 74.9 in 2011 and 2016 respectively. In 2011, K.N.A. Khader of the IUML defeated K.V. Sankaranarayanan, an LDF-backed Independent, for around 20,000 votes while in 2016 P. Abdul Hameed defeated O.K. Thangal of the Indian National League for around 12,000 votes. BJP’s presence In both the polls, BJP candidates Preman and K. Janachandran came in the third position and the party saw a considerable increase in its vote share from 9.8% to 16.65%. Vallikkunnu is the only constituency in Malappuram district where the BJP could make some inroads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vallikkunnu-an-iuml-bastion-by-default/article34010154.ece
07 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Vigil stepped up against wildfire||The Forest Department, on the directive of the Disaster Management Authority (DMA), has intensified scientific measures to prevent wildfire in vulnerable areas in Kozhikode district. Apart from ensuring more fire lines, controlled burning will be considered as part of the hazard reduction strategy around the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary. In case of staff shortage, staff from the Fire and Rescue Services Department will be deputed to protect vulnerable areas. Fire extinguishers will be arranged in such a way that staffers can quickly reach out to distant places. According to Forest officials, some of the most vulnerable locations where wildfire caused huge damage had been identified for better vigil. Night patrol and regular patrol by watchers and Forest squad will be strengthened in those locations. Local administrators and officials of the Department of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have also been asked to cooperate with the intensive wildfire mitigation measures. A special control room number will be circulated soon across the district to improve surveillance by the public. Meanwhile, Forest officials said they would form range-level squads to monitor and control wildfire. The main responsibility of the squads will be to prevent illegal entry by visitors and camp fires. They will also ensure that visitors never carry inflammable materials. People involved in poaching cases will be monitored by a separate squad. Subsequent to the directives of the DMA, a few local bodies have begun forming their own voluntary forces to tackle fire outbreaks. Various emergency response teams and local voluntary organisation groups will be part of such local forces. The relocation of tribal families from vulnerable areas is also under the consideration of the SC/ST Welfare Department. Efforts are also on to ensure audit and safety of tribal hamlets in advance to meet challenges. Besides, temporary rehabilitation facilities will be arranged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vigil-against-wildfire-stepped-up/article34010144.ece
07 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||CPI(M) cadre march to Customs office||Protesting against the Customs report in the court pointing to direct involvement of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan, and three other Ministers in the dollar smuggling case, CPI(M) activists took out a march to the Kozhikode Customs office on Saturday. The protesters alleged that the report was part of a “mean political conspiracy” supported by the BJP. Opening the march, CPI(M) district secretary P. Mohanan said the Customs action would draw protests from across the State. He alleged that the probe mechanism was being misused by vested interests to disrupt the continuation of the LDF government. “No force can stop the LDF from its winning stride. It is better that those who make such attempts withdraw from the scene,” said Mr. Mohanan. It is strange that the Customs which was hardly involved in the investigation had submitted an affidavit in the court, he claimed. Following Customs officials’ request, the police had made elaborate security arrangements in Kozhikode. The march was peaceful.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-workers-march-on-customs-office/article34010150.ece

07 March 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||Research identifies plant’s anti-drug property||A group of researchers from Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala’s Centre for Medicinal Plants Research (CMPR) have come up with evidence to prove that a poisonous medicinal plant available in the State can be effectively used against several illnesses, including cancer, after purification. A study conducted by a team led by C.T. Sulaiman, senior scientist at CMPR’s phytochemistry division, found that the traditional purification process suggested by Ayurveda classics for Bhallataka or ‘marking nut’ could not only do away with its toxicity, but also drastically enhance its anti-cancer properties. “This finding can lead to new insights into cancer research,” said Dr. Sulaiman. Medicinal properties Locally known as cheru or varnish tree, Bhallataka is widely found across the country and its medicinal properties have been well established. The Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 has classified Bhallataka as a poisonous plant. Its fruit is used in Ayurveda to treat diseases such as nervous debility, rheumatism, epilepsy, sciatica and asthma. But if used raw, it can cause irritation, blisters, toxicity and contact dermatitis. The CMPR study has validated the purification process named Shodhana suggested by Ayurveda classics. Chemical comparison of raw and purified samples of Bhallataka showed that the traditional purification process imparted chemical transformations to toxic compounds and converted them to non-toxic forms. “Pharmacological and toxicological studies in experimental animals showed that purification reduced the toxic effects and enhanced its anti-cancer activity,” said Indira Balachandran, project director who supervised the research supported by the Navajbai Ratan Tata Trust, Mumbai. Dr. Indira said that the traditional system of purification could positively impact the chemical, pharmacological and toxicological profile of herbal drugs. Renowned publisher Elsevier has published the study in its international journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology released from the U.S. The other members of the research team are Deepak M., Lijini K.R. and Anandan E.M. from Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala and Praveen K.T. from JSS College of Pharmacy, Ooty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/research-identifies-plants-anti-drug-property/article34010243.ece

Gopinathan continued in earnest on Saturday with State working president K. Sudhakaran visiting him at his house at Peringottukurissi near Alathur. After a discussion that lasted more than an hour, Mr. Sudhakaran and Mr. Gopinathan appeared confident about a rapprochement. Mr. Sudhakaran said the Congress leadership would take positive steps to maintain the party’s unity and to address the concerns of its regional leaders ‘Solid base of followers’ The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leaders will contact Mr. Gopinathan over phone on Sunday, and the party will take a final decision in a day or two. “We will solve the issue without causing any damage to the party,” Mr. Sudhakaran said, adding that Mr. Gopinathan was a leader with a solid base of followers. Mr. Gopinathan said he would wait for three days for the KPCC decision. “We want the Congress to regain its past glory in Palakkad. I am not seeking anything for my personal gain. We want a leadership that listens to, understands, empathises with the party workers,” he told The Hindu . Senior Congress leaders such as V.S. Vijayaraghavan, V.C. Kabeer, K.A. Chandran and K. Achuthan shared Mr. Gopinathan’s views. Mr. Sudhakaran held discussions with Mr. Kabeer, Mr. Chandran and Mr. Achuthan. He also met District Congress Committee president V.K.

07 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Kovalam has no extreme loyalty||Having navigated between the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) for two decades, the Kovalam Assembly constituency has presented choppy waters for both coalitions during the upcoming polls. Swim against the tide The segment is also known to swim against the tide by defying popular waves that normally sweep across the rest of the State. A formation of predominantly coastal villages, the constituency witnessed stiff competition in the previous Assembly elections in 2016 when M. Vincent of the Congress defeated the then incumbent MLA Jameela Prakasam of the Janata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)] by a margin of 2,615 votes. Five years earlier, Ms. Prakasam had trounced the UDF’s sitting MLA George Mercier by 7,205 votes. Mr. Mercier had previously wrested the segment for the Congress from Ms. Prakasam’s husband and three-time MLA and former Minister A. Neelalohithadasan Nadar in 2006. Nadar community votes A politically unpredictable segment, Kovalam’s electoral outcomes are known to hinge on caste and communal undercurrents. Key to the outcome of the electoral battle here is the influential Nadar community. Known for its mercurial nature, the community had backed the LDF in Neyyattinkara and Kattakkada in 2016, even while contributing to Mr. Vincent’s victory in Kovalam. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has emerged as a decisive force in the region of late. While Venganoor Satheesh of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could only win 7.3% of the votes polled in 2011, Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) candidate Kovalam T.N. Suresh capitalised on the sizeable Ezhava presence in the constituency to win 30,987 votes, i.e. 20.13% of the total votes. The coalition also managed to win 31,990 votes from the region at the 2020 local body polls. Crucial issues A host of issues including the LDF government’s handling of the crisis triggered by Cyclone Ockhi and its now-cancelled agreement with a U.S. firm to build a deep-sea fishing fleet are bound to figure in the election campaigns. It also remains to be seen if the government’s decision to extend the Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation to the Nadar Christian community will have any impact at the hustings. The delay in realising the Vizhinjam seaport project could also crop up. The constituency comprises Balaramapuram, Kalliyoor and Venganoor panchayats in Thiruvananthapuram taluk, and Balaramapuram, Kanjiramkulam, Karumkulam, Kottukal, Poovar and Vizhinjam panchayats in Neyyattinkara taluk. It has 2,15,002 registered voters, including 1,05,175 males,1,09,825 females and two transgenders, according to the voters’ list published by the Election Commission on January 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kovalam-has-no-extreme-loyalty/article34010620.ece
07 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Candidate selection in turmoil||The candidate selection process of the CPI(M) and the Congress appeared to have hit rough weather again on Saturday. The CPI(M) faced a massive social media campaign against the "denial" of the ticket to Kannur veteran P. Jayarajan. Mr. Jayarajan quickly distanced himself from the social media collective titled "PJ Army". He said such propaganda would work to the advantage of CPI(M) detractors. Meanwhile, the CPI(M) has cracked the whip on party indiscipline in Kannur. It temporarily removed Dheeraj Kumar from party membership for commenting about the party's candidate selection process. In Alappuzha, posters appeared demanding the Ambalappuzha seat for Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran. He is among the five Ministers taken off the party ticket on the ground they had contested the elections on two consecutive occasions. CPI(M) district secretary R. Nazar said the party had nothing to do with the posters. The LDF also faced a dissent measure in Ranni against the reported move to cede the sitting seat to the Kerala Congress (M). In Ponnani, similar posters appeared demanding the party ticket for Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan. A party insider said the bills seemed to be the handiwork of those seeking to sow confusion in the CPI(M) ranks. The Congress also faced its set of candidate selection related troubles. Scores of party workers expressed solidarity with former District Congress Committee president of Palakkad A.V. Gopinath, who raised a rebellion in the locality in protest against his sidelining by the Congress leadership. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee working president K. Sudhakaran rushed to Palakkad to negotiate with Mr. Gopinath. The CPI(M) floated the idea of fielding Mr. Gopinath as a Left Democratic Front Independent from Pattambi against Youth Congress president and incumbent legislator Shafi Parambil. Youth Congress workers protested the move to cede the Ettumanur seat to the P.J. Joseph faction of the Kerala Congress (M). The KPCC was yet to settle the discord over the move to hand over the Chadayamangalam constituency to the Indian Union Muslim League. Meanwhile, the Congress announced that it would contest in 92 seats. Screening committee member H.K. Patil said the party would accord 60% of the seats to the youth.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/candidate-selection-in-turmoil/article34010227.ece
07 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Ready to meet summer power demand: KSEB||Although daily power consumption in the State has touched 80 million units (mu) during March, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is well prepared to meet the summer demand, KSEB officials say. The storage in State’s hydel dams stands at 62%, which is adequate to generate 2,564.3 mu. This is also the highest in recent years. The power utility has tied up power to meet the summer demand and is filling up small gaps in the requirement via purchases on the Power Exchange, KSEB officials say. Poll factor Further, the State-run power utility has also begun sourcing power from NTPC’s Rajiv Gandhi Combined Cycle Power Project (RGCCP), Kayamkulam, under an agreement to purchase power from the RGCCP till March end or until the naphtha stocks there are exhausted. Apart from rising temperature, the upcoming Assembly polls will cause a spike in daily power consumption. On March 5, it stood at 80.2 mu. On the same day last year, consumption stood at 78.94 mu, show state load despatch centre data. The record for the highest single-day consumption in the State is 88.34 mu, recorded on May 23, 2019. Nonetheless, barring unexpected developments, the chances of a power crisis are quite remote this summer, KSEB officials say. Import capacity up The present power consumption pattern is not unexpected, says KSEB chairman and managing director N. S. Pillai. “The daily consumption is now averaging 80 mu, which we were expecting. If there are no summer showers and the heat increases, consumption could cross 85 mu or even touch 90 mu. Even then, we are prepared to meet the demand,” he says. Moreover, with the commissioning of the 2000-MW Pugalur-Madakkathara (Thrissur) line, the State’s capability of importing power has gone up considerably. In its seasonal outlook for March-May published on March 1, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had noted that below-normal seasonal maximum temperatures are likely over most of southern India.  The storage in State’s hydel dams stands at 62%, which is adequate to generate 2,564.3 mu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ready-to-meet-summer-power-demand-kseb/article34010240.ece

Close to 90,000 fresh applications were received across local bodies in the State during this short period of time. The government had issued a call for fresh applications in August last year, when as many as 8.32 lakh applications were received. The list of applicants from each area has been published in the respective local body office. Officials pointed out that the verification process was bound to take time owing to the large number of applications. The number of beneficiaries is expected to come down after the verifications. Poll duty "It will take longer as some of the verification officers will be deployed for election duty. However, the rest of the officers will continue with the work. Since the applications are done online, we have to check the documents as well as make sure that they do not own houses presently. At least a few such applications turn up," said a LIFE mission official. The direct application method for the LIFE project began for the first time in August last year. In the previous phases, the beneficiaries were chosen based on a survey conducted by the Kudumbashree misssion. Hits a milestone The project had in January hit a milestone of 2.5 lakh houses completed in phases. The work on 36 flat complexes is progressing in various parts of the State, out of which 10 are nearing completion. The initial plan for the third phase was to accommodate landless families in flats. However, many beneficiaries are now coming forward with interest to purchase land and construct houses. More economical For the government too, this is perhaps more economical as the cost of individual unit in a flat complex is around Rs. 13 lakh to Rs. 14 lakh, while individual houses can be built at Rs. 4 lakh. Finding land for flat complexes has also been a struggle in cities such as Thiruvananthapuram.  The government had issued a call for fresh applications in August last year, when as many as 8.32 lakh applications were received.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/life-mission-applicants-swell-to-92-lakh/article34010239.ece
07 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||An act of care and compassion for canines||It was a month ago that Jerry Das, city mission manager of the Kudumbashree National Urban Livelihoods Mission project, who was returning to the city from Vithura after midnight spotted a dog lying on the Peroorkada-Vazhayila road, near St. Jude’s Church. The dog, brown in colour, had been hit by a vehicle. It had a blue collar around the neck and looked clean, and most likely someone’s pet.  Pathetic condition Since it could not move, the likelihood of it being run over by vehicles and getting killed was too great. However, it was not allowing Mr. Das to come near; it would raise its head to earn him off. Mr. Das then waited at the spot for an hour for a member of a consortium of the eight Kudumbashree Animal Birth Control (ABC) microenterprise units in the district to arrive and transport the dog to Government Veterinary Hospital, Pettah. The dog was lucky that the consortium members, who provide food and take care of the dogs brought to the hospital for sterilisation as part of the ABC programme, are around at night, and could take it to the hospital in their vehicle. The animal that had broken its front paw near the shoulder was treated by the ABC programme’s empanelled doctors. Since its treatment, it is being taken care of by the consortium members. Its injury has now healed, it can walk, and has been eating food properly, says Mr. Das. The Kudumbashree ABC microenterprise units are responsible for capturing dogs to support the ABC programme of local bodies, transporting the animals to veterinary hospitals in the district for sterilisation, providing pre-and-post operative care, and then safely releasing the animals. Highly criticised The ABC programme had drawn a lot of flak initially, but the Kudumbashree ABC units are setting an example of love for animals by taking care of the dog for the past month, Kudumbashree district mission coordinator K.R. Shaiju says in a statement. The dog is now kept at the hospital and is awaiting its owner. For details, contact the ABC unit consortium on 9562387855.

Ms. Khosa had helped a couple from Thiruvananthapuram adopt the baby, a boy, from another State during the lockdown last year. The couple had decided to adopt the child when the lockdown came into effect. The legal hurdles they faced just multiplied. They feared that unable to travel to the other State, years of waiting for a child would go in vain. The couple then met the Collector and sought her help. Moved by the plight of the couple, Ms. Khosa contacted the District Collector of the place from where the boy was being adopted and expedited steps for the couple to secure travel pass for their journey. Not only that, she intervened wherever required till the couple reached their destination, completed the formalities, and returned with the boy. Ms. Khosa said she only did what was required as part of her official responsibilities, and she never expected it would bring so much joy into the lives of the couple. Though the couple had decided on a name for the child when they set off for the adoption, by the time they crossed various State borders mentioning Ms. Khosa’s name to the authorities there and finally reached their destination, their fondness for the Collector’s name increased. They then decided to name their boy after the Collector who had helped them make him a part of their family, the couple said.

As part of a mandatory annual audit, DoT Kerala had, till January 31, tested 46,151 out of 88,366 base transceiver stations (BTS) and found that all of them were within the permitted radiation levels, P.T. Mathew, Senior Deputy Director General, DoT, Kerala, said. Studies by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other scientific bodies also had not indicated harmful effects of mobile tower radiations. Nonetheless, the Government of India had adopted stringent norms by allowing just one-tenth of tower radiation as compared to international standards, Mr. Mathew said. Compliance with norms India adopted 0.45 W/m2 compared to 4.5 W/m2 as stipulated by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). These norms were arrived at on the basis of extensive studies by experts from IIT, AIIMS, ICMR and DoT. Impact of 5G With the roll-out of 5G, the number of towers in the State would rise from the existing 18,700 to 34,000 over the next two years. Even this increase in the number of towers would have no ill effects on health as far as radiation was concerned, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fears-about-mobile-tower-radiation-misplaced-dot/article34010219.ece

He says the apprehensions raised by some whether the vaccine against COVID-19 can lead to COVID infection are baseless. The vaccine does not totally protect one against contracting COVID infection but affords a protection of nearly 70% after the two-dose schedule of vaccination is completed. The immunity kicks in only 14 days after the second dose is administered. It will be unwise to ignore all COVID protocols just because one has taken the vaccine shots as one can still get the infection after vaccination. Mr. Vijayan says a good number of people have reported side effects such as fever and fatigue post vaccination but these usually get resolved within two days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pinarayi-seeks-to-allay-fears/article34010233.ece

Ajayakumar says food fortification has been gaining prominence. He was addressing the media during a briefing organised by Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), supported by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), in collaboration with Food Safety Commissionerate, Kerala, to spread awareness on the benefits of food fortification and the urgent need for its widespread adoption. Schemes Mr. Ajayakumar pointed out that the government and food manufacturers had implemented different schemes and projects to drive the addition of micro-nutrients into food. As a public health policy, this would go a long way to help to reduce dietary deficiencies in India, he said. In food fortification, micro-nutrients, i.e., vitamins and minerals such as Folic acid, Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D, were added to staple foods like rice, wheat flour, milk and edible oils. Poor learning abilities Deficiency of micronutrients would result in poor cognitive and learning abilities in children, lower productivity, increased morbidity and mortality and lower immune responses. India was home to an estimated third of the world’s micronutrient deficient individuals, he said. Around 70% of the Indian population received less than half of the recommended daily nutritional intake, Mr. Ajayakumar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/food-fortification-need-of-hour/article34010206.ece

Anantapur is the first district in the State to issue identity cards to the community, which specifies their gender, and provide them help under the provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. The authorities have promised to provide them with house sites and take the responsibility for building houses under the government scheme. Holding a meeting with the persons from the community, Mr. Chandrudu said the banks would be asked to provide loans based on the eligibility and skill of the persons from this group. “We all eke out a living by seeking alms on the streets as we do not get opportunities to mingle with the rest of the society despite being educated,” said Mounika, one of the transgenders, who had come to the Revenue Bhavan on Saturday. The majority of them said an awareness programme needs to be launched in the district so that people do not discriminate against them. The Collector said there was a need to educate people about the community so that they understand that being a transgender is not a crime, and iterated that the group needs handholding to bring them into the mainstream of society. A skill development programme would also be launched depending on the necessity of the specific group of people in an area. The Collector wanted them to start a Self-Help Group so that bank loans and other benefits could be given collectively. He handed over the ID cards to all those present at the Collectorate and asked others also to apply immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anantapur-issues-id-cards-to-transgenders/article34010548.ece

Addressing a municipal election campaign meeting here, he asked the YSR Congress Party to be cautious of the BJP, which, he alleged, was trying to bring in a religious and communal cyclone into the State for entering State politics. “The BJP had closed down the Nizamuddin Markaz, which it must open immediately, as it has been proved several times over that COVID-19 had nothing to do with religion and the government lost lawsuits in the court,” Mr. Owaisi said. The BJP is trying to cover up its inefficiency in handling the COVID-19 situation by blaming the Tablighi Jamaat, he pointed out. He alleged that Telugu Desam Party candidates were silenced by the YSRCP by luring them with money or contracts, but the AIMIM would not bow out and fight it out in the eight wards in Hindupur, seven in Kurnool, and six in Nandyal. VSP privatisation He supported the “Visakha ukku, andhrula hakku” slogan and criticised the BJP government at the Centre for trying to privatise the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. Mr. Owaisi advised the Jagan Mohan Reddy government not to keep silent just by sending a letter to the Centre on the privatisation of the VSP, but come on to the streets and oppose the move.

As the BJP-led alliance is gearing up to stake claim to the ensuing by-election to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat, winning many divisions in the civic body is quite pertinent ahead of making a mark in the larger political canvas. Though the alliance has fielded candidates only in nine of the fifty divisions, the contest is quite close with the ruling party. The cadre is already campaigning across the nine wards to ensure the victory of their candidates. The major advantage that the alliance claims to be in its favour is that all the candidates are either local to the ward or native residents of the old town.  Coercion alleged JSP leader and PAC member Pasupuleti Hariprasad on Saturday campaigned for BJP candidate Anusha Ramakrishna, who is contesting on behalf of the alliance in the 32nd division covering Sri Kodandarama temple area. The alliance is also facing the heat from the ruling party in the form of coercion at the nomination stage and intimidation at the withdrawal stage. “Even in my own 42nd division, our candidate’s nomination was declared withdrawn, though he was very much in the fray. We had to stage dharna in front of the police station and explain our case to the Returning Officer to get his nomination cleared,” said the party’s State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-jsp-striving-to-leave-lasting-impact-on-polls/article34010583.ece

07 March 2021||Tirupati,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD’s Chilkur Veda Pathasala project makes no headway||More than a decade has elapsed since the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) took the first step for the establishment of a Veda Pathasala at Chilkur village, near Hyderabad, and yet there is not much headway on the project. Chilkur had been chosen in view of its close proximity to the famed Balaji temple, where an allied ecosystem could be developed. The first proceedings for handing over advance possession of land for the project had been issued in June 2010. For road access, it had been decided to acquire the adjoining land and compensate the neighbour with a similar extent of land elsewhere. After more than five years, the proposal for alienation of 8.27 acres in Moinabad mandal of Ranga Reddy district had been sent to the CCLA in November 2015. The proposal has been gathering dust there since then. Blame it on bifurcation of the State, or the TTD’s indifference in following it up, the proposal has not made much headway. The Veda Pathasala had started functioning temporarily from the first floor of a building constructed by the Rotary Club of Bhagyanagar, where an anganwadi exists. Dwindling strength The limited space was hardly sufficient either to take up new admissions, or introduce new courses. Objections had also been raised over the venue, as it shared the premises where eggs were cooked and distributed under mid-day meal scheme. The student strength had started shrinking to reach the single digit, and doubts were raised over its very existence when it was closed during the COVID-19 lockdown. The TTD had written to the Telangana government in January 2019 that it would be forced to merge the Chilkur school with the existing Veda Pathasala at Keesaragutta, 60 km away, if it did not get the land alienated soon. The Balaji temple authorities, despite having no locus standi in the process, had offered shelter to the students till a permanent structure was made available, but there was evidently no response. “We have offered to provide space for classrooms and living space inside our temple to run the show, but there are no takers,” temple trustee and hereditary priest S. Rangarajan told The Hindu . Apart from the one in Chilkur, the TTD runs a Veda Pathasala in Nalgonda in Telangana and Dharmagiri (Tirumala), I. Bhimavaram, Kotappakonda and Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh, all of them taking shape with local support and political will. Taking cognisance of the issue, Chevella MP G. Ranjit Reddy recently promised to take it up with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttds-chilkur-veda-pathasala-project-makes-no-headway/article34010586.ece

The new system will be implemented in the current academic year and to expedite the process, latest technologies, including facial recognition, keeping the COVID-19 crisis in mind, are being explored. The Andhra Pradesh Centre for Financial Systems and Services (APCFSS) has been tasked with identifying an effective solution with focus on quality, accuracy, security, responsiveness, scalability, cost effectiveness and other relevant critical performance metrics in view. Panel formed A technical committee has also been formed to assist the APCFSS in identifying a suitable solution and ensure its smooth and effective implementation.

07 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘State claiming entire credit for projects funded by Centre’||Andhra Pradesh had been sanctioned more than Rs. 10,000 crore under various schemes for urban development, Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said on Saturday. The Union Minister was addressing the media at the BJP office here virtually from New Delhi ahead of the municipal elections in the State. Smart Cities More than Rs. 1,000 crore had been sanctioned under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Rs. 1,664 crore for development Kakinada, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Amaravati as Smart Cities, and Rs. 9,311 crore for housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), the Union Minister said. All these amounts had been sanctioned in the last six years, he added. Under Swachh Bharat alone, Rs. 571 crore had been sanctioned, and Rs. 567 crore of it had been released, he said. “Due to the intervention of the Union government, 110 urban local bodies in the State have been declared 100% open defecation-free,” Mr. Puri said. Expressing unhappiness over the YSRCP government trying to claim credit for the projects funded by the Central government, Mr. Puri said, “We have sanctioned 20 lakh houses under the PMAY, which is about 20% of the total houses sanctioned across the country. The Union government is also providing a subsidy of Rs. 1.5 lakh per house. It is painful to learn that the State government is taking the entire credit and misguiding the people,” Mr. Puri said. BJP Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, who moderated the virtual media conference, alleged that that funds provided by the Union government were not being utilised properly, and the results were not on expected lines as a consequence. Third party evaluation sought He urged the Union Minister to get the works being done by the State and the civic bodies evaluated by a third party. The Union Minister further said that Andhra Pradesh was yet to submit utilisation certificate for certain works undertaken. About Rs. 2,631 crore was not yet utilised under the PMAY, he added. “From 2004 to 2014, the Congress government had spent Rs. 1.57 lakh crore for urban intervention programmes. From 2014 to 2020, the BJP government had spent about Rs. 11 lakh crore. This indicates the focus of the government,” Mr. Puri observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/state-claiming-entire-credit-for-projects-funded-by-centre-union-minister/article34009979.ece
07 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP win will spell doom for city: Naidu||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president N. Chandrababu Naidu said that if the YSR Congress Party wins the GVMC elections, it will spell doom for the city. Speaking at various roadshows here as part of the TDP’s campaign, he urged people to see that YSRCP candidates are not elected. “Once they are elected this peaceful city would lose its peace,” he said. He said that if YSRCP is elected, the taxes of the GVMC will be increased exorbitantly, as the government intends to cover its deficit through the hike in taxes. “The government has already gone into a debt trap due to the vote bank schemes and now it will try to cover it up by increasing the taxes,” he said. Mr. Naidu said that TDP will fight till the end to see that the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) is not privatised. Appreciating former TDP MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao for taking up fast to protest against the privatisation of the plant, he said, “That is how a true leader reacts to an issue. But on the other hand, YSRCP is playing a game with the minds of the people,” he said. He alleged that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his aide and MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy would not hesitate from even selling the entire city. The former CM also alleged that YSRCP leaders were harassing the TDP candidates. Taking a sarcastic dig at Mr. Jagan’s liquor policy, Mr. Naidu said, “He had come to power by saying that liquor would be prohibited. But after coming to power, he has not implemented prohibition, but on the other hand he is selling his own brands of cheap liquor at higher prices. Nowhere in the country one would find the brands that are now being sold in A.P.” Mr. Naidu also said that the YSRCP failed to get things moving on the Visakhapatnam-based South Coast Railway Zone and also on the metro rail. He accused the State government of failing to get the campus started for Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy and the ESI hospital. Mr. Naidu faulted Mr. Jagan’s sand policy and said that due to the bad policy, both builders and construction workers were suffering a lot. “When the TDP was in power, we abolished the Agnampudi toll gate, but after the YSRCP had come to power, they have restarted it, putting burden on the commuters on that road,” he alleged Taking a dig at a local pontiff, he said, “The so-called godman did not utter a word when Lord Rama’s idol was desecrated at Ramatheertham, but he never forgets to pay his respects to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy.” Mr. Naidu also pointed out that the people of Vizag were never against Amaravati being the capital and they welcomed it, but Mr. Jagan is now pitching the people of two regions against each other through faulty narratives. “We in the Telugu Desam Party believe only in development and not undoing things,” Mr. Naidu said.  Anna canteens He also assured that if voted to power in the GVMC and other urban local bodies, TDP would revive the ‘Anna canteen’ programme. Mr. Naidu addressed over 15 roadshows in the last two days, including about eight, on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-win-will-spell-doom-for-city-naidu/article34010640.ece
07 March 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu, Lokesh have no right to seek votes in Vizag, says MLA||Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath from the YSR Congress Party said that Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu and party national general secretary Nara Lokesh have no right to seek votes in Visakhapatnam. He also questioned how Mr. Naidu and other members of the TDP, who were opposed to the idea of making the city, the Executive capital, stalled the distribution of houses to the poor, created hurdles for building guest house and even attempted to damage the brand image of the city, were seeking votes in the GVMC elections. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, Mr. Amarnath said that after facing a major defeat in Naidu’s own constituency Kuppam in the panchayat elections, Mr. Naidu and Mr. Lokesh have come to the city to campaign in the GVMC elections, with false narratives and fake promises. He alleged that TDP has no interest in developing Visakhapatnam or North Andhra region, but in turn looted the place for personal and political gains. Mr. Amarnath said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had written to the Prime Minister suggesting three alternatives to continue the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) as a public sector undertaking. The State will also move a resolution in the Assembly seeking the Centre to review its decision on privatisation. But, the TDP has no guts to raise its voice against the Centre, BJP or its ally Jana Sena Party, he said. The MLA also said that former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had prevented the privatisation of many such units in Visakhapatnam, but Mr. Naidu failed to take up the responsibility of protecting the VSP. He said that Mr. Jagan had implemented every promise he made in the manifesto in these 20 months and the Opposition leaders were trying to stall development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-lokesh-have-no-right-to-seek-votes-in-vizag-says-mla/article34010611.ece

07 March 2021||ERRAVALLI (SIDDIPET DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Agitation spots now deserted||It was a ‘chapta’ under the neem tree in the centre of the village. On May 14, 2016, this was the epicentre for agitation demanding implementation of Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act – 2013 (LA Act – 2013). On that day, several CPI (M) leaders led by party senior and All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) vice-president Sarampally Malla Reddy visited the village and interacted with the oustees. He had informed them how the LA Act – 2013 benefit them more than what the payment made under GO 123, the then process of land purchase from farmers. Diagonally opposite to that is an old structure, Buruju, a witness to the ongoing transformation of the village. A few kilometres away is Etigaddakishtapur in Toguta mandal, where on the same day, as many as 13 women fell unconscious due to high blood pressure when their land were acquired by the government for the proposed Mallannasagar project, which would spread across both Kondapaka and Toguta mandals. These two platforms located in these two villages had witnessed several agitations, relay hunger strikes for several days and heated speeches by leaders from various political parties. At Etigaddakishtapur, the agitation continued for more than two months and leaders like Revanth Reddy and Damodar Rajanarasimha visited the village. Now, these two platforms wear a deserted look. At Erravalli, majority of the oustees had already left the village with only 20 to 30 people residing now, still awaiting compensation. At Etigaddakishtapur, the elderly and the unemployed youth are discussing about their uncertain future. “This village will get submerged under Mallannasagar and everyone knows that. Despite that, the platform here was constructed for reasons best known to them,” commented a villager on condition of anonymity, adding that fund misuse might have taken place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/agitation-spots-now-deserted/article34010539.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao will get their due in the course of the time and the party's silence cannot be construed as weakness. Rifle hanging by the wall is silent but it doesn’t mean it can't shoot, KTR said apparently aiming at BJP State president Bandi Sanjay who has been on a criticism-spree of KCR. He was speaking at the meeting of Telangana Rashtra Samithi Vidyarthi (TRSV), the student wing of the TRS, held in connection with the Graduate MLC elections. Continuing his attack on the BJP, he said BJP relies on the 'WhatsApp University' to spread fake narratives while the TRS was committed to the betterment of the students in the State universities. He said BJP is good at "Baath Karodon mein Kaam Pakodon mein" referring to Prime Minister Narender Modi's controversial statement on selling pakoras was also a job. "We have to win the two MLCs winning the confidence of the graduates explaining the good work of the government," he said and asked the students and youngsters to explain the government jobs given and the environment created for employment in the private sector. KCR should be credited with these achievements and also the radical measures taken to provide quality education through the residential schools. On the other hand the Central government has denied educational and employment opportunities for Telangana. New IIMs, IISERs, IIITs, Medical colleges and NAvodaya Vidyalayas were announced for other states but not for Telangana, he said. KTR alleged that BJP doesn't seem to consider Telangana as part of India and they are just good at raking up emotive issues like Pakistan and religion to stoke the emotions for political benefit. The best way to teach them a lesson is by defeating their candidates in the MLC elections. He asked the student wing leaders to repel the false propaganda of the BJP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-baiters-will-get-their-due/article34010528.ece

The company also publicised the arrested Abhilash’s photographs with Kerala’s Finance Minister Thomas Isaac and billionaire businessman Mukesh Ambani and other celebrities in the country to lure gullible people to invest in their MLM business. The Economic Offences Wing of the Cyberabad Commissionerate on Saturday arrested Abhilash and 23 others closely associated with the business for duping people, while organising a business meet at a star hotel in the IT corridor. Abhilash lived a lavish life and owned a villa in Bengaluru. He had several luxury cars. Before floating this business in 2014, he was associated with Michigan based multi-level marketing company Amway. Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said that Abhilash’s photos with Mr. Siddaramaiah, Mr. Issac and others were published in the company’s booklets and pamphlet to promote their ‘illegal’ business and attract more and more investors. “They have used his photos with well-known people in the country as a bait. He must have taken photos with them on various occasions, but that doesn’t mean they are known to each other,” the officer said. The company claimed that they also operate in USA, Rwanda and Bangladesh. He said that the firm mostly targeted women, especially homemakers and unemployed youth. According to a senior police officer associated with the investigation of the case, the firm organised summits at stars hotels across the country, and also provided training sessions on how to join more members in their scheme. A man who referred more than 10,000 people will get a Mercedes Benz car, a week-long family trip to the US and a video documentary on their successful journey. “While organising the summit, they used to park expensive cars in the lobby to create hype about their business, and give fake speeches to lure and ‘boost the morale’ of the members or new joiners,” the officer said, adding that company also held virtual meetings. According to their binary business plan, at 11 level ,136 crore Indians will become part of their business, while at 12th and 13th stages, the entire population in Asia and world will become their members, respectively, police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ceos-photos-with-ambani-siddaramaiah-used-as-bait/article34010523.ece
07 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Building permissions set to get simpler from April||Obtaining building permissions may become simpler for several applicants starting from April, when the TS-bPASS (Telangana State Building Permission Approval & Self Certification System) is most likely to completely replace the existing system in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). While permissions are already being issued under TS-bPASS for certain structures, the system is still in transitioning stage, say officials. Users had been facing several issues under the existing Development Permission Management System (DPMS) as they are forced to make rounds of different offices, where clearances are struck. Self-certification TS-bPASS will facilitate self-certification by the applicants for structures built on 500 square meters (600 square yards) or less, without having to submit building plan. This limit will cover all independent houses. “We will merely mention the required setbacks in the permission proceedings, which the applicant has to adhere to. Deviations, if any, will be dealt with through separate mechanism,” informed a senior official from the Town Planning wing of the municipal corporation If the structure is proposed in prohibited or disputed land, or is marked for road development as per Master Plan, the application will be automatically rejected, as the system is linked with the government database of land titles. Users will be sensitised about the extents demarcated for Master Plan roads, and how much clearance to be left to proceed with the structure, officials said. As of now, permissions are being issued by GHMC through both DPMS and TS-bPASS, with applications for structures within plots more than 500 square meters in extent being processed solely through DPMS. It is aimed to transition completely to TS-bPASS by March 31, after which building permissions on plots over 500 square meters too will be issued only through the new system. Users will have the facility to run their building plan automatically through the system without human intervention. So far, over 720 applications have been processed and approved through TS-bPASS, and close to 150 have been rejected, owing to issues pertaining to land. Enforcement teams as per the TS-bPASS guidelines to keep a check on deviations are yet to be formed. Separate orders need to be issued by the government for the same, officials say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/building-permissions-set-to-get-simpler-from-april/article34010545.ece
07 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC summons two top officials to appear personally||Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao of Telangana High Court had directed two top bureaucrats to appear before the HC personally on March 26 in a contempt of court matter. The officials, Vikas Raj, Principal Secretary of Panchayat Raj and Rural Development and K. Ramakrishna Rao, Principal Secretary of Finance and Planning were directed to appear before the court at 10.30 a.m. on March 26. They were asked to explain as to why action should not be initiated against them for contempt of the orders of the HC. The contempt case was filed by 46 persons alleging that the two officers disobeyed the HC orders issued on March 15 of 2018 in an interim application of a writ petition. In the writ petition filed in 2018, the petitioners (who are part-time sweepers in zilla parishad schools of Karimnagar and other districts) questioned the government’s action of not paying full-time salaries to them. The petitioners claimed that the government did not regularise them even after some of them had put in 40 years of service. After hearing the contentions of the petitioners, Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao directed the officials to pay salaries to the petitioners on the basis of ‘equal pay’ for ‘equal work’. The pay should be minimum of the pay scale of the regularly engaged government employees holding similar posts. The judge stated that the direction was based on the law declared by the Supreme Court in State of Punjab and others vs Jagjit Singh and others. While the judge directed the authorities to pay the salaries within four weeks of the receipt of the order, the matter was kept pending by them. Alleging that the officials were disobeying the court directions, the petitioners filed a contempt of court case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-summons-two-top-officials-to-appear-personally/article34010526.ece
07 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Awareness sessions on ‘sneak thief of sight’||On World Glaucoma Week to be observed from March 7-13, opthalmologists in Hyderabad would organise awareness sessions on glaucoma, a name given to dozens of blinding eye conditions with a common feature of damage to optic nerve that gives one vision, colour vision and side vision. “It is the latter that is preferentially damaged in glaucoma in a very slow manner such that the patient does not realise in the early stages until blindness creeps up,” the doctors stated. Centre for Sight in the city would host awareness initiatives for ophthalmologists, medical community and public, to sensitise them on the permanently blinding eye disease. 5 lakh in TS affected Senior glaucoma specialist Manoj Mathur said around 1.2 crore people in India are effected by glaucoma and approximately 5 lakh patients are from Telangana. Vanita Pathak Ray, another glaucoma specialist at the Centre for Sight, said of the two varieties of glaucoma — Open Angle Glaucoma and Angle Closure Glaucoma, Telangana has high incidence of the latter, which impacts eyesight more severely. Usually, the first line of treatment for patients is drugs or eye drops and if a person does not respond to drugs, surgery has to be resorted to. Terming glaucoma ‘sneak thief of sight’, opthalmologists added that in majority of the cases, there are no symptoms in the early stages. Because of this, patients are often unable to tell if they have the disease and only an eye doctor who conducts specific tests for glaucoma can diagnose it. Regular check-up with an eye doctor, every one to two years, after 35-40 years is recommended. There is no cure for glaucoma. It can only be controlled with eye drops, laser and surgery. Monitoring at periodic intervals throughout life would be required if it is detected, as suggested by eye specialists. “There is no known cause for glaucoma. Among the risk factors for glaucoma are family history of glaucoma, associated risk factors like thyroid disorders, diabetes, hypertension, any history of eye injuries, excessive usage of steroids. The current treatment only prevents further damage in the eye. There is no treatment for reversal of the damage,” Dr Manoj said. Meanwhile, Centre for Sight has launched endoscopic laser cyclophotocoagulation surgery that is used in the treatment of glaucoma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/awareness-sessions-on-sneak-thief-of-sight/article34010537.ece

07 March 2021||HYERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID spillover effect is Rs. 1L cr.||Notwithstanding the loss to the State treasury by about Rs. 50,000 crore and its spillover effect on the government up to Rs. 1 lakh crore on account of COVID, Mr. Rao has expressed the hope that the outlay of the coming budget would be higher than last year. The financial activity in the State had picked up after the COVID situation had eased. The income generation in various forms had shown an upward trend. So, the budget for 2020-21 would hopefully be bright, he indicated while reviewing the budget preparations at a meeting on Saturday. A release later said the budget session of the Assembly was likely to commence in the middle of this month. Mr. Rao held the meeting with Finance Minister T. Harish Rao and senior officials to discuss proposals on the basis of budget estimates prepared by various departments and reports submitted by officials. He said the government would continue the sheep distribution programme for Yadav community along with several welfare and development programmes. Since the community was reaping profits from the scheme, a proposal would be made in the budget to distribute another three lakh units of sheep in addition to the 3.70 lakh units already given to the community. The Centre had appreciated the programme. It had identified the State with the highest population of sheep in the country. Since the fisheries programme was also yielding good results, the same would also be continued. Mr. Rao announced that the guidelines for fixing budget estimates department-wise had been finalised today. The Finance Minister would finalise estimates at meetings with heads of departments of roads and buildings, panchayatraj, municipal administration, education, irrigation and others from Sunday. The final touches would be given by Mr. Rao after budget preparations with all departments were completed. The meeting was attended by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Chief Advisor to government Rajeev Sharma, Principal Finance Secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao and officials of the CMO.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-spillover-effect-is-rs-1l-cr/article34010527.ece

The statue was unveiled by Sharmila, daughter of Y S Rajasekhara Reddy during her State-wide padayatra christened “Maro Praja Prasthanam” on April 27 in 2013. The statue was uprooted from its base on the pedestal abutting the Khammam-Yellandu main road by unidentified persons in the small hours of Saturday. The incident created a flutter at a time when political circles are agog with speculation that Ms Sharmila is likely to launch a new political party in Telangana next month and hold a public meeting in Khammam district to mark the event. Based on a complaint filed by a villager of Shivaigudem, the police registered a case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ysr-statue-vandalised-in-khammam/article34010533.ece
07 March 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||‘Govt. cannot shirk responsibility’||Pradesh Congress Committee president and Member of Parliament from Nalgonda, N. Uttam Kumar Reddy on Saturday alleged that both the TRS and the BJP in the State were playing a blame game to divert pressing issues such as unemployment. “Recent allegations and counters between the two parties over ITIR and Kazipet Railway Coach Factory, to fix the share of blame, show they both betrayed Telangana. Congress kept saying BJP was not sincere with Telangana, but our CM supported all decisions of the PM and was more active than any BJP CM,” he said. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy addressed a series of meetings in Nalgonda, in support of party’s Graduates’ MLC candidate S. Ramulu Naik. He said the TRS government was running away from the responsibility and was washing its hands of unemployment, by claiming creation of a few thousand jobs whereas the need was about 30 lakh vacancies. “KCR must break his silence on rising unemployment in Telangana. The government must present a realistic budget this year and also propose specific solutions to deal with unemployment, besides allocating funds for implementation of Rs. 3,016 unemployment allowance scheme, with effect from December 2018,” he demanded. Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy, referring to the growth figures by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, that the State claimed a growth of 1.35% GSDP during 2020-21, said the government must not inflate figures to claim economic growth. “The CAG and the 15th Finance Commission had revealed that the government committed deliberate accounting errors. Fake claims on economy doing better than national average were used to raise huge loans at high interest rates, and the amounts were utilised on projects that fetch commissions to TRS leaders,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-cannot-shirk-responsibility/article34010530.ece
07 March 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||CPI(M) leaders, with ploughs, take to roads||Expressing solidarity with farmers who are protesting against the Centre-enacted farm legislation in Delhi, leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) staged a novel demonstration on Saturday. With a green turban as headgear and dressed in beige dhotis and white cotton vests, the leaders carried indigenous ploughs on their shoulders and marched in the town. Former Miryalaguda legislator Julakanti Ranga Reddy and district secretary M. Sudhakar Reddy led the formation from the party’s office at Doddi Komaraiah Bhavan to the town’s clock tower centre, amid sloganeering against the BJP-led Centre. The protesting leaders wore black badge. They said the government had behaved in a relaxed way while thousands of protesters continue agitation, and several hundreds had already breathed their last during the period. The CPI (M)’s march and demonstrations were to mark 100 days of protests by farmers in Delhi, against the three farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. According to Mr. Ranga Reddy, “the sovereignty of the country is at stake, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi aligning with corporate forces is selling away public sector units at throwaway prices. Even as farmers are gaining support from across the globe, the PM here continues to be silent and adamant,” he said. The senior leader also demanded that the Telangana government call for a special session of Assembly to pass a resolution against the three farm laws. The TRS government should also withdraw its plans of shutting down produce procurement centres in the State, he demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cpim-leaders-with-ploughs-take-to-roads/article34010125.ece
07 March 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||‘Irrigation projects have become ATMs for govt.’||Minister of State, Home Affairs, G. Kishan Reddy on Saturday said the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government was diverting Centre-allotted funds. He said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre had provided the rightful share to Telangana, built national highways and commenced the fertilizers factory in Ramagundam for farmers, and had also been supportive of Rythu Bandhu, the Regional Ring Road and Defence production in the State. “The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government is depleting the public exchequer. Irrigation projects have become its ATM, they continue to draw amounts by raising the estimate values. They do not have the right to criticise the Centre or Modi,” he said. Addressing graduates and party cadre, at the BJP’s meet to strengthen its Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda Graduates’ MLC candidate Gujjula Premendar Reddy in Nalgonda, he said people started opposing ‘TRS family rule’ since the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. He alleged that TRS leaders had pocketed Rs. 900 crore in the name of relief distribution in Hyderabad and reasoned that the stalling of second phase MMTS and the Railway Project was because of failures and non-compliance on the State part. The Bharatiya Janata Party leader demanded that the State government come out with reports on Centre-released amounts to panchayats and municipalities, funds for medical and health infrastructure and the various irrigation projects in the past seven years. He urged the graduate voters to elect Mr. Premendar Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/irrigation-projects-have-become-atms-for-govt/article34010529.ece

07 March 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Mallannasagar oustees dig in heels as govt. mounts pressure||It is a do-or-die situation for residents of some submerging villages under Mallannasagar reservoir. Pressure is mounting on them to vacate their homes so that bund construction work can progress faster and Godavari water from Kaleswaram can be released into the 50 tmcft-capacity reservoir that is nearing completion. For the past three days, Etigaddakishtapur and Pallepahad villages have been witnessing heavy presence of police personnel and residents, especially women and the elderly, are feeling the pressure. Even while the situation was tense in some villages, officials from revenue and irrigation departments visited tandas attached to Egitagaddakishtapur on Friday and Saturday. They have asked residents to vacate the village while promising all benefits would be extended to them and that they can choose a house at Mutrajpally where a Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Colony is coming up for the Mallannasagar oustees. “Officials have asked us to vacate the village and shift to the new houses. But we have made it clear to the officials that we will leave only after all compensations are paid and construction of the new houses are completed,” a tanda resident said, echoing the feelings of fellow villagers. ‘Officials creating fear’ On the other hand, release of water more than the carrying capacity into Mallannasagar is also being seen as a blackmailing tactic to pressurise the residents to vacate their village. “Officials know that the flowing capacity of the canal is only 500 cusecs but they released 1,200 cusecs of water into it. That means it would overflow and fill quarries dug up to get black soil for Mallannasagar. Naturally, it will create fear among oustees. Release of water on Thursday night was intentional,” commented an oustee from Pallepahad. So far, four villages — Rampur, Lakshmapur, Singrama and Erravalli — have been vacated while four others attached to tandas — Vemulaghat (hamlet village Turka Banjerpally) Etigaddakishtapur (tanda Mogula Cheruvu), Pallepahad (tanda) and Brahmana Banjerpally — are yet to be vacated. “The officials have failed to provide permanent accommodation to those who have already vacated the villages. How can we be sure of a roof over our heads,” asked Swamy, another oustee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/mallannasagar-oustees-dig-in-heels-as-govt-mounts-pressure/article34010540.ece

07 March 2021||YEDDUMAILARAM (SANGAREDDY District),TELANGANA||Earning revenue from garbage||On the outskirts of this village is the dump yard where wet and dry garbage is being separated. Recyclable material like bottles is being kept aside. All other not useful material is put in incinerator and burnt down. The ash can be used again. The wet garbage is dried and and allowed to become compost. Since July 2020, the village has generated a revenue of Rs. 70,000 by selling the compost. A farmer in the village has used only this manure in his farm and cultivated wheat, village sarpanch Kasala Malla Reddy said and added that he too had used a tractor load of this manure. There is so much demand for the manure that a farmer was asked to wait for two weeks. The village has 32 CCTV cameras and 20 speakers of the public address systems. The CC TV monitoring system is in the room of sarpanch at the panchayat office enabling him to keep track of the happenings in the village while working in the office. The village is also getting a new panchayat building in G+1 mode, the building is expected to be ready in next few months. It is being built at an estimated cost of Rs. 40 lakh on 150 square yards. It will have a special room for women groups to hold their meetings. It took a long time for Mr. Malla Reddy to convince the residents to segregate the wet and dry garbage. At one point of time the village authorities had to tell the residents they would not collect garbage if it was not segregated. Not only that at on once occasion the sarpanch told the residents that they would leave the garbage unattended in front of the residences. Everyone has fallen in line and now every family puts out their garbage only after segregating it at source. The village has an underground drainage system. The village is shortly setting up a 40 KV solar power plant. While the village requirement is only 27 KV, the balance will be supplied to the grid. Among other projects under development is a four acre playground adjacent to the school for sports activities. “We are trying to change the face of the village and youth are cooperating. We are also going to start opening of Sukanya Samrudhi Yojana (SSY) accounts for the all the eligible girls, as it is being done in Haridaspur,” Mr Malla Reddy told The Hindu adding that this was aimed at encouraging girl child in the village. Even Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar had visited the village during last year Palle Pragathi programme in June 2020, to examine development activities being taken up here, the sarpanch added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/earning-revenue-from-garbage/article34010546.ece

07 March 2021||Bahadurgarh/New Delhi,||Digging in for the summer||Protesting farmers at Delhi’s borders are relying on their innovative skills to tackle the impending summer, and their empathetic collaboration to ensure a good harvest back home. The agitation against the three contentious farm laws began over 100 days ago. At the start, roads leading up to the protest sites were packed with tractors. But the numbers have dipped slightly as the machines are needed back in the villages for harvest season. The number of trollies, however, has increased and they are at the core of the changing landscape at the protest sites. Innovations range from RO purification-enabled submersible water devices, 500-litre water storage tanks filled with buttermilk, air-conditioned semi-permanent structures with their own sewerage system, trollies with desert coolers, and trenches to keep water from entering tents during the monsoon. ‘Trolley colonies’ have sprung up around semi-permanent structures laden with wet jute bags that will cool the air through portable fans, and submersible pumps are being installed along NH 9 to help create bathrooms for women protesters. At the Singhu border protest site, trollies have been fitted with desert coolers and even air conditioners. A dental clinic near the main stage has started distributing medicines from inside a semi-permanent structure and is also fitted with an air conditioner. Fans are being brought to the Tikri and Ghazipur border protest sites to cool the tents. Multiple 500-litre water tanks are replenished several times a day with lassi or buttermilk at the Tikri border and, like in Ghazipur, more bathing areas have also been created there. Both sites have also received additional washing machines. Summer plan Semi-permanent tents are being pitched not only to counter the heat but to also provide accommodation for farmers staying at the Singhu border without trollies. Ply-based and ready-made structures that can accommodate around 10-15 people have also been procured. Meanwhile, several patches of vacant land along NH 9 have been cleared of shrubbery and rocks to make way for trollies covered with tarpaulin and plastic sheets parked in a rectangular pattern – each seemingly constituting a separate “room” surrounded by porous green cloth – forming mini dwellings with elderly farmers resting on mattresses placed in the middle. The vacant plots are covered in trees that provide some relief from the sun. Rohtash Kumar from Bhiwani said semi-permanent structures such as sheds for tractors, and trollies laden with supplies, are coming up along the highway. The already-erected tents will see slight modifications as the mercury rises. “Some of our tents have multiple arrangements, including a kitchen and sleeping area. Then, there are the larger tents, which are used to store vegetables and other edibles... We are covering the tin ceilings of sheds for our vehicles with jute bags, and will put cardboard ceilings on the smaller tents for the summer. The larger ones will be covered by jute sheets which will be kept wet around the clock and have fans to keep the edibles cool,” he said. Luvpreet Singh from Fatehabad led the way to a large ‘tractor colony’ that has been set up on a recently cleared vacant plot. The encampment is preparing for the arrival of women protesters. “The owner of the land is a farmer like us. Not only did he give us permission to use the plot but also allowed us to build semi-permanent structures,” Mr. Singh said. Suresh Goswami from Jind in Punjab, who has been camping along the NH 9 since late November last year, said large fans that are used on farms will be placed next to the semi-permanent structures. They will be covered with wet jute sheets to keep them cool. “Since it is proving slightly difficult to gather water on a daily basis, we have made arrangements to ensure our own water supply by installing submersible pumps. Around a dozen have been set up and we will instal a total of 50 by April. We will not leave till the laws are repealed,” he said. Community harvest “The number of tractors is about the same as when the agitation started but sometimes tractors do need to go back to villages since the fields are being watered for the fourth time before the harvest,” said Virender Singh from Hisar, whose tent is among the many occupying the divider on NH 9 near the Rohtak bypass. “We have assigned duties for this. For example, one brother waters the fields and then comes here on the family tractor so the other can go back. If the family tractor is not available for some reason, a trolley – sometimes even two – take its place here,” he added. Gurdeep Singh from Patiala said though the harvest season was still a month away, farmers were in the process of making adjustments and arrangements, so they did not face issues once the harvest began. Village panchayats have played a significant role in helping households reach an understanding regarding the pooling and sharing of resources, he said, adding: “Once the harvest begins, farmers will be sharing their resources with each other to ensure the process is completed smoothly. Each village has sent around 50 tractors and trolleys. There are hundreds that are still in the villages and that should suffice for the season.” Manjeet Singh Shergill from Bahal village said their goal to get the controversial laws repealed necessitated willingness to be able to fight for a long duration. “Usually, each household has at least two tractors and trolleys. In case a family faces some kind of a shortage due to the protest, other villagers are more than willing to share. Had there been a logistical issue, we would not have brought tractors here in the first place,” Mr. Shergill said. Jatvinder Singh from Hoshiarpur said only half of the tractors and trollies in his village had come to the protest. “In our village, we have around 200-250 tractors and trolleys. Out of that, only about 100 are here. We have also started putting up tents as there is uncertainty over how long this will continue,” he said, adding: “In case some of us are required to take back our trolleys for a few days, with the tents installed, there accommodation will be sorted.” There is a sense of community sharing in the villages and there were enough resources back home for the upcoming harvest, Ramandeep Singh from Patiala said, adding: “Recently, a farmer from our village found himself without a tractor which he required for harvesting potato. His neighbours arrived with seven tractors to compensate for the one tractor that is stationed at the Singhu border protest site.” Sukhjeet Singh Sidhu from Ajrawar village said people were more than ready to help each other out given the ongoing agitation. “Currently, it is harvest season for potato and sugarcane. Once those farmers are done, they will replace us at the borders. There are a large number of trolleys in our villages, it is unlikely that we will need to take back the trolleys stationed at the protest sites,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/digging-in-for-the-summer/article34010270.ece

An NGT Bench directed the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Delhi to verify the factual position and take remedial action in accordance with law after due verification. The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea by Vivek Awasthi, seeking action against the felling of trees by DIAL and the GMR group for the expansion of a new runway at the airport. According to the petition, the felling of trees had taken place in non-compliance of requisite rules. Based on a RTI filed by the petitioner, it was contended that no permission was taken for the felling. Referring to the RTI, the Tribunal said: “While RTI proceedings cannot be taken as conclusive to presume that there is no permission, instead of straightaway interfering with the project of public utility and at the same time ensuring compliance of rule of law, we direct the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Delhi to verify the factual position.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/look-into-petition-alleging-chopping-of-trees-by-dial/article34010272.ece

07 March 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Activists demand inclusion of newlywed women in PDS||The Odisha Right to Food Campaign, a forum of individuals spearheading the movement for food entitlements, said the government should implement inter-portability facility for newlywed women, whose names are struck off the public distribution system after their marriage. According to RTF, Odisha, a large number of newlywed women are unable to access their share of ration as their names are cancelled from their parental card but not added to their marital cards. The problem worsens further as families find it equally difficult to add names of children to the ration card. “The State lacks a clear and transparent process to port names of migrated individuals or to add new individuals to ration cards. The process remains just as opaque and difficult to navigate despite the government implementing Aadhaar seeding, digitisation of PDS or even ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ scheme,” said Samit Panda, a lead member of RTF, Odisha. Thousands of women migrate after marriage, and a large fraction of this section of population risks exclusion from PDS, he said. The RTF, Odisha says the 2011 census shows that 46% of migration was due to marriage, of which 97%, or 20.58 crore migrants, were women. 78% population “As high as 78% of Odisha’s population are PDS beneficiaries. Observing the widespread exclusion of women, it is estimated that at least ten lakh women have been left out from PDS since National Food Security Act came into force,” he pointed out. Stating that access to food was under stress following the COVID-19 lockdown due to loss of income, Mr. Panda alleged, “exclusion from PDS will further reduce food intake of families, and worsens the already abysmal nutritional status of children, adolescent girls and women.” The forum demanded improvement in access to PDS. “A standard operating procedure for porting newly wed women’s names from parental to marital ration cards in a time-bound manner, must be issued after consultation with different stakeholders,” it emphasised. Grievance redressal A grievance redressal system should be implemented to identify and fix gaps in the process. There must be a mechanism to inform beneficiaries about deletion and addition of names in PDS system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/activists-demand-inclusion-of-newlywed-women-in-pds/article34010288.ece

07 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||AJP chief to contest from Duliajan||The six-month-old Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) has named its president Lurinjyoti Gogoi as its candidate for the Duliajan Assembly constituency in eastern Assam. Party general secretary Jagadish Bhuyan, who quit the Bharatiya Janata Party in December 2019 over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, will contest from Sadiya, a constituency where the Brahmaputra begins. AJP was launched in September 2020 by members of the influential All Assam Students’ Union, of which Mr. Gogoi was the general secretary, and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad. The party was an outcome of the anti-CAA movement in Assam and sought to give Assam a new brand of regionalism that the Asom Gana Parishad – birthed by the same organisations – had allegedly surrendered to its ally, BJP. “We have announced the candidates for 18 seats. Candidates for the other constituencies will be named soon,” Mr. Bhuyan said, dismissing reports of a rift with the Raijor Dal, another party formed by jailed rights activist Akhil Gogoi’s group and associate organisations. He declined to comment on the jailed rights activist’s view that an opposition alliance too many would help BJP and its allies retain power in the State. “We cannot comment on the views of another party or individual. We don’t feel so weak,” he said. Apart from Duliajan and Sadiya, AJP would be contesting Sarupathar, Dhemaji, Khumtai, Dhekiajuli, Rangapara, Dhing, Batadrava, Dergaon, Nazira, Thaora, Bihpuria, Dibrugarh, Mariani, Tinsukia, Dhakuakhana and Margherita.  Friendly fight The All India United Democratic Front, the second major party in the Congress-led Majahot or grand alliance, said it would be contest 24 seats. The party would contest 21 seats independently and there will be a friendly fight with the alliance partners in three. The seats that the AIUDF would be contesting for the Mahajot include the 14 it had won in 2016 and a by-election later. These are Abhayapuri (South), Algapur, Bhabanipur, Bilasipara (East), Dhing, Dhubri, Gauripur, Hailakandi, Jaleswar, Jamunamukh, Jania, Karimganj (South), Katlicherra and Naoboicha. Anchalik Gana Morcha, a constituent of the eight-party mahajot , will field two candidates – Lachit Bordoloi from Batadrava and Manjit Mahanta from Dispur. The grand alliance has offered two seats to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and a seat each to the CPI and CPI(Marxist-Leninist). These are Rangiya and Sorbhog, Morigaon, and Bihali. The Congress and Bodoland People’s Front, which is demanding at least 12 seats, are yet to announce their candidates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ajp-chief-to-contest-from-duliajan/article34010196.ece

07 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||I stand firmly with anti-CAA forces: Mahanta||Former Assam Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta said he has not wavered from his stand against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He is among the four MLAs of the regional Asom Gana Parishad who have been denied ticket for the three-phase Assam election starting March 27. “I stand firmly with the anti-CAA forces,” Mr. Mahanta said after arriving in Guwahati from New Delhi, where he had undergone treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The two-time Chief Minister is the founder-president of AGP, a minor ally of BJP in the State. The party got 26 seats following the seat-sharing agreement with BJP and other allies in New Delhi on March 5. AGP(P) ticket “Which party denied ticket?” he retorted, when journalists asked why he was left out. This has fuelled speculation that he could contest the polls on AGP-Pragatisheel (AGP-P) ticket. Mr. Mahanta had formed the AGP-P in 2005 after his expulsion from AGP. The party merged with the AGP in 2008 but was revived on a low key during the anti-CAA protests three years ago. AGP-P general secretary Pranab Goswami said the party had been re-energised ahead of the Assembly poll and they were waiting for Mr. Mahanta to lead them towards forming an “anti-CAA government”. His wife and former Rajya Sabha member Jayshree Goswami Mahanta slammed AGP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/i-stand-firmly-with-anti-caa-forces-mahanta/article34010512.ece

The One Green Mile project will beautify the arterial road by streamlining vehicle lanes, building over 3 km of pedestrian walkways, including a dedicated lane for cyclists, and creating a community space for residents to enjoy leisure activities. Spaces under flyovers will be remodelled as community spaces for recreational activities by setting up improved lighting fixtures, seating areas and play areas, equipment for exercise, and artwork. “One of the crucial changes would be to use the space under the flyover,” said Assistant Municipal Commissioner Sharad Ughade, BMC, G-South ward. “We propose to create over 1,000 sq. mt of space. We could use the space to encourage sports like skating and badminton,” he added. The streetscape project extends from Dadar flower market to Phoenix Mall in Lower Parel. Phase 1 of the project, an 800-metre stretch between One International Centre and One World Centre, is under way and is expected to be opened for the public in May. Phase 2, which extends along Senapati Bapat Marg from Dadar flower market to 520 metres beyond One World Centre, is expected to begin in April. The project involves planned urbanism, correction and widening of roads, broader pavements, and reclaiming the streets from encroachments. “We constantly strive to enhance the experience for those working in and around our office parks. We are thrilled to begin work on this streetscape redevelopment project, leveraging our real estate expertise and experiences of transforming properties to enhance quality of life for Mumbai residents,” said Quaiser Parvez, CEO, Nucleus Office Parks.

The commission had recommended providing 12% reservation in education and 13% in government jobs for members of the Maratha community. Last year, the Supreme Court had ordered an interim stay on the Maratha reservation law. The Supreme Court is set to hear pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the Maratha quota law under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018, from March 8 to 18.  Mr. Raje said, “I hope from March 8, the State government faces no confusion on the reservation matter. It has still not translated the annexures of the backward class commission’s report. I was told that the important points have been translated. But how can they decide which are the important points?” he asked. Mr. Raje said the Maratha community had assigned two senior counsels to help the State government with its plea to lift the stay on the implementation of the law. He also sought the release of the funds announced for the Sarathi Sanstha and the Annasaheb Patil Economic Development Corporation. Ankush Kadam, a Maratha Kranti Morcha worker, said, “During the last hearing, the matter was postponed citing a technical reason. The translation of the report was not submitted to the court and hence the hearing did not happen. The SC needs the documents in English and it was the State government’s duty to translate the whole report. Even now, they haven’t translated the document, which shows their negligence. We hope the government does its work in the reservation issue wholeheartedly and helps us win.”  During the last hearing... the translation of the report was not submitted and the hearing did not happen Ankush Kadam Maratha Kranti Morcha worker||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mva-govt-should-work-towards-lifting-stay-on-maratha-quota/article34010192.ece
07 March 2021||Pune,||Pune’s Blades of Glory adjudged world’s largest cricket museum||Blades of Glory, touted as a one-of-a-kind museum in India dedicated to cricket, has been awarded a ‘World Record’ by the World Record Academy in Miami, U.S. The museum in Pune is the brainchild of Rohan Pate, a former U-19 Maharashtra cricket player. It features over 51,000 items of cricket memorabilia and has been visited by nearly 500 cricketers across the globe. The museum has now surpassed its counterparts like the Lords’ Cricket Museum in London, the Bradman Museum in New South Wales, the West Indies Cricket Heritage Centre in Grenada and the New Zealand Cricket Museum in Welling in having the largest collection of cricket memorabilia. The museum’s 5000 sq. ft.-long gallery, known as ‘Castle of Cricket’, has a splendid array of cricketing memorabilia including bats and balls signed by the captains of the World Cup winning teams, as well as personal cricket items signed and used by legends like Sir Donald Bradman, Kapil Dev, Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, Desmond Haynes, Imran Khan, Sir Viv Richards, M.S. Dhoni, V.V.S. Laxman and Virat Kohli. ‘Feather in cap’ “Cricket is akin to a religion in India and my passion for the sport led me to do this. This achievement is a feather not only in my cap, but in the caps of cricketing enthusiasts across Maharashtra and Pune,” said Mr. Pate. In 2019, the museum was added to the ‘Google Art and Culture’ platform. Set up in 2012, it was inaugurated by Tendulkar. Boasting the largest cricket-related collection in the world, it has special sections dedicated to the game’s superstars like Tendulkar and Kohli. Stating that the venture was never intended to be a money-making enterprise, Mr. Pate said that his passion for the game was behind the idea of his museum dedicated to cricket. After India won the World Cup in 2011, Mr. Pate decided to tour countries to collect autographed articles. When he started out in 2012, he had just 600 items, which has swelled to over 50,000. Given the steady flow of recognition the museum has been receiving from global platforms, Mr. Pate said his next venture would be to establish a cricket museum in all Indian metro cities, with the first such one planned in Mumbai. “I am also thinking of setting up a similar museum in all cricketing nations in the future,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/punes-blades-of-glory-adjudged-worlds-largest-cricket-museum/article34010193.ece

07 March 2021||Islamabad,||Pakistan PM survives confidence vote||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan survived a vote of confidence by the country’s Parliament on Saturday, days after his party lost a key Senate seat to an opposition candidate. Ruling party and opposition cadres clashed briefly outside the Parliament ahead of the vote, with local TV channels showing a shoe being thrown at former Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal. Mr. Khan secured 178 votes in the 340-seat National Assembly through an open ballot, boycotted by the main opposition parties, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The vote followed the contentious results of Wednesday’s election to Pakistan’s Senate, whose members are chosen by provincial Parliaments and lawmakers from the lower house. In a sign of growing ruptures within his ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Mr. Khan’s Finance Minister lost his seat to an opposition candidate, suggesting some members of the party had switched their loyalty. Mr. Khan — who came to power in 2018 after vowing to clean up corruption — accused the Opposition of horse-trading and buying some of his party’s parliamentarians in a bid to ward off graft investigations. Speaking following the confidence vote, the Prime Minister accused the opposition parties of “plundering national wealth” during their times in office. “This was a decade of darkness used by the two parties to ruin national institutions”. Economy in turmoil Addressing party workers outside the Parliament, senior opposition leader and former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi denounced the vote as “illegal and unconstitutional”. “People are being deceived by this government,” he said. Since taking office, Mr. Khan has struggled to stabilise an economy hit by rising inflation, a depreciating rupee and ballooning deficits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-pm-survives-confidence-vote/article34009969.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The party can’t go on||For the first time in its post-Nazi history, a political party in Germany is officially under surveillance. Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, also known as the BfV, has classified the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as a “suspected case” with links to right-wing extremism. This means German security agents can monitor AfD party members, tap their phones, read their emails, and scrutinise the party’s sources of funding. AfD leaders reacted angrily to the decision, describing it as a politically motivated attempt by the Angela Merkel-led government to sabotage its prospects in an election year by putting them “in the Nazi corner”. It is true that the move comes at the beginning of an election season. Six of Germany’s 16 States go to the polls this year while the country will hold general elections in September, when Ms. Merkel will depart as Chancellor. However, except for the AfD, which has challenged the decision in court, most parties have welcomed the move. The decision marks the culmination of a two-year long investigation into the activities of the AfD’s youth division and the ‘Flugel’ (the Wing), an extremist unit of the party. As the courts review the legality of monitoring the entire party, the BfV has said, for now, incumbent lawmakers and those contesting the September elections will be exempt from surveillance, indicating that the tracking would be confined to lower-level party members. But formal surveillance, even if a limited one, could impact the perception battle ahead of the elections and put the AfD at a disadvantage. The AfD was founded in 2013 as a euro-sceptic party. But in 2015-16, when Germany welcomed 1.2 million refugees, it morphed into a platform for anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim politics, after which its popularity soared. In the 2017 federal elections, it emerged as the largest Opposition party, securing 12.6% vote and 94 seats. The party is also represented in all the 16 State Parliaments and the European Parliament. ‘Sense of betrayal’ The AfD has always enjoyed greater support in what used to be East Germany, in States like Saxony, Brandedburg and Thuringia. In these parts, sections of society that could not plug into the prosperity of post-unification Germany felt abandoned by the federal government. Their resentment was already high when the Merkel administration began to welcome refugees and spend on their welfare. The AfD stoked the sense of betrayal felt by many in eastern Germany — the sense that a government that has done little for them, even though they ‘arrived’ in 1990, is seemingly laying out the red carpet for ‘foreigners’ who are not even German, don’t speak their language, and follow a religion that “isn’t German”. The AfD’s manifesto proclaims that “Islam does not belong to Germany”. As the AfD’s popularity rose, Germany saw a spike in hate crimes targeting immigrants. As per official figures, the country witnessed around 900 Islamophobic hate crimes in 2020, with 80 mosques attacked during the year. The deadliest attack was the shooting spree by a far-right extremist in Hanau in February 2020, in which 11 people were killed. At the same time, AfD politicians have been serial offenders when it comes to anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and even anti-Semitic rhetoric, with some going so far as to break the nation’s biggest taboo — trying to whitewash its Nazi past. For instance, the party’s leader of the Opposition Alexander Gauland described the Nazi era as just a “speck of bird poo” on German history. The AfD’s Thuringia head Bjorn Hocke said Germany was “crippled” by its “politics of remembrance” about the Holocaust and must “reverse it by 180 degrees”. Speaking of Muslim migrants, another AfD politician Christian Luth said, “We can always shoot them later. That’s not an issue. Or gas them, as you wish.” The AfD had to expel Luth following public outrage over this comment. Right-wing violence Frequent outbreaks of right-wing violence — a pro-migrant politician was shot dead in June 2019, and a synagogue was attacked in Halle in October 2019 — appears to be one of the reasons behind the recent dip in the AfD’s popularity. The other factor has been infighting, with some leaders calling for extremist members to be expelled in the larger interests of the party, which they want to project as a viable alternative for a conservative middle class that wants nothing to do with neo-Nazis. Instances of right-wing violence have also sparked large rallies demanding that the state act against extremist platforms. While AfD leaders have sought refuge in free speech rights, Germany’s post-War Constitution is stringent on one aspect: preventing the return of Nazi ideology. As the Merkel administration moves to stop the normalisation of hate, it believes it has public sentiment and the Constitution on its side. With right-wing populism on the rise in many parts of the world, it is significant that the political establishment in Germany, Europe’s most powerful economy, is bucking the trend of liberal-centrists shying away from confronting the far-right head-on, and instead, showing the political sagacity to wield the powers of the state in defense of the constitutional order. Setting this example could well be Ms. Merkel’s parting gift to Germany, Europe and beyond.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/the-party-cant-go-on/article34009971.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The man behind the coup||When Min Aung Hlaing became Myanmar’s military chief in 2011, the country was transitioning into quasi democracy. The military had introduced a new Constitution in 2008, a year after the violent crackdown of the Buddhist monks who led the ‘saffron revolution’. Senior General Than Shwe, who had been in power since 1992, had handed powers to a new transition government of President Than Sein, a former military officer. Aung San Suu Kyi and many other political prisoners were released. All eyes were on the little-known General Min Aung Hlaing, who was described by blogger Hla Oo, who knew the commander from his childhood, as “a battle-hardened warrior of the brutal Burmese Army”. Initially, the General endorsed the government’s efforts to reach out to the political opposition and initiate a peace process with different insurgent groups. When Ms. Suu Kyyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) swept the 2015 election, the military accepted the results. But the political peace did not last long. When the NLD swept the 2020 election with a bigger mandate, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), a proxy of the military, alleged election fraud. On February 1, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing carried out the third coup in the country’s history, declaring a state of emergency and detaining elected leaders, including Ms. Suu Kyi and President Win Myint. Ever since, the Myanmar military has unleashed violence on protesters, killing over 50 people. International criticism is mounting. But the man behind the coup appears to be unmoved. The Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar military that controlled the country through direct rule for about 50 years is called, is notorious for its repressive tactics. The soldiers had killed hundreds of protesters in the past, incarcerated thousands of activists and established a system in which the Tatmadaw’s interests are perennially protected. Partial democracy Even when the military allowed partial democracy, the Generals resisted even suggestions from NLD leaders to change the military-written Constitution that has reserved a quarter of seats in Parliament and three key ministries in the government—defence, border and home affairs — for the soldiers. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing never committed to full transition. In 2015, a few months before the elections, he said he had no timeline for full civilian rule: “It could be five years or it could be 10 years, I couldn’t say.” In five years, he ended even the partial civilian rule. Born in the southern city of Dawei in 1956, Min Aung Hlaing did his school and college education in Yangon. He graduated in law in Yangon university before entering the elite Defense Services Academy in 1974. As a commanding officer, he led several military campaigns against the country’s myriad rebels. But his rise to the top echelons of the powerful military was sealed after he led the 2009 offensive against the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army, an insurgents group in the Kokang region, along the border of China’s Yunnan province. Within one week, the Myanmar military dislodged thousands of insurgents from the border. The campaign also resulted in thousands of refugees fleeing the border villages to the Chinese side of the border. Within the military, the campaign was hailed as a victory and Gen. Min Aung Hlaing got the attention of Senior General Than Shwe. In August 2010, he was appointed joint chief of staff. And in March 2011, when Gen. Than Shwe, in his mid-70s, retired, he picked Gen. Min Aung Hlaing as his successor. The road to coup The General hit headlines in 2017 when the military launched a sweeping counterinsurgency operation in the Rakhine State that led to at least 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, a persecuted ethnic and religious minority, fleeing the country. The UN Human Rights Council called for investigation into alleged genocide and crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine and Shan states. Following the UN call in 2018, Facebook took down Gen. Min Aung Hlaing’s pages that had millions of followers. Ms. Suu Kyi had defended the campaign against Rohingya internationally, but at home, several reports pointed to growing rifts between her and the military commander. When the NLD swept the 2020 election, the Army found the rising popularity of the party and its leader as a threat. The Generals made three demands to Ms. Suu Kyi, according to a Reuters report: disband the Election Commission, announce a probe into alleged election frauds and postpone the meeting of Parliament. Ms. Suu Kyi said ‘no’ to all three. In January, General Min Aung Hlaing issued a direct threat to the government. “The Constitution should be revoked if laws are not followed,” he said. And then, the military moved to capture power on February 1, hours before the new Parliament was to be convened. The military has promised elections, but it hasn’t given any timeline. The public, having experienced at least limited liberties for 10 years, stays defiant. As protests spread, the Generals turned to their favourite playbook of repression. However, despite the bloodshed, protests continue to swell the streets, unlike 1988 and 2007 when the military restored order through force. Perhaps this is the biggest challenge the junta faces today in its bid to consolidate power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/the-man-behind-the-coup/article34009972.ece
07 March 2021||Najaf,||Pope, top Shia cleric plead for ‘peace’ in historic Iraq meet||Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, spiritual leader of most of the world’s Shia Muslims, told Pope Francis in a historic meeting in Iraq on Saturday that the country’s Christians should live in “peace”. The meeting, on the second day of the first-ever papal visit to Iraq, marked a landmark moment in modern religious history and a milestone in the Pope’s efforts to deepen interfaith dialogue. Pope Francis later addressed the rich spectrum of Iraq’s religious communities at Ur, the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, a central figure in the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths, where he made an impassioned plea for “unity” after conflict. The 84-year-old pontiff’s trip to Iraq is an effort to both comfort the country’s ancient but dwindling Christian community and deepen his dialogue with other faiths.  The Grand Ayatollah, 90, “affirmed his concern that Christian citizens should live like all Iraqis in peace and security, and with their full constitutional rights,” his office said.  During his address, Pope Francis said freedom of conscience and of religion were “fundamental rights” that should be respected everywhere.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pope-top-shia-cleric-plead-for-peace-in-historic-iraq-meet/article34009970.ece
07 March 2021||Yangon,||Protests continue in Myanmar after UN envoy urges action||Security forces in Myanmar again used force on Saturday to disperse anti-coup protesters, a day after the UN special envoy urged the Security Council to take action to quell junta violence that this week left about 50 peaceful demonstrators dead and scores injured. Fresh protests were reported on Saturday morning in the biggest city of Yangon, where stun grenades and tear gas were used against protesters. On Wednesday, 18 people were reportedly killed there. Protests were also reported in Myitkyina, the capital of the northern state of Kachin, Myeik, in the country’s far south where police fired tear gas at students, and Dawei in the southeast where tear gas was also used. Other places included Kyaikto, in the eastern state of Mon, Loikaw, the capital of Kayah state in eastern Myanmar, and Myingyan, a city where one protester was killed on Wednesday. The escalation of violence has put pressure on the world community to act to restrain the junta, which seized power on February 1 by ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under military rule. UN special envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener said in her briefing to Friday’s closed Security Council meeting that council unity and “robust” action are critical “in pushing for a stop to the violence and the restoration of Myanmar’s democratic institutions.” “We must denounce the actions by the military,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/protests-continue-in-myanmar-after-un-envoy-urges-action/article34009967.ece
07 March 2021||Dubai,||Intense fighting in Yemen’s Marib leaves at least 90 dead||Fierce fighting between Yemeni pro-government forces and Iran-backed Houthi rebels has killed at least 90 combatants on both sides in the past 24 hours, military sources said on Saturday. The Shia rebels launched an offensive last month to seize Marib, the last stronghold in northern Yemen of pro-government forces who are backed by a Saudi-led military coalition. The clashes in the oil-rich province left 32 dead among government forces and loyalist tribes, while 58 Houthi rebels were killed in coalition air strikes, the sources said. They said heavy clashes broke out on six fronts as government forces were able to counter attacks by the Houthis who managed to advance only on the Kassara front northwest of Marib city. The fighting also left dozens of people wounded, the sources added. The loss of Marib would be a huge blow for the Yemeni government, but would also threaten catastrophe for civilians, including hundreds of thousands of displaced people in desolate camps. It would also be a major setback for Saudi Arabia, which has been the target of increasingly frequent Houthi missile attacks in recent weeks. Shrapnel from Houthi drones intercepted by the Saudis on Friday wounded two civilians, including a 10-year-old, in the southwest of the kingdom. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday urged the Houthis to halt their offensive in Marib, as he announced $191 million in aid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/intense-fighting-in-yemens-marib-leaves-at-least-90-dead/article34009974.ece

The envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, held talks earlier this week with Afghan leaders in Kabul, including President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, chair of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation, which oversees the government’s talks with the insurgents. Taliban spokesman Muhamad Naeem tweeted that Mr. Khalilzad and the top U.S. General in Afghanistan met with the insurgents’ negotiating team in Doha late on Friday. “Both sides expressed their commitment to the Doha agreement and discussed its full implementation. Likewise, the current situation of Afghanistan and the rapidity and effectiveness of the Intra-Afghan negotiations were discussed,” he wrote. The accord states that the U.S. will withdraw all troops from Afghanistan, with the Taliban promising not to allow territory to be used by terrorists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-envoy-khalilzad-meets-taliban-in-doha/article34009973.ece

07 March 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. open to evaluate, explore cryptocurrencies, says Thakur||Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Saturday said the government is open to evaluate and explore new technologies, including cryptocurrencies, for improving governance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is a strong advocate of embracing technology in various aspects of governance, the Minister of State for Finance said while addressing an event organised by Entrepreneurs’ Organisation — EO Punjab. “Let me say that we welcome innovation and new technology... blockchain is a new emerging technology,” Mr. Thakur said. “Cryptocurrency is a form of virtual currency. I firmly believe that we must always evaluate, explore and encourage new ideas with an open mind,” he added. A high-level inter-ministerial committee (IMC) was constituted under the chairmanship of the economic affairs secretary on digital currencies and it has submitted its report. The government would take a decision on the recommendations of the IMC and the legislative proposal, if any, would be introduced in Parliament following the due process, he said, inviting suggestions on the issue. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the government is still formulating its opinion on cryptocurrencies and will take a calibrated position. Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das had last week said the apex bank had certain “major concerns” over the impact cryptocurrencies may have on the financial stability in the economy and had conveyed the same to the government. The RBI had virtually banned cryptocurrency trading in 2018. The Supreme Court had asked the Centre in 2019 to frame policies for crypto, and in 2020, struck down the curbs imposed by the RBI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-open-to-evaluate-explore-cryptocurrencies-says-thakur/article34009936.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A look at the TVS Group’s proposed recast of holdings||Story so far: The TVS group has existed for 110 years. Given the various businesses in the group and the interests and priorities in the third and fourth generations of its founder T.V. Sundaram Iyengar, the family has decided to align the ownership of different group companies with the respective arms of the families managing them. A look at the background and some details of the planned structure: What is the first step of the family arrangement? The group has primarily three holding companies — T.V. Sundram Iyengar & Sons Ltd. (referred to as TVS & Sons), Sundaram Industries Private Ltd. (SIPL) and Southern Roadways Private Ltd. (SRPL), referred to as TVS Holding Companies. TVS & Sons holds majority stake in both the other holding companies and the balance in those two is held by the respective arms of the TVS family. Together, these three firms have funded, and hence hold stakes in, the group companies that have emerged over the years. The first step of the arrangement is to merge SIPL and SRPL into TVS & Sons on a share exchange ratio based on valuation. Such a merger is necessary as different family arms run different businesses whose stakes are held variously by the 3 holding firms. A merger and then demerger of each business into the respective family holding company would follow. Family arms also own a piece of the distribution business pertaining to their part of the overall business, which would be demerged into their ownership as part of the process. At the end of the family arrangement, there would be no single holding company but there would be separate holding companies for each of the family branches that have been managing the respective businesses for decades, sources close to the family said. Would there be other agreements that family members would enter into? The sources said that additionally, the arrangement will probably also see a number of ancillary agreements — for example as to how the TVS brand would be used in the future, and a non-compete agreement — as has been the practice for decades in prior family partitions in our country. What changes would the group’s listed firms witness? While the companies that run the businesses themselves are not directly part of the family agreement, their holdings will witness a change. TVS Motor Company is run by Venu Srinivasan and his immediate family members. According to an exchange filing by TVS Motor on January 27, the TVS holding companies hold 63.76% in Sundaram Clayton (SCL), which is the holding company for TVS Motor. It added that after the merger of the holding companies of the group, the two-wheeler auto parts and die castings business would be demerged into TVS Investments and Holdings Pvt. Ltd. (TVSIHPL). Also, the 63.76% of SCL’s shares held by the TVS Holding Companies will vest with TVSIHPL, in which Mr. Srinivasan and his immediate family members hold a majority stake. Likewise, Sundram Fasteners, run by Suresh Krishna and his family, would witness a demerger of the fasteners business from the TVS Holding Companies into TVS Sundram Fasteners Pvt. Ltd. The 49.53% shares held by the Holding Companies in Sundram Fasteners will vest with TVS Sundram Fasteners Pvt. Ltd., in which Mr. Krishna’s family holds a majority. Similarly, K. Mahesh’s family runs Sundaram Brake Linings, in which the TVS Holding Companies hold 32.66% stake. Post merger of the three TVS Holding Companies, a demerger of the Brake Linings business will be effected to Madurai Alagar Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. (MAEPL). So, the 32.66% of Sundaram Brake Linings held by the holding companies will vest with MAEPL, in which Mr. Mahesh’s family holds a majority. TVS Investments (TVSI) holds 59.84% in TVS Electronics, run by Gopal Srinivasan and family. The TVS Holding Companies hold 85% stake in TVSI. TVSI will merge into this family’s holding firm Geeyes Family Holdings Pvt. Ltd. (GFHPL) and the stake held by the TVS Holding companies will vest with GFHPL. The TS Rajam and TS Santhanam families would only have one holding firm each that would hold stakes in the companies they respectively manage. The TS Santhanam family’s holding company is Sundaram Santhanam & Family Pvt. Ltd. (SSFPL). The 29.69% of the TVS Holding Companies’ stake in Wheels India will vest with SSFPL. Brakes India is held partly by TVS & Sons, Southern Roadways and Sundaram Industries. Post merger of the holding firms, their entire holdings in Brakes India will move into TVS & Sons. Via the demerger, TVS & Sons’ holdings in Brakes India will come to the holding firm of Mr. Santhanam’s arm of the family, as would Sundaram Motors and Madras Auto Service, which are divisions within TVS & Sons. As per the arrangement, the tyre business, the TVS division of TVS & Sons and TVS Logistics would go to the TS Rajam family. At the end of the exercise, all shareholders of the TVS Holding Companies shall hold equity shares in the respective family arm’s holding firms, but the family which runs the business would own majority in the respective family holding firms. How was ‘fair value’ found? “There are so many factors and family history which go into it, so that linking the value of business to the settlement is impossible. It is not that the business value does not matter but it is just a lot more complicated,” the sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/a-look-at-the-tvs-groups-proposed-recast-of-holdings/article34009930.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Affordable housing finance unaffected’||Hinduja Leyland Finance, the non-banking finance company of the Hinduja Group, foresees double-digit growth in vehicle finance and is betting big on the housing finance front as it is on a growth path, chief executive officer Sachin Pillai said. Edited excerpts:  Have you reached pre-COVID levels in disbursements? In the asset classes, we have a presence, especially vehicle and housing finance. With the process of unlocking starting from June, we have seen sequential growth registering on a consistent basis. On a YTD basis, obviously the de-growth is still significant. However, we have seen a good bounce back in terms of confidence on the ground September onwards. The gap is narrowing and with continuance of the same trend we might see pre-COVID disbursements back in the first quarter of the next financial year. The mass passenger movement segment continues to be sluggish in line with the overall trend, and we do expect movement in this segment by the end of this quarter, especially with the vaccination drive in place and post that [when] relaxation of social distancing norms is expected. In housing finance, the last quarter was the best in terms of disbursements. The trends are continuing since January as well… the business is on a high growth trajectory. How was the performance for the last nine months? Our books at the end of nine months remained at the same levels of March 20. Margins have been better largely on account of softening of cost of funds. We have been able to drive operating efficiencies. Both put together have cushioned the effect of COVID provisions and enabled us to register growth of 10% in bottomline. While there is a standstill on NPAs on account of the Supreme Court order, on a proforma basis, NPAs have remained largely flat, with no restructuring done in the first nine months. How do you hope to end the year and meet the target for FY22? FY22 clearly seems to be a growth year. The economy is expected to grow in double digits, of course on a much lower current year base. We foresee a double-digit growth in disbursements in vehicle financing and housing finance businesses. Interest rates are expected to remain soft at least for a major part of the year and so will liquidity. We expect our books and profitability to grow by 20%. What is the status of your IPO? We are closely monitoring the market movements, especially NBFCs valuations. We will wait for the right window to emerge for considering listing. How are you managing your fund position? We are comfortable on liquidity with undrawn sanctions to the extent of four months of disbursements. Cost of funds have softened in this year by almost 50-75 bps. Our rating and outlook have remained unchanged during this period. Any update on affordable housing subsidiary? Affordable housing finance witnessed a faster bounce back among retail asset classes. Largely on account of this business being semi-urban/rural based, it was relatively unaffected as compared to urban cities as far as the pandemic is concerned. For us, we have presence in more than 500 locations and in the current year, we initiated our focus in the low-income housing finance segment, which hitherto we were not active in. We now manage Rs. 2,190 crore of assets in this business. Disbursements have grown at 21%, registering an overall book growth of 32% in the first nine months. We have registered a 62% growth in bottomline in the same period. The softening of borrowing cost, along with entry into the low-income housing finance segment, augured well for an uptick in margins. Operational efficiencies resulted in lower cost as well, cushioning the higher provision impact on account of COVID-related provisions. NPAs remain flat on a proforma basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/affordable-housing-finance-unaffected/article34009928.ece

07 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||India’s Irrepressibles maul the Three Lions, roar into WTC final||Washington Sundar ran out of partners to be left within touching distance of what should have been his maiden Test hundred in the morning session. But by the end of the day, the Chennai charmer was full of smiles, alongside his teammates, as India mauled England to not just win the series but also set up a World Test Championship title clash against New Zealand. Once Washington and Rishabh Pant had bailed India out of trouble at the Narendra Modi Stadium on the second evening, it was only going to be a matter of whether the weekend crowd would celebrate India’s win on Saturday or Sunday. Thanks to yet another accurate, potent spell from India’s spinners and a bizarre batting performance by England, India completed the formalities 42 minutes before the scheduled close of the third day’s play. Washington and Axar Patel’s 106-run partnership for the eighth wicket meant India stretched its first-innings lead to 160 before being bowled out for 365 just before lunch. R. Ashwin and Axar got into the act thereafter to bundle England out for 135 and register a thumping win by an innings and 25 runs to pocket the series 3-1. Two in two balls If England had to extend the game into the fourth day, it required a solid start to its second innings. With openers Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley having survived the three overs before the break, Ashwin was introduced into the attack upon resumption and he struck twice in his first over. Ashwin first induced a nick off Crawley’s blade to Ajinkya Rahane at slip. Off the next ball, Jonny Bairstow fell into the ‘leg trap’ for his third duck in four innings. Axar then ran through the middle-order, with first-innings top-scorer Ben Stokes sweeping the left-armer straight to leg gully. While Axar’s arm-balls were unplayable, Ashwin bamboozled the hapless England batsmen with his artistry. Since Ishant Sharma did not take the field due to pain in his left ankle, the spin twins shared 46.5 of the innings’ 54.5 overs. Barring Joe Root, who held the fort for more than an hour, only Dan Lawrence, batting at No. 7, offered any substantial resistance. But with no support from the other end, Lawrence (50) was the last man out, his heave against Ashwin resulting in the ball crashing into the stumps, giving the off-spinner his 30th five-wicket haul. Axar had earlier completed the fourth five-for of his maiden series, playing his part with the ball after having done his bit with bat. He was involved in a flawless partnership with Washington in the morning to bat England out of the game. While Axar rotated the strike, Washington carried on after starting the day on 60. When Washington was four runs short of the three-figure mark, Axar was late in recovering his ground after going for a non-existent single to be run out off the last ball of Root’s over. It took Stokes just four balls to see the back of Ishant and Mohammed Siraj and leave Washington agonisingly short.

Sindhu dished out a superlative performance to outclass Mia Blichfeldt of Denmark in straight games and enter the women's singles final of the Swiss Open Super 300 tournament here on Saturday. Sindhu beat fourth-seeded Blichfeldt 22-20, 21-10 in 43 minutes to avenge her first-round loss to the Danish World No. 12 at the Thailand Open in January. The second-seeded Indian will take on top seed and Rio Olympics gold medallist Carolina Marin in the final on Sunday. “Carolina is a good player so it won’t be an easy match, I have to play my 100%,” Sindhu said. Former champion K. Srikanth, however, couldn't cross the semifinal stage as he went down 13-21, 19-21 to top seed Viktor Axelsen. World No. 10 Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty also bowed out after losing 10-21, 17-21 to the sixth-seeded Danish pair of Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen in the last-four stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-in-final-srikanth-loses/article34009904.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||They out-skilled us: Root||England skipper Joe Root said he was disappointed with his team’s showing especially on the final day and praised Rishabh Pant, calling him a difficult batsman to bowl at. “It was disappointing but credit to India. They have out-skilled us. They have read the surface well, showed how to bat and were excellent with the ball as well. We just have to keep finding ways of getting better in similar conditions in the future,” said Root. “It was a frustrating way to finish this game. But credit to Rishabh and Washington [Sundar], that partnership was outstanding. The way he [Pant] bats makes it difficult for bowlers to build pressure, and to set fields as a captain is quite difficult when he pulls out a reverse sweep to a guy [James Anderson] with 600 wickets,” he added. Root also felt India exploited the conditions better and managed to grab the key moments in the game often, which proved decisive. “We did not react to changes in surfaces as well as India did. They exploited it better. They found ways of managing turn and non-turn better than we did. I do think there were periods in the game where we found ourselves at parity and India managed to grab them. Generally in low-scoring Test matches, that is a difference.”  The way he [Pant] bats makes it difficult for bowlers to build pressure||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/they-out-skilled-us-root/article34009913.ece
07 March 2021||Burnley,||Xhaka gaffe costs Arsenal||A dreadful defensive error from Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka gifted Burnley an equaliser as the sides drew 1-1 at Turf Moor in the Premier League on Saturday. Arsenal had taken a sixth minute lead when Willian ran at Burnley’s defence and fed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose low shot snuck in at the near. Mikel Arteta’s side looked comfortably in charge of the game until a shocking mistake six minutes before the break. Arsenal attempted to play the ball out from the back with keeper Bernd Leno passing to Xhaka deep in the penalty area, but the Swiss international’s attempted pass to David Luiz struck Clarets striker Chris Wood and ricocheted into the net.   The results:   Premier League: Burnley 1 (Wood 39) drew with Arsenal 1 (Aubameyang 6); Sheffield United 0 lost to Southampton 2 (Ward-Prowse 32-pen, Adams 49).   LaLiga: Real Valladolid 2 (Plano 14, Weissman 24) bt Getafe 1 (Mata 37).   Serie A: Spezia 1 (Verde 71) drew with Benevento 1 (Gaich 24).

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||NEUFC snatches late equaliser||NorthEast United FC found the equaliser off substitute Idrissa Sylla to hold ATK Mohun Bagan to a 1-1 draw in the first leg of the second semifinal of the ISL in Bambolim on Saturday. ATKMB led for a major part of the match, thanks to David Williams’ strike in the 34th minute. NorthEast, quite uncharacteristically, appeared a bit subdued in the attacking third as ATKMB’s defence did well to contain forwards — Federico Gallego and Luis Machado — well ahead of the striking zone. However, with injured striker Deshorn Brown missing the match, NEUFC’s attack lacked teeth. ATKMB breached NEUFC’s citadel in the 34th minute as a result of the fine understanding between Krishna and Williams. Krishna brought down a long floater on top of the NorthEast box and set up Williams with a short square pass. The Australian forward created the space by dislodging his marker with a body feint and fired an angular grounder that wrong-footed NorthEast goalkeeper Subhasish Roy. NorthEast came close to equalising in injury-time but Ashutosh Mehta’s header off a Gallego free-kick went off the crosspiece. However, Sylla found the target nodding home a Machado cross.  The result: NEUFC 1 (Idrissa Sylla 90+4) drew with ATKMB 1 (David Williams 34).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neufc-snatches-late-equaliser/article34009926.ece
07 March 2021||AHMEDABAD,||In sticky situations, somebody stood up for us : Ashwin||R. Ashwin, adjudged ‘Player of the Series’, was ecstatic about India’s qualification for the WTC final. “The WTC qualification is the result of the work we’ve put in over the last 10 years. The WTC was announced and we obviously really fought hard. We played six series and we've literally got most of the points. We have lost just three [sic: four] of the Tests in the cycle,” Ashwin said. “It means a lot to a lot of them in the dressing room. Some of them have not even played a World Cup. I'm so very happy for someone like Ishant Sharma, who got selected in the 2015 World Cup but couldn't play because of a last-minute injury. For someone like him to get to the WTC final would mean the world. I was reading somewhere that he called it the World Cup final for himself.” With 32 wickets and 189 runs, including a hundred, Ashwin’s performance was one of the talking points of the series. But when asked about the highlight of the series, he picked a team — not an individual — moment. “The way we came back in the second Test as a group, we found ourselves in some sticky situations in all these Tests and every time somebody has managed to stand up. That's related to how we have managed to bond as a team.”  The WTC qualification is the result of the work we’ve put in over the last 10 years||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/in-sticky-situations-somebody-stood-up-for-us-ashwin/article34009911.ece

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A diverse plate||With an impressive slate of content for 2021, Netflix looks set to build on the significant inroads it made during the pandemic year into the Indian OTT market. The streaming major recently announced an array of titles for this year, which include the Karan Johar-produced Ajeeb Daastaans , Sonakshi Sinha-starrer Bulbul Tarang , Dhamaka featuring Kartik Aaryan, and Chaitanya Tamhane’s The Disciple besides others. The Dhanush-starrer Jagame Thandhiram, and Mani Ratnam’s nine-film spectacle, Navarasa , which features names like Suriya, Parvathy Thiruvothu, Aditi Balan, Vijay Sethupathi, Siddharth, Arvind Swamy, Prakash Raj and Gautham Menon. This year will also see the return of a few popular web series like Delhi Crime , Mismatched , Jamtara and Masaba Masaba , besides originals like Finding Anamika , starring Madhuri Dixit, Decoupled featuring R. Madhavan and Aranyak with Raveena Tandon and Parambrata Chatterjee among others. In an interaction, Monika Shergill, Netflix India’s vice president — Content, remarks that the streaming platform is on “a very strong growth path” and that a big year awaits in 2021. “The kind of content we have put together... it is a full suite in every genre. We have headliner talent off and on screen, and we continue to support passionate creators to tell their best stories.”   Excerpts from an interview:  It’s quite a robust slate of films Netflix is offering audiences...  When you look at our slate, you will realise how strongly we feel about the audience in India — both current and potential members. Whichever country we are in, the goal is to be the definitive entertainment service.  We are seeing more diversity in the cast and crew as well with your increasing reach among regional audiences...   More than from a business perspective, we are looking at talent across India. And I would love it if when we talk to creators to script stories, for instance, from down South, then they make it for a national audience. We are one country with different tastes and languages, but talent coming from one region into the national space is something we should all be excited about. When opportunities are increasing and we are programming for a diverse slate, then you can’t just stick to the same people and the same way of doing things.  The newly notified Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, should be a thing of concern for you, isn’t it?   The important thing to note is that the goal of the government and that of the [digital streaming] industry is to do what is best for consumers and the creators.  Don’t you think self-regulation would have been a better option?   We have always believed in self-regulation. We have always approached our content the same way. If you see the service, the kind of information we display makes it easy for everyone to choose content that works for them. We have always had the rating of 7+, 13+, 16+, etc. We are in the process of understanding what the new guidelines are. However, streaming services are here to grow.  The extraordinary growth of OTT platforms last year resulted in a fractious relationship with theatres. Will it remain the same in 2021?   The relationship with theatres is not frictional but extremely collaborative. Films will continue to be available on streaming devices post-theatrical release, and the theatre business in India is robust. With audiences discovering films on streaming services and as we partner with theatres, it will bring in bigger business overall.  There is still some hesitation, however. Not too long ago, Dhanush — who is part of Netflix film The Gray Man , tweeted in support of a theatrical release for Jagame Thandhiram ...  There isn’t a talent from across the world that isn’t coming on Netflix at the moment. Extraction with Chris Hemsworth did smashingly well in India. We have stars like Gal Gadot, Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, Chris Evans, Ryan Gosling, Jason Momoa [etc.], and we are very proud to have Dhanush on The Gray Man and Jagame Thandhiram . The same talent will have great movies coming out in theatres as well as on Netflix. But the significant aspect is that it’s always ‘audience first’. They should get to enjoy the stories of their favourite stars, writers and directors wherever.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-diverse-plate/article34010162.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The myriad c o l o u r s of Mumbai||Three love stories, the past and present, fantasy and fact, reel and real weave a rich tapestry of stories in Gitanjali Rao’s animated film Bombay Rose . The 90-minute film is an ode to the metropolis and people; their dreams, disappointments, and determination to survive in the teeming city they call home. Releasing on Netflix, it is not only the first Indian animation feature to be picked up by the streaming platform, but also the first animation film to open the Critic’s Week at the Venice International Film Festival in 2019. It travelled to festivals in Toronto, London, and Busan and has been chosen for the 2021 Oscars. While telling the stories of the many characters in the film, Gitanjali brings in a range of issues faced by those living on the margins of society: child labour, poverty, trafficking, homelessness, gender issues and communal tensions. Over a phone call from Mumbai, Gitanjali says she was worried that the reality bytes would choke the film’s narrative. The characters were in her mind and the “struggle was to bring them together in a convincing manner”. “My way of working has always been to interweave stories. In animated films, it is a natural way of working, to go from one realm to another. It can be from the conscious to the dream-like state, from the past to the present and from one situation to a completely different one. So my storytelling comes from that. I can visualise my stories before I write the script,” she explains, adding that the project was three years in the making. City and its people True to the spirit of the city, the characters speak many languages and the songs reflect that plurality, right from the soulful song in Hindi to the smoky, foot-tapping ones in Goan Konkani and English. Gitanjali says that while staying in Bandra, she saw her characters: the flower sellers, the hustlers, the Anglo-Indian community. “Those scenes stayed with me. I wanted to show the different strata of society, classes and religions. If you live in Mumbai, inevitably there will be love stories, there will be stories about different religions and castes… If I take a double-decker bus around Mumbai, I would be looking into the lives and houses of people. I wanted that quality in my film,” she elaborates. She feels that when there is an attempt to divide people, the only way to protest is by celebrating the beauty and diversity. “So, in a way, the film also talks about all those things. There are layers and layers of politics in it,” she says. The seeds of the story were sown during a visit to Mandu in Madhya Pradesh, famous for its romantic fable of Baz Bahadur, the last sultan of Malwa, and Roopmati. Also keen on exploring the miniature painting heritage of Mandu, she decided to make Kamala, one of the characters, a native of Mandu. “When I get a story, the visuals come first. Kamala reaches Mumbai to escape from a hopeless situation. There is also the love story between Kamala and Salim, a migrant from Kashmir,” narrates Gitanjali. She points out that a storyboard comes first for her short films as well. In the case of a feature, she had to give a script while looking around for funding. “The feature film was tough because what I was seeing in my head had to be put down on paper. Prior to Bombay Rose , I had started working on Girgit , a short film. Since the producer had faith in me, I gave the script after the storyboard was over. But it is a very difficult way to work, especially when one is working with a team,” she explains. It is in the animatics stage that she sees the movie, when every shot, each mood and transition is in place. That is the blueprint of the film. She says that it becomes easier for her to “slide the stories into each other. Simultaneously, I would rework on the script”. Gitanjali also throws in a love story between two women as she pays a hat tip to the LGBTQIA+ community. “When we talk about a woman in love, there is an assumption that it has to be a man. I wanted to take on that assumption, in a gentle way,” she says. Meanwhile, Gitanjali has already started visualising her next film: one with nine cats and their lives.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-myriad-c-o-l-o-u-r-s-of-mumbai/article34010167.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Mother’s silence||What makes an epic timeless is its ability to draw parallels with the contemporary world, century after century. Author Madhavi S. Mahadevan recently unearthed one such parallel from The Mahabharata — in one story amid the myriad, interconnected ones she has long been familiar with — a parallel that gave birth to her latest book, Bride Of The Forest: The Untold Story Of Yayati’s Daughter (Westland). The book follows the life of Drishadvati aka Madhavi, the daughter of Yayati and one of the most trod-upon women in the intricate and complex epic. Possessing the ability to remain a virgin forever, Drishadvati has given birth to four royal heirs and future rulers, each of whom she had to leave behind with nary a second glance, once her work as the life-giver was done. The author explains how this storyline struck her more than most: “Anyone who has read the Mahabharata in totality is familiar with this story. Playwrights and short story writers have also picked up parts of this particular story. But when I realised that there was some connection to today’s reality of surrogacy, I started looking at the story differently. Was this the first example of commercial surrogacy to be found in the epics anywhere?” It took her eight months of added reading before she could piece together the entire story. She explains: “The characters in this story were generations before the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Which made it interesting, but also meant I had to look up information about all the characters, like Vishwamitra, Yayati, and Gaalav.” Considering Drishadvati’s abilities, it is hardly surprising that her story is dominated by men: men desperate for heirs, trapped in power struggles, blinded by ambition. In a way, the book’s language and often lofty tone of dialogue reflects this, but the chapters also reflect a host of other dynamics as well — from a Brahmin and Kshatriya clash of horns and a less than affectionate mother-daughter relationship, to a layered dynamic between father and child. Throughout all these interactions, however, what struck the author most about the character Drishadvati, was her silence, even while being passed on from king to king. “I wanted to understand what her silence was all about — it was speaking more than the few things she actually said,” muses Madhavi, “It was while exploring this silence that I started to understand what it could have meant, to be used like this. Even today, when it is a purely commercial arrangement, and the only ‘force’ that comes in is perhaps the need for money or dire straits, I feel there is pain in it, and this pain is silent.” Bride Of The Forest: The Untold Story Of Yayati’s Daughter is available at leading bookstores.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/mothers-silence/article34010168.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The Grey Plover in its breeding finery||While chirping with its Arctic neighbours — the Saamis, Nenets and Inuits — about climate change, the Grey Plover utilises the handle @blackbelliedplover. In its migratory range, it is @greyplover, wearing drab overalls — grey upperparts and white underparts with the chest speckled-grey. In early-September and end-of-March-to-early-May though, the adults among these birds would be draped (somewhere between partly and fully) in their breeding finery, despite being in the wintering grounds. The adult male’s cheek, neck, breast and belly would be the shade of a just-laid bituminous road. Hence Black-bellied Plover. The adult female would bear the shade of the same road after it had been subjected to a year of tyre-scuffing. During these times, birders in its migratory range, which includes Indian coastlines, including the Chennai coast, would hope to greet this bird of the mudflats. Contrasting sharply with most other plovers, this species does not display much of a flocking behaviour. The Grey Plover has its favourite sunbathing spots, the closest being Pulicat; even there, the species can come across as being thin on the ground, because it is not gregarious. On the eastern coastline, based on eBird records, mudflats at Adyar Estuary, Kelambakkam backwaters, Muttukadu backwaters, Mudhaliarkuppam backwaters, Nemmeli salt-pan area, Muttukadu backwaters and Odiyur may be quickly accessible spots where one could look for this species. A visit to Pulicat and Point Calimere may however be more conducive for a study of the species. A member of Madras Naturalists Society, Umesh Mani weighs in: “Grey Plovers do not come in large numbers; in contrast, Pacific Golden Plovers do. The last season, the regular flocks of Pacific Golden Plovers I saw at mudflats in Pulicat were in numbers of 50, 70 and 100, and the largest was something like 2,000 individuals. In comparison, the largest flock of Black-bellied Plovers I saw was 15 to 20 in a trip; and the regular flocks would be two or three individuals at a time.” It seems to be a leitmotif, repeated at most other coastal mudflat ecosystems. To give an example, birder Rama Neelamegan reports a sighting from Kelambakkam Backwaters that showed an almost similarly lopsided ratio, the scales heavily tipped in the favour of Pacific Golden Plover. The point is: Among the plovers, the Grey Plover is an outlier when it comes to gregariousness. Umesh illustrates it: “The sand plovers and ringed plovers are in groups, typically in mixed flocks. In contrast, the Grey Plovers are usually by themselves, unless they are roosting or getting together for reverse migration.” Over to Point Calimere with its BHNS Regional Migration Study Centre. “The Grey Plover is one of the uncommon birds, and every year we would ring 5 to 6 of them, with the upper limit at 10. When major projects were on, bird-ringing would happen round the year. With none under way now, ringing is restricted to a part of the bird migration season,” explains S. Balachandran, deputy director at the Centre. He points out that the overall sense one gets about the Grey Plover is that it has dwindled, something that could be said of all bird species dependent on mudflat ecosystems. “It is a global phenomenon; everywhere, coastal mudflats are dwindling. Stopover sites, during migratory birds’ southward passage or northward passage, are also shrinking. These issues are not restricted to India, but are global,” says Balachandran. “The Grey Plover is a largely a specialist bird, depending heavily on mudflats with their molluscs and crustaceans. Sometimes, they may opportunistically land in freshwater wetlands, but cannot get by on them. The Grey Plover is hugely coastal, found in coastal islands.” So clearly, there is no alternative to protecting coastal ecosystems for the sake of such species.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Teen reaches resources to underprivileged students||While on a visit to a government school as part of a field project, Upasana Ravikannan developed a first-hand understanding of the inequality in education. Two years later, she started a social initiative, GoPaadhai, which works around the objective of reaching educational resources to schools. Eighteen-year-old Upasana, who has cerebral palsy and is wheelchair bound, sees that her initiative is all set to take wider wings. She is among the 19 changemakers selected from 12 states for the second edition of the Ashoka Young Changemakers, a year-long programme that would equip her with the knowledge and perspective to find solutions to many other global challenges. “I was in Class IX and as part of Karthavyam, a diploma in public problem-solving initiative at HLC International, we went on a field visit to a government school. It was aimed at helping us understand the different challenges out there. The classrooms at the government school were as big as mine, but they were absolutely lacking in amenities,” says Upasana, who has brought out a storybook on waste management and also mobilised people to solve a waste-management problem, again as part of Karthavyam. The most poignant moment arrived when Upasana noticed that a group of children had left a puzzle incomplete on the floor. When she quizzed them about it, she was informed that many pieces were missing, and they would never be able to complete that puzzle. It was heartbreaking for Upasana to see children deprived of basic learning material. “The images of the school, children and my interactions never left me, and I used to discuss it with my music teacher, Seethalakshmi ma’am, who broadened my horizons and nudged me to do something about it,” says Upasana. Through the music teacher, she got to know Kanavu, an organisation that works with the ASSEFA Foundation in Kannaiarpet, Cuddalore. Upasana then turned to her gated community in Siruseri that helped her put her dreams into action. “I got permission to organise a road show to raise funds for Kanavu. I choose the Christmas get-together at the society to launch it. I even gave a talk at the event,” says Upasana, a resident of L&T Eden Park. That is the beginning of GoPaadhai’s journey. “We raised Rs. 15000 toward supporting a teacher training programme,” she says. Soon, her friends chipped in with their support. Arjun Mohan, for instance, who lives at Pelican Nest, a gated community in Thoraipakkam, volunteered to take the lead in another fundraising initiative for Kanavu. This time, they were looking for stationery and storybooks too. Here, they collected over Rs. 11000. Many other friends went door-to-door to raise funds. During the lockdown, Upasana received a request from InkLink Charitable Trust, which works with the underprivileged from Kannagi Nagar to raise funds to buy data cards so that the children could attend classes online. GoPaadhai volunteers again turned to their respective communities for donations; and now, the army of volunteers had increased. “In 2018, I had 10 friends helping me raise funds. The next year, it increased to 15 and now I have more than 20 people as volunteers, and some of them are grown-ups,” says Upasana. Deepa Som from L&T Eden Park is among those who helped mobilise support for her campaign among residents of the community. They raised approximately Rs. 20,000. Upasana and her friends are now working towards building resources for a school in Ramanathapuram. Currently in a gap year, Upasana and is spending the time at her disposal to volunteer at her alma mater , where she facilitates classes for grade 1 and 2 students in Mathematics and English. “HLC has played an important role in my daughter’s journey to become independent, emphatic and embrace an inclusive environment,” says her mother Aparna Ravikannan. Later, in July, Upasana will be enrolling for a bachelors programme in psychology at Ashoka University.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Quick off the block||All the 102 residents of Anandam Old Age Home in Ambattur have got vaccinated, with the last batch going through the process on March 6. At 95, P. Shankar Raman is the oldest to get the jab. “I barely felt the needle going into the muscle,” is what he has to say. Over the last week, the home was taking the residents in batches to the Corporation health centre at Venkatapuram in Ambattur for the vaccine shot. “I am happy and relieved that everything went on well, and am thankful to the supervisor Sundari and her staff for making this exercise a smooth for all the residents,” says Dr. G. Kamala, the in-house consultant at Anandam. The trip to the centre seemed to be an outing, as none of the residents had left the home since the outbreak of the pandemic, except for the 29 who were treated at Government Stanley Hospital after testing positive for COVID-19. Before being vaccinated, all the residents were informed about what it would do for them. “All the medical staff and the trustees have been vaccinated; and we shared our experience to boost their morale. Besides, they see us every day going about doing our work, after being vaccinated,” says Dr. Kamala. A day before the vaccination, hypertension and blood count were recorded. “For some seniors, the BP spiked as they waited for their turn; they were made to relax and sent only after a few others had returned,” she says. Those who are diabetic are prescribed their regular medicine and breakfast. A few hours after the injection, post-lunch, senior citizens were given a dose of Paracetamol. Says Dr. Kamala: “This is given as a precautionary measure, and those who had mild fever were given an additional dose.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/quick-off-the-block/article34010346.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||From trees to terra firma||Arboreal, the Asian Palm Civet and Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse are inclined to viewing their worlds along vertical lines. However in urban spaces, they tend towards adaptations without compromising on their essential nature. Mahathi Narayanaswamy, a resident of IIT-Madras who records the fauna and avifauna on the campus, draws attention to how now and then, a Palm Civet ( paradoxurus hermaphroditus) would invite itself to a terrace or balcony of a house (on the campus). The bolder ones — usually, the juveniles — would even attempt to decamp with vegetable peels.  With a proliferation of palm trees on the campus, Palm Civet presence is a given. However, even in this scenario, Palm Civet sightings will be received with surprise every time it happens. Says Preston Ahimaz, author of A Guide to Some Urban Fauna of India , and forest consultant for TVS Motor Company: “Palm Civets have this amazing ability to live completely unnoticed. They would be living right next to you and you would not know, unless you find a dropping or two somewhere.” However, this ability is being tested in urban spaces due to increasing density of human population and galloping development. With more buildings, they tend to set paw in human spaces, and be seen more often that they otherwise would be. “Palm Civets will be there provided you allow them to. They will use any abandoned place. For example, ventilators that are never used, with the niche on the outside. Arboreal, they would however want to be away from the ground. They will not roost or hang around on the ground. It has to be in an elevated place. They are used to being in the trees. So, any elevated place that is inaccessible and undisturbed is good enough for them.” The Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse ( vandeleuria oleracea) also looks for similar substitutes in high places, while in urban spaces, where it is hugely uncommon. Preston has had the experience of encountering a female Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse with her two babies, in the false ceiling of a building. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, a naturalist and a Madras Naturalists Society member, relates an episode involving this rodent, which sticks to trees until push comes to a headlong fall. Vikas narrates: “This mouse is not a pest, as it does not depend on what we eat. It is a completely wild species, not dependent on humans. However, it invited itself to our home in 2018. At that time, we were staying at Indira Nagar and the property had a mango tree whose branches were jutting into the house. Having fallen off the tree, it was clueless about getting back onto the tree, and came into the house. Inside, it went into the room that had a lot of wood furniture, and started climbing on everything. We managed to catch it, and when we released it on the ground, the first thing it did was go for the tree.”  Palm Civets have this amazing ability to live completely unnoticed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/from-trees-to-terra-firma/article34010363.ece

These features go a long way towards preventing accidents. However, around U-turns on this road, there are safety hazards. At a majority of these openings — 25 of them, to give a ballpark figure — motorists taking a U-turn usually do not have a clear view of oncoming vehicles. The vehicles move at a great speed and on a couple of occasions, I have been a witness to ‘near misses’. These ‘blind spots’ are to be addressed at the earliest. One suggestion is to install convex lens on all these spots thereby providing a clear view of oncoming vehicles. M.B.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Panchayat school in Pallikaranai in a sorry state||The premises of the St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union Middle School in Pallikaranai Kudiyirappu leaves a lot to be desired. Construction debris is dumped there. Breaking the door in a classroom, anti-social elements and tipplers make use of it. Stray cattle can be seen roaming around the premises. All of these things happen, because the school lacks a compound wall. The school authorities are unsure about the school’s boundaries; and they have riased this issue with the Assistant Educational Officer, Chennai; Block Development Officer (BDO) of St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union in Chitlappakkam, and Assistant Executive Engineer at Zone 14 office of Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). “Though the school comes under the control St. Thomas Mount Panchayat Union, the school’s location — Pallikaranai Kudiyirappu — is under the purview of GCC, which has constructed a wall in front of the school,” says a school staff on condition of anonymity. According to GCC officials from Zone 14, a portion of the area beyond the wall belongs to Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). Here, CMWSSB has constructed sewage treatment plants (STPs), where sewage from Mylai Balaji Nagar in Pallikaranai is treated, say GCC officials . In 2011, the Kancheepuram District Collectorate reportedly advised the erstwhile Pallikaranai Town Panchayat, which is now part of the Greater Chennai Corporation against setting up sewage treatment plants as a school was nearby. But Town Panchayat allowed CMWSSB to construct the STPs. GCC officials say they would make sure a compound wall was constructe, and that they would however need a permission letter from the BDO. Following this, they will get the field measurement book from the Surveyor, Taluk office and will do the needful. In the absence of a compound wall, a renovation work meant to be taken up by a non-governmental organisation is getting delayed. “There is absolutely no demarcated play area for children, although the area of the land assigned to the school is large by any standards. What needs to be done immediately is construction of a compound wall to protect the school premises from being misused by anti-social elements. If the actual boundaries of the land allocated to the school are known and the necessary permission is granted by the authorities, the compound wall can be constructed around the school. Further, the hall meant for noon meals is in a dilapidated state. It needs to be renovated. Years ago, the school had a strength of more than 400 students. Today, it is down to 150 students,” says the school staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/panchayat-school-in-pallikaranai-in-a-sorry-state/article34010355.ece

At last count, 60 per cent of the seniors who had registered for the vaccination got their jab. Impressed with the cleanliness and amenities at the PHC in Kelambakkam, 70-year-old R. Srikanth, a resident, spoke to the staff and doctor to find out if the PHC could give a slot for the residents to cut down on the waiting time. “Once I learnt it was possible, I circulated a note in the various WhatsApp groups about my audit of the PHC, and shared a form for those interested in getting a time slot,” says Srikanth. IT professional Sai Ram and Seshan Krishna Kumar from the gated community helped create a Google form as per the format required for registration with details like name, date of birth, PAN, Aadhar card number and address with pin code. “We circulated the online form on February 24 hoping to close it within two days but registrations kept coming in until February 28. A total of 122 people registered for the vaccination at the PHC,” says Srikanth, who is president of Rotary Club of Chennai Upscale and a polio-vaccination campaigner. The next step was grouping the registered members in such a manner that members of the same family would get their turn the same day. “Our objective was to have a process that helped both the PHC and residents and ensured there was no crowding at the Centre,” says Srikanth. “Each of us shared our experience, which was positive, in the community’s WhatsApp group, and this helped build confidence about the vaccine drive as well as the neighbourhood PHC, which many of us were visiting for the first time,” says Raghavan Murti, president of one of the towers.

If you do, then join hands with The Tongue Foundation which looks for support groups to create awareness about mother-child health, in Chennai. Founder of the non-profit The Tongue Foundation, Dr. Shifa Shamsudeen is establishing her first paediatric dental clinic, We Little, in Chennai soon, and she seeks to replicate the Foundation’s work in Coimbatore, where it has doctors, researchers and parents on board. “The Foundation informs the general public about how the tongue as a muscle is related closely to many other parts. It starts with breastfeeding, then goes on to teeth development, eating and breathing. It even has a link to cardio-vascular diseases,” says Dr. Shifa, who has earlier worked at various hospitals in Chennai. “We are trying to find an association between non-functioning tongue, hyperactive deficiency and attention deficiency,” she says, adding that the Foundation is collaborating with researchers and doctors, locally and globally, to initiate more research into the role of the tongue in breastfeeding. “Bottle feeding can cause narrow jaws and also narrow the wind pipe, eventually leading to disjointed teeth. We are trying to break this chain by creating awareness,” says Dr. Shifa, adding that the group used talks, workshops and seminars towards this end. “In the past we had associated with Coimbatore Parenting Network to conduct sessions regularly, but we need more people to help us take the Foundation’s activities forward,” she says. In Chennai, the Foundation wants parents’ groups to spearhead a campaign against bottle feeding, with support from them. “Or, if you stay in a gated community, invite us over for a talk,” she adds.

Twenty-five years ago, when Preston Ahimaz established his home in Madambakkam, long-time residents upheld this social practice. Enamoured of the Prestons’ garden, one family took this tradition a bit too far, stopping by the greenery almost every blooming day. It left Preston with a grin that has not shrunk a nanometre, to this day. “Black-naped Hares would come into our garden, nibbling on the grass and eating the flowerheads,” recalls Preston, author of A Guide to Some Urban Fauna of India and forest consultant for TVS Motor Company which has urban-forestry initiatives going at its factories. The garden visits continued for seven years, with the frequency steadily on the wane. However, when the visits stopped, there was a suddenness and finality, akin to what is felt when an overheated engine shuts off mid-journey. “You do not see them here anymore, because the area has been completely built-up,” says a disappointed Preston. For his part, he still makes the mammals and creepy-crawlies feel welcome — to the point of leaving his house unprotected by a compound wall, and one ground in the three-ground plot completely vacant. The Black-naped Hare ( Lepus nigricollis) however had left the region never to return. It is by no means a singular experience. What was once a common occurrence within the city seems almost totally restricted to isolated and protected pockets. “Any area that is not disturbed and which has some scrubland around, would have the Black-naped Hare. You get to see it at Madras Christian College - Tambaram, Nanmangalam Reserve Forest, Guindy National Park and IIT-Madras,” Preston illustrates. However, in localities organically suited to support Black-naped Hare populations, the species is largely a will-o’-the-wisp, leaving just a hazy trail, and remaining largely unseen. “In 2017, along the tracks of the MRTS line, at ground-level, in Velachery, I saw the scat of the Black-naped Hare. The species should be found around that region even now. In places characterised by scrublands and grasslands, you should find the Black-naped Hare,” M. Yuvan, naturalist and author of A Naturalist’s Journal , stays hopeful. Though the Black-naped Hare may be readily associated with scrublands, Preston touches upon the species occurrence data that shows it to be “not very habitat-specific”. To illustrate, it ranges around densely forested tracts as well as coastal regions marked by wide open spaces, as instantiated by their presence in Top Slips and Pulicat, respectively. “A cosmopolitan species and not very habitat-specific, they can manage in any kind of habitat as long as there is some living space. However, if there is constant human pressure and presence, they will vanish,” says Preston. “Along the coast, on East Coast Road, wherever there are open patches of land with some vegetation, you will find the Black-naped Hare.” Conceding that open land set aside for housing and agriculture is bound to give way to development sooner or later and one cannot argue about it, Preston emphasises that conserving the species would mean ensuring that areas designated as “protected” continue with that status. As a warning, he conjures up a situation just because it is too ridiculous to be entertained in thought, let alone scripted into reality. “You cannot breed hares in captivity — what is the point of it? Hares are prolific and will increase on their own. Just give them their habitat,” explains Preston. The call of the jackal There is a distinct timbre to a jackal’s howl distinguishing it from a dog’s. Of course, residents of localities within Chennai’s metropolitan area may still mistake it for a dog’s, as most people in Chennai’s urban and even semi-urban spaces, expect a jackal at their gates. Besides, for this majority, a symphony of howling jackals remains unheard. “In different places, you hear the howls of the Golden Jackal ( canis aureus) , at night. You would, in sections of Thoraipakkam and deep into Perungudi. Not many years ago, I would hear its howl in Baby Nagar, Velachery, in the evening and at night, when this section was undisturbed. That was before Perungudi Station Road was connected to the main road,” reveals Yuvan. On the urban-adaptability quotient, the Golden Jackal trumps the Black-naped Hare by a long bushy tail. “Unlike the Black-naped Hare, the Golden Jackal can live even in semi-urban areas, as they scavenge in garbage dumps” for a variety of leftovers that suits its eclectic diet plan, says Preston. In contrast, “the Black-naped Hare cannot live off humans except for some vegetable waste.” Though better adapted and nocturnal, the Golden Jackal would baulk at an environment marked by huge disturbances, in terms of human and canine presence. Preston underlines that when these two factors in check, the Golden Jackal thrives. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, naturalist and member of Madras Naturalists’ Society, recalls his first memory of a Golden Jackal sighting in an urban environment, as one in which a pack of stray dogs were hot on the heels of a terrified jackal. “On the campus of the SSN college on Old Mahabalipuram Road, I have heard jackals howling. On the outskirts, around Mahabalipuram, there are many Golden Jackals — from Kelambakkam onwards, the possibility of a Golden Jackal sighting increases. There are just open grounds, and the possibility of them being driven by stray dogs is low,” adds Vikas. As dogs and jackals belong to the same family ( canidae ) and sub-family ( caninae ), any diseases harboured by the former can be transferred to jackals. Yuvan says mange-ridden Golden Jackals in urban spaces are not uncommon. As with the Black-naped Hare, protected areas hold out hope for the Golden Jackal. “At Guindy National Park (GNP), I would have seen 15 individuals. I would be on the road, and they would be sitting there; they would not run away on seeing you,” says Vikas, who would frequent GNP through 2016 as part of a special wildlife study project. “The Theosophical Society also has a Golden Jackal population; and I have seen a pack of five.” Yuvan points out that MCC Tambaram should be having a healthy population of Golden Jackals. Grey facts When was the last time you ran into the Indian Grey Mongoose ( Herpestes edwardsi) ? “I have not seen the Indian Grey Mongoose in a very long time, and they used to be very common in and around Madambakkam. It is a question of the human juggernaut pushing away wildlife,” says Preston. Yuvan weighs in: “The Indian Grey Mongoose’s ecological role is important, and it is fading away from the urban spaces. In front of my house, at Baby Nagar in Velachery, I had seen a mongoose pair with babies, and now with the thicket removed due to a construction, this mongoose family is gone too. Currently, in pockets and places with less noise, the Indian Grey Mongoose would definitely be present. It feeds on reptiles, famously snakes, and on smaller rodents, and birds. Being a predator, it plays a crucial role in the food chain. We have to preserve habitats and leave thickets alone wherever we should and can, to keep this species in our midst.”  Unlike the Black-naped Hare, the Golden Jackal can live even in semi-urban areas, as they scavenge in garbage dumps||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/shaking-paws-with-five-mammals-in-urban-chennai/article34010362.ece

Balachandran, deputy director of BHNS Regional Migration Study Centre has regaled generations of bird-enthusiasts with. The memory is sufficiently fresh from the mudflats of Point Calimere for Blachandran to not call it up again: “In January 1989, we made a recovery of a Grey Plover, one that had been ringed in Kazakhstan three to four months back in September while it had made a pitstop there en route to its wintering grounds. When we recaptured this bird at Point Calimere in the first month of 1989, the Centre had a guest: Soviet bird scientist Prof. Gavrilov. Studying the details of the ring, Gavrilov was beside himself with excitement. The bird was from the erstwhile Soviet Union (which Kazakhstan was a part of) and wonder of wonders, he had ringed the bird himself. It was as if he was chasing the bird all the way to its wintering grounds.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/scientist-follows-bird-from-kazakhstan-to-indian-coast/article34010368.ece

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Shaking paws with five mammals in urban Chennai||There is the tradition — now scarcely followed — of neighbours calling on a family that has just moved in. Twenty-five years ago, when Preston Ahimaz established his home in Madambakkam, long-time residents upheld this social practice. Enamoured of the Prestons’ garden, one family took this tradition a bit too far, stopping by the greenery almost every blooming day. It left Preston with a grin that has not shrunk a nanometre, to this day. “Black-naped Hares would come into our garden, nibbling on the grass and eating the flowerheads,” recalls Preston, author of A Guide to Some Urban Fauna of India and forest consultant for TVS Motor Company which has urban-forestry initiatives going at its factories. The garden visits continued for seven years, with the frequency steadily on the wane. However, when the visits stopped, there was a suddenness and finality, akin to what is felt when an overheated engine shuts off mid-journey. “You do not see them here anymore, because the area has been completely built-up,” says a disappointed Preston. For his part, he still makes the mammals and creepy-crawlies feel welcome — to the point of leaving his house unprotected by a compound wall, and one ground in the three-ground plot completely vacant. The Black-naped Hare ( Lepus nigricollis) however had left the region never to return. It is by no means a singular experience. What was once a common occurrence within the city seems almost totally restricted to isolated and protected pockets. “Any area that is not disturbed and which has some scrubland around, would have the Black-naped Hare. You get to see it at Madras Christian College - Tambaram, Nanmangalam Reserve Forest, Guindy National Park and IIT-Madras,” Preston illustrates. However, in localities organically suited to support Black-naped Hare populations, the species is largely a will-o’-the-wisp, leaving just a hazy trail, and remaining largely unseen. “In 2017, along the tracks of the MRTS line, at ground-level, in Velachery, I saw the scat of the Black-naped Hare. The species should be found around that region even now. In places characterised by scrublands and grasslands, you should find the Black-naped Hare,” M. Yuvan, naturalist and author of A Naturalist’s Journal , stays hopeful. Though the Black-naped Hare may be readily associated with scrublands, Preston touches upon the species occurrence data that shows it to be “not very habitat-specific”. To illustrate, it ranges around densely forested tracts as well as coastal regions marked by wide open spaces, as instantiated by their presence in Top Slips and Pulicat, respectively. “A cosmopolitan species and not very habitat-specific, they can manage in any kind of habitat as long as there is some living space. However, if there is constant human pressure and presence, they will vanish,” says Preston. “Along the coast, on East Coast Road, wherever there are open patches of land with some vegetation, you will find the Black-naped Hare.” Conceding that open land set aside for housing and agriculture is bound to give way to development sooner or later and one cannot argue about it, Preston emphasises that conserving the species would mean ensuring that areas designated as “protected” continue with that status. As a warning, he conjures up a situation just because it is too ridiculous to be entertained in thought, let alone scripted into reality. “You cannot breed hares in captivity — what is the point of it? Hares are prolific and will increase on their own. Just give them their habitat,” explains Preston. The call of the jackal There is a distinct timbre to a jackal’s howl distinguishing it from a dog’s. Of course, residents of localities within Chennai’s metropolitan area may still mistake it for a dog’s, as most people in Chennai’s urban and even semi-urban spaces, expect a jackal at their gates. Besides, for this majority, a symphony of howling jackals remains unheard. “In different places, you hear the howls of the Golden Jackal ( canis aureus) , at night. You would, in sections of Thoraipakkam and deep into Perungudi. Not many years ago, I would hear its howl in Baby Nagar, Velachery, in the evening and at night, when this section was undisturbed. That was before Perungudi Station Road was connected to the main road,” reveals Yuvan. On the urban-adaptability quotient, the Golden Jackal trumps the Black-naped Hare by a long bushy tail. “Unlike the Black-naped Hare, the Golden Jackal can live even in semi-urban areas, as they scavenge in garbage dumps” for a variety of leftovers that suits its eclectic diet plan, says Preston. In contrast, “the Black-naped Hare cannot live off humans except for some vegetable waste.” Though better adapted and nocturnal, the Golden Jackal would baulk at an environment marked by huge disturbances, in terms of human and canine presence. Preston underlines that when these two factors in check, the Golden Jackal thrives. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, naturalist and member of Madras Naturalists’ Society, recalls his first memory of a Golden Jackal sighting in an urban environment, as one in which a pack of stray dogs were hot on the heels of a terrified jackal. “On the campus of the SSN college on Old Mahabalipuram Road, I have heard jackals howling. On the outskirts, around Mahabalipuram, there are many Golden Jackals — from Kelambakkam onwards, the possibility of a Golden Jackal sighting increases. There are just open grounds, and the possibility of them being driven by stray dogs is low,” adds Vikas. As dogs and jackals belong to the same family ( canidae ) and sub-family ( caninae ), any diseases harboured by the former can be transferred to jackals. Yuvan says mange-ridden Golden Jackals in urban spaces are not uncommon. As with the Black-naped Hare, protected areas hold out hope for the Golden Jackal. “At Guindy National Park (GNP), I would have seen 15 individuals. I would be on the road, and they would be sitting there; they would not run away on seeing you,” says Vikas, who would frequent GNP through 2016 as part of a special wildlife study project. “The Theosophical Society also has a Golden Jackal population; and I have seen a pack of five.” Yuvan points out that MCC Tambaram should be having a healthy population of Golden Jackals. Grey facts When was the last time you ran into the Indian Grey Mongoose ( Herpestes edwardsi) ? “I have not seen the Indian Grey Mongoose in a very long time, and they used to be very common in and around Madambakkam. It is a question of the human juggernaut pushing away wildlife,” says Preston. Yuvan weighs in: “The Indian Grey Mongoose’s ecological role is important, and it is fading away from the urban spaces. In front of my house, at Baby Nagar in Velachery, I had seen a mongoose pair with babies, and now with the thicket removed due to a construction, this mongoose family is gone too. Currently, in pockets and places with less noise, the Indian Grey Mongoose would definitely be present. It feeds on reptiles, famously snakes, and on smaller rodents, and birds. Being a predator, it plays a crucial role in the food chain. We have to preserve habitats and leave thickets alone wherever we should and can, to keep this species in our midst.”  Unlike the Black-naped Hare, the Golden Jackal can live even in semi-urban areas, as they scavenge in garbage dumps||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/shaking-paws-with-five-mammals-in-urban-chennai/article34010384.ece

At last count, 80 per cent of the seniors who had registered for the vaccination got their jab. Impressed with the cleanliness and amenities at the PHC in Kelambakkam, 70-year-old R. Srikanth, a resident, spoke to the staff and doctor to find out if the PHC could give a slot for the residents to cut down on the wiating time. “Once I learnt it was possible, I circulated a note in the various WhatsApp groups about my audit of the PHC, and shared a form for those interested in getting a time slot,” says Srikanth. IT professional Sai Ram and Seshan Krishna Kumar from the gated community helped create a Google form as per the format required for registration with details like name, date of birth, PAN, Aadhar card number and address with pin code. “We circulated the online form on February 24 hoping to close it within two days but registrations kept coming in until February 28. A total of 122 people registered for the vaccination at the PHC,” says Srikanth, who is president of Rotary Club of Chennai Upscale and a polio-vaccination campaigner. The next step was grouping the registered members in such a manner that members of the same family would get their turn the same day. “Our objective was to have a process that helped both the PHC and residents and ensured there was no crowding at the Centre,” says Srikanth. “Each of us shared our experience, which was positive, in the community’s WhatsApp group, and this helped build confidence about the vaccine drive as well as neighbourhood PHC, which many of us were visiting for the first time,” says Raghavan Murti, president of one of the towers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/getting-the-jab-done/article34010385.ece

If you do, then join hands with The Tongue Foundation which looks for support groups to create awareness about mother-child health, in Chennai. Founder of the non-profit The Tongue Foundation, Dr. Shifa Shamsudeen is establishing her first paediatric dental clinic, We Little, in Chennai soon, and she seeks to replicate the Foundation’s work in Coimbatore, where it has doctors, researchers and parents on board. “The Foundation informs the general public about how the tongue as a muscle is related closely to many other parts. It starts with breastfeeding, then goes on to teeth development, eating and breathing. It even has a link to cardio-vascular diseases,” says Dr. Shifa, who has earlier worked at various hospitals in Chennai. “We are trying to find an association between non-functioning tongue, hyperactive deficiency and attention deficiency,” she says, adding that the Foundation is collaborating with researchers and doctors, locally and globally, to initiate more research into the role of the tongue in breastfeeding. “Bottle feeding can cause narrow jaws and also narrow the wind pipe, eventually leading to disjointed teeth. We are trying to break this chain by creating awareness,” says Dr. Shifa, adding that the group used talks, workshops and seminars towards this end. “In the past we had associated with Coimbatore Parenting Network to conduct sessions regularly, but we need more people to help us take the Foundation’s activities forward,” she says. In Chennai, the Foundation wants parents’ groups to spearhead a campaign against bottle feeding, with support from them. “Or, if you stay in a gated community, invite us over for a talk,” she adds.

Engineering College in Thiruverkadu on Avadi – Poonamallee High Road (SH-55) is entering the final stretch. The decades-old bridge collapsed in the 2015 floods cutting off many big neighbourhoods, including Thiruverkadu, Poonamallee, Avadi, Thirunindravur, Pattabiram and Tiruvallur from the rest of Chennai. The bridge is high up on the list of much-awaited projects, as the five-kilometre-long stretch is the shortest route for goods-laden lorries and other container trucks from the industrial units in Irungattukottai, Sriperumbudur, Oragadam on Chennai – Bangalore Highway (NH-04) to reach the Kolkata Highway (NH-05) via the Chennai – Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road. Many residential apartment complexes are being constructed on the stretch due to affordable housing and lower pollution levels. “The early completion of the bridge would likely clear the traffic chaos at the temporary carriageway near the under-construction bridge,” says V. Ramesh, a motorist from Thiruver0kadu. At present, motorists use the temporary carriageway near the under-construction bridge across the river. The pathway does not have street lights, sidewalls, reflectors and warning signboards. Motorists have to take a narrow bend from the pathway to reach the main carriageway once they cross the river. As per the project plan, the new two-lane bridge work has been taken up under the Comprehensive Road Infrastructure Development Programme (CRIDP) by the Tiruvallur division of the State Highways Department at a cost of around Rs. 5 crore. Initially, the work was proceeding at a fast clip; bunds were created to block the flow of water on the Cooum river. Huge concrete cement pipes were used to allow the river water to flow slowly across the low-level bridge. An alternative pathway was created across the river to divert the existing traffic. “The entire bridge work will be completed in the next few months,” says a State Highways official.  The early completion of the bridge will ease traffic chaos on the temporary carriageway near the under-construction bridge||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/work-on-bridge-in-thiruverkadu-to-be-completed-in-the-next-few-months/article34010383.ece

Two years later, she started a social initiative, GoPaadhai, which works around the objective of reaching educational resources to schools. Eighteen-year-old Upasana, who has cerebral palsy and is wheelchair bound, sees that her initiative is all set to take wider wings. She is among the 19 changemakers selected from 12 states for the second edition of the Ashoka Young Changemakers, a year-long programme that would equip her with the knowledge and perspective to find solutions to many other global challenges. “I was in Class IX and as part of Karthavyam, a diploma in public problem-solving initiative at HLC International, we went on a field visit to a government school. It was aimed at helping us understand the different challenges out there. The classrooms at the government school were as big as mine, but they were absolutely lacking in amenities,” says Upasana, who has brought out a storybook on waste management and also mobilised people to solve a waste-management problem, again as part of Karthavyam. The most poignant moment arrived when Upasana noticed that a group of children had left a puzzle incomplete on the floor. When she quizzed them about it, she was informed that many pieces were missing, and they would never be able to complete that puzzle. It was heartbreaking for Upasana to see children deprived of basic learning material. “The images of the school, children and my interactions never left me, and I used to discuss it with my music teacher, Seethalakshmi ma’am, who broadened my horizons and nudged me to do something about it,” says Upasana. Through the music teacher, she got to know Kanavu, an organisation that works with the ASSEFA Foundation in Kannaiarpet, Cuddalore. Upasana then turned to her gated community in Siruseri that helped her put her dreams into action. “I got permission to organise a road show to raise funds for Kanavu. I choose the Christmas get-together at the society to launch it. I even gave a talk at the event,” says Upasana, a resident of L&T Eden Park. That is the beginning of GoPaadhai’s journey. “We raised Rs. 15000 toward supporting a teacher training programme,” she says. Soon, her friends chipped in with their support. Arjun Mohan, for instance, who lives at Pelican Nest, a gated community in Thoraipakkam, volunteered to take the lead in another fundraising initiative for Kanavu. This time, they were looking for stationery and storybooks too. Here, they collected over Rs. 11000. Many other friends went door-to-door to raise funds. During the lockdown, Upasana received a request from InkLink Charitable Trust, which works with the underprivileged from Kannagi Nagar to raise funds to buy data cards so that the children could attend classes online. GoPaadhai volunteers again turned to their respective communities for donations; and now, the army of volunteers had increased. “In 2018, I had 10 friends helping me raise funds. The next year, it increased to 15 and now I have more than 20 people as volunteers, and some of them are grown-ups,” says Upasana. Deepa Som from L&T Eden Park is among those who helped mobilise support for her campaign among residents of the community. They raised approximately Rs. 20,000. Upasana and her friends are now working towards building resources for a school in Ramanathapuram. Currently in a gap year, Upasana and is spending the time at her disposal to volunteer at her alma mater , where she facilitates classes for grade 1 and 2 students in Mathematics and English. “HLC has played an important role in my daughter’s journey to become independent, emphatic and embrace an inclusive environment,” says her mother Aparna Ravikannan. Later, in July, Upasana will be enrolling for a bachelors programme in psychology at Ashoka University.

Motorcyclists blame the culvert work taken up by the State Highways Department three months ago for the uncleared bitumen lying on the road. Traffic police perosnnel point out that accidents including minor ones are being reported from this damaged carriageway, especially at night, as motorcyclists are unable to see the stretch clearly. The culvert work was a major monsoon-preparedness measure by the Department that it undertook after widening the stormwater drains on the stretch last year. “The blue metal lying all over the damaged portion exposes motorcyclists to skidding accidents at night. The stretch should be relaid with other safety measures like zebra markings reflectors to ensure all road users’ safety,” says K. Prakash, a motorist from Puzhal. Six culverts have been built on Surapet Main Road. At Oragadam, the damaged portion of the stretch on the new culvert was not even levelled properly after the work was carried out — blue metal was just spread across it. Over the last few months, movement of vehicles has made the damaged portion even more uneven with the blue metal spillin onto the carriageway. The stretch has turned slippery due to sudden showers. The Oragadam junction is the key traffic point on the 8-km-long Surapet Main Road that connects Ambattur with Puzhal near the Central Prison there. “Steps will be taken to have the damaged portion of the stretch relaid soon,” says an official of the State Highways Department.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||From trees to terra firma||Arboreal, the Asian Palm Civet and Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse are inclined to viewing their worlds along vertical lines. However in urban spaces, they tend towards adaptations without compromising on their essential nature. Mahathi Narayanaswamy, a resident of IIT-Madras who records the fauna and avifauna on the campus, draws attention to how now and then, a Palm Civet ( paradoxurus hermaphroditus) would invite itself to a terrace or balcony of a house (on the campus). The bolder ones — usually, the juveniles — would even attempt to decamp with vegetable peels.  With a proliferation of palm trees on the campus, Palm Civet presence is a given. However, even in this scenario, Palm Civet sightings will be received with surprise every time it happens. Says Preston Ahimaz, author of A Guide to Some Urban Fauna of India , and forest consultant for TVS Motor Company: “Palm Civets have this amazing ability to live completely unnoticed. They would be living right next to you and you would not know, unless you find a dropping or two somewhere.” However, this ability is being tested in urban spaces due to increasing density of human population and galloping development. With more buildings, they tend to set paw in human spaces, and be seen more often that they otherwise would be. “Palm Civets will be there provided you allow them to. They will use any abandoned place. For example, ventilators that are never used, with the niche on the outside. Arboreal, they would however want to be away from the ground. They will not roost or hang around on the ground. It has to be in an elevated place. They are used to being in the trees. So, any elevated place that is inaccessible and undisturbed is good enough for them.” The Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse ( vandeleuria oleracea) also looks for similar substitutes in high places, while in urban spaces, where it is hugely uncommon. Preston has had the experience of encountering a female Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse with her two babies, in the false ceiling of a building. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, a naturalist and a Madras Naturalists Society member, relates an episode involving this rodent, which sticks to trees until push comes to a headlong fall. Vikas narrates: “This mouse is not a pest, as it does not depend on what we eat. It is a completely wild species, not dependent on humans. However, it invited itself to our home in 2018. At that time, we were staying at Indira Nagar and the property had a mango tree whose branches were jutting into the house. Having fallen off the tree, it was clueless about getting back onto the tree, and came into the house. Inside, it went into the room that had a lot of wood furniture, and started climbing on everything. We managed to catch it, and when we released it on the ground, the first thing it did was go for the tree.”  Palm Civets have this amazing ability to live completely unnoticed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/from-trees-to-terra-firma/article34010387.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||It is almost time to spot the Grey Plover in its breeding finery||While chirping with its Arctic neighbours — the Saamis, Nenets and Inuits — about climate change, the Grey Plover utilises the handle @blackbelliedplover. In its migratory range, it is @greyplover, wearing drab overalls — grey upperparts and white underparts with the chest speckled-grey. In early-September and end-of-March-to-early-May though, the adults among these birds would be draped (somewhere between partly and fully) in their breeding finery, despite being in the wintering grounds. The adult male’s cheek, neck, breast and belly would be the shade of a just-laid bituminous road. Hence Black-bellied Plover. The adult female would bear the shade of the same road after it had been subjected to a year of tyre-scuffing. During these times, birders in its migratory range, which includes Indian coastlines, including the Chennai coast, would hope to greet this bird of the mudflats. Contrasting sharply with most other plovers, this species does not display much of a flocking behaviour. The Grey Plover has its favourite sunbathing spots, the closest being Pulicat; even there, the species can come across as being thin on the ground, because it is not gregarious. On the eastern coastline, based on eBird records, mudflats at Adyar Estuary, Kelambakkam backwaters, Muttukadu backwaters, Mudhaliarkuppam backwaters, Nemmeli salt-pan area, Muttukadu backwaters and Odiyur may be quickly accessible spots where one could look for this species. A visit to Pulicat and Point Calimere may however be more conducive for a study of the species. A member of Madras Naturalists Society, Umesh Mani weighs in: “Grey Plovers do not come in large numbers; in contrast, Pacific Golden Plovers do. The last season, the regular flocks of Pacific Golden Plovers I saw at mudflats in Pulicat were in numbers of 50, 70 and 100, and the largest was something like 2,000 individuals. In comparison, the largest flock of Black-bellied Plovers I saw was 15 to 20 in a trip; and the regular flocks would be two or three individuals at a time.” It seems to be a leitmotif, repeated at most other coastal mudflat ecosystems. To give an example, birder Rama Neelamegan reports a sighting from Kelambakkam Backwaters that showed an almost similarly lopsided ratio, the scales heavily tipped in the favour of Pacific Golden Plover. The point is: Among the plovers, the Grey Plover is an outlier when it comes to gregariousness. Umesh illustrates it: “The sand plovers and ringed plovers are in groups, typically in mixed flocks. In contrast, the Grey Plovers are usually by themselves, unless they are roosting or getting together for reverse migration.” Over to Point Calimere with its BHNS Regional Migration Study Centre. “The Grey Plover is one of the uncommon birds, and every year we would ring 5 to 6 of them, with the upper limit at 10. When major projects were on, bird-ringing would happen round the year. With none under way now, ringing is restricted to a part of the bird migration season,” explains S. Balachandran, deputy director at the Centre. There is a fascinating Grey Plover-ringing episode from 1989 that Balachandran has regaled generations of bird-enthusiasts with. The memory is sufficiently fresh from the mudflats of Point Calimere for Blachandran to not call it up again: “In January 1989, we made a recovery of a Grey Plover, one that had been ringed in Kazakhstan three to four months back in September while it had made a pitstop there en route to its wintering grounds. When we recaptured this bird at Point Calimere in the first month of 1989, the Centre had a guest: Soviet bird scientist Prof. Gavrilov. Studying the details of the ring, Gavrilov was beside himself with excitement. The bird was from the erstwhile Soviet Union (which Kazakhstan was a part of) and wonder of wonders, he had ringed the bird himself. It was as if he was chasing the bird all the way to its wintering grounds.” He points out that the overall sense one gets about the Grey Plover is that it has dwindled, something that could be said of all bird species dependent on mudflat ecosystems. “It is a global phenomenon; everywhere, coastal mudflats are dwindling,” says Balachandran. “The Grey Plover is a largely specialist bird, depending heavily on mudflats with their molluscs and crustaceans. Sometimes, they may opportunistically land in freshwater wetlands, but cannot get by on them. The Grey Plover is hugely coastal, found in coastal islands.” So clearly, there is no alternative to protecting coastal ecosystems for the sake of such species.

At 95, P. Shankar Raman is the oldest to get the jab. “I barely felt the needle going into the muscle,” is what he has to say. Over the last week, the home was taking the residents in batches to the Corporation health centre at Venkatapuram in Ambattur for the vaccine shot. “I am happy and relieved that everything went on well, and am thankful to the supervisor Sundari and her staff for making this exercise a smooth for all the residents,” says Dr. G. Kamala, the in-house consultant at Anandam. The trip to the centre seemed to be an outing, as none of the residents had left the home since the outbreak of the pandemic, except for the 29 who were treated at Government Stanley Hospital after testing positive for COVID-19. Before being vaccinated, all the residents were informed about what it would do for them. “All the medical staff and the trustees have been vaccinated; and we shared our experience to boost their morale. Besides, they see us every day going about doing our work, after being vaccinated,” says Dr. Kamala. A day before the vaccination, hypertension and blood count were recorded. “For some seniors, the BP spiked as they waited for their turn; they were made to relax and sent only after a few others had returned,” she says. Those who are diabetic are prescribed their regular medicine and breakfast. A few hours after the injection, post-lunch, senior citizens were given a dose of Paracetamol. Says Dr. Kamala: “This is given as a precautionary measure, and those who had mild fever were given an additional dose.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/quick-off-the-block/article34010386.ece

If you have nor, it is zebra markings. While speed breakers in the hospital zone towards Thirumullavoyal have been painted with zebra markings, the stretch towards Rakki theatre complex seems to have missed out on this essential feature. State Highways Department that maintains the stretch has installed LED Street lights and constructed speed breakers, but the latter have come without the red and white stripes. “Often, motorists slam on the brakes at the last moment on seeing the speed breakers. Sometimes, we miss our balance,” says S. Pavan, a motorist from Ambattur.  As it is, this stretch is busy with outpatients, relatives of in-patients and other pedestrians frequenting the hospital. With an almost-continuous flow of vehicles along the stretch, there is an element of risk attached to walking across this section. Here, traffic police personnel are a rare sight. And then, motorists sometimes miss the oncoming traffic due to the location of a high mast lamp.  “Steps will be taken to paint zebra markings on the speed breakers in the hospital zone soon,” says a State Highways official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/zebra-markings-missing-on-speed-breakers-in-hospital-zone/article34010376.ece

With a gym spread over 1,200 sq.ft as the latest addition, the playground at Anna Nagar Western Extension would be registering more footfall. Due to the persistent efforts taken by residents of the locality, officials of Greater Chennai Corporation’s (GCC) Zone 9 agreed to establish a gym. Its timings are yet to be decided upon, a decision that reportedly would be taken by GCC in consultation with representatives of Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents Welfare Association. After a year, during which it will be maintained by the civic body, the gym’s maintenance will handed over to the RWA. The modern gym was built at a cost of Rs. 20 lakh with funds from the Ambattur MLA Local Development Funds (MLALDF); it has separate facilities for men, women and children. Solar panels have also been installed to provide green energy to the new facility. On an average, a Corporation official says, more than 20 persons can work out at the gym, at the same time. “A gym at the playground was a long-standing demand of residents as many youngsters go to privately-run gyms,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase II Residents Welfare Association. The playground, which sprawls across 5.33 acres, is one of the biggest in the neighbourhood and draws people from Villivakkam, Padi, Mogappair, Koyambedu, Tirumangalam and Korattur. Every day, over 500 residents walk on the tiled walker’s pathway at the playground. The place has basketball, volleyball and tennis courts. To supplement the PHC in the area, an Amma Mini-Clinic inside the bus terminus at TVS Colony in Mogappair has been opened to cater to needs of residents especially in Satya Nagar, Golden Colony, TVS Colony and Padi. The clinic will be open between 8 a.m and 3 p.m on all days including Sundays.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/playground-in-anna-nagar-gets-a-modern-gym/article34010373.ece

At last count, 80 per cent of the seniors who had registered for the vaccination got their jab. Impressed with the cleanliness and amenities at the PHC in Kelambakkam, 70-year-old R. Srikanth, a resident, spoke to the staff and doctor to find out if the PHC could give a slot for the residents to cut down on the wiating time. “Once I learnt it was possible, I circulated a note in the various WhatsApp groups about my audit of the PHC, and shared a form for those interested in getting a time slot,” says Srikanth. IT professional Sai Ram and Seshan Krishna Kumar from the gated community helped create a Google form as per the format required for registration with details like name, date of birth, PAN, Aadhar card number and address with pin code. “We circulated the online form on February 24 hoping to close it within two days but registrations kept coming in until February 28. A total of 122 people registered for the vaccination at the PHC,” says Srikanth, who is president of Rotary Club of Chennai Upscale and a polio-vaccination campaigner. The next step was grouping the registered members in such a manner that members of the same family would get their turn the same day. “Our objective was to have a process that helped both the PHC and residents and ensured there was no crowding at the Centre,” says Srikanth. “Each of us shared our experience, which was positive, in the community’s WhatsApp group, and this helped build confidence about the vaccine drive as well as neighbourhood PHC, which many of us were visiting for the first time,” says Raghavan Murti, president of one of the towers.  122 people registered for vaccination at the PHC||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/getting-the-jab-done/article34010408.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Shaking paws with five mammals in urban Chennai||There is the tradition — now scarcely followed — of neighbours calling on a family that has just moved in. Twenty-five years ago, when Preston Ahimaz established his home in Madambakkam, long-time residents upheld this social practice. Enamoured of the Prestons’ garden, one family took this tradition a bit too far, stopping by the greenery almost every blooming day. It left Preston with a grin that has not shrunk a nanometre, to this day. “Black-naped Hares would come into our garden, nibbling on the grass and eating the flowerheads,” recalls Preston, author of A Guide to Some Urban Fauna of India and forest consultant for TVS Motor Company which has urban-forestry initiatives going at its factories. The garden visits continued for seven years, with the frequency steadily on the wane. However, when the visits stopped, there was a suddenness and finality, akin to what is felt when an overheated engine shuts off mid-journey. “You do not see them here anymore, because the area has been completely built-up,” says a disappointed Preston. For his part, he still makes the mammals and creepy-crawlies feel welcome — to the point of leaving his house unprotected by a compound wall, and one ground in the three-ground plot completely vacant. The Black-naped Hare ( Lepus nigricollis) however had left the region never to return. It is by no means a singular experience. What was once a common occurrence within the city seems almost totally restricted to isolated and protected pockets. “Any area that is not disturbed and which has some scrubland around, would have the Black-naped Hare. You get to see it at Madras Christian College - Tambaram, Nanmangalam Reserve Forest, Guindy National Park and IIT-Madras,” Preston illustrates. However, in localities organically suited to support Black-naped Hare populations, the species is largely a will-o’-the-wisp, leaving just a hazy trail, and remaining largely unseen. “In 2017, along the tracks of the MRTS line, at ground-level, in Velachery, I saw the scat of the Black-naped Hare. The species should be found around that region even now. In places characterised by scrublands and grasslands, you should find the Black-naped Hare,” M. Yuvan, naturalist and author of A Naturalist’s Journal , stays hopeful. Though the Black-naped Hare may be readily associated with scrublands, Preston touches upon the species occurrence data that shows it to be “not very habitat-specific”. To illustrate, it ranges around densely forested tracts as well as coastal regions marked by wide open spaces, as instantiated by their presence in Top Slips and Pulicat, respectively. “A cosmopolitan species and not very habitat-specific, they can manage in any kind of habitat as long as there is some living space. However, if there is constant human pressure and presence, they will vanish,” says Preston. “Along the coast, on East Coast Road, wherever there are open patches of land with some vegetation, you will find the Black-naped Hare.” Conceding that open land set aside for housing and agriculture is bound to give way to development sooner or later and one cannot argue about it, Preston emphasises that conserving the species would mean ensuring that areas designated as “protected” continue with that status. As a warning, he conjures up a situation just because it is too ridiculous to be entertained in thought, let alone scripted into reality. “You cannot breed hares in captivity — what is the point of it? Hares are prolific and will increase on their own. Just give them their habitat,” explains Preston. The call of the jackal There is a distinct timbre to a jackal’s howl distinguishing it from a dog’s. Of course, residents of localities within Chennai’s metropolitan area may still mistake it for a dog’s, as most people in Chennai’s urban and even semi-urban spaces, expect a jackal at their gates. Besides, for this majority, a symphony of howling jackals remains unheard. “In different places, you hear the howls of the Golden Jackal ( canis aureus) , at night. You would, in sections of Thoraipakkam and deep into Perungudi. Not many years ago, I would hear its howl in Baby Nagar, Velachery, in the evening and at night, when this section was undisturbed. That was before Perungudi Station Road was connected to the main road,” reveals Yuvan. On the urban-adaptability quotient, the Golden Jackal trumps the Black-naped Hare by a long bushy tail. “Unlike the Black-naped Hare, the Golden Jackal can live even in semi-urban areas, as they scavenge in garbage dumps” for a variety of leftovers that suits its eclectic diet plan, says Preston. In contrast, “the Black-naped Hare cannot live off humans except for some vegetable waste.” Though better adapted and nocturnal, the Golden Jackal would baulk at an environment marked by huge disturbances, in terms of human and canine presence. Preston underlines that when these two factors in check, the Golden Jackal thrives. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, naturalist and member of Madras Naturalists’ Society, recalls his first memory of a Golden Jackal sighting in an urban environment, as one in which a pack of stray dogs were hot on the heels of a terrified jackal. “On the campus of the SSN college on Old Mahabalipuram Road, I have heard jackals howling. On the outskirts, around Mahabalipuram, there are many Golden Jackals — from Kelambakkam onwards, the possibility of a Golden Jackal sighting increases. There are just open grounds, and the possibility of them being driven by stray dogs is low,” adds Vikas. As dogs and jackals belong to the same family ( canidae ) and sub-family ( caninae ), any diseases harboured by the former can be transferred to jackals. Yuvan says mange-ridden Golden Jackals in urban spaces are not uncommon. As with the Black-naped Hare, protected areas hold out hope for the Golden Jackal. “At Guindy National Park (GNP), I would have seen 15 individuals. I would be on the road, and they would be sitting there; they would not run away on seeing you,” says Vikas, who would frequent GNP through 2016 as part of a special wildlife study project. “The Theosophical Society also has a Golden Jackal population; and I have seen a pack of five.” Yuvan points out that MCC Tambaram should be having a healthy population of Golden Jackals. Grey facts When was the last time you ran into the Indian Grey Mongoose ( Herpestes edwardsi) ? “I have not seen the Indian Grey Mongoose in a very long time, and they used to be very common in and around Madambakkam. It is a question of the human juggernaut pushing away wildlife,” says Preston. Yuvan weighs in: “The Indian Grey Mongoose’s ecological role is important, and it is fading away from the urban spaces. In front of my house, at Baby Nagar in Velachery, I had seen a mongoose pair with babies, and now with the thicket removed due to a construction, this mongoose family is gone too. Currently, in pockets and places with less noise, the Indian Grey Mongoose would definitely be present. It feeds on reptiles, famously snakes, and on smaller rodents, and birds. Being a predator, it plays a crucial role in the food chain. We have to preserve habitats and leave thickets alone wherever we should and can, to keep this species in our midst.”  Unlike the Black-naped Hare, the Golden Jackal can live even in semi-urban areas, as they scavenge in garbage dumps||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/shaking-paws-with-five-mammals-in-urban-chennai/article34010401.ece

The practice began when COVID-19 lockdown was introduced last year, as the violators had the road all to themselves. Though volume of vehicular traffic is back to old levels, this practice continues. The 300-metre-long Link Road connects Ramapuram and K.K. Nagar via Anna Main Road, and was opened for traffic in August 2017 as an alternative to First Main Road in Nesapakkam, which is narrow and therefore congested. Being 18-metres-wide, Link Road made it easier even for buses to navigate it. In fact, Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) even came up with a new route via Link Road. “As Link Road does not fall under the traffic police’s surveillance mechanism, lorry drivers park their vehicles on the stretch permanently. Due to such unauthorised parking, pedestrians are forced to walk on the carriageway,”says S. Suresh, a resident of Virugambakkam. It may be recalled that when motorists complained that a public toilet and a Tasmac outlet at the intersection of Link Road and Anna Main Road in Nesapakkam obstructed their view of Link Road, from a distance, the public toilet was demolished. However, lorries are now parked on the section, which prevents optimal use of the road. Link Road is an ‘S’ shaped road with narrow bends and therefore, parked vehicles block the view of vehicles coming in the opposite direction. According to the local traffic police, accidents have been reported from this road mainly during night. A Greater Chennai Corporation says, “Necessary steps will be taken at the earliest to prevent authorised parking of vehicles on Link Road.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/link-road-plagued-by-unauthorised-parking/article34010403.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Teen reaches resources to underprivileged students||While on a visit to a government school as part of a field project, Upasana Ravikannan developed a first-hand understanding of the inequality in education. Two years later, she started a social initiative, GoPaadhai, which works around the objective of reaching educational resources to schools. Eighteen-year-old Upasana, who has cerebral palsy and is wheelchair bound, sees that her initiative is all set to take wider wings. She is among the 19 changemakers selected from 12 states for the second edition of the Ashoka Young Changemakers, a year-long programme that would equip her with the knowledge and perspective to find solutions to many other global challenges. “I was in Class IX and as part of Karthavyam, a diploma in public problem-solving initiative at HLC International, we went on a field visit to a government school. It was aimed at helping us understand the different challenges out there. The classrooms at the government school were as big as mine, but they were absolutely lacking in amenities,” says Upasana, who has brought out a storybook on waste management and also mobilised people to solve a waste-management problem, again as part of Karthavyam. The most poignant moment arrived when Upasana noticed that a group of children had left a puzzle incomplete on the floor. When she quizzed them about it, she was informed that many pieces were missing, and they would never be able to complete that puzzle. It was heartbreaking for Upasana to see children deprived of basic learning material. “The images of the school, children and my interactions never left me, and I used to discuss it with my music teacher, Seethalakshmi ma’am, who broadened my horizons and nudged me to do something about it,” says Upasana. Through the music teacher, she got to know Kanavu, an organisation that works with the ASSEFA Foundation in Kannaiarpet, Cuddalore. Upasana then turned to her gated community in Siruseri that helped her put her dreams into action. “I got permission to organise a road show to raise funds for Kanavu. I choose the Christmas get-together at the society to launch it. I even gave a talk at the event,” says Upasana, a resident of L&T Eden Park. That is the beginning of GoPaadhai’s journey. “We raised Rs. 15000 toward supporting a teacher training programme,” she says. Soon, her friends chipped in with their support. Arjun Mohan, for instance, who lives at Pelican Nest, a gated community in Thoraipakkam, volunteered to take the lead in another fundraising initiative for Kanavu. This time, they were looking for stationery and storybooks too. Here, they collected over Rs. 11000. Many other friends went door-to-door to raise funds. During the lockdown, Upasana received a request from InkLink Charitable Trust, which works with the underprivileged from Kannagi Nagar to raise funds to buy data cards so that the children could attend classes online. GoPaadhai volunteers again turned to their respective communities for donations; and now, the army of volunteers had increased. “In 2018, I had 10 friends helping me raise funds. The next year, it increased to 15 and now I have more than 20 people as volunteers, and some of them are grown-ups,” says Upasana. Deepa Som from L&T Eden Park is among those who helped mobilise support for her campaign among residents of the community. They raised approximately Rs. 20,000. Upasana and her friends are now working towards building resources for a school in Ramanathapuram. Currently in a gap year, Upasana and is spending the time at her disposal to volunteer at her alma mater , where she facilitates classes for grade 1 and 2 students in Mathematics and English. “HLC has played an important role in my daughter’s journey to become independent, emphatic and embrace an inclusive environment,” says her mother Aparna Ravikannan. Later, in July, Upasana will be enrolling for a bachelors programme in psychology at Ashoka University.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Stormwater drain work crawls in Ashok Nagar||While stormwater drains are being built on both sides of Jawaharlal Nehru Main Road at a sluggish pace, precautionary measures to prevent mishaps are glaringly lacking. The dug-up portions of the road have not been barricaded. On portions where the work has been completed, road-relaying work is yet to begin. It is particularly felt on the section between Lakshman Sruthi junction and Ashok Pillar junction, as it is extremely busy, often even at night, with goods-laden lorries from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh passing through the stretch to reach the south of Tamil Nadu via Tambaram. “Unable to use the footpath, we end up on the carriageway, which is unsafe, especially at night,” says B. Sekar, a resident of Ashok Nagar. The State Highways Department is carrying out this work for the past five months. The stormwater drain is being widened three feet wide and six feet deep to improve its rainwater-discharging capacity. Residents of nearby localities point out that they have been enduring the traffic chaos due to this work for quite some time. A State Highways official says “Steps will be taken to complete the work at the earliest.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/stormwater-drain-work-crawls-in-ashok-nagar/article34010398.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||From trees to terra firma||Arboreal, the Asian Palm Civet and Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse are inclined to viewing their worlds along vertical lines. However in urban spaces, they tend towards adaptations without compromising on their essential nature. Mahathi Narayanaswamy, a resident of IIT-Madras who records the fauna and avifauna on the campus, draws attention to how now and then, a Palm Civet ( paradoxurus hermaphroditus) would invite itself to a terrace or balcony of a house (on the campus). The bolder ones — usually, the juveniles — would even attempt to decamp with vegetable peels.  With a proliferation of palm trees on the campus, Palm Civet presence is a given. However, even in this scenario, Palm Civet sightings will be received with surprise every time it happens. Says Preston Ahimaz, author of A Guide to Some Urban Fauna of India , and forest consultant for TVS Motor Company: “Palm Civets have this amazing ability to live completely unnoticed. They would be living right next to you and you would not know, unless you find a dropping or two somewhere.” However, this ability is being tested in urban spaces due to increasing density of human population and galloping development. With more buildings, they tend to set paw in human spaces, and be seen more often that they otherwise would be. “Palm Civets will be there provided you allow them to. They will use any abandoned place. For example, ventilators that are never used, with the niche on the outside. Arboreal, they would however want to be away from the ground. They will not roost or hang around on the ground. It has to be in an elevated place. They are used to being in the trees. So, any elevated place that is inaccessible and undisturbed is good enough for them.” The Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse ( vandeleuria oleracea) also looks for similar substitutes in high places, while in urban spaces, where it is hugely uncommon. Preston has had the experience of encountering a female Asiatic Long-Tailed Climbing Mouse with her two babies, in the false ceiling of a building. Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, a naturalist and a Madras Naturalists Society member, relates an episode involving this rodent, which sticks to trees until push comes to a headlong fall. Vikas narrates: “This mouse is not a pest, as it does not depend on what we eat. It is a completely wild species, not dependent on humans. However, it invited itself to our home in 2018. At that time, we were staying at Indira Nagar and the property had a mango tree whose branches were jutting into the house. Having fallen off the tree, it was clueless about getting back onto the tree, and came into the house. Inside, it went into the room that had a lot of wood furniture, and started climbing on everything. We managed to catch it, and when we released it on the ground, the first thing it did was go for the tree.”  Palm Civets have this amazing ability to live completely unnoticed||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/from-trees-to-terra-firma/article34010405.ece

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||It is almost time to spot the Grey Plover in its breeding finery||While chirping with its Arctic neighbours — the Saamis, Nenets and Inuits — about climate change, the Grey Plover utilises the handle @blackbelliedplover. In its migratory range, it is @greyplover, wearing drab overalls — grey upperparts and white underparts with the chest speckled-grey. In early-September and end-of-March-to-early-May though, the adults among these birds would be draped (somewhere between partly and fully) in their breeding finery, despite being in the wintering grounds. The adult male’s cheek, neck, breast and belly would be the shade of a just-laid bituminous road. Hence Black-bellied Plover. The adult female would bear the shade of the same road after it had been subjected to a year of tyre-scuffing. During these times, birders in its migratory range, which includes Indian coastlines, including the Chennai coast, would hope to greet this bird of the mudflats. Contrasting sharply with most other plovers, this species does not display much of a flocking behaviour. The Grey Plover has its favourite sunbathing spots, the closest being Pulicat; even there, the species can come across as being thin on the ground, because it is not gregarious. On the eastern coastline, based on eBird records, mudflats at Adyar Estuary, Kelambakkam backwaters, Muttukadu backwaters, Mudhaliarkuppam backwaters, Nemmeli salt-pan area, Muttukadu backwaters and Odiyur may be quickly accessible spots where one could look for this species. A visit to Pulicat and Point Calimere may however be more conducive for a study of the species. A member of Madras Naturalists Society, Umesh Mani weighs in: “Grey Plovers do not come in large numbers; in contrast, Pacific Golden Plovers do. The last season, the regular flocks of Pacific Golden Plovers I saw at mudflats in Pulicat were in numbers of 50, 70 and 100, and the largest was something like 2,000 individuals. In comparison, the largest flock of Black-bellied Plovers I saw was 15 to 20 in a trip; and the regular flocks would be two or three individuals at a time.” It seems to be a leitmotif, repeated at most other coastal mudflat ecosystems. To give an example, birder Rama Neelamegan reports a sighting from Kelambakkam Backwaters that showed an almost similarly lopsided ratio, the scales heavily tipped in the favour of Pacific Golden Plover. The point is: Among the plovers, the Grey Plover is an outlier when it comes to gregariousness. Umesh illustrates it: “The sand plovers and ringed plovers are in groups, typically in mixed flocks. In contrast, the Grey Plovers are usually by themselves, unless they are roosting or getting together for reverse migration.” Over to Point Calimere with its BHNS Regional Migration Study Centre. “The Grey Plover is one of the uncommon birds, and every year we would ring 5 to 6 of them, with the upper limit at 10. When major projects were on, bird-ringing would happen round the year. With none under way now, ringing is restricted to a part of the bird migration season,” explains S. Balachandran, deputy director at the Centre. There is a fascinating Grey Plover-ringing episode from 1989 that Balachandran has regaled generations of bird-enthusiasts with. The memory is sufficiently fresh from the mudflats of Point Calimere for Blachandran to not call it up again: “In January 1989, we made a recovery of a Grey Plover, one that had been ringed in Kazakhstan three to four months back in September while it had made a pitstop there en route to its wintering grounds. When we recaptured this bird at Point Calimere in the first month of 1989, the Centre had a guest: Soviet bird scientist Prof. Gavrilov. Studying the details of the ring, Gavrilov was beside himself with excitement. The bird was from the erstwhile Soviet Union (which Kazakhstan was a part of) and wonder of wonders, he had ringed the bird himself. It was as if he was chasing the bird all the way to its wintering grounds.” He points out that the overall sense one gets about the Grey Plover is that it has dwindled, something that could be said of all bird species dependent on mudflat ecosystems. “It is a global phenomenon; everywhere, coastal mudflats are dwindling,” says Balachandran. “The Grey Plover is a largely specialist bird, depending heavily on mudflats with their molluscs and crustaceans. Sometimes, they may opportunistically land in freshwater wetlands, but cannot get by on them. The Grey Plover is hugely coastal, found in coastal islands.” So clearly, there is no alternative to protecting coastal ecosystems for the sake of such species.

At 95, P. Shankar Raman is the oldest to get the jab. “I barely felt the needle going into the muscle,” is what he has to say. Over the last week, the home was taking the residents in batches to the Corporation health centre at Venkatapuram in Ambattur for the vaccine shot. “I am happy and relieved that everything went on well, and am thankful to the supervisor Sundari and her staff for making this exercise a smooth for all the residents,” says Dr. G. Kamala, the in-house consultant at Anandam. The trip to the centre seemed to be an outing, as none of the residents had left the home since the outbreak of the pandemic, except for the 29 who were treated at Government Stanley Hospital after testing positive for COVID-19. Before being vaccinated, all the residents were informed about what it would do for them. “All the medical staff and the trustees have been vaccinated; and we shared our experience to boost their morale. Besides, they see us every day going about doing our work, after being vaccinated,” says Dr. Kamala. A day before the vaccination, hypertension and blood count were recorded. “For some seniors, the BP spiked as they waited for their turn; they were made to relax and sent only after a few others had returned,” she says. Those who are diabetic are prescribed their regular medicine and breakfast. A few hours after the injection, post-lunch, senior citizens were given a dose of Paracetamol. Says Dr. Kamala: “This is given as a precautionary measure, and those who had mild fever were given an additional dose.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/quick-off-the-block/article34010409.ece

Prabhu, a resident of Parthasarathipuram. The intersection witnesses heavy traffic due to its proximity to Venkat Narayana Road, South Usman Road, Pondy Bazaar, Ranganathan Street, Mambalam railway station, and the Metropolitan Transport Corporation bus terminus in T.Nagar. Further, there are two educational institutions located near the intersection. Pedestrians say crossing the intersection can be harrowing. Accidents are a near-miss at this intersection, say residents. Residents say there are cases of school students attempting wheelie-races. Recently, the driver of an MTC bus (route number 47D plying between Avadi and Thiruvanmiyur) reportedly brought the vehicle to a halt due to such reckless behaviour by youngsters.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||From the belly of the sea||A tiny village called Tuna lies by the sea in Gujarat’s Kutch district. Pottery is the main source of livelihood here. And the lives of the potters are intertwined with the rhythmic cycle of the sea. No other pot, it is said, keeps water so exceptionally cool, even in the scorching heat of summers, or lends it so fresh and sweet a taste. The secret, the potters say, lies in the clay they use, which they dig up from the seabed during a specific time of the month. “Our water pots sell all over Gujarat; I just sent a truckload to Mehsana 300 km away,” says Razak bhai, a potter in Tuna, as he works the malleable clay until the pot holds the desired shape. It is the salinity of the sea that gives the clay its unique property, he says. Arduous process Collecting the clay is, therefore, timed with the tide — cyclically, every month. “We collect the clay only during the no-moon phase, when the sea recedes the farthest and we can reach the seabed. When the water recedes, the clay becomes dry. The salty sea water makes this black mitti (earth) special,” he says. Hanif bhai , also a potter in the village, says they cannot collect clay during the monsoon, when the sea brims over. “Other than the four monsoon months, our production goes on through the year.” The pots are made very thin in a long and arduous process. “Our backs give up,” says Hanif bhai . “But this is the only trade we know and the only trade we are meant to do.” Women are just as much a part of the process of making Tuna pots. “We too are deeply involved in the pot-making. We collect the clay in the tractors, prepare it for the potter’s wheel, help prepare the kiln, and then paint the pots,” says Fatima ben.  Special clay Tuna’s kilns are wide and can fire up to 400 pots at once. “The process of firing is very specific,” says Hanif bhai . The kiln has to first be cleaned thoroughly. Then, broken pieces of pots are placed over a blanket of tree bark. This is then layered with more broken pieces, over which the unbaked pots are placed, upside down. The pots are then covered with chhandh , a mixture of wood and fertiliser, and the kiln fired for two days and nights. Once baked, the pots are painted. Tuna’s pots typically have lines drawn around them. “To check if they are from here, rub the surface gently; it will flake,” says Fatima ben . “Fill it with water, and it will not do so any more.” The clay does not lend itself to other household objects. “For example, if we make a kadhai (wok) of it, it does not heat up as effectively on the fire as the clay pots. Our clay’s speciality is the water pot. Generations of my family have crafted them. That is the tradition,” says Razak bhai . Lingering nervousness A pot is sold for approximately Rs. 30-35 by the potters. In the market, the price rises to around Rs. 80-100 per piece. The demand is always high, and it is for this reason that the number of potters migrating to Tuna from nearby villages has been gradually increasing over the years. “In the past four or five years, at least 10 Kumbhar (potter) families have migrated to our village from elsewhere,” says Razak bhai. “Now we have 60-70 families here.” There is, however, a lingering nervousness in the village. A few years ago, when the Tuna terminal of Adani Ports was commissioned, it posed a threat to the potters. The area cordoned off by the port authorities was where the potters got their clay from. “That mitti is the best,” says Razak bhai . When the potters expressed their concern, they were offered some respite. “They [the company] told us that the area is not being used by them for now, and so we can continue to collect clay from there.” The worry is how long the respite will last. Meanwhile, another area where the potters collect their clay from has started losing out to a number of salt factories coming up in the vicinity. The excess salt that seeps into the ground makes the clay lose its special quality. The potters have written to the district collector expressing their concern. The families remain hopeful. “Our work will go on, just like it has for the last 300 years,” says Razak bhai . Just like the tides and the sea. The writer is a Gujarat-based freelance journalist.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Writing the tea leaves||India’s capital is home to a famous chaiwala . A darling of the press, fêted by numerous organisations and no stranger to the highest echelons of political office, Laxman Rao has led a storied life. It wasn’t his brews but his books that catapulted him into the public eye, and even into Teen Murti House, where Indira Gandhi hosted him in 1984. A few decades down the line, then President Pratibha Patil also had the honour. Now the author of 25 Hindi books, he’s received awards from NGOs and literary associations and been covered more than 100 times in print, broadcast and digital media. All the while, until Delhi went into lockdown last year, you could still walk right up to a tea stall on Vishnu Digambar Marg and treat yourself to a cuppa from this celebrated author. The pandemic brought change and, in its own way, peace. Rao’s sons were doing well, so he could quite happily wrap up the tea business and focus on writing and promoting his works. Several are now available on online shopping sites and Kindle. And currently in the works is a Mahabharata -based play called Hastinapur . It’s an epilogue to the epic that aims for contemporary relevance, with an emphasis on “diagnosing and redressing the moral dilemmas of our times,” he says. It has a focus on Karna, a “great warrior, a great human being and a great friend” who Rao feels has been given short shrift by recent adaptations. The tea stall is still there — it’s his correspondence address and office space-cum-bookshop. “Literature needs time to flourish; that’s why I needed to sell tea.” he says. And time it took. Rao started his rags-to-writer journey in 1975, when he left his village with Rs. 40 in his pocket — borrowed from his father — and a dream to make it big as an author in Delhi. He opened a paan shop on Vishnu Digambar Marg in 1977, and later diversified into tea. Leisure reading The shop was near Delhi’s old book market, and he used to grab books by authors ranging from Lenin to Shakespeare to read when there was a lull in business. This was also when he encountered the works of one of his inspirations, the novelist and Bollywood scripwriter Gulshan Nanda. Next year, Rao was ready to try his luck. He approached publishers with two manuscripts and met rejection after rejection. “One publisher said, ‘get out’, and that day I decided I would publish on my own. I thank him for rejecting me.” He worked hard at the shop, saved up Rs. 7,000, and in 1979 launched his first novel, Nai Duniya Ki Nai Kahani , through his own self-publishing line. Of course, it wasn’t just a question of publishing; at first he had to go around on his bicycle delivering copies to schools, libraries and railway stations. He had little success initially, but Pradhanmantri , the play he wrote after meeting Indira Gandhi, brought him instant fame. Origin story For Rao’s literary origin story, we have to flash back even further to a little village called Talegaon Dashasar in Maharashtra’s Amravati district, where he was born in 1952. His senior at school, a reformed ruffian named Ramdas, dived into a river to bathe and never came up again. The memory would gestate in Rao’s mind until 1992, when Ramdas became the novel Ramdas — his third and most successful book, with more than 5,000 copies sold to date. “My writing is not protest at all against any incident, but it must be inspiring. It is mostly my imagination on the basis of some fact that passes by me. I always live in present and write fictional literature,” he says. Rao feels it’s been smooth sailing since 2000, when he was given an award by the Bhartiya Anuvad Parishad and his career really took off. Recently, he has widened his scope to write about subjects like politics and economics; his last published book was Bhartiya Arthashastra Aev Maulik Sidhant in 2018. Over the years, he’s worked on other things too; he completed his Class XII in Delhi aged 37, got a degree from Delhi University at 50 and an M.A. in Hindi literature from IGNOU at 63 — and is still planning to do a Ph.D. What does the future hold? “I’ve become a Gulshan Nanda as I wished, and now I want to be Shakespeare. I don’t want to sell tea anymore — I only wish to write and promote my works,” he says. The writer is a research scholar at the Academy of International Studies, Jamia Millia Islamia.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A report from the future||Once the last few elements of the Nightmare Regime were ejected from power by the ballot box, what remained before the nation and the new government was the massive task of clean-up, the fumigation and detoxing from the deadly ideology that had so nearly destroyed the Republic. This was not something that could be achieved overnight, and if indeed it was to be done on a war-footing then that ‘war’, it was understood, would be a long struggle for a more equal society, starting from an education system which would stand the test of time generation after generation as it reached every child in the country and helped them grasp and internalise, among other things, the basics of rational science and history and the complete dismantling of the caste system. Critical shift As these processes were set in motion, the larger, centrally-controlled instruments of corruption were tackled first, leading to the removal of secret funding for political parties, the re-establishment of a robust independent judiciary, and the huge clean-up of the gravely damaged federal agencies and commissions. The separation of state and religion, with the weeding out of all religious bias from the business of the state, was urgently and critically required. This was one of the main challenges met not just by the new government but by the people as a whole. As often happens with a huge and radical change, it wasn’t just the grotesque excesses and mistakes of the most recently deposed regime that needed dismantling but also the ingrained sins and bad tendencies of previous regimes. So, for example, apropos economic planning, the huge shift from blindly aiming for ‘growth’ to ‘contentment’ goals for the general population put the epitaph not only on the crazed crony capitalism of the last regime but also on the accepted economic wisdoms of several previous governments. This went hand in hand with emergency-level efforts to stave off or reverse the several ecological/ environmental disasters facing the country. It took a while for the burgeoning entrepreneurial sections to understand and trust that the movement to remove obscene inequality and place strict checks and restrictions to protect the environment didn’t equal some fanatical ‘Communist’ agenda but was, in fact, the pre-requisite for a balanced, reasonably peaceful and just society in which their businesses could thrive. Cricket magic Such was the toxic afterlife of the different kinds of destruction the Nightmare Regime had wreaked that people felt its effects for many years after the Regime had ceded power. One of the main challenges facing the country was how to deal with the supporters of the Regime and its infamous ideology. Support for the Regime had withered, especially in the last five years of its rule, but there was still a sizeable number of believers and hangers-on, angry and disillusioned, who were unable or unwilling to give up the lies and myths they had been fed by their leaders. Given the principles of the new Republic people wanted to forge, there was no choice but to try and bring these bitter and disappointed ones back into the fold of a secular, egalitarian society. Oddly enough, one of the major ways this process of assimilation began was through cricket, specifically the renaming of several major stadiums in the country. Most of the Regime supporters were also serious cricket fans. Once every State cricket board began to follow the policy of removing names and statues of political leaders from the stadiums, a different kind of message began to trickle into the wider consciousness. The team was India, which was greater than any political figure and separate from them; the area of sport belonged to sportspeople and spectators; politicians and political hero-creation were not welcome to piggyback on this. A few years after the end of the Dark Period, a five-Test tour by Australia had a schedule that read: 1st Test, Mumbai/ Bombay — Sunil Gavaskar Stadium (formerly Brabourne), 2nd Test, Delhi — Bishan Singh Bedi Stadium (formerly Kotla), 3rd Test, Bengaluru/ Bangalore — Rahul Dravid Arena (formerly Chinnaswamy), 4th Test Ahmedabad — Vinoo Mankad Stadium (formerly Motera/ Modi), 5th Test, Kolkata/ Calcutta — Eden Gardens (a couple of iconic venues such as Eden and Green Park retained their old names). ODI games with Bombay and Bangalore were repeated but at the alternate venues of the Sachin Tendulkar Stadium (Wankhede) and the brand new G.R. Vishwanath Stadium. Along with the renaming of stadiums went the dismantling of grandiose, over-sized statues, the cessation and redirecting of the money and energy from vanity projects such as bullet trains and ugly secretariat buildings. As things became more transparent, as decision-making processes became more inclusive, a different atmosphere was collectively created in the country. It was then observed that things both big and small, both obvious and seemingly obscure, all fed into the larger detoxification process.  Such was the toxic afterlife of the different kinds of destruction that the Nightmare Regime had wreaked that people felt its effects for many years after the Regime had ceded power||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/a-report-from-the-future/article34010446.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||From movies to books||When a bunch of young film enthusiasts in northern Sri Lanka decided to build a library of cinema, they were certain about two things. Their resources would not be limited by geography, language, or culture. And, the library would be named after one of their own. The opening of the Balu Mahendra Library in Kilinochchi last December reflected precisely that spirit. Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi, Sinhala filmmaker Prasanna Vithanage, director Bharathiraja from India, and senior Sri Lankan Tamil theatreperson Maunaguru Sinniah, among others, spoke about Mahendra at the virtual inauguration. The diverse guestlist was not incidental. Mahendra, who hailed from eastern Batticaloa, worked in the island nation’s dominant Sinhala film industry as a young technician, before his formal training in Pune. He went on to become one of South India’s most admired film icons, with technique that many compared to the best in world cinema. For those who conceived the library, it all began with a workshop called ‘Pattarai’ — incidentally, the name of Mahendra’s film school in Chennai — in May 2020, at the height of the pandemic. Under a stringent lockdown, a group of youngsters, mainly from war-affected districts in the island’s north and east, put together a series of interactive, virtual sessions with senior technicians and artists, with support from the University of Jaffna. Over 600 film buffs from across Sri Lanka — and a few from Tamil Nadu — signed up. The resource persons spanned continents and genres — from Prasanna Vithanage, Vijay Sethupathi, Nasser, Nalan Kumarasamy, Lenin M. Sivam to Balaji Sakthivel, Poornima Ramasamy, Ghibran and Ranjith Joseph. The workshops went on for four months, leaving participants with one key takeaway. “It made us realise you can’t simply watch TV or films and become a filmmaker. Not everyone with a camera can become a cinematographer. These skills come with focused learning, training, and thinking. We realised we didn’t have the resources for that and that’s how the idea of a library was born,” says Ramya Deron, president of the Balu Mahendra Library. Until 2009, when Sri Lanka’s civil war ended, Kilinochchi district in the Tamil-majority Northern Province was best known as the administrative capital of the LTTE. Post-war, it is a busy town where residents try hard to revive its economy and their livelihoods. Government-built war monuments dot the A9, the main highway to the north from capital Colombo. Off the main road are villages where mostly Tamils live, braving the aftermath of the war. The Balu Mahendra Library, opened just weeks before his seventh death anniversary last month, is housed on the first floor of an old building belonging to a cooperative society. Laid the foundation “We thought a lot about the library’s name, and felt it had to commemorate Balu Mahendra sir, who was from Batticaloa. He went to a thriving film industry in South India and made a mark with his creativity and technical brilliance. That is no small accomplishment,” says Ramya. Mahendra’s decision to go to India in the late 60s was completely understandable, says Vithanage, the acclaimed Sinhala filmmaker. Although many popular producers, distributors and theatre owners in Ceylon back then were Tamils, the predominantly Sinhala film landscape gave little room or recognition to Tamil technicians, he says. “Even now, in this Sinhala-Buddhist majority context, it is not easy for mainstream Tamil filmmakers to make the films they want for theatrical release. Balu Mahendra tried working here but soon realised he couldn’t do much. That is why he left for Pune Film Institute.” With a recommendation letter from no less than Lester James Peries, a pioneer Sinhala filmmaker, called “the father of Sri Lankan cinema”. Soon, other technicians followed suit and built successful careers in India, but few know they are from Sri Lanka, says Ramya. “For us, it is inspiring to think that someone from our country went to India and became a trailblazer.” Like others in her team, Ramya, a 20-year-old software engineer, volunteers her time to manage the library. “We dream of building a distinct Eelam [Tamil name for Sri Lanka] Tamil film identity, and we could not think of anyone but Balu Mahendra sir as our icon, and as our film identity.” Not long after entering the Indian film world, Mahendra’s work was noticed. “He did not try to merely fit in; he began telling stories on his own terms,” says Vithanage, recalling the experience of watching Azhiyatha Kolangal (1979) in Colombo and “being stunned” by the film’s sensibility. “With the limited technology of that time, his storytelling was so close to life. It opened a new vista in filmmaking,” he says, citing Veedu (1988) and Sandhya Raagam (1989) as other inspirations. Mahendra may have not worn his Sri Lankan identity on his sleeve, but much of his inspiration appears to have come from his formative years on the island, although it was not confined to that. He has spoken of watching David Lean make The Bridge on the River Kwai in Sri Lanka’s scenic hill countryside, during a school trip, and being drawn to filmmaking that day. Theatreperson Maunaguru Sinniah, who grew up with Mahendra in Amirthakali village in Batticaloa, traces other influences. “His father Balanathan was a popular maths teacher in our village. It is his name that Mahendran annan (elder brother) took on as his first name later. Annan was a quiet but intent observer of life. When I watched Veedu , I was reminded of the difficulties his father faced while building their stone house in our village,” he says. Azhiyatha Kolangal , too, transported him back to their school days. Growing up, Mahendra was not attracted to any of the political ideologies dominating the region when Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict began to brew. “He was more interested in arts and literature. He observed people and tried to understand the lives they were leading,” says Sinniah. Once, a man was found drowned in the pond near the village temple. The entire village gathered to see the body. “We were very sad to see that person lying lifeless. I vividly remember Annan telling us: ‘How many dreams this man would have had’. It affected him very much.” Strong women Years later, Mahendra’s films stood out for capturing human relationships and emotions with rare honesty. “He was especially good at sensitively portraying the dynamics of male-female relationships. Tamil society prides itself in being morally righteous, defining culture and values in very rigid ways. Annan ’s films zoomed into the complexity of human relationships, without being judgemental,” Sinniah notes. Vithanage also finds Mahendra’s writing of women characters “remarkable”. “Look at Shoba in Azhiyatha Kolangal , Archana in Veedu or Revathi in Marupadiyum . They were so different to the women portrayed in other films at the time. They had agency, they were decision makers,” he says. The newly launched library so far has received over 10,000 books and DVDs from writers and filmmakers abroad and in Sri Lanka. Mahendra’s family too has made a sizeable contribution, even as the young volunteers running the library explore funding options. Meanwhile, the team is also trying to expand its network within the island, getting not only Tamil youth from the north and east, but also Tamil-speaking Muslims from the north, the ethnically diverse Eastern Province, as well as Malaiyaha Tamils from the island’s central and southern hill country. “We are keen on evolving a distinct Tamil cinema idiom in the island, but we want to tell stories from all over the country, not just from the north or east,” says Ramya. Going forward, the team wants to make their resources accessible in rural Sri Lanka, through mobile libraries. “We also want to screen the classics in our villages.” For now, they meet every weekend to watch the classics. Apart from aspiring filmmakers and technicians like themselves, they have even had their curious milk vendor and other local people join some sessions. Heated discussions follow. The group has a sizeable number of young women. “We are particular that women get a chance to learn about being technicians in cinema, and not be confined to acting careers,” says Ramya. Mahendra would have liked that.  Mahendra’s films stood out for how human relationships and emotions were captured with rare honesty.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Kinship in the time of Covid||One evening in June, a group of young men and women gathered in Zhavame village in the foothills of the Kapamodzü peak, one of Nagaland’s highest mountains. The lockdown had not yet been completely lifted, and the group mused about the abandoned paddy fields in the village. Many young people from Zhavame had moved to cities to study or work, and almost half the fields had been left fallow. At the end of the meeting, the Christo Naga’s Club, whose members included students, farmers, government and private sector employees, reached a decision: they would begin cultivating the land again. “Every member of the club comes from a farming background, but this was our first ever experience of farming independently without our parents. In the process, we learnt a lot,” says 34-year old Ngapunyi Albert Krocha, a social worker who lives in Kohima but visits his village often. The lockdown had convinced the group about the importance of self-reliance. They hope to encourage other young people to grow their own food. “We can never know what the future holds, but if we are self-reliant, or have surplus cultivation, we can survive,” says Krocha. Love your neighbour This is just one of the ways in which communities in Nagaland have come together to support each other during the ill-planned lockdown, which pushed thousands of people into penury. The close-knit society is falling back on the sense of community and kinship that has been passed down over generations in Nagaland. “If your house burns down, if your family member falls sick or dies, if you are suddenly diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, if your crops fail, your neighbours, kinsmen, clansmen, come to help you build a new house, help care for the sick,” says writer Easterine Kire about the Naga sense of community. Churches too began serving meals to the underprivileged during the lockdown. “Then there were NGOs and individuals distributing packets of food to daily wage workers who had lost their source of income. This sense of community is ingrained in us,” she says in an email interview. Nagaland is a great example of how communities rise to the occasion, explains Rosemary Dzüvichü, professor at the Department of English, Nagaland University. “The commitment towards community is an integral part of Naga culture. Whether in death or celebration, we are taught to stand by each other. We have seen this in the outpouring of generosity from individuals and communities and organisations towards the less fortunate, returnees, daily wage workers who faced the brunt of the lockdown in the State,” says Dzüvichü, who is also advisor to the Naga Mothers’ Association (NMA), the apex body of women’s organisations in the State. During the worst phase of the pandemic, NMA helped the Rotary Club identify single mothers, HIV+ people and daily wage workers to provide food and essential items, apart from helping the district administration reach out to orphanages and institutes for special needs children. The NMA also helped raise money and other resources for quarantine centres. It also collaborated with the Salesian Province of Don Bosco and reached out with thousands of rupees’ worth of essential food items to the quarantine centres at Peren and Tuensang. “To reach out to the community, no matter how distant, especially in times of trouble, has always been a part of our culture,” says Dzüvichü. It was with this spirit that NMA helped hundreds of women and children from Rengma families, who were forced to stay in relief camps at Bokajan and Silonijan during the 2013 conflict in Assam’s Rengma Hills. What is behind the Nagas’ sense of community? In the words of Kohima-based author, former editor and journalist Charles Chasie, “Naga tribes were all head-hunters, but they were also very diverse and practised several systems such as pure democracy, different shades of republican systems, chiefships and absolute autocracy — this is why Naga society is an anthropological goldmine.” Universal values “Your life, under head-hunting conditions, depended on another person, and blood relationship was important. However, not just blood relationships, friendship also mattered a lot,” explains Chasie. “Different clans had their brother clans in every other village and even tribes where Tenyimia were concerned.” Tenyimia consists of 10 different Naga tribes: Angami, Chakhesang, Zeme, Liangmai, Rongmei, Poumai, Mao, Maram, Rengma, and Pochury. Along with head-hunting, the grand ‘Feast of Merit’ constitutes the basis of Naga social life. Traditionally considered the highest form of social honour, the ‘Feast of Merit’ includes rituals and involves giving a community feast to the whole village. Among the Chakhesang tribe, only those who have performed the ‘Feast of Merit’ are entitled to wear the prestigious shawls, Hapidasa and Saparadu. They can also adorn their homes with Hapiteh, a wood carving of the buffalo head, which is also symbolised in the Hapidasa shawl. Seno Tsuhah, a community development worker, says that communities in Nagaland come together not only during times of crisis, but also to celebrate milestones or address important issues. “The value-based community life and sense of belonging have always been strong in our society — if we look at our forefathers’ generations, the community cohesiveness, the universal values of compassion, were always there, and that is still binding us,” she says. When vegetables couldn’t be transported into the State during lockdown, Tsuhah noticed how several villagers started visiting community forests to forage and collect wild edible plants so they could share it with urban dwellers in cities such as Kohima. She was also happy that young people were taking the lead in cultivating fallow fields. The greatest realisation of the community, she points out, has been the importance of growing their own food. Joy of growing food The members of the Christo Naga’s Club are sure that their new initiatives will not stop after the pandemic. “Now, we are all grown up, living in towns and cities, and we barely get the time to experience the joy of farming. So, it was a personal rediscovery, going back to nature, cultivating our own food,” says Rosou Pohena, a veterinarian who is also president of the club. Around the same time, there have been conversations around local food in Chizami, a village perched in the hills of Phek district. Both at the church and community levels, the importance of growing one’s own food and making sure that the local food is strengthened, appreciated and acknowledged is emphasised. A year since the pandemic, families cultivating small plots of land have begun expanding their farming. Seno Tshuhah is very hopeful that communities will continue to uphold this practice; during the pandemic, the first example of solidarity shown to one another was sharing food. “Food is at the core of our community life,” she says. The pandemic has indeed brought people closer in Nagaland, says Dzüvichü. “It has taught me how important it is to help people in our own towns, both within our communities and beyond.” Richard Belho, an architect who also does social work, says that the pandemic helped people realise their own vulnerabilities. “People chose to become strong and started helping each other; we started hearing a lot of stories of people coming out of their comfort zones. The pandemic did light up that spirit in people.” Kire says there are several lessons to be learnt from the pandemic, including getting one’s priorities in order; creating awareness about the needs of low-income groups in our midst; and nurturing the entrepreneurial spirit among young people who carved out businesses and found new ways of earning an income. “I learned about the resilience of the human spirit even when it has received terrible blows, and also the abiding importance of family and finding new ways to care for each other,” she says.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Constellation of words||‘There are times in history when patterns of memories shift, geography is reconfigured and language unpredictably mutates.’ Recognising and explaining the new world that we inhabit at a time of tumultuous transformation then demands a conceptual, interpretive exercise that can help decode both where we are and where we are heading. When Raymond Williams compiled the iconic Keywords (1976), he was attempting to make sense of post-war Britain, an emerging society and culture where language and words no longer meant what they did earlier. His strategy was to select a set of keywords which would capture the unconscious consensus about value or social reality, words that would reflect not only that which bind us but also the tension of disagreement or division. To state sharply, keywords help provide an entry, a pathway to engaging with the ‘soul’ of a culture/society.  Imagining keywords for India, a country far more culturally and linguistically diverse than any other, with the possible exception of Papua New Guinea, with multiple histories and traditions, lifestyles, cultures and memories, any effort to draw out commonalities while respecting the divergencies and tensions is both ambitious and audacious. Not only because of the scale and diversity but also because the process of making and unmaking an India of our imagination has never settled. And yet, through all the tumult, there is a new India that is unfolding a new mingling that makes possible a bridging of differences. In the selection of 259 words drawn from multiple languages, both native and imported, this volume ‘seeks to provide via a constellation of words... a discourse mapping of the present that pertains to India, certainly, but also to a global world desperately in need of new vocabularies,’ in short keywords from as much as for India. Just think of the number of words /phrases from various Indian languages that have now been incorporated in the Oxford English dictionary. Hopefully, this ‘crossing over’ exercise will help foster an understanding of culture from a set of perspectives that counterbalance western ethnocentrism in an increasingly interconnected world. ‘Sogadu to Susegad’ The book brings together contributions from over 200 contributors from not just a variety of academic disciplines but fields of activity — from activists, performers, politicians, planners, scientists, philosophers and others. And while the book is in English, the words have been chosen from a wide range of Indian languages, though it is likely that some of them may not be comprehensible to all, say Sogadu (Kannada) or Susegad (Konkani) outside their cultural zone. The effort is collaborative. Second, unlike conventional scholarly texts where the focus is on high theory, philosophical concepts, this book makes a radical departure by foregrounding lived experience and material culture of common people. So words like atma, ahimsa, dharma, moksha are discussed alongside more commonplace offerings like lota, balti, jharoo . More playful are words like kismet, pyar, matlabi, adda, baat-cheet and new creations like love marriage, gharwapsi , acronyms like VIP or terms like settled and adjust. Each entry can become the basis for a thesis. Rich material Overall, the 259 words have been grouped under seven categories: classical, heritages; contemporary aesthetic modes; economic mantras, media and technological change; intimacies; emancipatory imaginaries; language and self-reflection; and politics and the political, providing rich material on inherited traditions, shared cultural aesthetics, notions of economic power, technological change, intimacies of everyday experience, the nature of freedom, the language of thought and the structure of political power. Together these provide a fascinating entry into contemporary India marked by a melange of discourses that makes for a dialogic, argumentative society. Scholars are likely to quibble over the selection/ absence of specific keywords or, for instance, the variation in the length of entry, writing style or complexity of treatment. But then, the editors make no claims to being either comprehensive or authoritative. Rather, the reader is invited into a process of engagement, to exorcise, disagree and elaborate on alternative meanings or readings of the words and phrases on offer. As a result the exercise remains an open-ended one, reflecting a task that is never complete, a truer representation of a society and culture that is constantly transforming.  Keywords for India is a fascinating book, simultaneously illuminating and exasperating. Fortunately, many of the entries are playful, suggestive of the many ways in which common people, not just scholars, appropriate and remould words and languages for multiple purposes. And, importantly, how they travel across cultures, regions, and groups, often in ways that surprise. As such it can be fruitfully read and enjoyed by experts and lay people. Hopefully, it will inspire others into a similar experiment, because only then can we move towards constructing alternative epistemologies of the South as we attempt a swaraj of ideas, a decolonising of our mind.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Burning hearts||The True History of the Conquest of New Spain is one of the most disturbing books you will ever read. You know how it ends: the Spanish conquistadors (conquerors) defeat the Aztecs and colonise Mexico. But nobody else in the book — the Aztecs and the mercenaries butchering them — knows the outcome because it is written in chronological fashion, like a travel diary. The writer was one of the mercenaries himself — a man named Bernal Díaz del Castillo (1492–1584), who writes in the first person. Brave fight He participated in most or all of the over 100 battles and skirmishes that took the Spanish force, numbering only a few hundred, to the capital and led to their ultimate victory over the king of the Aztecs, Montezuma. The Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, a man in his 30s, was able to prevail purely because of technology: the Aztecs fought with arrows, darts, slings and daggers made of obsidian, a kind of stone. They wore padded cotton as protection. The Spaniards carried guns, cannon, crossbows and swords made of steel. They also had over a dozen horses, unknown in the new world and introduced to America by Cortés in 1519. On top, Cortés and his men knew military drill and how to keep formation. The Aztecs had no experience of modern battle. As a result, although they were brave — Díaz says so — they could not stop the small band of Spanish soldiers from slowly but surely making their way to Mexico City (then called Tenochtitlan) after an expedition that went on over more than 600 km and took nine months. At the end of it, they forced their way into the palace and held the king hostage for months while enjoying his hospitality. Montezuma was killed on June 29, 1520, apparently by his own people who were angered and ashamed of the humiliation that their nation had been put through. Díaz was writing a few decades after the fighting began with the aim to correct what had been written about the expedition before him. Previous works by Spanish writers had been critical of the conquistadors’ brutality. Díaz writes that Cortés (whom Díaz admired) and his men did what they had to do. Díaz was in his 20s when he went on the expedition and wrote the book five decades later, when he was in his 70s. But he likely kept notes because the details he provides are quite vivid. Of the ruler of the Aztecs, Díaz tells us: “The Great Montezuma was about 40 years old, of good height, well-proportioned, spare and slight, and not very dark, though of the usual Indian complexion. He did not wear his hair long but just over his ears, and he had a short black beard, well-shaped and thin. His face was rather long and cheerful, he had fine eyes, and in his appearance and manner could express geniality or, when necessary, a serious composure. He was very neat and clean, and took a bath every afternoon. He had many women as his mistresses, the daughters of chieftains, but two legitimate wives who were Caciques in their own right, and only some of his servants knew of it.” Unlike others, Montezuma was “quite free from sodomy” (one wonders how Díaz knew that). Held captive One of the reasons why the Spaniards were able to distance themselves from their actions was that the Aztecs practised human sacrifice. Díaz describes the scene: “There were some smoking braziers of their incense, which they call copal, in which they were burning the hearts of three Indians whom they had sacrificed that day, and all the walls of that shrine were so splashed and caked with blood that they and the floor too were black. Indeed, the whole place stank abominably… the walls of this shrine also were so caked with blood and the floor so bathed in it that the stench was worse than that of any slaughterhouse in Spain. They had offered that idol five hearts from the day’s sacrifices.” Díaz is not a scholar, merely an infantryman, and gives us no insight into why the Aztecs did what they did. He merely reports what he sees. There is page after page of detail that puts us at the centre of the action and holds us captive as we all — the conquistadors, the Aztecs, Montezuma and us, the reader — head to that inevitable and unjust end.  Díaz is not a scholar, merely an infantryman, and gives us no insight into why the Aztecs did what they did||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/burning-hearts/article34010430.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Mahjong magic||The Chinese Lunar New Year of the Ox dawned on February 12. During the New Year holidays in China and the Far East, Mahjong is the favoured traditional game played by young and old and men and women in family get-togethers and social clubs. The board game originally from China has permutations and combinations added from Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. It has a big presence in the Army cantonments in India. A prerogative of the British Army wives, Mahjong is now a safe legacy with the wives of the Indian officers. Every Army club hosts a Mahjong table or two; civilian clubs too have them now. Yours truly was indoctrinated at Deolali in 1967; the fascination simply won me over as I continue to play even to this day! Played with 144 tiles, originally in ivory, bone or bamboo, Mahjong is a game of four players. The play evolves from 13 tiles that are dealt with in a complicated way. One needs to see this in action to get an idea! The beauty of the game lies in making “hands” so diverse that one’s grey cells must be on the alert to switch, change, modify and declare completion by “going or calling” Mahjong with the 14th tile! In Hong Kong and Singapore, I taught a number of Indian women this fascinating game, and I am delighted that they play it avidly. One can play with strangers online too. A useful diversion during the lockdown! A lovely pastime for the retired and not so young, Mahjong vies with Bridge and Sudoku in the usage of the brain and hence is advocated as a deterrent to dementia and cognitive disorders. Besides mastering the amazing repertoire of hands, patience, attention, focus and equanimity are additional boons. There is social bonding, friendship, a sense of sharing and caring, a measure of give and take. It’s never about winning! It’s more about the best “hands” one can make. The measure of extra doubles makes for great fun! This bonding helps in sharing trivia and problems, and the pressure cooker of daily stress gets released. These are the magical moments of Mahjong! One looks forward eagerly to the weekly Mahjong play date, never mind that we are all well past 80. premrajan4@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/mahjong-magic/article34010428.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Then a hero comes along||Barefoot and wearing a langot , a little boy scurries across the baked red earth, his eyes and mind fixed firmly on the path ahead. Then the camera zooms out to give us an ominous view: “In the distance, silhouetted by the now bright sun, stand some large, menacing, sharp-edged machines.” It’s in these visual descriptions, with the feel of a screenplay, almost, that Devashish Makhija’s Oonga shows itself to be The Book of the Film. The young adult novel is an adaptation of Makhija’s 2013 film of the same name, which never got a commercial release. The little boy is our hero, the eponymous Oonga, who belongs to the Dongria Kondh adivasi community. Their village is located in a hotspot of conflict between Naxalites and the CRPF, with a corporation manoeuvring malevolently in the background. Makhija gives us perspectives from each camp and succeeds in humanising most characters, from Hemla the tribal teacher who tries to thread the elusive needle of the non-violent middle path, to those driven to outlawry as a result of (graphically described) state-inflicted violence, to the sons of farmers trying to make a living in the security forces. Even those who inhabit the darker shades of grey, like Pradip of the CRPF, spring surprises. In the midst of all this is Oonga, who wants nothing more than to metamorphose into his hero, Rama. Only, this Rama is the prince of the forest, fighting to rescue his bride, the daughter of the earth, from a ten-headed industrial horror. There is zero subtlety in how any of this is conveyed, but it serves as a timely reminder of the plural and occasionally subaltern Ramas who have always lived beyond the grasp of hegemonic beliefs. One aspect where there is some subtlety is the air of the supernatural, around a certain character in particular. It’s done with enough restraint to avoid importing clichés about shamanism and closeness to nature. The narrative prose achieves a healthy level of staccato. Overall, it’s a decent read that addresses urgent real-life problems and doesn’t shy away from depicting very real horrors.

A collection of poetry titled The Kolkata Cadence might thus make the reader apprehensive but, fortunately, the poems mostly escape that trap. There is the standard romanticisation of Kolkata’s old red houses, dingy lanes and its particular brand of rain, but it is to be found only in certain poems that falter. Kushal Poddar’s poems stand out for offering something more than the hackneyed Kolkata of tram, rickshaw and river; ‘Our Bodies of Water’ and ‘Straightjacket’ are layered with a surreal quality. Linda Ashok’s ‘Gift’ and ‘You Ask If This Is Love’ offer novelty of thought. Sufia Khatoon’s ‘The Pomegranate Tree’, which concludes the collection, paints some intriguing and affective pictures. Some poems by Amit Shankar Saha and Joie Bose are original and unflinching. When talking of Kolkata, people tend to get nostalgic, which leads to a misplaced glorification of this relic of a city. There are poems in this vein here — all loss and mourning that do not make for much originality. Take, for example, Bina Sarkar Ellias’ poem, ‘Calcutta’, that lumps together “asphalt, cement and a cacophony of Bollywood songs”. Is this a mourning for nature that has given way to the capitalistic urban or an expression of the conviction that the anterior is necessarily superior? Also, nobility of intention alone cannot make for great art. Sanjukta Dasgupta’s feminist poem, ‘Sita’s Sisters’, may have worked as a spoken-word piece, but leaves something to be desired by way of craft on the page. Then there’s Arnab Chatterjee’s interpretation of eunuchs in his poem: “They who can never deliver/ come to deliver joy.” This is reductive at best and tone-deaf at worst. The best poems are really not about the city at all — they are the more abstract and personal ones. Yet, they too are about Kolkata in the sense that they eulogise the mirage city of the mind. While some might say nostalgia is a grave failing, it is also a wonderfully romantic one. For that reason, this collection may be worth a read. The reviewer is a freelance journalist.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Faithful to a fault||Suppose you are regarded as a venerable fount of wisdom. What kind of disciple would you want for yourself? Obviously, one who is completely faithful to your sentiments, who conveys your thoughts exactly as expressed, who invariably upholds your authority. So it may seem, at first blush. But is this really so? I think you would soon find yourself wishing that this earnest disciple of yours was not quite so earnest. That he did not keep insisting on your every saying. Perhaps you would even start yearning for some obscurity, so that your wisdom may have some wiggle room, and the reputation that hangs on it may not always be weighing upon you. Unless, of course, you were invincibly convinced of your own perfection. I would not ascribe such egotism to the  Mahabharata. So it seems to me that Keerthik Sasidharan’s The Dharma Forest , a 500-page tome that is only the beginning of a trilogy, is doing the epic a subtle injury. Subtle, because Sasidharan certainly does not darken the tale by crude falsifications; and yet an injury, because by the naivete of his diligence, he ends up dragging it into a bad light. The book is structured as stories of the Kurukshetra war, being recounted to a dying Krishna by Jara, the hunter who has shot him by accident. There are three main segments that focus, respectively, on Bhishma, Draupadi, and Arjuna. Thanks to Sasidharan’s powerful imagination, the reader is amply transported to their world. The encampments of the weary and wounded, the histrionic violence of the battlefield, the other-worldly characters, their jealousies and rivalries and ruminations, their contracts with the gods, who watch them with pleasure and anxiety, Krishna with his beatific smiles — and dharma with its exacting tolls: these are the elements of the epic, and these are also the elements of the book. The reader who is interested in something more modern and critical, perhaps regarding the social or gender relations of the epic, will not find it in Sasidharan’s telling. That is his prerogative. But it is one thing to avoid a critical perspective on source material, another to be fascinated, in helpless fidelity, by its most grotesque aspects. Air of wisdom In The Dharma Forest , the grotesquerie of the whole story is firmly on display. One encounters astronomical violence, mind-boggling body counts, and visceral descriptions of mutilated bodies. One sees what it is to be the wife of five warlike men, noting, in particular, the sexual callisthenics it may involve. And one breathes the air of wisdom that blankets it all; that sweetly delivers sweet-sounding words to reconcile oppressive vows, expedient chicanery and continuous bloodshed with dharma . But, someone might object, all these things are a part of the story. They are indeed a part of the story, and yet are so psychologically fraught in their interplay that angels must fear to tread where The Dharma Forest rushes in. It should be noted that the extremism of the Mahabharata — the ‘next level’ that it reaches, surpassing the war epics of other cultures — owes precisely to the fact that its characters have caught hold of such a lofty notion as dharma . Just as killing and vowing and revenging begin to naturally pall on them, dharma arrives, not only to justify but also to spur exponential killing and vowing and revenging. In this way, the Mahabharata avoids the explicit sense of tragedy that is typically the keynote of ancient classics. But the whole process is really not pleasant to look at. It is unpleasant as regards the deeds it produces and the metaphysics it propagates in relation to those deeds. Lacking sobriety And the combined presentation of all these factors is the most appalling. Thankfully, one usually doesn’t encounter this. A philosophical study of the Mahabharata might not linger on the cruelty; another may well do so, but might innocently leave out the metaphysics; even a comprehensive rendering could separate the two in the telling (just as the dialogue of the Gita may be abstracted from the rest of the tale). But The Dharma Forest is faithful unto foolishness, realistic unto distastefulness, and does not seem to notice the effect of its handling because of its intoxication with the material. In this connection, it is notable that the character whom Sasidharan treats most impatiently is Yudhishtira. Yudhishtira, who at least tries to navigate the world of thought alongside (not abstracted from) the world of action, is frequently confounded by what he is doing. This happens because he is sober-minded enough to retain doubts about it all. But he is portrayed as something of a neurotic. Sobriety is precisely the quality that is lacking in The Dharma Forest (and, incidentally, in its oblivious blurbs). On the other hand, intoxication can wear off suddenly and surprisingly, and Sasidharan is probably too skilful a writer to always remain in it. I look forward to the rest of this trilogy. The writer is the author, most recently, ofThe Outraged: Times of Strife.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A ‘museum’ of forgotten stories from the borderlands||“Panitar’s division is as cruel as it is arbitrary: here, the houses on either side of one dusty lane occupy two neighbouring countries. Where India ends and Bangladesh begins is a question confused by history, family and the border pillars themselves.” Panitar has a one-foot-high concrete block on the side of the mighty Ichamati river marked ‘Border Pillar No.1’. In her new book Midnight’s Borders , Suchitra Vijayan includes a photo of the pillar, which becomes a cricket stump for boys on either side of the border most days. As she travelled 9000 miles over seven years across India’s borders, some drawn so hastily that they cut across fields, homes and courtyards, she met men, women and children, finishing with “endless notebooks, over a thousand images and more than 300 hours of recorded conversations.” Her quest took her to the farthest ends of the India-Bangladesh/ China/ Myanmar/ Pakistan borders. Through these real histories of the people, she gives readers another perspective on old wounds like Partition and new divisionary tactics like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Lines that divide It was not going to be easy as she quickly found out. Travel to States like Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland in the Northeast which share borders with China and Myanmar required Inner Line Permits, BSF soldiers followed her everywhere on the West Bengal/ Bangladesh border, and in Kashmir she was summoned to meet the local inspector at Uri. From the margins Vijayan began her journey in Kolkata. Even as 70% of the border with Bangladesh has been fenced, “smugglers, drug couriers, human traffickers and cattle rustlers continue to cross to ply their trades.” All along the border, the common refrain is, “It feels like Partition is still alive.” A story from near Jalpaiguri in north Bengal, that of a man named Ali, is heartbreaking. When Vijayan meets him, he is inside his home with all the windows closed and sealed to snuff out light. “The border runs through him,” his friend Jamshed had told Vijayan, “He is almost gone, but I don’t want his story to be gone too.” Ali lived right on the edge of the India-Bangladesh border. When fencing began, he became trapped in a no-man’s land, his marriage to a girl from Bangladesh ended with each being stranded on either side and he never got out of the cycle of debt and struggle, finally losing the ability to dream. “They took my land, they stole my life, they stole my future, they took my nightmares and they stole my dreams too.” Ali went missing in 2018. In Assam, Vijayan met people devastated by the National Register of Citizens process, with names of long-time residents missing from the final list, and in Kashmir she spent time with a family mourning the loss of their son in an ‘encounter’. At Fazilka near the Pakistan border, she ran into Sari Begum, who had a bunker on her land but had a darker story of pain and violence from the days of Partition. No outsiders The complexities of the Naga peace process were apparent on a visit to remote villages of Tuensang district where many of the women remained silent with others admitting they had never encountered an outsider, except Indian soldiers. In Nellie (Assam) too, where over 3,000 Muslims were killed in 1983, people stared at Vijayan in confusion, ‘no one comes here anymore’, she was told. Bhawan Singh, who photographed the Nellie massacre, said he had never seen anything like it. Fearful of the future he asked quietly, “Where did all this hate come from, where is it going to take us?” echoing what many residents had told her. By looking beyond maps to create a “museum of forgotten stories,” Vijayan has given voice to those who live on the fringes like Ali or Sari. The black and white pictures accompanying the chapters add a thousand words more.

He had actually arrived almost three months earlier but couldn’t report the news. In doing so he also had defeated his greatest rival, the British explorer Robert Scott. What place is Amundsen the first recorded human being to reach? 2Almost all great civilisations are built on the banks of permanent rivers, with multiple countries being built on one river as is the case in Europe. There are, however many countries in areas that do not have rivers at all. The largest country not to have a single river is officially a kingdom. Which country is this that has ‘wadis’ that are intermittently dry valleys? 3The second largest country in the world has half of all of the natural lakes in the world (563). An impressive 14% of the country’s land area is covered by freshwater lakes. That’s roughly 25% of the world’s wetlands, making it the largest wetland area in the world. Most of these lakes were created by glacial erosion. Which country is this? 4A large part ofJurassic Parkwas shot on this island, whose lush greenery and undisturbed natural environment was the perfect setting for the dinosaurs to come to life. It is also home to the largest volcano, and technically the tallest mountain in the world. Which island is this that is also the only State in its country without a single straight line in its borders? 5This desert is currently going through a dry spell and is expected to be green again in about 15,000 years. The name of the desert means ‘Desert’ in a dialect of Arabic, so if you were to translate the name, it literally means ‘Desert desert’. It is technically the third largest desert in the world, although people usually think it’s number one. Which humongous desert is this? 6Þingvellir National Park in Iceland is one of only two places in the entire world where you can see two certain geological features above the earth’s surface. (The other place is in Africa.) These two features have been moving apart over history at a rate of 2 cm a year. In the gap between them, there is a lake where you can go diving. The two features are known as ‘North American’ and ‘Eurasian’, and in other places when they move, they usually cause natural disasters. What are these two features that are responsible for the world looking how it is today? 7Point Nemo is a place on Earth where if you were there, you would be the furthest from the closest land. The nearest person would be 2,688 km away from you. You can find it on Google Earth at 48°52.6′S 123°23.6′W. If you pass Point Nemo at the right time of day, you’ll be closer to the astronauts in the International Space Station, some 400 km up in space, than any other human on earth. Where in the world is Point Nemo? 8The Dragon’s Triangle is a region south of Tokyo that is considered to have paranormal properties. According to researchers, many modern ships and several hundred crews were lost without a trace within this area due to sudden electrical and electronic failures and major disruptions in the compass. It has often been called the Asian twin of a more popular area found in the Atlantic Ocean. What is the name of the area in the Atlantic that has similar properties with more disastrous outcomes? 9This football stadium in the city of Macapa (Brazil) is nicknamed ‘Zerão’ or ‘the Big Zero’ and is located in a neighbourhood called ‘Marco Zero’.

The total Exclusive Economic Zone (the ocean area over which they have rights) covered by this country is about 3.5 million square kilometres.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The return of the forest owlet||Prachi Mehta was always fascinated by owls. When she was a student of wildlife biology in 1997, birders spotted a forest owlet perched on a bare teak tree in northwestern Maharashtra. The news sent the birding world into a tizzy. Although the species doesn’t lurk in the dark nor frequent remote mountain valleys, it had dodged ornithologists for more than a hundred years. Mehta saw her first forest owlet almost a decade after it had been discovered again. The small bird, about half the size of a house crow, was asleep on a leafless teak tree in Melghat Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra. The forest owlet has an uncanny resemblance to the more common spotted owlet that inhabits many a backyard across India. But its white belly shining in the bright morning sun immediately sets the bird apart. Unlike most other owls, this species hunts during the day, when it is visible and exposed to assaults by others. Every bird, from tits to treepies, mobs this diminutive predator, and large raptors make a meal of it. Unnerving look The researcher and her field assistant took in the rare bird’s broad head, powerful talons, and its beak covered with the dry blood of its last victim. Sensing their eyes on it, the bird opened one eye and then the other, and bobbed its head from side to side like a cat. “In fact, owls are cats with wings,” she says. “They have a similar unnerving look.” After confirming the humans were merely being curious, it closed its eyes and went back to sleep. That moment when it had peered at them with wide-eyed innocence melted her heart. “Owls are not beautiful in the traditional sense as peacocks are, but they look very human.” Over the following years, Mehta would trek through forests of Central India, from Odisha to Gujarat, locating the forest owlet in previously unknown locations. The species isn’t found in any other country. Restricted area Back in the 1870s and 1880s, the earliest reports suggested it wasn’t a common bird. Today, it has forsaken many of its former haunts in Odisha and Chattisgarh, harried by logging and encroachments. It remains restricted to a narrow belt, extending about 650 kilometres along Maharashtra’s northern border with Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where it is known as ran pingada in Marathi and dooda in Korku, the dialect of the Korku indigenous community in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Even along this strip, the owlet is relegated to scattered patches, hunting insects, reptiles, and mice in the neighbouring fields. “Its ability to hunt in agricultural areas gives a false impression that it is adaptable, that it doesn’t need forests,” says Mehta. She cites an incident as an example of why dense jungles are essential for the bird’s survival. Mehta had come upon a forest owlet family and marvelled at two youngsters huddled close to a parent in the soft glowing evening light. The other parent, presumably the father, arrived and offered a mouse to his mate. She transferred it to a chick which bolted it down whole. An eagle owl disturbed this domestic tranquillity when it glided overhead. The young birds scrambled for a hiding place, but they had outgrown their nest hole. They cowered in fright until the danger passed. Two days later, however, Mehta noticed a scattering of feathers, the only remains of the fledglings, under the tree. They had become prey, after all. “Tree cavities are very important as refuges for the species,” says Mehta. “The forest owlet might find food near human settlements, but such areas don’t have old trees with hollows of the right size.” The earlier instance of the species being lost-and-found may have been due to birders’ inability to spot it. If it disappears again, looking harder will not resurrect the forest owlet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-return-of-the-forest-owlet/article34010451.ece

A jump to four of a red suit, after a one no trump bid by partner, transfers to the next higher suit. This applies even after a bid by the opponents. The 10 of clubs lead, and the auction, suggested that East had the singleton jack and the clubs weren’t splitting 3-2. In addition, West probably had the ace of hearts and perhaps the ace of diamonds as well. It looked bleak, but South found a way home. He won the opening club lead with dummy’s ace and led a spade to his ace. When that felled the queen, South continued with the king of spades and a spade to the jack, drawing trumps. The king of clubs was next, followed by a club to the queen. When declarer led a fourth club, he could have ruffed it and relied on East holding the ace of diamonds, but he did much better. He discarded a heart from dummy! West won the trick with his 10 of clubs and did his best by leading the ace of hearts. Had South ruffed this he would have lost three diamond tricks, but he discarded a diamond instead. West had no choice now but to give South an entry with one of the red kings and South had his contract.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The art of the laugh lines||Humour tickles everyone in the universe, if not often, at least once in a while. Though the general belief is that laughter hardly solves life’s problems, it does help overcome situations not so pleasant. Those with the funny bone and a freewheeling give-and-take attitude are found to be less egoistic and more successful in relationships. Some of our legendary artists were known for their impromptu jokes and repartee, cracking them the way they sprinkled manodharma on stage. When the violin maestro Tirumakudalu Chowdiah played Raga Kapi brilliantly while accompanying Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar in a concert, the legendary musician, during a pause, extolled: “Mine is an ordinary Kapi, and here is the Nescafe.” On song On a train journey, a music lover asked Chembai, “Sir, are you Ariyakudi?” He nodded “no” with his hallmark smile. After a while, the bemused aficionado asked, “Then, are you Semmankudi?” Chembai threw back, “I am simply Chembai, no kudi ,” punning on the word kudi which in Tamil and Malayalam means drinking alcohol. Decades ago at a U.S. airport, seeing Ustad Vilayat Khan carry a sitar, an airline staffer, ignorant of who the great musician was, dropped a comment, “Ravi Shankar is a legendary sitarist.” Khan saheb shot back, “Huh, Ravi just passed away.” Those aware of the Ustad’s temperament and the issues that he and Pandit Ravi Shankar had right from their first (and last) concert together during their teenage years can understand the black humour. Once, Ambatt Shankaran Menon (1851-1894), an acclaimed Kathakali actor, began his performance as Duryodhana in the play Utharaswayamvaram without waiting for the arrival of the Eralppatu Thampuran, the local ruler. By the time the Thampuran arrived, the first scene, a captivating erotic act with intricate techniques and rigid grammar of the art, was over. Instructions went to Menon to repeat it. But he did not oblige. Next morning, summoned by an annoyed Thampuran, Menon politely said it was Duryodhana who was on stage, and not Shankaran who would have obeyed the command. The Thampuran yelled, “My order was to Ambatt Shankaran and not to Duryodhana.” Menon was quick to submit that it was an act of sambhoga shringara (eroticism of sexual union) and “Shankaran is not that young to repeat such things immediately.” The amused king let him off with a token punishment — no remuneration for the performance, and he was to re-enact the role that evening “to see whether he is strong enough to repeat it then”. During a Chakyarkoothu performance, the Chakyar happened to narrate the story of a cat-eyed king. The ruler of the province was also cat-eyed and taking it as a jibe, he ordered that the Chakyar be arrested. Early next morning, the king, holding his “ready-to-chop” sword, asked, “What do you feel now?” The Chakyar knew death was close, but said politely, “Now I am like a mouse in front of a cat.” The king burst into laughter and honoured him for his humour even when facing death.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Fresh insight into Ghalib’s world||I had expected the new ‘critical biography’, Ghalib: A Wilderness at my Doorstep (Allen Lane) to be a biography for the ordinary Ghalib fan. I should have known better. Its author, Mehr Afshan Farooqi, is the daughter of Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, whose demise last year deprived India of one of its most brilliant writer-scholars. Not surprisingly, while Ghalib contains much of interest to the serious Ghalib fan (a description that does not include all those who attribute every amorous couplet to ‘Chacha Ghalib’), it is, above all, an original work of serious scholarship. Calcutta years In some areas, such as the relationship of Ghalib’s Persian and Urdu writings, the influence of his Calcutta years on Ghalib’s oeuvre, a critical chronology of the various manuscripts of his poetry, and the impact of print on his production and reception, this book is a path-breaking work of the sort that Shamsur Rahman Faruqi would have been proud of. Such elements have been carefully researched, for Mehr Farooqi shows a clear awareness of the holes that remain to be plugged in these areas. As she sums up towards the end of the study, “I have engaged with Ghalib’s trajectory in Urdu and Persian, poetry and prose. I have used Ghalib’s sojourn to Calcutta as an important signpost in his career graph for three reasons: first, Ghalib’s exposure to and awareness of the power of print; second, his increased output in Persian; and third, his preparation of a selection of his Urdu poetry.” This is not an easy book to read, if you are the ‘Chacha Ghalib’ kind of poetry lover. But it repays the effort. It uncovers or repositions much about Ghalib and his mysteriously appearing and disappearing manuscripts — something surely awaiting a novel by a South Asian Umberto Eco. As necessary background, it also provides a glimpse of the literary culture of the age, a time that thought of composition, literature and books quite differently from how we do today. Mehr Farooqi makes the convincing case that, in this respect, Ghalib was somewhere in between, and his awareness of the change that was coming helped him position his own work in ways that might have prevented them from being eroded by time. Switch from Persian One cannot help noticing that Ghalib’s career as a writer contained a switch from Persian to Urdu. After initial years of composition in Urdu, he switched to composing almost exclusively in Persian — Mehr Farooqi connects it to his Calcutta years — and then returned to Urdu. His career as an author has shown a similar kind of shift: from his own privileging of his Persian works over his Urdu compositions to the almost exclusive focus that critics have put on his Urdu poetry and letters at the expense of his Persian compositions. It strikes me that, in recent years, a comparable shift has been taking place: from major works on Ghalib in Urdu, which were rarely translated into English, to significant critical and biographical interventions in English, informed by scholarship in both Persian and Urdu. Mehr Farooqi’s Ghalib is a major landmark on this new and necessary path.  The reviewer is an Indian novelist and academic who teaches in Denmark.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The mosquito roast||Dear Agony Akka,  I am a resident of Chennai since last five years and each year the mosquito menace is getting more and more out of control. In public places I find myself scratching and swatting my body in various awkward places. My arms and legs are beginning to be filled with scabs and red bite marks. Eating buffet dinners is already a difficult task and when these are held outdoors, it becomes impossible — I have to balance plate in one hand, cutlery in the other, and then the mosquitoes begin biting and I have no hands left to swat them. Two days back we went for socially distanced dinner to a neighbour’s house and whole evening I spent swatting mosquitoes and not being able to focus on the chitchat. When we came home, my husband told me it was bad manners to kill mosquitoes when you are a guest. Is this true? Are there any etiquette rules regarding mosquito problem? —Mauled and Desperate   Dear MAD,  If you had even an iota of historical knowledge, you will know that more than 10,000 years ago our ancient Indian civilisation had invented full-body saris and dhotis and salwar-kameez to counter precisely this mosquito menace only. That is why we need to bring back sanskari clothing — not to encourage modesty but to discourage malaria. Now if you modern people are going to wander around in shorts and miniskirts and sleeveless tops, how can you expect to keep mosquitoes away? After all, it is the nature of mosquito to bite bare skin, just like it is nature of menfolk to rape. That is why sensible people like award-winning actresses and judges are always telling us that it is in our own hands to prevent rape and mosquito bites. Backward move In my own building society, I am always advising women to go back to ghoonghats or burquas — not only can you save money on facials and make-up items, you can be saved from mosquitoes as well. If you also fully cover arms and legs, then you can also save money on waxing. And no longer will you be writing letters complaining about scabs and red blobs on skin. Your husband is absolutely correct — it is bad manners to go to someone’s house and keep swatting mosquitoes. You will only make the hostess feel bad. Mind you, I have always happily swatted away, but I am very charming and can get away with all this. I am not sure you can. Instead, you could invest in frilly, long-sleeved blouses like heroines in old Bengali films and keep these for all outdoor affairs. You will look cool and also become mosquito-proof. Take it up Alternatively, I also suggest colour-coordinated mosquito bats. Like matching masks, learn to carry a bat with you. Not only can you use it on mosquitoes, but you can even zap all those men who feel compelled to call you dear and put their arm around your shoulders. I am personally deeply against the idea of buffet dinners where they don’t even give you a spot to sit. Balancing plate, cutlery, wine glass, mosquitoes and octopus-type males is well-nigh impossible even for Indian women who are supposed to be the embodiment of Shakti and Durga and whatnot. One useful skill to pick up, especially for those all-night bhajan affairs and community puja functions, is to learn to coordinate the mosquito swats on various parts of your body with the clapping of the cymbals and drums. People will think you are filled with religious fervour and also that you keep the beat really well. This can only stand you in good stead in the days up ahead.  — AA  agony.akka@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/the-mosquito-roast/article34010447.ece

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Kerala’s delayed approach towards herd immunity||From mid-February, a spike in daily new cases was reported from a few States including Maharashtra. For days on end, the Health Ministry kept repeating the message that Kerala too was “witnessing an upsurge of daily new cases”. Even as recently as March 6, the Health Ministry wrongly implicated Kerala for the surge in cases when it said “Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka continue to report a surge in the COVID-19 daily new cases.” Kerala continues to contribute a high number of cases on a daily basis. However, there has not been any surge or spike in daily cases, as seen in other States. In reality, Kerala has been witnessing a steady decline in daily cases since end-January. “From a second peak of 6,078 seven-day moving average of daily cases as on January 23, we have been seeing a steady decline in cases in Kerala. There has been a 50% decline in the seven-day moving average of daily cases from the fourth week of January to March 4,” says Dr. Rijo John, Health Economist and Consultant based in Kochi, Kerala. “The seven-day moving average of daily cases in Kerala as on March 4 was 2,996. The absolute number of daily cases on March 4 was 2,616.” While other States have reduced the number of daily tests in recent months, Kerala has been continuing with the same number of daily tests. “The seven-day average daily tests conducted was over 60,000 when the test positivity rate was 15% during the peak in the first half of October last year. Now, even when the test positivity rate is under 5% seven-day average, the average testing has increased to 70,000 since the first week of February,” says Dr. John. “Keeping daily testing at high levels even when daily cases are declining inspires more confidence that the decline in daily cases is real and is not due to reduced testing,” Dr. John adds. Maharashtra and Gujarat have not increased testing despite reporting more cases on a daily basis. While the rest of the country witnessed a peak in mid-September when the daily fresh cases touched nearly 98,000 on September 16, Kerala witnessed a peak a month later in mid-October. Unlike other States that witnessed a steady decline in daily cases, there were a reduced number of daily cases in Kerala since mid-October, but the numbers continued to stay high and did not steadily decline to low levels. First wave “The first wave is yet to decline in Kerala. The daily cases have plateaued in the State for a long time and are now seeing a decline,” says Dr. Raman Gangakhedkar, former chief epidemiologist of ICMR who was a part of the national COVID-19 task force till he retired in June last year. “There has not been any resurgence of cases lately [in Kerala].” According to Dr. Giridhara Babu, epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru, the decline in cases since late January could be due to high infection rate that is close to herd immunity needed for the decline to begin. As on March 5, over 0.8 million people have been vaccinated in the State. “It is too early to say that vaccination could have contributed much to the decline. The number of people vaccinated is not large enough to have significantly contributed to the decline,” says Dr. Babu. “If the seven-day average test positivity rate stays below 5% for a few weeks it indicates that the pandemic is under control,” says Dr. Gautam Menon, Professor of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University and co-author of COVID-19 modelling studies. Dr. Menon attributes the decline in daily cases to the long duration of background seroprevalence across the State, and so new infections are only expected to decline. “The long plateauing of cases has ensured a good fraction of people have experienced an infection. In the circumstances, one can expect a decline in daily numbers across the State. But the only way to check this is through serosurvey,” Dr. Menon adds. “My guess is that about 40% of the population would have been infected. This is just my guess.” Based on anecdotal evidence, Dr. Menon says aggressive tracing and quarantining would have contributed to the decline in cases. “Unlike Kerala, other States have not been able to pick up a steady increase in cases in the rural areas,” he says. Herd immunity? Refuting the possibility of widespread infection in the population taking it close to herd immunity contributing to the decline in cases, Kerala Health Secretary Dr. Rajan N. Khobragade says that as per the third countrywide serosurvey conducted by the ICMR between December 17, 2020 and January 8, 2021, the seropositivity in the State was only about 11.5%. “So nearly 82% of the population in the State have not got infected,” Dr. Khobragade says. Dr. Khobragade’s assertion of low seroprevalence in the State is supported by Dr. Anurag Agrawal, Director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), a CSIR lab in Delhi. “The second serosurvey carried out across CSIR labs found Kerala had the lowest seropositivity,” says Dr. Agrawal. “The State has managed to stretch the curve such that the new infections are spread out over a longer period of time. The State also continues to undertake more testing and reporting,” Dr. Agrawal says. “For the first six months, the outbreak was minimal in the State. We have been undertaking active case finding in the State. Anyone with influenza-like illness is tested for coronavirus infection,” Dr. Khobragade says. Dr. Khobragade also cites 30-40% bed occupancy for patients with COVID-19 as proof that the State did not experience large-scale spread of the virus in the population. “Our healthcare system was never overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. There has been not one instance when COVID-19 patients have been denied admission in a hospital due to bed shortage,” he says. Talking about the pioneering efforts undertaken by the State, Dr. Khobragade cites the post-COVID-19 care and management provided to people experiencing problems after recovering from COVID-19 disease. “Kerala is the only State to provide post-COVID care and management to people. As a result, we have collected sufficient post-COVID-19 data,” Dr. Khobragade asserts. There are 1,284 post-COVID-19 clinics at primary health centres, taluk and general hospitals and medical colleges. Genome sequencing Kerala in collaboration with IGIB was the first to begin sequencing the genome of samples collected from all the 14 districts to identify any variants/escape mutants. “We began discussion with the State government in September, and the programme became operational in December,” says Dr. Agrawal. “They collect 25 samples from each district per week from people with high viral load, extract the RNA and ship the samples at low temperature. This really helps the operations as we can begin sequencing immediately on getting the samples. Their support is outstanding.” Over 1,000 samples sent from Kerala have been sequenced so far. “This is the largest number sequenced from any State,” adds Dr. Agrawal. “We did not find anything of concern, in terms of variants/mutations in the genomes we sequenced from Kerala.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/keralas-delayed-approach-towards-herd-immunity/article34010034.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Clustering educational institutes and research centres||National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) envisions establishing large multidisciplinary universities to promote research directed to solve contemporary national problems, and provides the option of setting up clusters of higher education institutes. Cluster-based universities would increase faculty strength, both in terms of numbers and diversity of disciplines, and facilitate conduct of research on real life problems. Mainstay of research Doctoral students are the mainstay of research in universities. In many countries including India, universities also conduct off-campus doctoral programmes in research laboratories. The Indian Institute of Science pioneered a variant of off-campus programme called External Registration programme which enabled employees working in laboratories or industries to register for a doctoral programme under the supervision of its faculty and carry out a major part of research at their workplace. The external registration programme has now been adopted by more higher education Institutes. The topic of research taken upunder off-campus programmes is always of relevance to the workplace. One could go a step further and make workplaces pursuing knowledge-based work a part of a cluster-based university. Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, established in 2005, by the Department of Atomic Energy, is a cluster-based university and I have had a long association with it. Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California, U.S., is a federally funded research and development centre managed by California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The intellectual environment and identity of JPL are profoundly shaped by its role as a part of Caltech. A large laboratory, JPL has about 6,000 full time employees, and Caltech was placed eighth in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) by Shanghai Rankings in 2020. SOKENDAI (the Graduate University for Advanced Studies) established in Japan in 1988 and running only doctoral programmes, brings together several research institutions and museums such as the National Museum of Japanese History. The Paris-Saclay University received its legal status in 2019, though it has been functioning as a “university system” since 2015. The university shares 275 laboratories with several research organisations, including CEA (Atomic Energy and Alternate Energies Commission), INSERM (French Institute of Health and Medical Research) and others. Though just accredited, Paris-Saclay university was placed fourteenth in ARWU by Shanghai Rankings in 2020. It is now one of the Europe’s biggest research universities. Common objective All countries have their unique legal framework for establishing universities, and therefore, while there are differences in the structure of HBNI, SOKENDAI, Paris-Saclay University, and Caltech, the objective is to benefit from synergies. It enables conducting academic research on focussed areas. It also enables pursuit of academic research and post-academic research in the same university, and results in faster deployment of results of research. Benefits can be seen from the growth and success of HBNI, which was ranked fourteenth a,pmg universities by NIRF-2020. Nature Index ranked HBNI at second position among all academic institutions in India during the period October 1, 2019 to 30 September 2020. Another example of a cluster-based university in India is the Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research established in 2011. Nature Index has ranked it at eighth position in India.  Different concepts India needs to earnestly pursue this model. Institutions for clustering in a university can be selected based on different concepts; some examples could be institutes managed by a Department or a Ministry or a Public Trust, institutes located in close proximity, institutes pursuing similar objectives etc. Many industry associations have established research centres and more could be encouraged to do. I will like to add a note of caution as well. In a cluster-based university, the ‘rewards system’ has to recognise all aspects of talent and all knowledge-based output. One may recall the advice given by P. B. Medawar to young scientists that “technicians are colleagues in a collaborative research”, and “despite their paper degrees”, young scientists have a lot to learn about research. This advice is more important today when complexity of experimental facilities is growing, and need not only competent technicians, but highly competent engineers, called scientific officers in national laboratories, for their design, construction, safe operation and maintenance. Scientific officers have deep insights about research capabilities of facilities. For moving away from single-discipline institutions to multi-disciplinary universities, clustering is a promising model to achieve a critical mass in a university to invigorate research.  (R. B.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||JNCASR team develops potential drug candidate for Alzheimer’s||Researchers from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bengaluru, have developed a small molecule that helps disrupt and reduce formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of mice with Alzheimer’s Disease. The group is planning to take this molecule, which is a potential drug candidate, forward for clinical studies. The results of their study were published in the journal Advanced Therapeutics.  Alzheimer’s worldwide The World Alzheimer Report 2015 which was an analysis of the prevalence, incidence, cost and trends in Alzheimer’s Disease documented the fact that in 2015, over 46 million people worldwide were living with dementia. The report estimated that this number would increase to more than 131.5 million by 2050. Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive and irreversible disorder of the brain, which affects memory and thinking skills. One main feature of the disease is the deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Amyloid precursor proteins play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease by producing the Amyloid-beta peptides of which in particular Amyloid Beta peptide 42 is particularly toxic in the formation of the amyloid plaques. This was targeted by the researchers, using the small molecule TGR63. Usually, in people, the symptoms start manifesting when they are in their sixties, though the onset is much earlier. In research that spans the course of a decade, the group led by T Govindaraju of JNCASR selected six candidate molecules TGR60-65, all of which had the same core structure, and put them through in vitro tests to see whether these could check the growth of amyloid plaques and also dissolve preformed ones. “All the designed compounds were screened through in vitro and cellular assays. The data from these experiments revealed superior activity of TGR63 and hence we took this molecule forward for animal studies,” says Prof. Govindaraju, who heads the Bioorganic Chemistry Laboratory at the institute.   Effect on mice Mice are often used as model animals to study Alzheimer’s Disease. When genetically modified to show Alzheimer’s, the disease starts manifesting at about 4-5 months, by 8-10 months there are mild symptoms and by 12-14 months they reach advanced stage of disease as indicated by amyloid plaques and cognitive decline and loss of memory. The experiment involved using transgenic mice which had Alzheimer’s Disease induced in them. The animals were subjected to three behavioural tests to verify that TGR63 really did reduce the amyloid burden and, furthermore, was not toxic to the mice. In one of the tests, the animals were let to swim in relatively large pool of water. A small plank was placed in a specific spot and the mice learnt to swim towards to spot and save themselves by climbing on to the plank. Later the mice were made to repeat the task, but the plank had now been removed. The behaviours of four categories of mice were observed – mice without Alzheimer’s, mice without Alzheimer’s which had been treated with TGR63, mice with Alzheimer’s which were treated with TGR63 and mice with Alzheimer’s which had not been treated with TGR63. In the above task, while the first three categories of mice swam back to the spot where they had learned to find the plank, the last category – mice with AD and no treatment – did not remember the way back. Brain analysis “Further, reduction of amyloid plaques was studied by brain analysis,” says Prof. Govindaraju. The ten-year-long research broadly evolved in five stages, according to him: design of the set of molecules; in vitro evaluation, in cellulo evaluation, computational study and in vivo evaluation and cognitive assessment. “I am in discussion with pharma companies to take TGR63 to clinical studies,” says Prof. Govindaraju.  The data from in vitro, cellular assays revealed superior activity of the small molecule. T.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Understanding human brains||How do modern human and Neanderthal brains differ? Using brain organoids – mini brains developed in a lab – built using stem cells, University of California San Diego School of Medicine researchers have been able to compare modern humans to other primates, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, which until now was not thought possible, particularly when the species is already extinct. The researchers catalogued the differences between the genomes of diverse modern human populations and the Neanderthals and Denisovans, who lived during the Pleistocene Epoch, approximately 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago. Mimicking an alteration they found in one gene, the researchers used stem cells to engineer ‘Neanderthalised’ brain organoids. The team initially found 61 genes that differed between modern humans and our extinct relatives (Science). One of these altered genes – NOVA1 – caught the researchers’ attention because it is a master gene regulator, influencing many other genes during early brain development. The researchers used CRISPR gene editing to engineer modern human stem cells with the Neanderthal-like mutation in NOVA1. Then they coaxed the stem cells into forming brain cells and ultimately Neanderthalised brain organoids, says a University press release. Neural network changes in Neanderthalised brain organoids parallel the way newborn non-human primates acquire new abilities more rapidly than human newborns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sci-tech-and-agri/understanding-human-brains/article34010028.ece
07 March 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi to get its own school education board: Kejriwal||The Delhi Cabinet on Saturday approved the setting up of the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE), Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said. The move follows the government’s decision to commence the ‘Deshbhakti Curriculum’ in schools from the new academic year. The proposed board will conduct assessments throughout the year to develop holistic learning instead of once in a year assessment that focuses on rote learning, the Chief Minister said. ‘Global education’ “Our students will progress towards global education. The board will function in close alignment with national and international boards. The board will develop world-class education practices that will enable the shift in teaching-learning practices across Delhi,” he said during a digital press briefing. “In the present education system, we assess a student at the end of the year for three hours, but in the new education board, we will assess students throughout the year. The entire system of education now focuses on rote learning, this has to change and emphasis has to be placed on understanding, and personality development,” he added. Mr. Kejriwal said assistance would be sought from international outfits, and global practices as well as teaching methods had been analysed so they can be incorporated in the DBSE. High-end techniques will be used to impart education and conduct assessment, Mr. Kejriwal said, adding that the interests, needs and specialisations of each student would be taken into account by the DBSE to provide insights on what courses they should opt for. “There are approximately 1,000 government schools and 1,700 private schools in Delhi. Most of them are affiliated with the CBSE. These schools will not become a part of the new board all at once; 20-25 government schools shall be included in the 2021-22 session,” he said. “These schools are being chosen based on suggestions from students, teachers, and parents. Over the next four-five years, we hope to see all government and private schools being affiliated with the DBSE,” he added. The board’s governance and coordination will be overseen by a governing body under the chairpersonship of the Education Minister. Members of the governing body will include education officials, experts from higher education, principals of government and private schools, teachers and parents as well as educationists from other spheres. “I am very happy and excited to see Delhi Education Board’s initiatives towards quality education for all. Before joining politics, when I worked with various NGOs, I always felt that our system of education lags and it is only through its improvement that we will be able to solve the plethora of issues that our country faces,” he said.  “The DBSE will prepare students to take responsibility for their country, focus on making students good human beings beyond all religion, caste, and class differences, and enable students to emerge as job givers and not job seekers,” he added.  ‘Funds for National Flags’ In a related development, sources said the Delhi government was preparing to allocate separate funds for the installation of the National Flag at various locations across the national capital. Sources added that the government was also preparing to hold cultural events based on the lives of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Shaheed Bhagat Singh under the ‘Deshbhakti’ head for which it is likely to allocate funds in the 2021-22 Budget.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-to-get-its-own-school-education-board-kejriwal/article34010188.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||What changes after COVID-19 vaccination?||The story so far: Nearly 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in India so far. However, as the vaccination drive gains momentum, questions have emerged about appropriate behaviour after being vaccinated. In the United States, last week, Texas removed its mask mandate and lifted all other COVID-19-related restrictions. In India, the Union Health Ministry on Friday said six States — Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi — were reporting a surge in new cases. Health officials said the rise in the number of cases across States could be because of the negligence that has set in regarding established COVID-19 protocols. Can the mask come off? Whether it is okay to lose the mask now is a question that some people have been asking; others feel confident in shedding their masks, after two, or even just one shot of the vaccine. However, not wearing a mask would be a bad idea, say experts. At various places, infection clusters have been reported that are linked to people who participated in group events, such as marriage ceremonies, without wearing masks or maintaining physical distancing. Tamil Nadu’s Health Secretary, J. Radhakrishnan, is leading the efforts to stem a gradually rising COVID-19 graph in the State. “To not wear masks would be nothing short of criminal now. Just as in the case of Maharashtra, we have identified family clusters of COVID-19 cases in a couple of cities here. In most instances, it has been because of attending weddings or other family functions, and not wearing masks or being in close proximity to others. We are reinforcing the absolute need to continue wearing masks. Even a vaccine is a secondary tool for us, many may not have got it yet, but everyone can wear a mask and remain safe,” he said. What does being vaccinated really mean? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), being fully vaccinated means a period of two weeks or more following the receipt of the second dose in a two-dose series, or two weeks or more following the receipt of a single-dose vaccine. In India, currently, both vaccines being used — Covishield and Covaxin — follow a two-dose regimen. Typically, the immune response takes a while to build up after a vaccine shot. In an episode of Science in 5 , Katherine O’ Brien of the World Health Organization (WHO) said after the first jab of a two-dose vaccine, a good immune response kicks in within about two weeks. It is the second dose that boosts the immune response “and we see immunity get even stronger after that second dose”. But it is still unclear how long immunity lasts from the vaccines at hand now. She said whether or not the immune response is durable, how it performs with the passage of time, and how long it lasts can be found out only by monitoring people who have already been vaccinated over a period. While clinical trials have demonstrated that vaccines protect people against the disease, it is not clear if they prevent getting the infection or a severe form of the disease, or if those vaccinated can transmit the virus to others. If the vaccinated individual is still carrying the virus, the vaccine may provide immunity from severe disease for him or her, but the individual could still transmit the virus to someone who is not yet vaccinated, and therefore, vulnerable. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s FAQ document on vaccines says, “Protective levels of antibodies are generally developed two weeks after receiving the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.” In a tweet, United States’s White House adviser and top infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said, “Currently we do not have enough data to say with confidence that the vaccines can prevent transmission. So, even if vaccinated, you may be able to spread the virus to vulnerable people.” What changes after you get a vaccine shot? “After vaccination, your risk of severe disease from COVID-19 goes down dramatically. Once 70-80% of a population has been vaccinated, many current restrictions may be lifted,” said Priya Sampathkumar, infectious diseases consultant and medical director, infection prevention and control, Mayo Institute, U.S. However, there is concern that vaccinated people may get asymptomatic COVID-19 and transmit it to others. “So, until a large proportion of the population is vaccinated, please wear a mask to protect others,” she added. The CDC on its website also highlights the need to continue with masks: “While available COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy at preventing severe and/or symptomatic COVID-19, there is currently limited information on how much the vaccines might reduce transmission and how long protection lasts. In addition, the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is not known. At this time, vaccinated people should continue to followcurrent guidanceto protect themselves and others, including wearing a mask, staying at least six feet away from others, avoiding crowds, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands often...” Dr. O’ Brien pointed out in the episode that while we are still learning about what vaccines can do, there is out-of-control transmission in many countries. There is not enough evidence yet of vaccine response for some age groups, and vaccines are in short supply in the community. Hence, following COVID-19 protocols is essential, she added. Dr. Sampathkumar dealt with another question in a Twitter thread recently — what if everyone in a small family or social group is vaccinated? “In a small group in which everyone has been vaccinated, it is okay to meet without masks. The risk is low. In work settings, masks are still recommended as verifying vaccination and the health status of co-workers is tricky,” she said. She added that one may visit a fully vaccinated family member if they have also been fully vaccinated. However, travelling freely might not yet be safe. “Also, a lot depends on what we learn about the ability of vaccines to prevent asymptomatic infections and stay effective against COVID-19 variants,” she said. However, if you have been fully vaccinated, as per the recommended dosage, you can safely go eat indoors in restaurants, and the risk would be extremely low. The CDC urges that even fully vaccinated people who get exposed to COVID-19 but do not quarantine should watch for symptoms for 14 days following the exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, if indicated. For how long should we continue following safety protocols? “Time is going to tell. Once we get broad vaccination coverage ... we can slowly start taking our foot off the pedal,” said Dr. O’ Brien. Meanwhile, with cases rising in India, States are hustling to reinforce COVID-19 protocols, impose fines for violations, and reintroduce a diluted version of restrictions. After rules were relaxed gradually following an exhaustive year-long campaign and pandemic fatigue set in among people, safety measures were overlooked. However, unless there is evidence that vaccination prevents transmission, or until herd immunity is achieved with a combination of vaccination and natural immunity from infection, it is clear that giving the mask up or other safety measures is dangerous. To do so would be to keep alive the cycle of transmission of the virus in the community.  Experts say currently, there is limited information about the extent to which the vaccines might reduce transmission and how long the protection lasts. The efficacy of the vaccines against emerging virus variants is also not known||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/what-changes-after-covid-19-vaccination/article34009961.ece
07 March 2021||Ghaziabad,||Tikait flags off tractor rally to mark 100 days of farmers’ protest||To mark 100 days of farmers’ protest against the Centre’s new farm laws, Bharatiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait flagged off a tractor rally from Ramraj town of Muzaffarnagar on Saturday. The tractor march will travel across 16 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and reach the Ghazipur protest site on March 27. Police deployment Despite aggressive posturing of Mr. Tikait, only around a dozen tractors turned up for the rally. Local sources said a massive security deployment by Uttar Pradesh Police in Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Bijnor prevented farmers from joining the protest in large numbers. “It seems the police considers tractors akin to a Pakistani tank. The local police didn’t allow farmers to leave their villages,” said Mr. Tikait, who visited a local gurdwara before steering a tractor himself. He asserted that the rally would continue as planned. “These are trials to check what the administration is up to. Whenever we want, we can mount a massive show of strength,” he claimed. On the declining number of farmers at the Ghazipur border, Rajvir Singh, State BKU vice-president said farmers were busy with their crops. “The government is trying to tire us out. So, we have to plan accordingly. We are in for a long haul.” Mr. Singh said. “The BKU and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha were ready for talks with the government, but it seems the government’s focus is on the State elections, right now.” He said the BKU was not planning to turn political, but the BJP would face the political fallout of farm laws in the coming panchayat elections.

07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Spectrum sale, price test and the road ahead for 5G||The story so far: Tuesday saw the end of India’s first auction of telecommunications spectrum in five years, with the government generating a revenue of Rs. 77,815 crore from the exercise. Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio accounted for close to 60% of the spectrum bought, followed by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. On offer was over 2,308 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum valued for the auction by the government at Rs. 3.92 lakh crore, and bids were successfully received for 37% or 855.6 MHz. The auction lasted less than two days. How has the industry been since the last auction? A lot has changed in the industry since 2016, when the previous auction took place. The participants then included Tata Teleservices, Idea Cellular, Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Reliance Communications and Aircel. In the last few years, there has been a consolidation in the industry, as a result of which there are only three major players now — Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. An IIFL Securities report last December suggested that Jio and Bharti Airtel are, by increasing their market share, shaping the industry toward “a near two-player structure”. On the other hand, Vodafone Idea, it said, is struggling financially. In recent years, while the user base has grown, the industry itself has witnessed unforeseen financial stress in the form of an important court case against it. The reference is to the Supreme Court verdict last September that ordered telecom players to share revenues coming from even non-telecom services with the government. It gave telecom companies 10 years to pay their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues to the government, with 10% of the dues to be paid by March 31, 2021. Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel were the worst-hit by this order. Why was an auction needed now? All three players needed to renew some of their spectrum as the validity was set to expire later this year. Wasn’t this for the 5G rollout? No. The auction for that is likely to happen later. In the auction that was held on March 1 and 2, the government offered spectrum for 4G in the following bands: 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz, 2,300 MHz and 2,500 MHz. What do these bands stand for? To explain this, we have to begin with the term ‘spectrum’, which, in this context, stands for the portion of the electromagnetic wave range that is suitable for communication purposes. As this is a huge economic resource, which also provides unimaginable benefits to any population, it is controlled by the government. Industry organisation GSMA, a body that represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, says in its blog that one slice of this spectrum is not the same as another slice. The difference is in terms of the frequency of these waves (the number of times the waves repeat themselves in a second). It says, “Spectrum bands have different characteristics, and this makes them suitable for different purposes. In general, low-frequency transmissions can travel greater distances before losing their integrity, and they can pass through dense objects more easily. Less data can be transmitted over these radio waves, however. Higher-frequency transmissions carry more data, but are poorer at penetrating obstacles.” In this context, hertz is a measure of the number of cycles per second, and 1 megahertz stands for 1 million hertz. Telecom providers cover their bases by using both low and high-frequency bands. Who bought what in the auction? Reliance Jio was the biggest spender in the auction. It shelled out Rs. 57,122 crore, just over 60% of which was to acquire spectrum in the 800 MHz band, according to a report by Edelweiss. It spent the remaining on 1,800 MHz and 2,300 MHz bands. Bharti Airtel, which dished out Rs. 18,699 crore, spent half of its money on the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands. It also spent on the 2,100 MHz and 2,300 MHz bands. Vodafone Idea, the report said, “was the most conservative of the lot”. It used almost two-thirds  of its Rs. 1,993-crore spend on the 900 MHz band. It spent the remaining on the 1,800 MHz band. The spectrum will be assigned to bidders for a period of 20 years. How do analysts view the auction strategy of these three companies? Though the auction is largely seen as an opportunity to renew expiring spectrum, analysts say Reliance Jio’s “higher-than-expected” spend is an attempt to improve network experience. The Edelweiss report says Reliance Jio could have gone for it because “in recent quarters, Bharti Airtel has onboarded a disproportionately higher share of smartphone subscribers leveraging its superior network”. Vodafone Idea’s low-key presence in the auction is linked to its balance-sheet constraints. It is also likely that the players are preserving their resources for the upcoming 5G era. Why did the 700 MHz band have no takers? The 700 MHz band, as also 1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz, and 2,300 MHz bands, are seen playing an important role in the 5G rollout (the fifth generation of mobile networks that promises to connect everybody as also everything much faster and at much lower latency). The 700 MHz band was not expected to find any takers given its prohibitive floor price. Some see this as an opening for the government to scale down the reserve price when it comes up for bidding in future. What an ICICI Securities report called the “king” in 5G, the C-band, which is the band between 3,300 MHz and 4,200 MHz, was not on offer in this round of auctions. How did this auction compare to the last round? In 2016, about 40% of the 2,355 MHz of spectrum (at a reserve price of Rs. 5.6 lakh crore) was sold, giving the government Rs. 65,789 crore in revenue. This time, the Centre has managed to get more. The government said the revenue generated by the auction has exceeded its expectations, which was about Rs. 45,000 crore, according to Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash. The expectations were low because of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that the top three telecom players were looking to renew expiring spectrum and consolidate holdings in select bands.  The 700 MHz band was not expected to find any takers, given its prohibitive floor price. Experts see this as an opening for the government to scale down the reserve price||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/spectrum-sale-price-test-and-the-road-ahead-for-5g/article34009965.ece
07 March 2021||New Delhi,||Audit report exposes Rs. 546-cr. flyover scam, claims AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday alleged that an audit report of the BJP-led municipal corporations has exposed a “scam” of Rs. 546 crore in the construction of the Rani Jhansi flyover. The cost of construction for the flyover was fixed at Rs. 175 crore but it went up to Rs. 724 crore by the time it was completed, it said. “The construction cost of the Shastri Park flyover was set at Rs. 302 crore, but it was built for Rs. 250 crore in just 1.5 years under the Arvind Kejriwal model. The cost of the Rani Jhansi flyover was fixed at Rs. 175 crore but it went up to Rs. 724 crore and took 24 years under the BJP-led municipalities,” AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said, adding that the decision to construct the Rani Jhansi flyover was made in 1995 and it was completed in 2018. It was supposed to be finished by 2000. “This means that the BJP leaders were involved in corruption worth Rs. 546 crore from this project. This audit report has 54 pages and 70 objections,” he said. Mr. Pathak said that when a government construction takes place, a land-owning agency is appointed by the State government to acquire the plot. No govt. agency “Unfortunately, the land-owning agency in the Rani Jhansi project was not a government agency. In fact, BJP leaders and the local engineers made a deal. They created a new system and technique for owning every piece of land, which involved corruption. I am sure this has never happened anywhere in the country,” Mr. Pathak said. He added that there was a religious building on one of the plots that was acquired. “Over Rs. 26 crore was given to a person named Abhishek Gupta [for the land]. If this was government land, who is Abhishek Gupta and why was the money given to him? Also, over Rs. 10 crore was spent without any approval. No approvals were taken from any official or agency to spend this extra money,” he said, adding the Delhi government will consider taking legal action against the civic bodies over the matter. ‘Manipulative politics’ Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Mr. Pathak’s statement calling “cost escalation of the flyover project” a scam shows that he “indulges only in manipulative politics to malign the corporations”. Everybody knows that due to court cases, compensation claims, and other humanitarian reasons, this flyover project got repeatedly stuck and was delayed by 20 years, he added. The two-decade delay escalated the cost of construction from planned Rs. 175 crore to Rs. 724 crore. This is cost escalation due to reasons beyond the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s control and not a scam. It would be better if Mr. Pathak talks about facts instead of manipulations, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/audit-report-exposes-rs-546-cr-flyover-scam-claims-aap/article34010183.ece
07 March 2021||New Delhi,||Frontline workers claim under pressure to get jab||Despite the vaccination drive for front-line workers starting almost a month after healthcare workers, more front-line workers have been immunised, according to official data. While vaccination of healthcare workers started on January 16, front-line workers, which includes police, paramilitary and government officials, started getting vaccinated from February 13. Over 2,30,073 of 3,38,251 (68%) front-line workers had taken the vaccine till Thursday and only 1,49,910 of 2,38,256 (62.9%) healthcare workers had been vaccinated. Strong ‘encouragement’ Officials said that many healthcare workers were infected by the virus and that is one of the reasons for the lesser turnout. Enthusiasm is more because of “better awareness and communication” among front-line workers, said Delhi government officials. But there have been cases of them being under some level of “pressure” to take the vaccine, as per officials. The number of people above 60 years of age and in the 45-59 age group taking the vaccine has also been steadily rising since it started on March 1.  On February 26, a Delhi Police head constable made a PCR call from Shakarpur in east Delhi after he was informed by his seniors that his salary will be cut if he refused to get vaccinated. The Delhi police received many such calls and later in the day, officials said there was a “communication gap” and the message about the increment cut was spread to encourage officers to get vaccinated. A senior officer said there were misconceptions regarding the vaccination among a few policemen, however, all SHOs have been instructed to ensure that all personnel get vaccinated. “If in a case, any police personnel had doubts, then he is to be counselled by doctors and experts, but ensure 100% attendance,” the officer said. The officer added that policemen with significant medical conditions have been advised to consult their doctor before taking the shot. Officials monitoring situation An official working with the Delhi Jal Board said there is “monitoring” by senior officials on who all are getting the vaccine and this “creates a kind of pressure... but vaccination is not mandatory”. Last month, an audio message of a Delhi government official asking employees to get vaccinated or else face action was leaked on social media. Officials later clarified that no such action was ever taken and the message was done just to encourage the employees. “There were about four-five cases where front-line workers, who came to get vaccinated at the hospital, said that they did not want to take the vaccine. They requested us to just give them a certificate, as higher-ups were asking them to get vaccinated,” said a doctor working at the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Hospital. “On Tuesday evening, when we were about to call it a day, a police officer came to get vaccinated. He said that he was not inclined to get vaccinated, but “ACP saheb ” has asked him to get vaccinated. Healthcare workers do not have that level of pressure,” the doctor said.  Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police PRO, said that around 85% of Delhi Police personnel have got the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The remaining personnel will also get vaccinated soon. “I got a message from the government informing me about my date of vaccination and then I got a call asking me to get vaccinated on the date. I was also asked to submit the certificate of vaccination at the office. In a way, we have more pressure than healthcare workers to get vaccinated,” said a police officer who works at the Delhi Secretariat. But many said that they took the vaccine willingly. A constable posted in Central Delhi said, “Initially, I was against the vaccination after reading about it on social media. However, my colleagues who got vaccinated shared their experiences and advised me to get vaccinated at the earliest. I got the first shot last week and I am doing fine,” said the policeman. The Delhi Police has a strength of around 90,000 personnel. At least 34 personnel died due to COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/front-line-workers-claim-under-pressure-to-get-jab/article34010184.ece
07 March 2021||Chandigarh,||Night curfew imposed in 4 Punjab districts||A night curfew was imposed in Punjab’s four districts from Saturday to tackle a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. The orders came after Punjab Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan and Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta held a meeting to review the COVID-19 situation with all Deputy Commissioners, district police chiefs and civil surgeons through a videoconferencing. The districts where the night curfew has been imposed are Jalandhar, SBS Nagar, Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala. The night curfew will remain in place in the districts from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. Ms. Mahajan said, “The second wave of the disease has already started and all the DCs and police chiefs must ensure that large gatherings like marriages, religious events and social functions are restricted”. Jalandhar Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori had earlier in the day said the order will be effective from Saturday till further directions. Some to be exempted However, there will be relaxation for workers or staff working in factories which run on 24-hour shifts and also in cases of medical emergency. These orders will not be applicable on people returning after travelling in buses, trains or flights. The Chief Secretary in a tweet has urged people to get themselves vaccinated and to continue to follow the COVID norms. Last month, the Punjab government had authorised Deputy Commissioners to impose the night curfew in virus hotspots if needed. Punjab has been witnessing a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases for nearly four weeks. Jalandhar reported 242 cases on Thursday, 134 cases on Friday and 154 on Saturday, promoting the district authorities to take this decision. Jalandhar is at the second spot in terms of COVID-19 cases after Ludhiana. It has so far reported 22,410 COVID-19 cases. There are a total of 926 active cases in Jalandhar as of now, according to a medical bulletin. SBS Nagar, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur on Saturday reported 156, 85 and 137 cases, respectively. Punjab on Saturday reported 1,179 fresh COVID-19 cases, taking the infection tally to 187,348 cases. Twelve more deaths took the fatality count to 5,910. Punjab is among the five States that has been asked by the Centre to refocus on strict surveillance, containment and RT-PCR testing to check the growing number of cases. The other four States are Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.  Earlier, the State government had lifted the night curfew from January 1.

07 March 2021||Shimla,||HP MLAs to get full salaries from April 1: CM||Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur while presenting the budget for 2021-22 on Saturday said the salaries of State MLAs will be paid in full from April 1 and the MLALAD fund will be restored fully. Mr. Thakur proposed no new tax in his fourth budget which pegged total expenditure at Rs. 50,192 crore for 2021-22 against Rs. 49,131 crore in the last fiscal despite the COVID-19 crisis. The Chief Minister announced a budgetary allocation of Rs. 8,024 crore for education and Rs. 3,016 crore for health services during 2021-22. Debt burden After presenting the budget, Mr. Thakur said that the State has a debt burden of Rs. 60,500 crore. The debt burden has increased by Rs. 4,763 crore from Rs. 55,737 crore in the last financial year. Earlier, Mr. Thakur announced in the Assembly that MLAs will get their full salary from April 1. Mr. Thakur, who also holds the finance portfolio, said the MLA local area development (MLALAD) fund will not only be restored, but it will be hiked by Rs. 5 lakh from Rs. 1.75 crore to Rs. 1.80 crore. The State government had last year decided to cut 30% salary of MLAs and suspend the MLALAD fund for two years to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chief Minister said that total revenue receipts are estimated at Rs. 37,028 crore during 2021-22, whereas total revenue expenditure is estimated to be Rs. 38,491 crore, leading to a revenue deficit of Rs. 1,463 crore. Fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs. 7,789 crore which is 4.52% of the Gross State Domestic Product, he added. COVID-19 pandemic has impacted revenue receipts adversely during 2020-21, he said adding that its impact on State’s own revenue cannot be ruled out during 2021-22. The Chief Minister announced 12 new schemes with focus on women welfare and empowerment, expansion of social security net, strengthening and expansion of health services, increasing income of farmers, Swaran Jayanti Aashray Yojana, employment creation, infrastructure and industrial development and quality education. He stated that 40,000 new beneficiaries would be brought under Social Security Pension Schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hp-mlas-to-get-full-salaries-from-april-1-cm/article34010176.ece
07 March 2021||March 07 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Red Echo’ over India||The story so far: On March 3, Maharashtra Power Minister Nitin Raut announced that a State Cyber Cell probe had found 14 Trojan horses in the servers of the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company. These malwares had the potential to disrupt power distribution in the State. The announcement came in the wake of a report from Recorded Future, a U.S.-based cybersecurity firm, stating that a group linked to the Chinese government, which it called ‘Red Echo’, had targeted 10 vital nodes in India’s power distribution system and two seaports. Recorded Future claims the cyber intrusions from China began in May 2020 amid heightened tensions at the border. It also suggested that these malwares could be the cause of the massive power outage in Mumbai last October. On Monday, the Power Ministry said Chinese hacker groups had targeted various Indian power centres but these groups had been thwarted after government cyber agencies warned it about their activities. The Ministry said there had been “no data breach” from the threat.  How did Recorded Future track malware in Indian systems? Recorded Future did not look directly into the servers of India’s power system. Instead, it found a large number of IP addresses linked to critical Indian systems communicating for months withAXIOMATICASYMPTOTEservers connected to Red Echo. These servers had domains spoofing those of Indian power sector entities configured to them. For example, it had an ‘ntpc-co.com’ domain, which spoofs the originalntpc.co.in. AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers act as command-and-control centres for a malware known as ShadowPad.  What is ShadowPad? ShadowPad is a backdoor Trojan malware, which means it opens a secret path from its target system to its command-and-control servers. Information can be extracted or more malicious code delivered via this path. Mr. Raut had said that there was an attempt to “either insert or remove around 8 GB of data from the server”. Security firm Kaspersky says ShadowPad is built to target supply-chain infrastructure in sectors like transportation, telecommunication, energy and more. It was first identified in 2017, when it was found hidden in a legitimate software produced by a company named NetSarang. Trojanised softwares, or softwares that have dangers hidden in them, like the eponymous Trojan horse from Greek mythology, are the primary mode of delivery for ShadowPad.  How are ShadowPad and Red Echo linked to China? Kaspersky states that several techniques used in ShadowPad are also found in malware from Winnti group, “allegedly developed by Chinese-speaking actors”. Security analysis firm FireEye links ShadowPad to a group known as ‘APT41’, which it says overlaps with the Winnti group. Microsoft has been tracking another group under the name ‘Barium’. In September 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that a federal grand jury had indicted “five computer hackers, all of whom were residents and nationals of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), with computer intrusions affecting over 100 victim companies in the United States and abroad”. The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed that these were the intrusions that various security researchers were tracking using different threat labels such as ‘APT41’, ‘Barium’, ‘Winnti’, ‘Wicked Panda’, and ‘Wicked Spider’. The Department of Justice statement said the “defendants also compromised foreign government computer networks in India and Vietnam”. Security firm FireEye also “assesses with high confidence” that ‘APT41’ “carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state control”, i.e., the group not only spies for the Chinese government but also does cybercrime when it suits them. The group has been known to target the video-game industry. Recorded Future in its report notes large overlaps in the systems used by Red Echo and ‘APT41/Winnti/Barium’. “At least 3 of the [Red Echo] targeted Indian IP addresses were previously seen in a suspected APT41/Barium-linked campaign targeting the Indian Oil and Gas sectors in November 2020,” it says.  What were Red Echo’s targets? Recorded Future lists these as suspected targets: Power System Operation Corporation Limited, NTPC Limited, NTPC Kudgi STPP, Western Regional Load Despatch Centre, Southern Regional Load Despatch Centre, North Eastern Regional Load Despatch Centre, Eastern Regional Load Despatch Centre, Telangana State Load Despatch Centre, Delhi State Load Despatch Centre, DTL Tikri Kalan (Mundka), Delhi Transco Ltd (substation), V. O. Chidambaranar Port and Mumbai Port Trust.  What is the objective of Red Echo? Recorded Future says the kind of infrastructure sought to be accessed by Red Echo, such as Regional Load Despatch Centres, has minimal espionage possibilities. However, it adds, “we assess they pose significant concerns over potential pre-positioning of network access to support Chinese strategic objectives.” Prepositioning in cyber warfare means to have malware assets in crucial places that can be called on when an actual attack is launched.
