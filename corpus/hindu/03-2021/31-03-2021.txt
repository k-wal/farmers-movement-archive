31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Surge in cases a cause for concern: Centre||The surge in the number of COVID-19 cases has gone “from bad to worse”, said V.K. Paul, member (health) of the NITI Aayog, on Tuesday, as India registered 56,211 new cases in the past 24 hours. Dr. Paul said 10 districts across India, including Pune (59,475), Mumbai (46,248), Nagpur (45,322), Thane (35,264), and Bengaluru Urban (16,259), currently have the highest active COVID-19 case load. The cases include 855 from virus variants. Speaking at a press conference, Dr. Paul noted that the country was facing an increasingly severe situation in some districts, but the whole country is potentially at risk. “All efforts to contain the virus and save lives should be taken,” he said. ‘Urgent action needed’ Also addressing the press conference, Union Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan stressed the need to take urgent action to curb the surge. He said the States had been asked to ramp up testing with focus on RT-PCR tests, ensure effective and prompt isolation of those infected and tracing their close contacts while strengthening public and private health care resources. “Ensuring COVID-appropriate behaviour and saturation of vaccination for priority age groups” in districts reporting surge in cases is also a priority, he said. “India is currently showing a weekly national average positivity rate of 5.65%,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/surge-in-cases-a-cause-for-concern-centre/article34202485.ece
31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Manipur retracts letter on refugees||The Manipur government has withdrawn a letter issued last week directing officials to not set up any camps for Myanmar nationals crossing the border into India and to “politely turn away” those seeking refuge. Meanwhile, even though the Union Home Ministry asserted that the refugees should be identified and deported, the Mizoram government is planning to provide them employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. “It appears that the contents of the letter have been misconstrued and interpreted differently. The State government has been taking all humanitarian steps had recently taken all steps, including taking them to Imphal, to treat the injured Myanmarese nationals. The State government continues to provide all aid,” said H. Gyan Prakash, Special Secretary (Home) in Manipur government, in another letter dated March 29. “In order to avoid this misunderstanding, I am directed to convey the decision of the government that it has decided to withdraw the letter dated 26.03.2021 mentioned above,” Mr. Prakash added. In the March 26 letter to the Deputy Commissioners of five districts bordering Myanmar, Mr. Prakash had said that in case of grievous injuries, medical attention may be provided on “humanitarian considerations” and also directed that Aadhaar enrolment “should be stopped immediately and Aadhaar enrolment kits taken into safe custody.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/manipur-retracts-letter-on-refugees/article34202487.ece

31 March 2021||Bengaluru,||CD scandal: Woman records statement||After 28 days of suspense, the woman in the sex CD case, allegedly involving BJP leader and former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, appeared before the metropolitan magistrate and recorded her statement on Tuesday. She was later escorted to the technical cell of the city police at Adugodi by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) where her statement was recorded.  The woman reportedly reiterated her statement given earlier in a series of videos and a handwritten complaint she filed with the Cubbon Park police through her lawyer, accusing Mr. Jharkiholi of cheating and sexual assault. She also deposed that she had not been kidnapped as alleged by her parents. The SIT officials are also learnt to have taken her voice sample. The official posed over 50 questions and recorded her statement in camera as per section 161 of the Cr.PC. The SIT officials questioned her in detail about the incident and her conversation with the family where she allegedly claimed that the video is morphed and fabricated. The SIT officials also sought to know from whom she had a threat perception. “She replied to all the questions confidently and also submitted a set of evidence in the form of pictures, videos, and gifts to corroborate her claim,” said official sources. The SIT officials assured her protection and the woman also requested the SIT to help her family who are allegedly “under the control of the accused [Mr. Jharkiholi]”. The SIT is likely to continue the investigation after subjecting the woman to medical examination and taking her to the spot where the alleged crime took place for mahazar (inspection). After recording her statement, the woman was escorted to the location of her choice where she is going to remain amid tight security. Day of high drama It was a day of high drama at the magistrate court on Tuesday where the woman was said to appear before a magistrate. While the police deployed personnel in large numbers there, the venue was changed to the special court at Gurunanak Bhavan at Vasanthnagar where the statement was recorded before the magistrate. Advocate Jagadish Kumar said that now that the victim had recorded her statement, the accused should be arrested immediately. “This is a high-profile case and the accused is very influential and may disturb the ongoing investigation. Hence the SIT should take immediate action and arrest the accused,” he said. The police have registered an FIR against Mr. Jarkiholi after the woman submitted a complaint through her lawyer accusing him of sexual assault. He has been charged under Sections 376c (sexual intercourse by a person in authority), 354a (sexual harassment), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 417 (cheating) of the IPC and under Section 67a of the IT Act (publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act). Prior to this, based on the complaint of Mr. Jarkiholi, the SIT had begun an investigation into the alleged “conspiracy” to defame him and blackmail him using the CD, which he claimed was fake.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cd-scandal-woman-records-statement/article34202624.ece
31 March 2021||TIRUCHI,||ECI transfers Police Commissioner of Tiruchi City, suspends ACP||The Election Commission of India has ordered the transfer of J. Loganathan, Commissioner of Police, Tiruchi, to a non-election post at the State headquarters. The ECI has also ordered suspension of the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Law and order) Golden Rock, Tamilmaran, for serious dereliction of duty. The Commission has directed that the ACP be attached to the DGP headquarters with immediate effect. The Commission's orders comes in the wake of the recent seizure of covers containing cash from a couple of police stations in Tiruchi. The cash was allegedly distributed as bribe to police personnel to cast their votes, through postal ballots, in favour of the DMK. Based on preliminary reports and inputs, the Commission is said to have found a serious case of dereliction of duty by some officials. About 23 covers containing cash were recovered from the Government Hospital police station and another 12 covers from the Thillai Nagar police station on March 27. Cash amounting to around Rs. 70,000 were seized during the searches conducted at both police stations falling under the Tiruchi West Assembly constituency from where DMK principal secretary K.N. Nehru is seeking re-election. The City Crime Branch had booked a case against five persons including a Special Sub Inspector attached to the Government Hospital police station and a woman Head Constable serving in Thillai Nagar police station. An advocate and two others were also named in the case. Mr. Nehru had alleged that it was an attempt to defame him and countermand the election in Tiruchi West and other constituencies. This is the second major action of ECI against senior district officers in Tiruchi. Already the former District Collector S. Sivarasu, Superintendent of Police, P. Rajan and Srirangam Sub Collector Nishant Krishna were transferred to non-election posts following the seizure of Rs. 1 crore in unclaimed cash near Pettaivathalai in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tiruchi-police-commissioner-transferred-acp-suspended/article34203013.ece

Jagadeesha said on Tuesday that Yakshagana shows and dramas can go on in Udupi district by appropriately adhering to COVID-19 behaviour. But if COVID-19 inappropriate behaviour is reported while organising these events, the owner of the hall, the ground or open land where the shows are staged will be held responsible and they will attract penal action.

The Deputy Commissioner said that a residential apartment in Manipal was declared as a containment zone on Tuesday. He said that religious gatherings, consumer fair where social distancing norms cannot be adhered to, will not be allowed. “The present rate of COVID-19 cases in the district does not call for any tougher action than what is being imposed now,” Mr. Jagadeesha said. The Deputy Commissioner said that the rate of positive cases in the district stood at 0.5% in this January. It went up to 1 % in February and to reach 2% in March mainly due to the cases reported on MIT campus. Regarding steps being taken against COVID-19 positive cases coming from Maharashtra and Kerala where the incidence is high, Mr. Jagadeesha said: “We have not yet initiated any process to check RT-PCR negative reports at the check-posts of Udupi district.” Referring to the army recruitment rally, Director (Recruitment), Army Recruitment Office, Mangaluru, Col. Firdosh P. Dubash, said that 22,532 aspirants turned up for the rally. “Against the general notion, this time youths from Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts predominantly showed interest in joining the army,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-ban-on-yakshagana-dramas-in-udupi/article34203126.ece

31 March 2021||Tiruppur,||DMK, Congress against empowering women: PM||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress will not guarantee women empowerment as “insulting women” is a part of the culture of these two parties, alleged Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an election meeting in Dharapuram on Tuesday. Without naming DMK MP A. Raja, whose allegedly derogatory remarks on the “birth” of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami caused a stir recently, he said that the DMK and the Congress had launched “their outdated 2G missile” targeting the women of the State. “I want to tell the Congress and DMK: the people of Tamil Nadu are noting everything. They will never tolerate [an] insult to the women of the State,” Mr. Modi said, warning both the Opposition parties to “control” their leaders. Urging people never to forget March 25, 1989, when he said the DMK mistreated then Leader of Opposition Jayalalithaa in the Legislative Assembly, he claimed that the party might insult “many other women of Tamil Nadu” if elected to power. The “anti-women mindset” of the Opposition parties is not restricted to Tamil Nadu, he claimed, citing the recent death of the mother of a BJP worker in West Bengal after an alleged attack by the “goons” from the Trinamool Congress. He said the Congress or DMK had not condemned this. “We in the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) are inspired by the thoughts and ideals of the great Andal and Avvaiyar. We believe that the progress of society is not complete without empowerment of women,” Mr. Modi asserted. He cited schemes such as increasing toilet coverage under Swachh Bharat, distribution of LPG connections under the Ujjwala Yojana, and maternity benefit distribution under the Pradhan Mantri Matri Vandana Yojana, which were introduced by the Central government for the welfare of women. Mr. Modi assured that setting up of a defence industrial corridor and a toy cluster to manufacture “top quality toys for the world” will benefit many in the State. The Central government has sanctioned Rs. 14,000 crore for the 3.5 lakh micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) units in the State and has “initiated reforms that will free small farmers from middlemen,” he said. Mr. Modi addressed the audience in English as BJP Mahila Morcha leader and Coimbatore South Assembly constituency candidate Vanathi Srinivasan translated his speech into Tamil. Beginning his speech with chants of “Vetrivel Veeravel,” he described Dharapuram as one of the oldest cities in the State, which had produced personalities such as Tiruppur Kumaran and Dheeran Chinnamalai. He mentioned that the people of Dharapuram are “eagerly awaiting a rail link” and that the Central government is “positively looking at that demand”. He appealed to the electorate to vote for NDA candidates, including the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Paattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) in the Assembly election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dmk-congress-against-empowering-women-pm/article34202531.ece
31 March 2021||KOLLAM,||LDF following ‘corporate manifesto’, says Priyanka||Accusing the Left Democratic Front (LDF) of following a “corporate manifesto” despite swearing allegiance to the Communist manifesto, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi said the Kerala government was trying to assert a borderline fascist culture in the State. “Just like the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, the LDF government’s agenda is to sell the assets of Kerala to corporates,” she said while campaigning for the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidates at Karunagapally here on Tuesday. Urging the voters to choose well, Ms. Gandhi said Kerala had seen a politics of fear, fraud and favouritism during the past five years. Kerala was witnessing three different types of politics this election. “The first being the politics of the CPI(M) and it’s the politics of violence, repression and scams. The politics of BJP that spreads hate and divisiveness is the second. Then there is the politics of the Congress that is building a future vision for Kerala,” she said. LDF claims hollow “The LDF claims that they are representing a democratic political alternative. If that is the case, then why are they instilling fear in the people of Kerala? Many young Congress workers have been killed and the government has spent money to defend their killers. They have lathicharged members of their own alliance. The greatest gift our Constitution has given is freedom. Any government irrespective of left wing or right wing that tries to suppress the voice of people cannot be called democratic,” she said Drawing parallels between the stands of Kerala and Uttar Pradesh government in Walayar and Hathras cases, she said the LDF government, which showed a lot of concern about the atrocities against women in other States, stood with the accused in the Walayar case. “If Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister came here for campaigning, he would bring up issues such as love jihad, but now CPM(M)’s own alliance partners are talking in the same language. In the Jhansi incident where the nuns were harassed, Union Home Minister said it was wrong only because it is election time. Rest of the time they fully encourage this behaviour,” Ms Gandhi said. She alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his government were too busy dealing with foreign gold and giving out fishing contracts to multinationals. "Instead of safeguarding the livelihood of fishers, the government sold their interests to the corporates for Rs. 5,000 crore.” False promises “You are the most educated State in the country and the whole country looks towards you while you are taking the decision who to elect. It's not just Kerala you decide for, but you set the path for the rest of the country. I want you to show everyone that you will not be fooled by any false promises of a corrupt government so that the State can be put back on the path of development, Ms. Gandhi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ldf-following-corporate-manifesto-says-priyanka/article34202478.ece
31 March 2021||PALAKKAD,||Kerala was betrayed for a few pieces of gold: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday compared the incumbent Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala to Judas. “Judas betrayed Lord Christ for a few coins. The LDF betrayed Kerala for a few pieces of gold,” Mr. Modi said while addressing an election rally of the BJP at Fort Maidan here. Mr. Modi went on to attack both the LDF and the United Democratic Front (UDF), saying that both fronts were engaged in a match-fixing game. Calling upon youth to reject the LDF and the UDF, Mr. Modi said they both were masters of vote-bank politics and shared the same objective of making money. The Prime Minister accused the two fronts of directly attacking the State’s culture. “These parties are ashamed of the culture of our land. Their leaders abuse our tradition and ethos. The LDF government should be ashamed of ‘showering’ lathi s on innocent devotees, and the UDF should be ashamed of remaining silent,” he said, adding that the BJP could not be intimidated by lathi s and would not remain a silent spectator. According to Mr. Modi, the nation’s politics is afflicted by five diseases — corruption, casteism, communalism, cronyism (both nepotism and dynasticism), and criminalism. “And the root cause of this disease is a super disease called vote-bank politics,” he said. Alleging that the UDF and the LDF had erected a large number of road blocks to Kerala’s development, the Prime Minister proposed a FAST path of development for the State. “F stands for fishery and fertilizers, A for agriculture and Ayurveda, S for skill development and social justice, and T for tourism and technology,” he said. He said the BJP would give thrust on those areas to achieve fast development for the State. The BJP, if elected to power in Kerala, will also stop the culture of political killings in the State. All BJP candidates in the district, including Mr. Sreedharan, were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kerala-was-betrayed-for-a-few-pieces-of-gold-modi/article34202483.ece

The commission dismissed the bank’s claim that there were numerous pending applications for opening student savings accounts. The commission noted that no student must be deprived of scholarships or other assistance for want of a bank account.

She was later escorted to the technical cell of Adugodi by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) where her statement was recorded.   The woman reportedly reiterated her statement given earlier in a series of videos and a handwritten complaint she filed with the Cubbon Park police through her lawyer, accusing Mr. Ramesh Jharkiholi of cheating and sexual assault. She also deposed that she had not been kidnapped as alleged by her parents. The SIT officials are learnt to have taken her voice sample. The official posed over 50 questions and recorded her statement in camera in accordance with Section 161 of the CrPc. The SIT officials questioned her in detail. “She replied to all the questions confidently and also submitted a set of evidence in the form of pictures, videos and gifts to corroborate her claim,” an official source said. The SIT officials assured her protection, and the woman also requested the SIT to help her family which is allegedly “under the control of accused Ramesh Jharkiholi”.  After recording of statement, the victim was later escorted to a location of her choice, where she will remain amid tight security.   It was a day of high drama at the magistrate court on Tuesday. While the police deployed personnel in large numbers there, the venue was changed to the special court at Gurunanak Bhavan in Vasanth Nagar, where the woman’s statement was recorded before the magistrate. The woman’s advocate, Jagadish Kumar, said the accused should be arrested immediately. “This is a high- profile case and the accused is very influential and may disturb the ongoing investigation. Hence the SIT should take immediate action and arrest the accused,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/woman-in-cd-case-records-her-statement-reiterates-stand/article34202391.ece
31 March 2021||Kolkata,||All eyes on Nandigram in Bengal Phase 2||Campaigning has wound up in 30 constituencies in four districts of West Bengal which go to the polls on April 1. However, all eyes will be on one seat — Nandigram — where Trinamool Congress chief and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting against former party colleague-turned-rival Suvendu Adhikari, who switched to the BJP ahead of the polls. Of the 30 seats. nine each are in Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur, eight in Bankura and four in South 24 Parganas. A total of 171 candidates are in the fray, including 30 from the Trinamool, 30 from the BJP, 15 from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), two each from the Communist Party of India and the All India Forward Bloc and nine from the Congress. Eight seats, including three in Paschim Medinipur and Bankura, and one each in South 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur are reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates. A total of 75,94,549 voters will exercise their franchise across 10,620 polling booths, Election Commission sources said. For the past three months since January 7, when the Chief Minister announced that she might contest from Nandigram, the constituency has been the centre of high-voltage politics with the BJP fielding former Trinamool leader Suvendu Adhikari, who had represented the constituency for the past five years. The seat is being viewed as a ‘prestige fight’ among the two major political parties and has seen some of the most frenetic campaigning that the State has witnessed. The drama was heightened after Ms. Banerjee suffered a leg injury on March 10 during campaigning, which she has attributed to an ‘attack’ from her rivals. She has continued to campaign in a wheelchair and has held almost a dozen public meetings and roadshows in Nandigram. On the other hand, the constituency has seen the presence of high-profile campaigners from the BJP including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who held a rally at Kanthi in Purba Medinipur and spoke about Nandigram, and Union Home Minister Amit Shah who participated in a roadshow on Tuesday as campaigning closed. The BJP has also roped in star campaigners like Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and actor Mithun Chakraborty. The other interesting constituencies up for grabs on April 1 are Kharagpur Sadar, Debra in Paschim Medinipur district, Bankura in Bankura district and Sagar in South 24 Parganas. The Kharagpur Sadar seat, which BJP State president Dilip Ghosh won in 2016, was wrested by the Trinamool in a byelection in 2019, in spite of the BJP having a lead of over 45,000 votes in the Lok Sabha election. The BJP has this time fielded actor Hiranmay Chattopadhyay, a former Trinamool youth leader. The contest for the Debra seat has turned out to be interesting with two former officers of the Indian Police Service — Humayun Kabir of the Trinamool and Bharati Ghosh of the BJP — competing against each other. The Trinamool won this seat in 2016. Ms. Ghosh, who joined the BJP in 2019, contested the Ghatal Lok Sabha seat but lost to Deepak Adhikari of the Trinamool. While Mr. Kabir was senior to Ms. Ghosh in the police service, she is senior to him in politics. With stated assets of Rs. 19 crore, the former police chief of Paschim Medinipur is among the wealthiest candidates in the fray. Another seat to look out for is Bankura where the Trinamool has fielded actor Sayantika Banerjee. She is up against Niladri Sekhar Dana of the BJP, which had a lead here in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In Sagar, on the southernmost tip of West Bengal, three-time Trinamool MLA Bamkim Chandra Hazra is facing BJP new-comer Bikash Chandra Kamila.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/all-eyes-on-nandigram-in-bengal-phase-2/article34202422.ece

31 March 2021||Pune,||Lockdown as last resort: Maharashtra govt.||Amid a huge rise in number of COVID-19 cases, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday said a lockdown would be imposed in the State only as a last resort. He said neither the public desired nor Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the ruling parties in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) wished to impose a lockdown. Mr. Tope nevertheless said the government would be left with no option if the number of critical patients rapidly exceeded available critical health facilities, putting a heavy strain on the medical infrastructure. “A lockdown is neither loved nor wanted by anyone in the State as it has severe economic repercussions. The Chief Minister does not wish it and neither do any of the three MVA partners. There are no differences within the coalition as well on this count,” the Minister said. However, Mr. Tope said that with Maharashtra reporting 35,000-40,000 new COVID-19 patients daily, a dire problem that posed itself was the availability of critical beds. Exponential rise “The number of cases is increasing exponentially. In such a situation, it is necessary to measure the rate of increase in the number of patients with the available health facilities and medicines. If this situation continues unchecked, then a lockdown will have to be deployed as a last option because nothing is more precious than human lives,” Mr. Tope said. He hinted that any lockdown in the future would not take the shape of last year’s stringent lockdown. “We do not want unorganised workers and small businesses to suffer,” he said. He said the Chief Minister was continually in discussion with officials and was pondering on how to tighten curbs without resorting to a lockdown. “In the event of such a decision [to impose a lockdown], the duration will be decided after a comprehensive Cabinet discussion and will not be taken suddenly,” the Health Minister said. Stating that Maharashtra ranked first in vaccination in the country, Mr. Tope appealed to all political parties to urge their activists to make sure that more people came forward and got themselves inoculated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lockdown-as-last-resort-maharashtra-govt/article34202430.ece
31 March 2021||GUWAHATI,||Barak Valley in focus in Assam Phase 2||Campaigning for the second phase of Assembly election in 39 of 126 constituencies in Assam ended at 6 p.m. on Tuesday. Polling to these seats across 13 districts in southern, central, and parts of northern and western Assam will be held on April 1. The BJP and its ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) won 25 of these 39 seats in 2016. The focus in this phase is on the Bengali-dominated Barak Valley where support for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is high among the Hindus, unlike in the Assamese-dominated Brahmaputra Valley. The Barak Valley has 15 seats across three districts, and the BJP had won eight of these in 2016. Unlike in West Bengal, the BJP has been vague about implementing the CAA in Assam. This may not affect the party’s Hindu vote bank, as many think it is a strategy not to annoy the party’s Assamese voters in Brahmaputra Valley. The Congress, on the other hand, is believed to have gambled with its anti-CAA stand to appeal to a section of Hindu voters that are sceptical of the BJP’s intentions. This approach is expected to work in the seven Muslim-dominated constituencies in the valley, where the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and the Congress had won four and three seats respectively in 2016. The two parties are allies this time. The BJP is also hoping to retain all the five seats across the three hill districts of Dima Hasao, Karbi Anglong and Western Karbi Anglong. The party has changed all but one candidate this time. In the remaining 19 seats spread across central, and parts of northern and western Assam, the BJP and the AGP had won 12 seats in the last election. Erstwhile ally Bodoland People’s Front, the Congress and the AIUDF had won four, two and one respectively. There are a total of 345 candidates, including 26 women, in the fray in the second phase, and 37 of them have criminal records. Their fate would be decided by a total of 73,44,631 voters, including 36,09,959 women and 135 transgenders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/barak-valley-in-focus-in-assam-phase-2/article34202413.ece
31 March 2021||Nandigram,||High-decibel campaign ends in prestige seat||The high-decibel campaigning for the prestigious Nandigram seat in West Bengal drew to a close on Tuesday with roadshows and rallies by Home Minister Amit Shah and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, but the constituency remained on edge with the BJP and the Trinamool trading charges of several malpractices. Mr. Shah participated in a roadshow from Bheturia to Reya Para for party candidate Suvendu Adhikari. Hundreds of supporters, including women, gathered in the scorching heat. Mr. Shah greeted them from an open vehicle with Mr. Adhikari by his side raising slogans rhyming “Nandigram with Jai Shri Ram”. “The overwhelming response at the roadshow clearly tells us that Suvendu Adhikari will win with a majority. One of the easy ways to bring change [parivartan] is to defeat Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram,” Mr. Shah said. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee held three public meetings at Sonachura, Basuli Lock gate and Tengua More. She urged people not to be afraid and come out and vote in large numbers for the “Bhoomi Kanya” [daughter of the soil]. She visited the house of a party supporter at Balarampur, alleging that the BJP supporters had driven her party members out of the villages. “One of the persons has been admitted to a trauma care centre in a hospital. The BJP workers are not allowing the villagers to return home. The Election Commission must provide them security,” she said. As dusk descended, the situation turned volatile with the BJP supporters alleging that they were attacked by the Trinamool activists in some areas. The Central armed police forces had to stage a march in some areas to bring the situation under control. Amidst campaigning, Mr. Shah alleged that the wife of a BJP supporter was raped in Nandigram.“Within 5 km of where the Chief Minister is staying, a woman has been raped. The incident speaks volumes about the security of women in the State.” At one of her rallies, Ms. Banerjee said the BJP planned to incite a riot by killing their own party supporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/high-decibel-campaign-ends-in-prestige-seat/article34202416.ece
31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hopes crushed by degrees of extortion in Philippines||When 17-year old Anjali*, the daughter of a small shopkeeper in Gujarat, went to the Philippines in March 2015, she was fuelled by an education loan and dreams of becoming the first doctor in her family. When she returned home in January 2021, she had her hard-earned medical degree, but had also been robbed of $12,000 courtesy an unscrupulous agent, saddled with an additional loan, and put through six months of harassment and threats of losing her visa for fees she had already paid. Anjali (name changed on request) is one of the 15,000 Indian students who head to the Pacific island nation for a medical education every year, lured by easier admission criteria and lower fees than in India’s private medical colleges. But the promises soon turned sour for Anjali and several other Indian students. Embassy advisory Having received a slew of complaints of exploitation by colleges and agents, the Indian Embassy in Manila issued an advisory to prospective students earlier this month, warning them of the pitfalls on the road to medical qualifications. Anjali finished Class 12 in 2014 without the scores to get a medical college seat in India. She chose the Philippines for its widespread use of English, temperate weather, and promise of low fees. However, the agent kept delaying her departure claiming that her visa could not come through until she paid $12,000 in fees for the pre-medical course. Taking a bank loan, she complied. Like most Indian medical students in the Philippines, Anjali entered the country on a tourist visa on the agent’s advice, who tutored her to tell immigration officials she was entering the country only for a few weeks to write an exam. The embassy advisory said it had received complaints about agents who confiscated students’ passports and then charged them exorbitant fees for immigration procedures to convert the tourist visa to a student visa. Anjali did not face such issues, but a few days after classes started at Our Lady of Fatima University, she got a notice that the college had not received her pre-medical course fees. “I showed them the receipt that I had paid the agent, but they would not accept it. The agent had gone missing,” she said. RP, another student who wanted to be identified only by his initials, said his agent had not told him that he had to first complete a pre-medical Bachelor’s degree and score well in a medical entrance test before joining the medical programme. “In India, the agent talks to you with honey in his mouth,” said the Chennai native. “Once you are in the Philippines, there are so many conditions, so many ways for them to fleece you. The reality is different.” The Embassy said it had received complaints of an “education mafia” of agents and colleges who conspired to extort money. Its advisory urged students to deal directly with colleges, but students say some colleges insist on using agents. In Anjali’s case, the college allowed her to complete the pre-medical course, medical degree and clinical internship before it brought up the issue of the missing fees again, in August 2020. The college authorities later dropped another bombshell, claiming that the annual medical degree fees of $3,750 which she had paid for four years should have actually been $5,000. Without the money being paid, it refused to release her degrees or support her visa extension request. In December 2020, with Anjali facing threats of deportation from the Philippines, her brother took a loan from the factory he works in to help meet the university’s additional demands and finally return home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hopes-crushed-by-degrees-of-extortion/article34202539.ece
31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC to study if POCSO Act can be used against minors||The Supreme Court has decided to examine whether the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act can be employed to punish teenagers for “consensual” physical relationships which later turn “sour.” A Bench led by Justice Indira Banerjee admitted the case of a man accused of rape while he was 18 years old by a girl who was 17. The duo were in a “relationship” in school. He, however, refused to marry her, following which a complaint was filed against him in 2015. The case is based in Tamil Nadu. The trial court found the man guilty and sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment under the POCSO Act in 2019. This was despite the fact that the girl had changed her stance during the trial and stated in court that they were in a consensual relationship. The man, represented by advocate Rahul Shyam Bhandari, approached the Supreme Court after the Madras High Court too refused to accept the girl’s stand that they were in a consensual relationship. Mr. Bhandari argued that his client and the girl were both “less than 18 years of age at the time of relationship”. “The boy was a juvenile at the time. Now, the girl and the boy want to settle in life,” Mr. Bhandari submitted before Justice Banerjee’s Bench in the apex court. Notice to T.N. govt. The Bench has issued notice to the Tamil Nadu government. The man’s appeal in the apex court has sought clarity on the law for punishing minors under the POCSO Act for consensual sex. It said the objective of the Act was not to punish adolescents who are in a live-in or physical relationship. The apex court ordered the State police not to take any coercive action against the appellant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-study-if-pocso-act-can-be-used-against-minors/article34202410.ece
31 March 2021||New Delhi,||Plea in SC to save academic freedom||The Supreme Court has asked the government to respond to a plea by five teachers to protect “academic freedom” from raids and seizures of police and investigative agencies. The past few years have seen raids on and seizures of electronic evidence from academics, researchers, lawyers and activists. Now, a group of educationists have asked the court to frame guidelines so that the police treat the academic work and research, usually stored in computers they seize during raids, in a “civilised manner”. A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul issued notice to the Centre and sought a reply in four weeks. Professors Ram Ramaswamy, Sujata Patel, M. Madhava Prasad, Mukul Kesavan and Deepak Malghan said academics lose their life’s work when police carry off their computers and hard drives after a raid. What may be stored in these devices would be their life’s work. At the hands of the police, their work run the risk of damage, loss, destruction or even distortion. “Data that is stored digitally by academics may have been collected through extensive field work spanning decades or the results of scientific experiments or calculations similarly representing major effort. If these are tampered with or damaged, the loss to research in the sciences and social sciences is considerable and often irreplaceable. A lifetime’s work is life as much as livelihood. Patentable material may exist or work that runs the risk of being plagiarised. Work may also be stored in ‘clouds’, compelled exposure of which carries all of the aforesaid risks as much as the seizure of physical devices,” the petition, filed through advocates Nitya Ramakrishnan and S. Prasanna, said. The “entirely unguided power” of investigative agencies to take control of devices that contain much, if not all, of a citizen’s personal and professional life, requires to be treated in a civilised way by means of directives from the Supreme Court, it said. The petition also said some “recent news reports” suggested remote tampering with devices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-in-sc-to-save-academic-freedom/article34202428.ece
31 March 2021||Chennai,||Canada limits AstraZeneca shot to those above 55 years||Following reports of an extremely rare adverse reaction to the AstraZeneca vaccine which causes blood clots, several countries have set age limits for the use of the vaccine and Canada is the latest to follow suit. Health Canada, a Canadian federal department responsible for helping citizens maintain and improve their health, on March 29 recommended that the AstraZeneca vaccine be used only on people above 55 years. This guidance was given after scientists in Europe said they had identified a mechanism that was responsible for the vaccine causing blood clots in rare cases. Earlier on March 24, Health Canada had issued a label change and guidance on the AstraZeneca vaccine following reports from European studies of rare but serious events of blood clots associated with low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). The Canadian federal body has asked the manufacturers to conduct an assessment of the risks and benefits of the vaccine by age and gender in Canada. Until then, it has recommended pausing the use of the vaccine on people under 55 years of age. Canada is not the first country to recommend an age limit for use of the vaccine. According to a report in Science , France has restricted the use of this vaccine to people aged 55 and higher; the age limit is 65 in Sweden and Finland and 70 in Iceland — the rationale being this is the age group most likely to suffer the severest impact of Sars Covid-2 infection. Puzzling combination The combination of symptoms — blood clots and low platelet count, sometimes with bleeding — is puzzling, because normally it is the blood platelets that help in clotting of blood and therefore they would be present in large numbers when blood clots. Researchers said in a preprint posted on Research Square that these unusual symptoms actually resemble a rare side-effect of the blood thinner heparin which is known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In this context, researchers Greinacher et al draw a parallel to HIT and call this vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) and say it may be treated in a manner similar to treatment of HIT. Given the wide roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine in India, some scientists believe the decision of the Canadian Agency need not be emulated. According to Vineeta Bal, retired scientist from the National Institute of Immunology, Delhi, and currently with IISER Pune, “Given that the number of infected [in India] is increasing rapidly, and that there are not very many reports of reinfections, but new people getting infected, there is an urgent need to vaccinate the people. This [VIPIT] is a very rare side-effect and when crores of people around the world have been vaccinated, this particular adverse reaction has been seen in about 30 people. I hope our government does not take a cue from others and issue a directive, as that would only confuse people.” While other countries have a choice of several vaccines, India has only two right now.

Jaishankar said India supports the Intra-Afghan Negotiations (IAN), in a rare direct reference to the Taliban at the 9th Heart of Asia conference in Tajikistan. Mr. Jaishankar attended the meet along with Foreign Ministers of 15 countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Central Asian states. “India has been supportive of all the efforts being made to accelerate the dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban, including intra-Afghan negotiations,” the Minister said and referred to his participation in the inaugural virtual session of the Doha talks in September 2020. ‘Engage in good faith’ “If the peace process is to be successful, then it is necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, with a serious commitment towards reaching a political solution,” he added. India has not in the past referred directly to the Taliban, and the government has not opened any public engagement with the militant group. Mr. Jaishankar said India views the escalation in violence against civilians in and the “continued involvement of foreign fighters” in Afghanistan with “grave concern” and pushed for Heart of Asia members to ensure a permanent ceasefire. Speaking at the same conference, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan “fears that any space gained by ISIS and Al-Qaeda could accentuate the threat of terrorism,” and cautioned against the role of “spoilers”, both “within and outside Afghanistan”. In a departure from the recent past, however, Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Qureshi were present for each other’s speeches during the conference, unlike previous boycotts by the two sides at a number of conferences since 2019. However, despite speculation over an ongoing India-Pakistan peace process and a back-channel dialogue, Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Qureshi did not make any public contact during the day-long conference, and were seen avoiding eye contact during the joint photo opportunity they both participated in. Speaking at the conference in Dushanbe, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani, who spoke to both foreign ministers in separate meetings, thanked neighbouring countries for their support. He also lauded a number of regional connectivity initiatives including India’s air corridor programme and Chabahar port project, as well as the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-says-india-backs-afghan-taliban-dialogue/article34202440.ece

The local people noticed the inscription and pedestals while the ground-levelling work was underway for the last two days. They informed the taluk administration and officers of the Department of Archaeology, who visited the spot on Monday. As much as 15 acres of government land, spread over Lakshmidevarahalli and Kellengere villages, have been taken up for the construction of the college. Arsikere tahsildar Santhosh Kumar told The Hindu that the inscription was found on the private land adjacent to the government land identified for the college. “While the owner was levelling the ground with a tractor, the inscription was found. The pedestals were found on the government land. The workers have kept them safe. Officials of the archaeology department said they would shift them to the museum,” he said. The local people have also asked the State government to take up excavation at the site. Harisha Kolagunda, a lecturer at Hoysaleshwara PU College in Arsikere, said Arsikere had prominence since the rule of Hoysalas. “The department should take up excavation at the site, without allowing any construction work. A detailed study could bring out more significant things,” he opined. The department has decided to send a team of experts to study the place. Kumar H.C., curator of Archaeology Museum in Hassan, who visited the spot on Monday, said the stone inscription was in Kannada. “It is a Jain inscription. We have to study it in detail,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hoysala-inscription-found-near-arsikere/article34202629.ece

Antony has said the Congress will become stronger nationally to fight the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) if it is able to win the forthcoming Assembly election in Kerala. “The revival of the Congress at an all-India level will depend on the outcome of the Assembly election in Kerala, as it happened in 1970 after the split in 1969. The Congress government in Kerala will help the party to emerge as an attacking force against the NDA government when the next elections to the Lok Sabha are held in 2024,” Mr. Antony told The Hindu . Congress ally Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) would win the majority in Tamil Nadu and M.K. Stalin would form the government, he said. In Assam, the situation of the Congress had improved and the fight was between equals. “The performance of the Congress will not be pathetic as before in Assam,” he said. Mr. Antony, who was thrice Chief Minister of Kerala, is hopeful that the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) will be voted to power. AICC leader Rahul Gandhi’s presence and campaign would be a big boost to the Congress and the UDF, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-poll-crucial-for-cong-antony/article34202400.ece

It also said government’s requests for user data from Internet companies had increased “dramatically.” The report, which is submitted each year to the U.S. Congress, is retrospective and contains a country-wise discussion of the state of human rights. “The government generally respected this right, although there were several instances in which the government, or actors considered close to the government, allegedly pressured or harassed media outlets critical of the government, including through online trolling,” the report says. It also details cases against individual journalists and NGO activists, including Siddharth Varadarajan of The Wire (case by U.P. government) and Anirban Chattopadhyay ofAnandabazar Patrika(summoning by Kolkata police). The government made 49,382 user data requests in 2019 from Facebook, a 32% increase from 2018. Over the same period, Google requests increased by 69%, while Twitter requests saw a 68% increase. In a section on the arbitrary deprivation of life, the report highlights the case of the Sattankulam (Tamil Nadu) custodial deaths of P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks, who were arrested for allegedly keeping their shop’s shutters open past permitted hours during the pandemic. The report takes note of the April 2020 detention of pregnant Jamia Millia student Safoora Zargar, who was protesting the citizenship laws. It also mentions the arrest of JNU student Umar Khalid, who like Ms. Zargar, was detained under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. On the protracted detention of politicians in J&K, the report notes that former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, arrested under the Public Safety Act, was released after a three-month extension of her detention.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-report-flags-curbs-on-indian-media/article34202926.ece
31 March 2021||KOCHI,||RS polls during term of present Assembly: ECI||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday informed the Kerala High Court that elections for the three vacancies of Rajya Sabha seats falling vacant on April 21 would be conducted during the period of the present Assembly. The submission was made by counsel for the ECI when a petition filed by CPI(M) leader S. Sarma, MLA, and the Legislature Secretary challenging the ECI's decision to keep in abeyance the election process came up for hearing.  Justice P.V. Asha recorded the submission of the ECI counsel and posted the petition for further hearing on April 7. Counsel for the ECI submitted that the tenure of the three elected members would expire only on April 21. Members of the present Assembly had the right to elect members to the Rajya Sabha. In fact, the ECI had only taken a decision to keep in abeyance the notification and the schedule of the election. The term of the Assembly would end only on June 1. Besides, the ECI had already issued a statement saying that the decision on conducting elections to the impending vacancies would be taken shortly. Therefore, the plea for directive to conduct the election was premature. Counsel for the petitioners submitted that 19 days were required for the election process. Since the retirement of the members was on April 21, the last date for notification would be April 2. As per Section 12 of the Representation of the People Act, the election should be completed before the retirement of members. Therefore, the notification would have to be issued in a day or two.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-polls-during-term-of-present-assembly-eci/article34202711.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||LDF following ‘corporate manifesto’, says Priyanka||Kerala was witnessing three different types of politics this election. “The first being the politics of the CPI(M) and it’s the politics of violence, repression and scams. The politics of BJP that spreads hate and divisiveness is the second. Then there is the politics of the Congress that is building a future vision for Kerala,” she said. “The LDF claims it that they are representing a democratic political alternative. If that is the case, then why are they instilling fear in the people of Kerala? Many young Congress workers have been killed and the government has spent money to defend their killers. They have lathicharged members of their own alliance. The greatest gift our Constitution has given is freedom. Any government irrespective of left wing or right wing that tries to suppress the voice of people cannot be called democratic.” Drawing parallels between the stand taken by the Kerala and Uttar Pradesh governments in the Walayar and Hathras cases respectively, she said the LDF government, which showed a lot of concern about the atrocities against women in other States, stood with the accused in the Walayar case. “If Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister came here for campaigning, he would bring up issues such as love jehad, but now CPI(M)’s own alliance partners are talking in the same language. In the Jhansi incident, where the nuns were harassed, Union Home Minister said it was wrong only because it is election time. Rest of the time they fully encourage this behaviour,” she said. She alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his government were too busy dealing with foreign gold and giving out fishing contracts to multinationals. “Instead of safeguarding the livelihood of fishers, the government sold their interests to the corporates for Rs. 5,000 crore.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ldf-following-corporate-manifesto-says-priyanka/article34202392.ece
31 March 2021||Press Trust of India,||Former MP withdraws remarks about Rahul||After coming under fire for his sexually coloured remarks about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former MP from Kerala Joice George on Tuesday withdrew his comments and expressed regret publicly, even as the Congress demanded his arrest, while the ruling CPI(M) distanced itself from the remarks. “I hereby unconditionally withdraw the inappropriate remarks made by me while addressing an election rally at Irattayar here on Monday. I also express regret over that,” Mr. George said while speaking at a meeting in Kumily in the high range district. Mr. George had said that Mr. Gandhi visited only women’s colleges, and that the girls should be ‘careful’ while dealing with the former Congress president. “Rahul Gandhi is a bachelor and troublemaker.. so girls should be wary of him,” he had said while campaigning for Power Minister M.M. Mani. Mr. George had won as CPI(M)-supported Independent in the 2014 Lok Sabha poll. As TV channels started airing the visuals of his speech, sharp reactions poured in from various quarters condemning the remarks. Congress leaders were up in arms against Mr. George’s remarks. Leader of the Opposition and Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala demanded that the police register a case against Mr. George. Distancing himself from the comments, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said attacking Mr. Gandhi personally was not the Left Democratic Front’s stand. “We will oppose him politically not personally,” Mr. Vijayan told reporters in Kasaragod. Soon after that, the CPI(M) State secretariat issued a press statement stating that the Left party does not agree with the remarks. The former MP’s remarks came days after Mr. Gandhi had given Aikido lessons at St. Teresa’s College in Kochi on the request of a student.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/former-mp-withdraws-remarks-about-rahul/article34202402.ece

Their leaders abuse our tradition and ethos. The LDF government should be ashamed of ‘showering’ lathi s on innocent devotees, and the UDF should be ashamed of remaining silent,” he said, adding that the BJP could not be intimidated by lathi s and would not remain a silent spectator. According to Mr. Modi, the nation’s politics was afflicted by five diseases — corruption, casteism, communalism, cronyism (both nepotism and dynasticism), and criminalism. “And the root cause of this disease is a super disease called vote-bank politics,” he said. Political killings Alleging that the UDF and the LDF had erected a large number of road blocks to Kerala’s development, the Prime Minister proposed a FAST path of development for the State. “F stands for fishery and fertilizers, A for agriculture and Ayurveda, S for skill development and social justice, and T for tourism and technology,” he said. He said the BJP would give thrust to these areas to achieve fast development for the State. The BJP, if elected to power in Kerala, would also stop the culture of political killings in the State, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-betrayed-for-a-few-pieces-of-gold-modi/article34202408.ece

In addition, a number of districts that saw limited prevalence earlier, were also showing a surge in cases. Mr. Bhushan said, as per a government survey, 97% people were satisfied with the overall vaccination experience.

They cannot live here for free so this decision has been taken.” He added that Chief Minister Zoramthanga has granted Rs. 1 lakh from the CM relief fund to provide for food and relief to the refugees fleeing military crackdown in Myanmar. “The civil society groups, with the help of local television channels have so far raised more than Rs. 16 lakh to help the people.

Trinamool Rajya Sabha Parliamentary Party leader Derek O’Brien in the letter said the party had no objection to India’s participation in the official events but the party takes umbrage at the events of March 27, also the date for polling for the first phase of elections in West Bengal. Saturday’s events included a visit to Orakundi, birthplace of Matua sect founder Harichand Thakur. Mr. Modi tweeted pictures from the Matua temple and the description was also translated into Bengali. The Matua community, immigrants from Bangladesh, has clout in North 24 Parganas and Nadia, which will vote in the subsequent phases. These events, the party said, had nothing to do with either the 50th anniversary of the Independence of Bangladesh or the birth centenary of ‘Bangabandhu’. “Rather, they were solely and exclusively intended to influence the voting pattern in certain constituencies in the ongoing election to the Assembly of West Bengal. No Indian Prime Minister has so brazenly indulged in an unethical and undemocratic act, and violated the model code,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modis-bangladesh-tour-violation-of-model-code/article34202418.ece
31 March 2021||New Delhi,||Congress files plaint on BJP’s Assam ads||The Congress on Tuesday complained to the Election Commission against Bharatiya Janata Party taking out advertisements after the first phase of polling in Assam, in which the party claimed it would win all the 47 Assembly seats in the State. Last Sunday, all prominent newspapers in Assam carried an advertisement that predicted a clean sweep by the BJP in Upper Assam that went to polls a day earlier. Separately, the Congress also complained against BJP Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for using threatening language against one of its ally, Bodo People’s Front chief, Hagrama Mohilary. Speaking to reporters, Rajeev Shukla said the Bharatiya Janata Party ads were a clear violation of the Representation of the People Act and the EC guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-files-plaint-on-bjps-assam-ads/article34202420.ece
31 March 2021||New Delhi,||‘Jab minimises chance of hospitalisation’||There are only a few rare cases wherein people contracted COVID-19 after taking vaccines, said Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday. He was speaking to the media after receiving his second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Dr. Vardhan took the second dose of indigenously developed coronavirus vaccine Covaxin at the Delhi Heart and Lung Institute. He was accompanied by his wife Nutan Goel, who also took the second shot. The Minister added that even if someone tests positive after taking vaccines, it minimises the chances of their hospitalisation or admission to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) wards. Stating that India currently has the lowest COVID-19 fatality rate in the world (1.34%), the Minister appealed to all those eligible to take the vaccine immediately. “There should be no doubt about Covaxin and Covishield safety and immunogenicity. Both Indian vaccines are safe and effective. A lot of people still have doubts regarding vaccines. I urge them not to believe what is being circulated in ‘WhatsApp university’,” the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jab-minimises-chance-of-hospitalisation/article34202424.ece

The State government has notified March 30 as the appointed day for its decision to enhance the age of superannuation of employees. Following the assurance given by the TRS in its election manifesto, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had recently announced his resolve to fulfil the assurance.

31 March 2021||Kochi,||38,586 multiple entries detected, EC tells HC||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday informed the Kerala High Court that it had been able to identify only 38,586 demographically similar entries (DSEs) from 3,16,671 entries on the electoral rolls in the State after an intensive analysis of the data provided by political parties regarding multiple entries on the roll. The ECI submitted that in respect of each 38,586 DSEs, physical verification would be conducted by booth level officers (BLOs) and it would be marked on the ASD (Absentees, Shifted and Dead) list to be prepared by the BLO and such list would be furnished to the presiding offices along with the voters’ list to avert bogus voting. The submission was made by counsel for the ECI when a writ petition filed by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala seeking to delete or freeze the multiple entries of names on the electoral roll was taken up for hearing. ‘No changes possible’ The ECI also submitted that no modification/addition/deletion was possible to weed out the discrepancies on the electoral roll after the last date of making nomination. In order to prevent impersonation of absentee, shifted and duplicate/dead voters, whose names continue to appear on the electoral roll, a list of such voters (ASD) was prepared and provided to the presiding officers concerned. If any persons listed on the ASD list turned up, his/her identity would be verified before allowing such a person to vote. Besides, a thump impression of such voters would be taken in the register of votes (Form-17A). Extra precaution had been taken to ensure that those found on the ASD list could not vote more than once. In his reply affidavit, Mr. Chennithala said the ECI and Chief Electoral Officer was not serious about tackling the serious issue of multiple entries of names on the electoral roll. Besides, they were silent about the action taken on the issue. He suggested that the BLOs be directed to solicit the choice of the voters in writing with signature or thumb impression in advance of the voters who had names in more than one polling booth and report the same to the presiding officers and other presiding officers of the booths where such voter had entered his name. He also suggested taking photographs of the face of each voter immediately after putting ink on his/her finger and obtain an affidavit duly attested by the presiding officer to the effect that he/she had cast only one vote. The court reserved its verdict on his petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/38586-multiple-entries-detected-ec-tells-hc/article34202397.ece

Their family members were harvesting wheat crops in the fields at Kawaiyya village. The charred bodies of Mohd.

31 March 2021||Mumbai,||Sharad Pawar hospitalised in Mumbai||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar was admitted to the Breach Candy hospital on Tuesday. He had been experiencing pain in the abdomen and it was earlier announced that he will be admitted on March 31. “Our party president Sharad Pawar saheb was to be admitted to hospital for endoscopy and surgery procedure tomorrow, but since he is experiencing some pain again in the abdomen, he has been admitted to Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai today,” said NCP leader Nawab Malik. Mr. Pawar’s sudden hospitalisation created a buzz, with many speculating about his health. Mr. Malik, however, denied there were any complications. On Monday, the party had said that Mr. Pawar was feeling a little uneasy due to a pain in his abdomen and was therefore taken to Breach Candy Hospital for a check-up. “Upon diagnosis, it came to light that he has a problem in his gall bladder,” Mr. Malik had said. Mr. Malik said the NCP president was on blood thinning medication, which was now being stopped due to this issue. “An endoscopy and surgery will be conducted. Hence, all his programmes stand cancelled until further notice.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sharad-pawar-hospitalised-in-mumbai/article34202433.ece

31 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Development amidst vexed civic woes||The Anna Nagar constituency has been a fortress of the DMK, which has won the seat eight times since 1977. From here, DMK supremo M. Karunanidhi went to the Assembly twice. Party veterans K. Anbazhagan and Arcot N. Veerasami were also elected from the constituency. The only two occasions when the DMK lost was in 1991, when the Congress’s A. Chellakumar won, and in 2011, when the AIADMK’s S. Gokula Indira emerged as the winner. This constituency comprises areas including Anna Nagar, Kilpauk, Shenoy Nagar, Aminjikarai and parts of Arumbakkam. With an electorate of 2.8 lakh, this constituency houses some of the richest in the city and the lower middle class and the poor. Good facilities From hospitals to educational institutions, this area boasts some good facilities; yet there are some pockets that have been neglected. For instance, while a majority of the roads are in a fairly good condition, there are certain pockets where roads are in a dismal state. Sixth Avenue in Anna Nagar, by-lanes in MMDA Colony, M.H. Colony in Aminjikarai and T.P. Chathram in Shenoy Nagar have been left unattended for long, and are in a terrible shape. Narasimhan, a resident of MMDA Colony, says, “Durairaj Nagar road was relaid after several years just ahead of the election. It is very difficult to travel through M.H. Colony, and it is ridden with potholes. If it rains, the situation only gets worse.” Tree cover lost V. Swaminathan of Shenoy Nagar is disappointed that the tree cover has taken a hit owing to the Chennai Metro Rail project. “It has been years since the station has come up in this area but they have not yet restored the park. We need our trees back,” he says. A. Chokkalingam of Anna Nagar West Extension Association says the storm-water drains have been built on a lower plane, and the water doesn’t flow easily to the Buckhingham Canal, and this should be rectified. The DMK has renominated M.K. Mohan this time. He says he has made sure most civic amenities are well maintained. “During the lockdown, I have distributed hundreds of rice bags to the needy. From ration shops to anganwadis, I have opened quite a lot of facilities for the poor. In addition, I held a job camp recently wherein hundreds of youth got offers from companies,” he says. V. Ponraj, who served as the scientific adviser to former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, is in the race as Makkal Needhi Maiam candidate. But his campaign suffered a setback as he was down with COVID-19. “From constructing good houses for those living in slum clearance board flats and those living close to the Cooum to recreation clubs for senior citizens, I will ensure the needs of all classes of people are taken care of, if voted to power,” he says. S. Gokula Indira of the AIADMK told The Hindu that she is confident that her party will sweep the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/development-amidst-vexed-civic-woes/article34202974.ece
31 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘AIADMK acting as a slave of the BJP’||Time is ripe for the people of Tamil Nadu to overthrow the government of the AIADMK, which has become a slave of the BJP, Congress leader Veerappa Moily has said. Mr. Moily, who is the AICC observer for the Congress’s campaign management in Tamil Nadu, charged the AIADMK with failure to uphold federalism and the BJP with acting as a patron of the AIADMK. “The AIADMK supported the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. But for its 12 votes [in the Rajya Sabha], the Bill would not have been passed. Now the AIADMK is saying it will ask the Centre to revoke the CAA. All this is being done for the purpose of election. If you look at how the BJP is playing it, it is not raising the issue of the CAA in Assam. But in West Bengal, it is talking about it,” he told The Hindu.  Mr. Moily said the three farm laws had gone through Parliament only because of the AIADMK’s support. “There is brazen slavishness on the part of the AIADMK,” he said, adding that had Jayalalithaa been alive, she would have never tolerated it. He criticised the BJP government for India’s abstention from a crucial vote on Sri Lanka’s rights record at the United Nations Human Rights Council. This showed that the party was not interested in the welfare of Sri Lankan Tamils. The protection of Tamils was in the psyche of the electorate. “Politics is more important for the NDA than the welfare of the Tamils in Sri Lanka. This abstention is a big blow to the Tamils,” he said. Asked why the Congress had not been seeking a share in power in the State, Mr. Moily said that was not a dominant demand of the party. The party was more concerned about the country’s stability and integrity than “grabbing power”. “Sharing power is only incidental. It is not the dominant factor,” he said. According to him, DMK president M.K. Stalin was a natural leader who had trained under his father M. Karunanidhi. “This time we are going to be victorious, and he is bound to be the Chief Minister.” The campaign of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and the dynamic leadership of Mr. Stalin would help the DMK-led alliance reap rich rewards, and there was a groundswell of support, he said.  The AIADMK supported the CAA...

31 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Brace for COVID-19 curbs after April 6||The Greater Chennai Corporation will resume stringent COVID-19 containment activities after the election on April 6, Commissioner and Chennai District Election Officer G. Prakash said. Mr. Prakash said perimeter control planning for areas with COVID-19 cases would start after April 6. The movement of residents within these containment zones would be restricted. At present, there is no restriction in the movement of residents in streets with reports of COVID-19 cases. “Once polling is over, old verticals will be introduced for containment. We will go on full blast,” said Mr. Prakash. Containment activities At present, 358 streets have registered more than three COVID-19 cases. The Corporation has put up banners for 14 days in such areas. In a few days, more than 7,000 volunteers are expected to carry out COVID-19 containment activities for three months in containment zones. “We have made arrangements for COVID-19 care centres for 6,000 patients in Athipet. More COVID-19 care centres will be commissioned at Anna University, Madras University and Victoria Hostel,” said Mr. Prakash. Madras University and Anna University would have 1,000 beds each. In June 2020, when the pandemic had peaked, the Corporation made arrangements for 23,000 beds in the city. During the election, PPE kits would be provided to COVID-19 patients visiting the polling stations. Pointing to the rise in the number of cases because of religious functions, hotels and public transportation, Mr. Prakash said each individual had the responsibility of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Poll preparations Ahead of the Assembly election, the Chennai district election office has seized material worth Rs. 26 crore. Senior citizens who had not voted would get a second chance to make use of the postal ballot system. Over 4,070 out of 7,300 senior citizens had voted. The officials would visit their homes for two days. Those who did not vote during the two days would get a second chance, said Mr. Prakash. The number of vulnerable and critical polling stations had increased by 12 after consultations with political parties. In all, 577 vulnerable and 30 critical polling stations had been identified in the city. Security arrangements for the booths would be strengthened. “We have made arrangements to increase the turnout. We have organised awareness camps,” said Mr. Prakash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/brace-for-covid-19-curbs-after-april-6/article34202977.ece
31 March 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Only 14 prisoners in Tamil Nadu will be voting||Only 14 prisoners out of the the total 15,416 convicts and undertrials lodged in nine central prisons and sub-jails will be exercising their franchise two days ahead of the Assembly poll in the State. Jail officials said most of them were not eligible to cast their vote as per settled law. However, those detained under preventive detention laws were given the right to vote. “Most of them — convicts and undertrials — do not have the right to vote as per settled law. However, detenues under preventive detention laws, such as Goondas Act and National Securities Act, are allowed to vote through postal ballot,” said a senior officer of the Prison Department. As many as 1,571 detenues could vote but only 14 had expressed their willingness. “We have sent their willingness to the government. After verifying the addresses and other eligibility details, the returning officers will send the postal ballots,” the officer said. As per the records of the Prison Department, 368 detenues are lodged in Central Prison-II, Puzhal, 225 in Tiruchi, 201 in Vellore, 147 in Coimbatore, 178 in Madurai, 205 in Palayamkottai, 106 in Cuddalore, and 141 in Salem. Among them, those who are detained for the first time are eligible to cast votes. Only five detenues in Central Prison, Coimbatore, seven in Cuddalore, and one each in Palayamkottai and Puzhal are going to vote now. RP Act As per sub-section (5) of Section 62 of the Representation of the People Act, any person who is confined in prison while serving a sentence for any offence or is under lawful confinement in a prison or in police custody for any reason is not entitled to vote. In 1997, the Supreme Court rejected a plea for voting rights to prisoners citing resource crunch. Permitting every prisoner to vote would require deployment of a much larger police force, it said. But activists have demanded that voting rights be given to all prisoners, including convicts and undertrials. Senior advocate Sudha Ramalingam said, “On the face of it, the reason given is that prisoners are incarcerated due to their criminal acts and so they are confined in prisons, depriving their fundamental right to live anywhere they like which includes the right to vote. But as the most basic premise of criminal jurisprudence is that one is deemed innocent unless found guilty, those undergoing preventive detention and undertrial prisoners ought not to be treated on a par with convicts.” According to the UN, prisoners should be given the right to vote, she said. A number of countries had allowed it. “Our Supreme Court and the High Courts have upheld Section 62 (5) of the RP Act, which deprives prisoners of the right to vote. I feel adult franchises should be universal,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/only-14-prisoners-in-tamil-nadu-will-be-voting/article34202997.ece

31 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Election pushes up fuel sales||Despite the prices remaining high, fuel sales have gone up in the State in March, thanks to a combination of factors, including electioneering, increased fishing activities and the continued use of personal vehicles for transportation. “In the southern States, for the oil industry as a whole till March 28 diesel growth was only 13.5%, whereas for Tami Nadu it is 17%. Similarly, for petrol, the growth is 12.7% against Tamil Nadu’s growth of 13.3%,” said an industry source, who added that the data was not to be compared with last year’s figures since the lockdown began at March-end owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. An oil marketing company official said that the growth in diesel sales was due to increased economic activity, electioneering and fishing. “We are getting good demand for diesel from the south like Ramanathapuram and Thoothukudi from fishing vessels. Last year, during the lockdown, fishing, too, had come to a stand still,” he said. As far as petrol sales were concerned, people continued to use personal vehicles for commute. “People are still afraid of using public transport. Many are purchasing new vehicles,” he said. Fuel outlets in some areas of Tamil Nadu were seeing a marginal increase in petrol and diesel sales owing to electioneering. “This has been so only for the past few days. And it will be so only for a few more days till the end of campaigning,” said a dealer, who said customers had stopped fighting about the high fuel prices. “They only grumble now and talk about elections and voting. Though fuel price is a major factor this election, we hoped it would come down. But international factors are driving the prices up instead,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/election-pushes-up-fuel-sales/article34202978.ece
31 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||It is more about making a statement for sexual minority candidates||Fifty-three-year-old M. Radha, a transperson contesting in the Assembly election from Mylapore constituency as an independent, has no delusions about securing a huge share of votes let alone winning. Her modest expectation is to surpass the number of votes she got in the Parliamentary election in 2019, the first time she contested an election. As a candidate from the Chennai South constituency, under which Mylapore falls, she secured 1,042 votes and stood 14th among the 40 contestants. “I am very hopeful of getting considerably more votes this time,” Ms. Radha, who is contesting on the ‘telephone’ symbol, says. She is clear about her objective. “I want to change the stigmatised perception people have about transpersons and highlight our issues by using the election as an opportunity to get people’s attention,” she says. She is one of the two transperson candidates among the 3,998 in the fray across Tamil Nadu. Bharathi Kannamma is the other candidate contesting from Madurai South constituency. Ms. Radha says although members of the trans community were finding more acceptance and gradually entering many professions, there was still a long way to go for the society to change the negative perceptions. “Many still want to think of us as those who either beg or involve in sex work for livelihood. I want to show that we are dignified people who are struggling in life due to discrimination, lack of opportunities and support,” she says. Highlighting how numbers mattered in electoral politics, she complains that none of the major political parties have prominently highlighted any welfare measures for them in their manifestos owing to the smaller size of the trans community. “The Transgender Welfare Board, started during the previous DMK government, has largely remained non-functional since 2015,” she says. She is paid an abysmally low Rs. 500 a month for working as a peer educator for a government programme through a non-governmental organisation to create awareness among the transgender community. “In contrast, a group of us recently visited Kerala and we were impressed by the schemes implemented there,” she says. On whether she intended to join any political party, she quips that parties called them only during elections to attend meetings or campaigns in return for money, but did not want to give them an opportunity to enter electoral politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-is-about-making-a-statement-for-sexual-minority-candidates/article34203003.ece
31 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vanniyar quota will go up after caste census, says Ramadoss||The 10.5% quota set aside for the Vanniyars within the Most Backward Class reservation is permanent, and it will only be increased after a caste census is done in Tamil Nadu, PMK founder S. Ramadoss said on Tuesday. He said in a statement that a caste census would bring out the fact that the Vanniyars constituted around 15% of the State’s population, and the reservation would accordingly be increased through a new law. His statement comes after AIADMK coordinator-cum-Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and other AIADMK leaders said the 10.5% reservation was only provisional. Dr. Ramadoss said the issue did not involve a caste, but social justice and development. “The legislation providing 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyars was passed by the Assembly and signed into law by the Governor. The law has officially been notified.” A law could not be temporary after the Assembly ratified it. “Another legislation has to be brought in to replace it. This is the procedure.” Ensuring social justice meant providing reservation [in education and employment] proportionate to population, he said. “The Chief Minister also said in the Assembly that the 10.5% reservation was a first step, and the quantum would be increased after a caste census.”   The legislation providing 10.5% reservation for the Vanniyars was passed by the Assembly and signed into law by the Governor||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vanniyar-quota-will-go-up-after-caste-census/article34202617.ece

Nagar, arrested three drug peddlers from Tripura and seized 140 kg of ganja from them. Following a tip-off on the movement of contraband, a special team deployed decoys to a room in a private lodge on Begam Shahib Second Street, Thousand Lights. At 7.30 p.m, the sleuths nabbed two youth at the lodge and seized 20 kg ganja from them. Based on information given by them, the police team raided a rented house at Thoraipakkam where 120 kg of ganja was stocked for the purpose of selling in the city. The names of the arrested were given as Mohamud Mamunul Islam, 22, Sarif Chowdhary, 25, and Sahin Miah, 23, of Tripura. The contraband, cash and mobile phones were seized by the police. The accused sent ganja through a reputed courier firm to the city for the purpose of distribution and sale. After despatch, they flew to the city and collected goods and stocked at the rented house in Kallukuttai, Thoraipakkam. Later, they distributed it to the customers who placed orders online, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/140-kg-ganja-seized-three-held/article34202969.ece
31 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||I am trying to break my own notions on same sex relationship, says judge||Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the Madras High Court on Tuesday wrote that he was trying to break his own preconceived notions about same sex relationships and was in the process of evolving and sincerely attempting to understand the feelings of people involved in such relationships and also that of their parents to whom such relationships involving their children come as a rude shock. Passing interim orders on a petition filed by two young women with same sex orientation, the judge decided to send the petitioners and their parents for counselling to an expert working with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community and obtain a report. Such a report would help the court in proceeding with the case complaining of harassment by the petitioners’ parents, he said. “I personally spent time doing research and collecting materials to arrive at a proper understanding of this issue. It would have been possible for me to pack my order with a lot of research material and get applauded by the outside world for rendering a scholarly order. However, there was a call from inside which kept reminding me that if I venture into such an exercise at this stage, it will only be hypocritical of me since the order will not reveal my true and honest feeling about this very important issue,” he said. “To be open, I am also trying to break my own preconceived notions about this issue and I am in the process of evolving and sincerely attempting to understand the feelings of the petitioners and their parents. Thereafter, I shall proceed to write a detailed order on this issue. That is the reason why I am trying to develop this case brick by brick and ultimately construct something purposeful on this issue,” the judge wrote. After talking to the petitioners and parents in-camera, the judge recorded that the petitioners were graduates from Madurai Kamaraj University and they had fled to Chennai due to police complaints lodged by their parents. Now, they were under the care of a non-governmental organisation, International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care, and were looking for jobs to sustain themselves financially. The petitioners did not mince words while explaining their relationship to the judge and insisted that they preferred to reside together. Hence, the judge requested psychologist Vidya Dinakaran to hold counselling sessions with them and their parents in the third week of April and submit a report to the court by April 26. He recorded the submission of the Madurai police that they would not pursue the woman missing complaints by the petitioner’s parents.

Facebook has blocked his account. Mr. Babu, who is the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) candidate for Velachery, told The Hindu that a coordinated attack had led to the automatic blocking of his account. He wrote on Twitter: “Yesterday, my Facebook profile became locked and we are still struggling with getting my page back. Since I was doing a hyper digital campaign, from my hospital bed, in Corona ward, this is a coordinated attack.” Mr. Babu alleged that this could be the joint work of the information technology cells of other parties. ‘Not violated norms’ In the last two weeks, an average of over 10,000 people watched his page for live chats and hundreds of them shared the videos. He said he and his team had not violated the community guidelines of Facebook. He said Facebook had asked him to fill a form and restoration might take long.

31 March 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Arappor Iyakkam launches mobile app for election||The non-governmental organisation Arappor Iyakkam has launched a mobile application providing easy access to information on contestants from all the constituencies for the upcoming Tamil Nadu Assembly election. The app, which can be found on Android and iOS platforms under the title ‘Arappor Iyakkam - Empowering Citizens’, has a “Know your candidate” section in Tamil and English, providing details income, assets of and criminal cases (if any) against the candidates. Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of the organisation, said that the intention was to help citizens make an informed choice before voting for a candidate. “Moreover, independent candidates do not get a level playing field with many people not knowing the names of independents in their constituencies. In the application, we have provided constituency-wise list of contestants and their symbols,” he said. Though the data has been compiled from the affidavits filed by candidates that are already available on Election Commission of India’s website, he said that accessing the information from there can be tedious for many. “One has to download the affidavit in pdf format that has several pages for each candidate and look for relevant details. We have made it easier,” he said. He pointed out that only sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) are provided by the candidates in their affidavits. “We have provided the offences these sections refer to so that the public can easily understand the nature of the crime,” he said. Over 600 volunteers from multiple locations worked on compiling the data, and designing the app to make it available before the election, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/arappor-iyakkam-launches-mobile-app-for-election/article34202575.ece

31 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘It is film star vs political actor vs son of the soil’||Under a tree, a group of politically active residents from Ho Chi Min Nagar, near Sivananda Colony, are busy taking selfies. A little away, a group of youngsters in their twenties are busy cheering the gathering with their drum beats. They are waiting for Congress working president and Coimbatore South constituency candidate Mayura S. Jayakumar, who has scheduled his campaign in the area and other parts of Ward 50 of the Coimbatore Corporation. As his vehicle nears the point, the drum beat picks up pace. After greeting local leaders of parties in the Secular Progressive Alliance, Mr. Jayakumar walks the narrow lanes of the residential locality, which is mostly populated by people from the lower income group.  After walking a few lanes, the Congress candidate lands in front of a temple where he uses the public address system to reach out to voters. The residents have been demanding title deeds (patta) for long time. “How is that the AIADMK that has been in power for 10 years has not taken steps to give patta, but will give those after the ensuing election? Therefore, what the BJP candidate, Vanathi Srinivasan, has promised a few days ago during her campaign in this area was nothing, but a lie,” he tells the listeners. Mr. Jayakumar says he has always been associated with the area and reminds the residents how during the COVID-19 lockdown, he distributed free rice and vegetables. “You’ll also recall how I’ve been running a tuition centre in the area for students to have good education.” Moving around a few more lanes, Mr. Jayakumar says the two other major contestants in the arena are not from the area – one is a film star and another is a political actor. Both are from Chennai. Whereas, he is from Coimbatore South and is only a phone call away. Moving to a few more residential localities, Mr. Jayakumar repeats most of the charges against his opponents. In Gandhi Nagar, he shares his phone number to the residents saying that he is only a phone call away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-is-film-star-vs-political-actor-vs-son-of-the-soil/article34203020.ece

31 March 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||T.N. Assembly election crucial: Prakash Karat||The Assembly election in Tamil Nadu is crucial as it will decide whether the State will have a government controlled from New Delhi by the Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi or a government that is independent and answerable to the people of Tamil Nadu, Communist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member Prakash Karat said at Dharapuram on Tuesday. “We have seen how the AIADMK has acted as the junior partner of BJP and RSS. Whenever the Central government passed anti-people policies or laws, the AIADMK had supported them,” he said at an election campaign meeting. When several people died or lost their livelihood during the pandemic last year, the Prime Minister launched one attack after another on people in the form of the three farm laws and labour codes, and the steep rise in the prices of diesel, petrol, and LPG. In Tiruppur, Mr. Karat said the Central government’s policies led to distress among SMEs. He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke at Dharapuram about Periyar and Anna in the context of women’s equality. Mr. Modi was a pracharak of the RSS. The RSS and BJP believe in Manu Smriti, which says women are inferior to men. Since he is talking in Tamil Nadu, Mr. Modi spoke of Periyar and Anna. “So, this is the force which is inimical to the ideals of Periyar, Anna and the Dravidian movement. Today, they are paying lip service to it,” he said. In Coimbatore, Mr. Karat said the AIADMK had betrayed the ideals of Anna and the Dravidian movement by following the ideology and policies of the BJP. Hence, the party should drop ‘Anna’ and ‘Dravida’ from its name.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-assembly-election-crucial-prakash-karat/article34202597.ece

The protest was against India’s decision to abstain from voting at the United Nations Human Rights Council on a resolution seeking investigation into war crimes allegedly committed by the Sri Lankan government during the Eelam war. ‘A betrayal’ Calling it a betrayal of Tamil cause, the outfits attempted to show black flags to Mr. Modi, who arrived at the Coimbatore airport to participate in campaigns in Palakkad, Kerala, Dharapuram and Puducherry. Holding ‘go back Modi’ placards, they shouted slogans saying that the Centre had taken stand that was in support of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.

31 March 2021||Dharmapuri,TAMIL NADU||Close fight between DMK, PMK in Dharmapuri||Dharmapuri, primarily a Vanniyar dominated constituency, is set to witness a close contest between Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Pattali Makkal Katchi. The constituency lags in an industry led employment forcing educated youth to look for employment elsewhere, primarily in Bengaluru. SIPCOT industrial estate The SIPCOT industrial estate that was announced in 2011, remains an unfulfilled dream of Dharmapuri.Panjapalli water supply scheme that was primary source of drinking water for Dharmapuri was stopped. The constituency is made up of the municipality with its 33 wards and a contiguous rural belt. The DMK traditionally has held sway over the town voters. While the rural extensions such as Elakyampatty panchayat, and villages of Nallampalli union are Vanniyar dominated. Govt. employees A significant proportion of government employees, seen as the vote bank of the DMK, are residents of Dharmapuri municipality. Incidentally, the 10.5% internal quota for Vanniyars is selectively used as a campaign agenda. As if to not spurn the other backward communities that are purportedly aggrieved by the quota for Vanniyars, the internal quota is selectively flaunted as a feat of the PMK in PMK held areas and not everywhere in the constituency. Both the DMK and the PMK summon bulk support in different parts of the constituency. However, like the other PMK constituency of Pennagaram, there is resentment among the AIADMK’s local aspirants for conceding the constituency to the PMK. And like Pennagaram, there is no telling of an absolute transfer of the AIADMK votes in the favour of the PMK owing to this grievance. In addition, like in other PMK fought constituencies, the DMK has whisked in the family of the late Vanniyar Sangam leader Kaaduvetti Guru to undercut the PMK’s campaign. Dalit votes The AIADMK’s alliance with the BJP and the symbol of PMK are two factors that is expected to steer away minority and Dalit votes from the alliance in favour of the DMK. The constituency has 14% Adidravidars, 18% other intermediate castes, 4.4% Muslims and 3.6% Christians, among others. The PMK has won the seat twice in 2001 and 2006, DMDK won in 2011, and the DMK won the seat in 2016. The DMK has fielded its incumbent MLA P. Subramani, who is known as affable. While the PMK has fielded the district chairman S.P. Venkateswaran, who is well versed with the constituency. Makkal Needhi Maiam has fielded Jaya Venkatesh, and the AMMK has fielded D.K. Rajendran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/close-fight-between-dmk-pmk-in-dharmapuri/article34202613.ece

31 March 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Farmers in trouble in green zone||Gobichettipalayam is agrarian out and out. The region is also called ‘Chinna Kodambakkam’ for its picturesque fields and brimming canals that have attracted the cinema industry for over 30 years. Paddy, sugar cane, turmeric, tobacco, plantain and coconuts are grown abundantly. Mulberry cultivation is another major activity. Freedom fighters G.S. Lakshman Iyer, and K.S. Ramasamy Gounder hailed from Gobichettipalayam. The absence of right price for farm products, inadequate cold storage, the failure to establish a cocoon market, lack of an outer ring road, the mixing of sewage in the Thadapalli Canal, the delay in the relocation of the garbage dump yard, shortage of job opportunities for the youth and the delay in the settlement of dues to sugar cane farmers by mills are the major issues. Alternative crops Since farmers are not getting the right price for turmeric, the area under the crop has dropped from over 10,000 acres to less than 2,000 acres. Mulberry cultivators have long been demanding a cocoon market. Many farmers have switched to alternative crops. The Kodiveri anicut attracts a large number of tourists. Development works were carried out recently, but tourists demand more changing rooms and other facilities. There is also a demand for improving the facilities at the Gunderipallam reservoir to attract more tourists.  Won nine times The AIADMK has won the seat nine times and the DMK twice. The incumbent and School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan has represented the constituency seven times from 1980 to 2016, except in 1996 when he lost to G.P. Venkidu of the DMK.

31 March 2021||KRISHNAGIRI,TAMIL NADU||PMK, AIADMK made laughing stock of reservation: D. Raja||CPI general secretary D. Raja on Tuesday charged that the PMK and AIADMK have pushed reservation to a corner solely for political opportunism. Responding to Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam’s interview with The Hindu, in which he said the 10.5 % reservation for Vanniyars was only provisional, the CPI leader said the AIADMK and the PMK have rendered reservation a ‘laughing stock’. “The PMK asked for one thing, the AIADMK-led State government announced something else, and has now backtracked saying it is only provisional. How can a policy be provisional? Then what was the need to announce that,” he asked. What was the ideology of this AIADMK government, and the rationale behind the PMK joining this alliance, he asked. The issue had brought to fore the fundamental dissonance between the two allies, Mr. Raja said. According to Mr. Raja, the PMK has been reduced to a party of “ideological conflict” by its association with the BJP. “It calls itself a party for social justice and aligns with the BJP. Its ideological position will be put to further test post elections,” Mr. Raja said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-aiadmk-made-laughing-stock-of-reservation-d-raja/article34202619.ece

31 March 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘#GoBackModi hashtag is natural sentiment of the Tamils’||As Prime Minister Modi is in Tamil Nadu for campaigning, #GoBackModi is trending on Twitter again. The hashtag is the natural sentiment of the people of Tamil Nadu, says DMK IT wing head and Madurai Central MLA P.T.R.P. Thiagarajan. Excerpts:   Whenever Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Tamil Nadu, #GoBackModi trends on Twitter at national level...  This is a natural sentiment of the Tamils. If you ask if the DMK IT wing has anything do with it, the answer is no. We encourage it, participate in it and try to make it bigger. But, neither do we have the capacity to do it by ourselves, nor are we the major instigators of this hashtag. It is the natural expression of the Tamils and the Tamil diaspora around the world. We don’t have the capacity to make something happen that is not in the hearts of the people. Even if the DMK IT wing doesn’t participate, the hashtag will still trend.  Do you think digital platform campaigns influence voter behaviour?  We know the capacity of full-scale digital marketing, especially in places like the U.S. where it is easier to tailor content separately for every voter. Although the scenario is not the same in India, there has been a remarkable trend in T.N. which has greatly changed the game. Statistically, T.N. is one of the States with the highest internet penetration. It also has the highest internet penetration in rural areas. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the people to get all their content and information online. Therefore, the ability to influence through digital marketing has spectacularly increased in T.N. in the last five years.  Does DMK believe in responding or countering Twitter trolls?  Countering trolls cannot be the primary work of any IT wing. To me, the IT wing is both an integral part of the party’s overall communications programme and integral part of the its administration. The BJP sees its IT wing as a false propaganda machine to cover the inabilities and failures of the government.  What is the role of an IT wing, a later day staple of elections?  A digital campaign is a part of overall communication and marketing plan. The DMK IT wing will amplify the general message that our leader wants us to convey to the people. In 2016 Assembly elections, a negligible amount of marketing expenses of the DMK were through digital campaigns. By 2019, the total marketing expenses came down by one third.  How do IT teams counter ridicule on social media?  On the PM’s birthday, a lot of people were talking about unemployment in the country. When every strategy failed, the BJP IT wing got reduced to #RespectyourPM. This is a turning point, as here is an IT wing that is like a cult manager whose job is to talk about the PM. There is no effective way to prevent a huge negative campaign. Trending on social media platforms is not equal to winning elections or field politics. The parties can merely use the technology to enhance ground connectivity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gobackmodi-hashtag-is-natural-sentiment-of-the-tamils/article34203122.ece
31 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK-BJP alliance is opportunistic: Kanimozhi||The alliance between All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is an opportunistic alliance, which was formed to safeguard the interests of AIADMK leaders, charged Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) women's wing secretary M.K. Kanimozhi, here on Tuesday. Campaigning for CPI (M) Tirupparankundram candidate S. Ponnuthai at Harveypatti, Ms. Kanimozhi said that the DMK formed an alliance with parties which have similar ideologies. Accusing the AIADMK of changing its stance ahead of assembly elections, Ms. Kanimozhi said that initially the AIADMK government supported the Citizenship Amendment Act and the agricultural laws passed by the BJP government. "But, now suddenly the AIADMK is changing its stance and has promised to press the Centre to revoke the CAA once voted to power. This shows that the AIADMK-BJP alliance was opportunistic," she said. She said that the CM's claim that alliance with BJP has benefited Tamil Nadu was false. Although it had been more than two years since the foundation stone was laid for AIIMS, there has not been any progress after that. The State government has also failed to exempt the State from NEET. "The AIADMK has mortgaged the rights of Tamil Nadu to the Centre," she charged. She claimed that there was no industrial development in the State in the last 10 years. "The women feel unsafe and anyone opposing the government is threatened," she added. Ms. Kanimozhi promised proper functioning of the IT park at Vadapalanji and construction of an underground drainage system at Avaniapuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-bjp-alliance-is-opportunistic/article34202590.ece

31 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||DMK and AIADMK bribe voters, says Kamal Hassan||The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) are committing a crime by paying Rs. 5,000 as cash-for-votes, to obtain the rights to control the life of voters, alleged Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) president Kamal Hassan. Addressing a public campaign meeting at Avaniapuram here on Tuesday evening, Mr. Hassan said that people must understand that receiving money from the Dravidian parties as a bribe to vote for those parties, will not alleviate their poverty. "But, MNM is a party that is going to revolutionise Tamil Nadu politics," he said. He said that the main aim of all the candidates of MNM was to serve the public. All the candidates of MNM are from various professions and are not dependent on politics for their livelihood. "I am also one among them. For the past 25 years, I focused on my own work and did not think about politics. But, in the remaining days, my aim is to serve the people," he added. The party promised to set up industries and IT companies in Tirupparankundram assembly constituency once voted to power. Seamless drinking water will also be supplied to all the wards in the constituency. Removal of encroachments from waterbodies was one of the main priorities of the party, he said. Mr. Hassan said that an MNM candidate from Madurai was attacked by competing contestants from other parties. "Unlike the DMK and the AIADMK which follow rowdyism, the MNM will be open for legal route against this attack," he said. Actor Radhika Sarathkumar of All India Samathuva Makkal Katchi also campaigned along with Mr. Hassan at Bethaniapuram and Arapalayam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-aiadmk-commit-crime-by-paying-cash-for-votes-says-kamal-hassan/article34202589.ece

31 March 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea to desilt Vaigai dam||Claiming that the Vaigai dam may have a silt deposit of up to 20 feet, reducing the original storage capacity by at least 15 %, an advocate moved the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Tuesday seeking a direction to the authorities to desilt the sand deposited in the Vaigai dam. Advocate B. Stalin of Melur said that reservoir sedimentation was a severe problem faced due to soil erosion in the catchment areas of the reservoir. Virtually no work has taken off to desilt the Vaigai dam since its inception, he said. In 2016, there was a total estimation of around Rs. 180 crore to desilt the Vaigai dam and the same was revised to Rs. 220 crore in 2019. However, the study and ideas to desilt the Vaigai dam were still pending, the petitioner said. Apart from desilting the Vaigai dam, the petitioner also sought a direction to the authorities concerned to fix a boundary to the water storage area, remove encroachments in the water storage area and prevent water theft in Moola Vaigai and Vaigai river. A Division Bench of Justice M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi ordered notice to the State and sought a response from the authorities concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaigai-dam-not-desilted-since-its-inception/article34202585.ece
31 March 2021||NAGERCOIL,TAMIL NADU||Narendra Modi has neglected Tamils: Stalin||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has neglected Tamils and been doing everything possible against their language, culture and welfare, his electioneering in Tamil Nadu will ensure the BJP and its allies’ crushing defeat in the State, DMK president M.K. Stalin said. Canvassing votes for DMK candidates S. Austin of Kanniyakumari and N. Suresh Rajan of Nagercoil and Congress candidate for Kanniyakumari Lok Sabha by-election H. Vijayakumar alias Vijay Vasanth at Aralvaimozhi near here on Tuesday, he said, the PM, following the killing of a few Tamil fishermen by the Sri Lankan navy when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, had said the absence of a ‘manly Prime Minister’ had emboldened the island nation’s navy to unleash murderous attack on Tamil fishermen. He had uttered this in a bid to mock at Mr. Singh. When he became the Prime Minister in 2014, Mr. Modi held talks with Sri Lanka and the neighbouring country’s navy continued to hunt down the Tamil Nadu fishermen besides destroying their boats, nets and detaining the vessels. However, Mr. Modi, who once mocked at Mr. Manmohan Singh, was helplessly witnessing these attacks. Moreover, he was working against the culture and language of Tamils ever since he became the Prime Minister and had enacted the Citizenship Amendment Act, Act banning Triple Talaq and the Farmers’ Act with the help of the AIADMK and Anbumani Ramadoss of the PMK. But, the DMK collected over 2 crore signatures against the CAA and spoke against it in the Tamil Nadu Assembly even as Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami supported it saying that there was no harm in accepting CAA. “Mr. Modi’s electioneering in Tamil Nadu for the BJP candidates and its allies will ensure their crushing defeat,” Mr. Stalin said even as Mr. Modi is scheduled to visit Kanniyakumari on April 2. He assured that the DMK, on returning to power after the April 6 Assembly polls, would ensure Tamil fishermen’s fishing rights and their safety on high seas. The DMK president said the AIADMK, after supporting these controversial Acts in the Parliament, had promised in its manifesto that they would urge the Centre to repeal it in an attempt to cheat the voters. “This is betrayal of the people. Mr. Palaniswami’s betrayal of Tamils to please Mr. Modi is more toxic than the venom of snakes,” Mr. Stalin said. The Chief Minister’s recent assertion that he would not allow Kanniyakumari International Container Transhipment Terminal was nothing but hoodwinking the people. Training guns on Tamil Nadu Government’s Special Representative to Delhi and AIADMK candidate for Kanniyakumari Assembly constituency N. Thalavai Sundaram as the “business partner of EPS and OPS”, Mr. Stalin charged that Mr. Thalavai Sundaram had amassed wealth from Kanniyakumari to Cambodia instead of working for the well-being of his district. “After being sidelined by then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, Mr. Thalavai Sundaram, who managed to get the blessings of V.K. Sasikala, became Tamil Nadu Government’s Special Representative to Delhi. He betrayed Mrs. Sasikala to join the camp led by EPS. If he is elected from Kanniyakumari, he will defect to the BJP, betraying the people of Kanniyakumari and the AIADMK as well,” Mr. Stalin said. Terming BJP candidate for Kanniyakumari by-poll and former Union Minister Pon. Radhakrishnan ‘Poi’ (lie) Radhakrishnan, Mr. Stalin said he who got elected in 2014 did not fulfil none of the promises he had made in that Parliamentary election. “Mr. Radhakrishnan, one of the prominent leaders of the BJP, promised to establish commercial port at Colachel, airport in Kanniyakumari, Sports Authority of India’s Centre, industrial park, cancer research centre at Government Medical College Hospital etc. Since he failed to fulfil the poll promises even after being the Union Minister, I call him as ‘poi’ Radhakrishnan. He lost the 2019 election for letting down his poll promises and is going to lose this by-election too. The crushing defeat you are going to present him should make him of not think of contesting an election any more,” Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/narendra-modi-has-neglected-tamils-stalin/article34203242.ece

Ramkumar Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhgam (AMMK) has fielded S. Anbazhagan.

The situation in Puducherry is unique,” he said, referring to the denial of ticket to Mr Narayansamy. “It reflects the condition of Congress. He was denied ticket despite being a loyalist (to Gandhi family) for so many years,” he said, addressing a public meeting at AFT Ground in Puducherry. Terming the previous Congress government in the Union Territory as one of the worst “non- performing” governments, he said the Congress legislators themselves had levelled charges against the Chief Minister and his family.

The region had a tremendous scope in terms of growth in spiritual tourism, he pointed out. Mr. Modi said the Centre had constructed 6,000 houses under a scheme and another 8,000 were under construction. The Centre had sanctioned Rs. 2,000 crore worth projects under the Smart City programme, he added. Speaking on the occasion, AINRC leader and former Chief Minister N. Rangasamy charged that the last five years under Mr. Narayanasamy were the “darkest” in the history of Puducherry and his government had taken the region 10 years backwards. Candidates belonging to the AIADMK and the BJP were also present at the meeting.  I could see a wave in all the four States and one Union Territory.

31 March 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||54 candidates in Puducherry face criminal charges||An analysis of the affidavits submitted by candidates in the 30 constituencies across the Union Territory of Puducherry for the April 6 Assembly election shows 17% of them face criminal charges. The analysis, done by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)/The Puducherry Election Watch, found that 54 candidates (17%) of the 323 candidates had declared criminal cases pending against them and 28 (9%) declared serious criminal cases pending against them. In the 2016 Assembly election, of the 343 candidates analysed, 68 (20%) had declared criminal cases and 30 (9%) had declared serious criminal cases. The 2021 study excluded one Independent candidate — S.K. Subramanian from the Raj Bhavan constituency — owing to the incomplete affidavit available on the Election Commission of India’s website at the time of preparing the report, which was recently shared with the media. In a party-wise breakdown, 3 out of 5 candidates from the AIADMK, 5 out of 9 candidates from the BJP, 7 out of 13 candidates from the DMK, 4 out of 14 candidates from the Congress, 3 out of 16 candidates from the All India N.R. Congress and 2 out of 26 candidates from the DMDK had declared criminal cases pending against them. An analysis of those facing serious charges from the major parties shows 2 out of 5 candidates from the AIADMK, 5 out of 13 candidates from the DMK, 2 out of 9 candidates from the BJP, 2 out of 14 candidates from the Congress, 2 out of 26 candidates from the DMDK and 1 out of 16 candidates from the All India N.R. Congress have declared serious criminal cases. While two Independent candidates have declared cases related to murder (Section 302, IPC), the AINRC candidate from Karaikal North faces a charge related to attempt to murder (Section 307, IPC). Only one candidate — Congress candidate from Manavely — has declared cases of crime against women, relating to word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman (Section-509, IPC). Out of the 323 candidates analysed, 36 are from national parties, 64 from State parties, 108 from registered unrecognised parties and 115 are contesting independently. The analysts have found that 8 (27%) of the 30 constituencies are red alert constituencies, or constituencies where 3 or more candidates have declared criminal cases against themselves. In its conclusions, the ADR has observed that the directions of the Supreme Court appeared to have had little effect on the parties in the selection of candidates in the 2021 election. All major parties have put on their ticket 8% to 60% candidates who have declared criminal cases. The Supreme Court, in its directions of February 13, 2020, instructed parties to cite reasons for selection of such candidates and why others without criminal antecedents could not be selected. The reasons have to be with reference to qualifications, achievements and merit. ‘No interest in reform’ “The data clearly show that political parties have no interest in reforming the electoral system and our democracy will continue to suffer at the hands of lawbreakers who become lawmakers,” says P. Joseph Victor Raj, State coordinator for the ADR/The Puducherry Election Watch. The ADR has recommended measures to remedy this criminalisation of the political sphere by permanent disqualification of candidates convicted of such heinous crimes as murder, rape, smuggling, dacoity and kidnapping and debarring persons against whom charges have been framed for having committed serious criminal offences punishable by imprisonment of at least 5 years and the case is filed at least 6 months prior to election. It has also suggested cancellation of tax exemptions given to the parties which field such candidates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/54-candidates-in-ut-face-criminal-charges/article34203008.ece

31 March 2021||Rajapalayam,TAMIL NADU||Stalin takes strong exception to Prime Minister’s charges||Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M. K. Stalin took strong exception to Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s comment that women in Tamil Nadu will not be safe if DMK came to power. “Does not the Prime Minister know about the Pollachi sexual assault case wherein around 250 girls were sexually abused for three years with the knowledge of officials, police and ruling party men. “The women were kidnapped, the crime incidents were videographed and the women were threatened,” he alleged. If he (Mr. Modi) does not know about this, he does not have the right to continue in the post of Prime Minister,” Mr. Stalin charged. While the PM said that law and order in the State will deteriorate under the DMK government, why did he hide about the recent incident of sexual harassment of a woman Superintendent of Police by the very Director General of Police rank officer, he asked. Mr. Stalin also recalled that three college girl students were burnt alive in a bus burning incident in Dharmapuri when the then Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa was convicted in a corruption case. Flaying Mr. Modi for making such false allegations, Mr. Stalin said that it was not fit for a man holding the highest position to make such statements. “The Bharatiya Janata Party was routed in the Parliamentary election in 2019 and would face the same fate in the Assembly election too,” the Leader of the Opposition said. The BJP was enrolling several anti-social elements in its party and one of its functionaries was charged with sexually harassing a minor girl, Mr. Stalin said. Rajenthra Bhalaji Voters of Rajapalayam Assembly constituency should reject Minister for Dairy Development K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, who has been chased out of Sivakasi by its voters, said Mr. Stalin. “All these days, I have been seeking votes for candidates of our (Secular Progressive) alliance parties. But, for the first time, I have come to tell you who not to vote for?” is how started Mr. Stalin in his speech. Stating that Mr. Bhalaji was always talking about violence and abused people on caste and religious lines, Mr. Stalin said even a ruling party MLA from the district, M.S.R. Rajavarman complained about threat to his life from the Minister. Mr. Stalin said that Mr. Bhalaji was an example of why he said that win of AIADMK would become victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party. “It was Mr. Bhalaji who said that Modi is our daddy,” the DMK president recalled. The Minister never spoke about his department. He never gave a reply to various corruption charges levelled against Aavin and its related cooperative societies. “Even a disproportionate assets case is pending against him in the High Court. Even before the High Court, the people will give their judgement on April 6. “When DMK comes to power, this case would be expedited and he would be sent to jail,” Mr. Stalin said. Mr. Stalin sought votes for party candidates K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran (Aruppukottai), Thangam Thennarasu (Tiruchuli), A.R.R. Seenivasan (Virudhunagar), S. Thangapandian (Rajapalayam), A.R. Raghuraman, Sattur – MDMK) (all DMK candidates) and G. Ashokan (Sivakasi) and P.S.W. Madhava Rao (Srivilliputtur), both Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-takes-strong-exception-to-prime-ministers-charges/article34202588.ece
31 March 2021||S. SundarSrivilliputtur,TAMIL NADU||She takes up gauntlet for her sick father||She came to Srivilliputtur to file nominations as a dummy candidate for her father P. S. W. Madhava Rao, the Congress candidate for Srivilliputtur Assembly constituency, But she turned into a substitute candidate for him in electioneering. A resident of Chennai, Dhivya Rao had never been into politics. This engineering graduate also does not have any experience in students’ union activities. But when her father was hospitalised after being infected with COVID-19, she readily came forward to fill his absence in election campaign. “I never had any experience in politics. But I had to do it for my father,” says this young mother of an eight-month-old infant. The short duration for electioneering this Assembly election has been so demanding that she is engaged from early morning till late night and even could not take care of her son who is left under the care of others. She has been going to the nooks and corners of the constituency in the campaign vehicle. Accompanied by a group of women, she walks on the streets to meet voters. “I am telling voters that I have come to seek votes for my father who is down with COVID-19. I also tell them that soon he will be back to meet them,” she said. Though she has to put up with the scorching sun, Ms. Dhivya said the warmth she received from voters is what keeps her going. Among the regular promises of development of the constituency like Azhagar dam scheme, she also recalls her father’s promise that, if elected, he would donate the monthly MLA salary all through his five-year tenure for the benefit of the needy. She is hopeful of a huge victory for her father, “for the voters in the polling booths will look at the party symbol to vote for him. That way the ‘hand’ (Congress symbol) will be very helpful,” Ms. Dhivya said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/she-takes-up-gauntlet-for-her-sick-father/article34202594.ece
31 March 2021||Salem/Erode,TAMIL NADU||EPS brought disrepute to CM’s chair: Udhayanidhi||DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin accused Edappadi.K.Palaniswami of putting to shame the Chief Minister's chair, which was earlier adorned by leaders such as C.N. Annadurai, M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa. Campaigning at Edappadi for DMK candidate T. Sampath Kumar, he said that while Annadurai was remembered for the respect he brought to Tamil, Karunanidhi for being a scholar in Tamil and Jayalalithaa for her courage, Mr. Palaniswami was associated with Koovathur where MLAs were held at a resort to get their support. The Chief Minister had given up the rights of the State and betrayed its people. He thrust NEET on Tamil Nadu, heeding the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party, the BJP. Fourteen students died by suicide in protest against NEET. The DMK had consistently opposed NEET. Stating that a resolution against NEET was passed twice in the Assembly, Mr. Udhayanidhi alleged that the Centre had returned the file, but the State government kept it from the public. When 13 persons were killed in the anti-Sterlite protests, the Chief Minister allegedly claimed that he had come to know of this only from the news on television. “On May 2, he is going to see through TV our leader (M.K.Stalin) becoming CM”, he said. Mr. Palaniswami would go to prison once DMK came to power, he said. The DMK youth wing leader alleged that an AIADMK functionary, who had been named an accused in the Pollachi sexual case, was now canvassing votes for Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman. Mr. Udhayanidhi said the AIADMK government was the only one that indulged in corruption even in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Udhayanidhi claimed that he was the first person to expose that 43 doctors had died due to COVID-19. But, Health Minister C. Vijayabhaskar threatened to sue him if the statement was not withdrawn. However, the Indian Medical Association later confirmed the doctors’ death. While campainging for Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi candidate K.K.C. Balu, who is contesting on the DMK’s Rising Sun symbol in Perundurai Assembly constituency, Mr. Udhayanidhi said that when AIADMK leader sought their votes, people ask them how their leader Jayalalithaa died. “Ask them how she died. They cannot answer and they will run away”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eps-brought-disrepute-to-cms-chair-udhayanidhi/article34202611.ece

31 March 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||Asks PM why he didn’t fulfil his poll promise||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his next visit to Tamil Nadu on April 2, should tell the voters why he did not fulfil his poll promise of creating two crore jobs a year and bring back black money from abroad to give Rs. 15 lakh to every Indian family, DMK president M.K. Stalin said on Tuesday. Canvassing votes for the DMK alliance candidates at Alangulam, Mr Stalin said the promises were made in 2014. Another promise of doubling the farmers’ income had been put in cold storage. “Did anyone here get the job or Rs. 15 lakh from Mr. Modi? We lost what we had when you (Modi) demonetised high-value currency notes. Instead of doubling the farmers’ income, you don’t even have the courage to meet the farmers protesting on the streets of Delhi for more than 125 days braving coldest winter and harsh summer. Answer all these questions when you visit Tamil Nadu again on April 2. Else the people will give you the answer on April 6,” he said. He countered the Prime Minister’s charge that the DMK had never treated women with dignity. Mr Modi who “called Jayalalithaa (former Chief Minister) corrupt and wanted to politically obliterate her,” had mentioned she was manhandled in the Assembly in 1989. “Then (AIADMK) MLA and current Tiruchi MP Su Thirunavukkarasar (now in Congress), who was in the Assembly on that day, had confessed later in the Assembly that it was a drama enacted in a bid to stall the presentation of State Budget to cripple the smooth functioning of official machinery,” he contended. “The confession of Mr. Thirunavukkarasar is in the minutes of the Assembly. I am ready to send you the copy of his speech. A person adorning the office of the Prime Minister should not lie. You should ask your party leader Subramanian Swamy about the kind of reception accorded to him by a group of AIADMK women when he once came to the Madras High Court,” he said. Mr Stalin said Mr Modi should also get an idea about the acid attack on former civil servant Chandralekha “for having unearthed a corruption under Jayalalithaa’s administration.” The DMK leader questioned Mr Modi’s commitment to fight corruption when he was holding up the hands of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his deputy O. Panneerselvam against whom the DMK had submitted a memorandum of corruption charges “to your (Centre’s) agent in Tamil Nadu, the Governor.” He claimed that instead of wiping out corruption and those who are inundated by corruption, the BJP is admitting the corrupt, the rowdies and the anti-socials into the party. Coming down heavily on Mr. Palaniswami, the DMK chief said the AIADMK government had not given the privileges meant for denotified communities by introducing the ‘double certificate’ system, which would be scrapped after conducting due census of denotified tribes and appointing a liaison officer for the purpose. “The rivalry between EPS and OPS is the reason behind following the ‘double certificate’ system for denotified communities,” Mr. Stalin alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/asks-pm-why-he-didnt-fulfil-his-poll-promise/article34203243.ece
31 March 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||‘PM Modi must explain unfulfilled poll promises’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his next visit to Tamil Nadu on April 2, should tell the voters why was he unable to fulfill his poll promises of creating two crore jobs a year and bring back black money from abroad to give Rs. 15 lakh to every Indian family, DMK president M.K.

31 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||We will not be intimidated by Stalin’s malicious propaganda: CM||Accusing DMK president M.K.Stalin of levelling unfounded charges against the AIADMK government and Ministers, its leader and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday asserted that he and his colleagues would not be intimidated by such propaganda. Campaigning in support of the AIADMK candidates at Marakkadai in Tiruchi, Mr. Palaniswami felt that Mr. Stalin had been levelling unfounded allegations against the Ministers as he could not stomach the growing popularity and goodwill gained by the present government. It was to defame the government and to confuse the voters that the DMK president had been levelling unsubstantiated allegations. “We will not be intimidated by the malicious propaganda. We have done nothing wrong and are prepared for anything,” Mr. Palaniswami said. The DMK had no locus standi to talk about corruption. Several senior leaders of the party were facing serious corruption cases. Most of the former DMK Ministers had been running educational institutions using the swindled public money, he claimed. Secret plan Mr. Palaniswami alleged that Mr. Stalin had evolved a secret plan to sideline seniors and former Ministers in his party to effect a succession plan to crown his son Udhayanidhi. Mr. Stalin had been frequently speaking about the formation of special courts to deal with the corruption cases against elected representatives. Since several senior DMK leaders were against his succession plan, Mr. Stalin had been advocating the setting up of special courts, Mr. Palaniswami claimed. According to him, 13 former DMK Ministers had been facing corruption cases for misusing the power and swindling public money. They would not only go to jail but also their political careers would be over if they were found guilty of the offence. All of them were seniors and were capable of questioning the DMK leadership. It was only to silence them that Mr. Stalin had been advocating setting up of special courts, he contended. Mr. Palaniswami reiterated his allegation that the DMK and its alliance parties had managed to win the Parliament elections by deceiving the voters with attractive promises and unleashing malicious propaganda. But 38 MPs belonging to the DMK and the Congress had failed to raise the people’s issues in Parliament, he claimed. They had done nothing to get funds for the State. But most of the MPs were super rich and they had been mainly trying to protect their wealth, Mr. Palaniswami claimed. “Mr. Stalin is again trying to hoodwink the people by launching a malicious campaign. The voters will not be deceived again. They will give a fitting lesson to the power-mongering DMK and its leader,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/we-wont-be-intimidated-by-stalins-malicious-propaganda-cm/article34202622.ece

31 March 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Train stoppage: Tiruverumbur voters are a disappointed lot||Residents in Tiruverumbur constituency that encompasses the bulk of extension areas of Tiruchi city are a disappointed lot as mainstream candidates have not reflected in their manifestos their long-pending demand for stoppage for express trains at Adarsh railway station in the town. The issue does not find a place in the manifestos of DMK candidate Ambil Mahesh Poyyamozhi and AIADMK candidate P. Kumar, though it has a bearing on strengthening the economic aspects of the town, according to representatives of public welfare organisations. They recently prevailed upon Makkal Needhi Maiyam candidate M. Muruganandam to highlight the cause. Residents of Kailash Nagar, Amman Nagar, Balaji Nagar, Prakash Nagar, BHEL Township, OFT, Thuvakudi town and several other large localities are necessitated to travel to Tiruchi railway junction to board express trains to distant destinations. Sanctioning of stoppage of express trains at Tiruverumbur station of ‘Adarsh’ status will help in reducing traffic congestion on Tiruchi-Thanjavur Highway to a significant extent, N. Anbalagan, president, Tamil Nadu Makkal Valarchi Kuzhu, said. “Trains to destinations such as Rameswaram and Tiruchendur pass through the station at a convenient time during night. The stoppage at the station will also mean a fillip to footfall of visitors from distant places to Erumbeeswarar Temple, Tirunedunkulam Nedungalanathar Temple and the Grand Anicut,” he said. Mr. Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, Mr. Kumar (during his stint as Tiruchi MP) and current MP Su. Thirunavukkarasar had on a few occasions taken up the cause of the travelling public with the railway authorities in recent years. They were reportedly told by the authorities of Tiruchi division that the matter will be pursued with the Railway Board. “However, there has been no positive outcome; the absence of stoppage for express trains at Tiruverumbur in the new time table has caused a huge disappointment,” Ravikumar, a trader in Kattur, said. Ever since 2012 when Tiruverumbur station was accorded Adarsh status in the Union Budget, the travelling public has been looking for a favourable announcement from the railways, Mr. Ravikumar added. The railway station, according to regular travellers, is well equipped to handle stoppage of the express trains. Only passenger trains, which have been discontinued due to the COVID pandemic, have stoppages at the station. Now that the double-line Tiruchi-Thanjavur stretch has been electrified, all that is required is a considerate approach on the part of the railway authorities to fulfil the long-pending demand of the travelling public, Mr. Anbalagan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/train-stoppage-tiruverumbur-voters-are-a-disappointed-lot/article34203237.ece

The classes for the first year students were conducted online all through. This time, the department faculty anticipate more number of students to apply. “We have started receiving queries,” Ms. Mekala said.

Provisional admission is permitted for such candidates provided their final marks are made available before July 30. Most of the students in the first batch are inclined towards pursuing their doctorate degrees. Nevertheless, internship programme in media organisations as a component of the final year content is under contemplation, Ms. Mekala said.

Mr. Maran said that while Mr. Palaniswami had betrayed Sasikala who had helped him to come to power, Mr. Panneerselvam initially alleged suspicion in the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, but failed to appear before the Arumugasamy Commission that was set up to probe the matter. “You would have seen on mobile messaging applications pictures of Edappadi Palaniswami falling at the feet of Sasikala. As soon as he came to power, she was the first one he betrayed, and then the people of Tamil Nadu by bowing to Narendra Modi,” said Mr. Maran. Mr. Maran also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pointing out that while fuel prices fell across the world, it did not happen in India owing to the high taxes. Campaigning for the DMK’s Coonoor candidate K. Ramachandran, Mr. Maran spoke of the issues faced by tea estate workers, especially when they turned old and were unable to work. He said DMK president M.K.

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Nagapattinam port upgradation remains a forgotten promise||The political scenario has hotted up in this constituency where AIADMK’s Thanga Kathiravan takes on J. Mohamed Shanavas of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, DMK’s ally. Be it these two main contenders or candidates of other mainstream parties, including Makkal Needhi Maiam, Naam Tamizhar Katchi and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, none has been able to convince voters on their plans for infusing vibrancy into the local economy. Since the economy in this coastal town is mostly dependent on the fishing sector, there is a sense of dejection among traders over absence of any progress in the project to develop the once-active Nagapattinam Port. The promise — made in 2012 — to upgrade the port into an all-weather, deep-water, direct berthing green-field facility at a cost of Rs. 380 crore remains just on paper. “The port, if upgraded, will give major thrust to shipping trade in the region,” T. Sundaravadivelan, president, Nagore-Nagapattinam Chamber of Commerce, said.  At the time of making the announcement under Rule 110, the State government said the Nagapattinam port once upgraded would be able to handle 10 lakh tonnes of cargo and generate revenue of Rs. 20 crore . Further, in 25 years, it would generate around 60 lakh tonnes earning Rs. 120 crore. Grievances galore The fisher community, on its part, is agitated over a host of other issues including government action against those using banned nets and restrictions imposed on bottom trawling in the Palk Bay. The fishing department has been enforcing the restrictions on operators of mechanised boats to sustain marine resources. But the operators are also steeped in financial troubles due to the restrictions as the vessels are owned by a consortium of 40 to 50 fishers, according to official sources. “The Central government’s plan to develop coastal economic zones under the Sagar Mala project will enhance the fishing restrictions and make matters worse,” according to Rajendra Nattar, president of Indhiya Desiya Meenavar Sangam.There is no major industry in the constituency. Indian Oil Corporation’s new refinery project through its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited is the only silver lining. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation for the refinery project earlier this year. Voters’ aspirations The aspirations of voters in this constituency include upgrade of the municipality into a corporation, construction of an integrated bus stand, and improvement in rail services. Also, the tourism infrastructure is insufficient to cater to the needs of visitors from all over the country to the world-famous Velankanni Basilica and Nagore Dargah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nagapattinam-port-upgradation-remains-a-forgotten-promise/article34202563.ece

31 March 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||CM invites Ramesh Jarkiholi to campaign for byelections||Breaking his silence on the CD scandal, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Tuesday not only claimed that allegations of sexual harassment against BJP leader and former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi were “baseless” but also said that he would invite the latter to campaign for the party ahead of the byelections. This statement comes even as the victim of the sex CD scandal recorded her statement against Mr. Jarkiholi before the magistrate in Bengaluru the same day. Speaking at Belagavi to reporters, the Chief Minister said: “This is nothing but a political conspiracy. The truth will come out only after inquiry. The whole issue is aimed at bringing disrepute to the party and the leaders allegedly involved.” He said he was confident of Mr. Jarkiholi coming out unscathed from the controversy. “I invite him to campaign for our candidate in the bypolls. I am sure he will come,” he said. On Monday evening, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah had questioned the Chief Minister’s continued silence on the issue. The Chief Minister said the issue would not affect the BJP’s electoral prospects. “Mr. Siddaramaiah or other party leaders may raise the issue, but BJP leaders will not talk about it. It is a criminal matter under investigation and not relevant to the bypolls,” said Mr. Yediyurappa. No comment In fact, leaders campaigning in North Karnataka refused to speak on the issue. While RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa said he would not like to comment when his attention was drawn to it at Hubballi, Umesh Katti at Belagavi had a similar response. Mr. Yediyurappa said he was satisfied about the pace of the Special Investigation Team’s inquiry. “It is going on smoothly and in an efficient manner. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai has been functioning in a responsible manner. He is not only keeping tabs on the investigation at every stage, but also briefing the media about it regularly. There is no need to suspect that the investigation is not going properly,” he said.

At her first public speech after being nominated by the BJP, she said that her husband was a martyr like the many COVID-19 warriors who had succumbed to the virus. Even during the peak of the virus, he was going around helping the poor. He became a martyr, she said. He worked relentlessly to develop the constituency for 20 years. In a short time of around 14 months that he was Union Minister, he strove to get new projects for Belagavi and the State. Some of them were unprecedented, she said. She sat next to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and took notes while others spoke at the meeting. Removing her mask only to speak, she made a brief speech. She made an emotional appeal to party workers and friends and followers of Angadi to help her realise his dreams for the constituency. This would further strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Yediyurappa, she said. Mr. Yediyurappa asked party leaders to see that Mangala Angadi won by at least two lakh votes. He asked workers to highlight the achievements of Mr. Modi and the State government. There is no need to talk about the Opposition parties at all, he said. Earlier, Ms. Angadi filed four sets of nomination papers. She submitted different sets of nomination papers with Mr. Yediyurappa and BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel, Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol and Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa and Union Minister Prahlad Joshi and Deputy Speaker Anand Mamani and MLAs Abhay Patil and Anil Benake. Earlier, at the Sambra airport, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies Umesh Katti told journalists that the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who has been accused of sexual harassment by a woman, and his younger brothers, Balachandra Jarkiholi and Lakhan Jarkiholi, would campaign for the BJP candidate in Belagavi. Mr. Joshi expressed the satisfaction over the investigation of the allegations levelled against Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi being conducted by the SIT. It is on the right track. It will reveal who are the real culprits, he said. Responding to demands by Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi’s supporters that the SIT should arrest Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar, as the woman is said to have referred to his name in an audio clip, Mr. Joshi said that that was not reason enough for his arrest. He said that the candidature of Satish Jarkiholi from the Congress would not affect the BJP’s chances. “The Congress is disappearing from the face of the country. It will disappear from Belagavi too,” he said. The BJP has won 41 of the 58 elections held in the last six years. It means that the people have faith in Modi Sarkar, he added. “[Leader of Opposition] Siddaramaiah keeps talking about the BJP as he has no other work. He should not make allegations that only tend to belittle him,” he said. Reacting to reports that some forces were trying to release CDs of various BJP leaders, including the Chief Minister, Mr. Joshi said that that would not affect the stature of Mr. Yediyurappa who is a highly respected leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangala-angadi-recalls-her-husbands-work/article34202632.ece

31 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bear attacks six on outskirts of the city||Panic reigned on the outskirts of the city as a bear, which had strayed into Shettihalli, Thattanahalli, Kachanayakanahalli in Anekal, attacked six people, out of which three suffered severe injuries. The incident occurred during the early hours of Tuesday. The injured have been identified as Sreenivas Reddy, Ramakka, Manja, Venkatswamy, Bisal Kumar and the security guard of a warehouse. Sources said that around 3 a.m., the wild animal attacked the security guard of a private firm in Kachanayakanahalli, then moved towards KPTCL quarters in Chandapura. Locals took videos of the animal and alerted forest officials who rushed to the spot. Around 6.30 a.m., the animal attacked three people in Shettihalli, located around seven kilometres away. By the time forest officials reached the spot, the animal had moved towards Thattanahalli and injured two more persons. A forest official said, “Our staff spotted the animal near Shettahalli. It tried to attack our staff who managed to escape. After that, it could not be traced.” The official said a bear attacking people in these parts is very unusual, and it is difficult to say from which forest it has come. Deputy Conservator of Forest (Bengaluru Urban) Ravishankar S.S. said, “After receiving information, our staff rushed to the spot and began operations as per the protocol. Veterinary doctors and other officials were involved in the operation. We suspect that the animal might have come from Bannerghatta. Announcements are being made to alert residents to stay safe.” He said that three people who were severely injured are getting treated in hospitals. Incidentally, on Monday, a bear which was rescued from Tumakuru was taken to Bannerghatta Biological Park. But the animal escaped and entered the forest of Bannerghatta National Park. Some suspect that the same bear might have entered the villages in Anekal. B.N.N. Murthy, DCF of Bannerghatta National Park, said, “The bear rescued from Tumakuru did not show any abnormal behaviour and was not aggressive. It is very difficult to establish that the same bear strayed into villages located 15 to 20 km away from Bannerghatta National Park. We suspect that the bear, which entered villages and attacked people on Tuesday morning, might have come from other forests bordering Tamil Nadu. But we are not in a position to say anything.” He further added that bear is a nocturnal wild animal, which shows such aggressive behaviour when stressed. “It could be a female bear and might have lost its cubs, and as a result, it might be showing such behaviour. There is a possibility of the animal getting infected with rabies,” he added. He said around 100 forest officials are working on rescue operations, and drones are also being used. “The animal was last spotted 7 a.m. on Tuesday. Forest staff did not trace it till 9 p.m. There could be possibility of it having entered a forest area,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bear-attacks-six-on-outskirts-of-the-city/article34202938.ece
31 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||With high rate of spread, active cases climb to over 25,000||The recent spurt in COVID-19 infections in the State has been more rapid than the wave last year. As a result, it took a lesser number of days for active cases to rise in the second wave compared to the first. Karnataka’s active cases on Tuesday touched 25,541. During the first wave, it took 128 days for active cases to cross 25,000. While the first case was reported in the State on March 8, 2020, active cases touched 25,839 on July 14, 2020. However, active cases declined to as low as 5,824 on March 1 and shot up to cross 25,000 within in a month. Active cases in the State peaked at 1,20,270 on October 10 and started declining since then reducing to 50,592 by November 1. This number further reduced to 25,146 on November 17 and since then there has been a consistent decline till March 1. Of the 25,541 active cases as of Tuesday in the State, 17,582 are in Bengaluru alone. With 1,116, Kalaburagi has the next highest active cases after Bengaluru followed by Bidar with 818 active cases. State Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said that with the daily addition of nearly 300 new cases, active cases are piling up in the State. “Nearly 85% of these cases are under home isolation. We are able to manage as of now with the existing beds and are preparing to further expand facilities in the coming days,” he said. He said home isolation patients are being properly triaged and monitored on a regular basis. The number of active cases will change every ten days as more patients recover, he said. Giridhar R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said active cases are bound to surge as the test positivity rate (TPR) is increasing rapidly. “As of now the TPR is hovering between 2% and 3%. If this goes beyond 5%, which is bound to happen in a few days, it means that the outbreak is beyond amenable to containment,” he said. “Besides, the growth rate of cases from week to week is also rapid now compared to the first wave. The Reproductive Number has also gone beyond 1.6% and all these are worrying trends,” he added. Asserting that the bed capacity in hospitals should be increased at the earliest, he added that the centralised bed allotment system incorporating private hospital beds should be restarted as the number of ICU cases are also on the rise.  As of now, the TPR is hovering between 2% and 3%. If this goes beyond 5%, which is bound to happen in a few days, it means that the outbreak is beyond amenable to containment.  Giridhar R.

31 March 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Delay in imposing restrictions upsets experts||As the city is hit by a second wave of COVID-19 infections, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who chaired two review meetings over the past two weeks, has refused to impose any new restriction on public gatherings. This has been contrary to advice from the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and officials combating the pandemic on the ground. “The economic cost of the lockdown seems to be weighing heavily on the mind of the Chief Minister, who also holds charge of the State’s economy. He also doesn’t want to create panic in society and hence keen on not disturbing normal life to the extent possible,” said a senior Minister who was part of the two review meetings. However, experts and officials are concerned that any further delay in imposing stringent restrictions on gatherings may prove costly for the city in terms of increasing cases creating a health crisis, which may force a lockdown like is being contemplated in Maharashtra. “What we did right in 2020 was that the administration let science completely guide the management of the pandemic, but that doesn’t seem to be the case today given how TAC recommendations are being given a go by,” said a senior bureaucrat. Civic and health officials are keen on stringent restrictions on occupancy of all public spaces to ensure social distancing norms, especially since the spread of the particular strain of the virus is several times more than last year. This essentially means restricting occupancy in film theatres to 50%, reducing occupancy in restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, malls and public transport. “Two pubs have already emerged as COVID-19 clusters, indicating how closed spaces are tinderboxes for the virus to spread. All restaurants and pubs have maximised their real estate to accommodate more patrons, which is an issue today. Their occupancy needs to be regulated,” said a senior civic official. “With a string of big ticket releases, the latest to hit screens will be Puneeth Rajkumar starrer Yuvarathna on Thursday, theatres have turned into a huge concern as they are closed spaces with air-conditioning,” the official added. Even in public transport – BMTC and Namma Metro – occupancy needs to be strictly restricted, civic officials have recommended. These industries and public transport have reportedly been lobbying hard for “no restrictions on occupancy” citing economic woes. “The film industry has been lobbying hard against the 50% occupancy rule. In a new trend to woo audiences back to theatres, Puneeth Rajkumar is touring the State ahead of the film’s release. These events have themselves raised red flags, but the government is not able to restrict them as bypolls and political rallies are on,” said a bureaucrat. But the government has imposed a ban on all protests for the next two weeks. “Sections of the food and beverages industry are trying to get out of the mandatory testing of their staff every fortnight, which led to discovery of two clusters,” a civic official complained. Add to this, TAC has also recommended suspension of all classes except 10 and 12, especially since many young children have reported positive for the infection during the second wave. However, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, who reportedly argued against closure, also sought a day’s time to come out with the department’s stand on the issue, and hence the decision was deferred. The only restrictions the Chief Minister agreed to impose are closing down party halls, gyms and swimming pools and other such facilities in apartments, and banning protests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/delay-in-imposing-restrictions-upsets-experts/article34202942.ece

31 March 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Congress firm on its stand in CD row’||Continuing his tirade against the BJP government in Karnataka over the CD scandal allegedly involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Tuesday said that the Congress is firm on its stand in the CD row. “We [Congress leaders] have demanded the supervision of the Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court over the investigation by the SIT and, now even the woman in the CD case has written a letter to the Chief Justice requesting the same,” he reiterated. He was speaking to presspersons in Kalaburagi before proceeding to Basavakalyan to participate in the nomination filing process of Congress candidate Mallamma Narayan Rao, for the bypolls on April 17. Refuting the allegation made by the parents of the woman against the KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that Mr. Shivakumar has already clarified that he had no links in the scandal and the parents might have commented against him due to pressure. Reacting to the attack on Mr. Shivakumar’s car in Belagavi, he said it showed the culture of BJP and of no proper law and order in the State. He accused the BJP of not taking any action even when there were blatant violations of the law. Exuding his confidence in winning Basavakalyan bypolls, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the late Narayan Rao was on good terms with all people in the constituency and the failure of the BJP in the State would definitely help the Congress retain the seat in the byelections. Replying to a question on the selection of Muslim candidates by the JD(S) in Basavakalyan, he alleged that it was due to the tacit understanding between the BJP and the JD(S). He also exuded confidence in winning all three seats – including Basavakalyan and Maski Assembly constituency and Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency. Expressing concern over the relentless surge in COVID-19 cases in Karnataka, Mr. Siddaramaiah stressed upon the need to follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) laid down by the government to contain the second wave. The government should ban public gatherings and processions at least for a couple of weeks, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-firm-on-its-stand-in-cd-row/article34202641.ece

31 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Fishing boats beach at Bengre as gusty winds wreak havoc||Gusty winds played havoc with fishing boats tethered at the Old Port in the city late on Monday. Consequently, some boats went adrift and beached on the Bengre shore. President, Mangaluru Trawl Boat Owners Association and Chairman of Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation (KFDC) Nitin Kumar told The Hindu that about 10-15 fishing boats beached at Bengre. The fishermen began releasing the boats on Tuesday. During a visit to the Old Port and Bengre on Tuesday, a fisherman Vasudeva said that he is now worried about the cost that may be incurred to release his beached boat Veera Vinayaka near the ferry point at Thota Bengre. He said that he might require more than Rs. 1 lakh to bring the boat back to normal condition. “I have no other way but release the beached boat as I earn my livelihood out of it,” he said. He further said: “Small boats help us earn about Rs. 3,000 per day. We are waiting for low tide when the boat is likely to emerge out of the sand.” Mr. Vasudeva and his younger brother have availed of the services of boat repairers to make it sail out. Yadava Guruswamy, who takes up boat alignment works, said that it was around 10 p.m. on Monday when gusty winds created havoc. Mr. Guruswamy and his family members could not stay inside their thatched roof house and they came running out to the ferry point. “The force of the storm made some boats tethered at the South Wharf of the Old Port, float towards the estuary after the rope holding them got severed,” he said and added that this was the first time that he saw such a severe impact of the storm. While some fishermen managed to salvage their boats by evening, others are yet to work out ways to release their beached boats. The heavy rain accompanied by gusty winds, lightning and thunder which lashed Mangaluru and nearby areas late on Monday caused minor damage to private and public property. The impact of the heavy winds was such that some concrete roads in the city were covered with a mixture of leaves and mud resulting in slushy driving conditions posing danger to two-wheeler drivers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/boats-beach-at-bengre-as-gusty-winds-wreak-havoc/article34202936.ece
31 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||CAMPCO to seek govt. help to tackle Yellow Leaf Disease||A meeting of scientists and arecanut growers here on Tuesday framed a package, comprising short- and long-term measures to address Yellow Leaf Disease (YLD) and related issues in arecanut plantations. It decided to take the package to the Task Force on Arecanut constituted by the State government to recommend to the government to help farmers whose plantations have been hit by the disease. The meeting was held under the auspices of Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd. (CAMPCO). Addressing presspersons after the meeting, CAMPCO president A. Kishor Kumar Kodgi said that the government will be requested to financially help such growers either to take up short-term measures suggested by scientists to save the plantations hit by the disease or to take up alternative crops. The former Director of Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI), Kasaragod, P. Chowdappa, who is also a member of the Task Force on Arecanut, said that mulching using bio-degradable plastic to reduce soil moisture content, application of bio-fertilizers and bio-nutrients and using bio-agents in Yellow Leaf Disease-affected plantations will help to save palms which may continue to give yield. It is a short-term measure to save the plantations. As a long-term measure, alternative fruit crops such as rambutan, avacado, dragon fruit, mangosteen and oil palm can be cultivated . A progressive farmer and farm scientist D.C. Chowta at Meeyapadavu in Kasaragod district, Kerala, has been cultivating fruit crops successively now. Mr. Chowdappa, who is also the chairman of the technical committee of the Task Force on Arecanut, said that it is estimated that about 14,000 hectares of arecanut could have been hit by the disease. Meanwhile, Director of Directorate of Arecanut and Spices Development (DASD), Kozhikode, Kerala, Homey Cherian said that more than 10,000 hectares have been hit by the disease. The former CPCRI director said that the disease was first reported in the State in 1965. Now, it is spread in parts of Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru, Shivamogga and Uttara Kannada districts. The DASD can help farmers in technology transfer and demonstration of technology while dealing with the disease. Member of scientific panel of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) I. Karunasagar, CAMPCO Managing Director H.M. Krishna Kumar, president of All India Areca Growers Association, Puttur, Kinila Ashok, Executive Editor of a farm monthly, Adike Pathrike, Shree Padre, and directors of CAMPCO, among others, took part in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/campco-to-seek-govt-help-to-tackle-yellow-leaf-disease/article34203137.ece
31 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Fast-tracking railway works in the State||At a time when the office of the General Manager of a Railway Zone was considered out of bounds for the common man, Ajay Kumar Singh, who took charge as the GM of South Western Railway in October 2018, opened the doors of his office to co-workers and the general public alike, say rail fans about the General Manager on the eve of his retirement on Wednesday. It was not just interacting with them; Mr. Singh believed in providing solutions to the woes of railwaymen and travelling public, says Karnataka Railway Vedike’s K.N. Krishna Prasad who has actively been espousing railway issues of the State. SWR, formed in 2003, saw robust growth in the last two years, including the development of stations, namely, Hubballi, Davangere and Byappanahalli. Mr. Singh, along with Chief Administrative Officer of SWR K.C. Swamy, who is also retiring on Wednesday, ensured the construction of the Byappanahalli terminal at Bengaluru a la airport terminal, Mr. Prasad said. A railway official who didn’t wish to be named said that Mr. Singh moved closely more with Group D and C staff than with senior officials. While he welcomed them to his chamber, he interacted with them in detail during surprise inspections, the official said and added that many saw that their long-pending service grievances were settled by Mr. Singh. Kundapura Gautam Shetty, another rail fan, said that operational feasibility had never been an issue for Mr. Singh when it came to delivery of service to the needy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fast-tracking-railway-works-in-the-state/article34203135.ece

31 March 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘MIT students have not observed COVID-19-appropriate behaviour’||The general tendency among students not to observe COVID-19-appropriate behaviour is among the chief reasons for the surge in cases at Manipal Institute of Technology, Minister for Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education K. Sudhakar said in Manipal on Tuesday. “It is a great relief that most of the students, like the rest in the State, are asymptomatic,” he told presspersons after visiting the campus and reviewing the situation in Udupi district. The students should understand that those who tested positive are potential carriers of COVID-19 and should not come in contact with senior citizens and other vulnerable people. They should remain in isolation for 14 days, he stressed. As many as 8,000 students and nearly 3,000 staff and support staff were on campus. Such a large number was also a cause for the surge in positive cases in MIT since March 15. As many as 900 students have tested positive so far on campus. “It is a relief to find that only a few have mild symptoms,” he said. The State government is working to lessen the mortality rate in the State. “Lesser the number of deaths, the more effective we will be in our combat against COVID-19,” he said. While appreciating steps taken by Udupi district administration, the MIT and Manipal Academy of Higher Education in preventing the spread of COVID-19, the Minister said the district administration will be asked to be more tough in the enforcement of COVID-19 protocol in public places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mit-students-have-not-observed-covid-19-appropriate-behaviour/article34203144.ece

31 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||K.R. Hospital to treat severe cases||COVID-19 patients with mild and moderate symptoms will remain in the designated COVID-19 facility in the District Hospital on KRS Road. All critical cases will be moved to the K.R. Hospital as they may require other medical interventions and investigations which are currently unavailable in the district hospital. The decision follows the authorities’ move to overcome deaths of patients with serious complications, including acute kidney injury (ATI). Mysuru’s COVID-19 case fatality rate last year had worried the health authorities who were on their toes to lower the rate. The 250-bed district hospital was chosen as designated COVID-19 hospital last year since there was no other facility available which could be used for isolating and treating COVID-19 patients. Since the hospital wasnot fully equipped to handle serious cases, a decision was taken to make use of K.R. Hospital’s beds for attending to vulnerable cases, including SARI, ILI and pneumonia. Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) Director and Dean C.P. Nanjaraj told The Hindu : “We aren’t ready to take any chances. It’s too risky to shift critical patients for CT scan, blood investigations, X-ray, dialysis and so on. Since KRH has all facilities under one roof, we decided to keep serious cases in our hospital and limit milder cases to the district hospital in the interest of patients.” Dr. Nanjaraj said the hospitals and doctors have learnt many approaches on patient management after having treated the patients since the last one year. “We are now very well prepared to counter the pandemic. It has taught us many things.” Thanks to last year’s efforts post-pandemic, KRH is now equipped with a 13 kl liquid oxygen tank providing uninterrupted oxygen supply to beds for patients with respiratory complications. “We have around 400 beds with centralised oxygen supply for treating patients with breathing problems. We also have 50 ventilator beds besides 100 beds with oxygen supply at the trauma care centre on KRS Road for COVID-19 treatment,” the director said. As of now, KRH has nine serious cases in its ICU. Dr. Nanjaraj said one portion of the trauma care centre which has been taken over for COVID-19 treatment, is being used for vaccination and the remaining half can be used to accommodate mild and moderate patients, which will be done from this year onwards. Meanwhile, the Principal Secretary, Health, had a video conference with the MMCRI authorities on the preparations to be made and precautions to be taken to counter the second wave. With the government telling the districts to be on alert for the next 50 days with the beginning of the second peak, the district administration and the district health authorities have geared up for yet another major combat against the pandemic. “The situation may not be as tough like it was last year. The severity of the infection could be less compared to last year but the cases could be more. The severity in vaccinated persons could be milder. Keeping all these opinions, we can say that the COVID-19 management may not be as challenging like it was last year,” Dr. Nanjaraj said, adding that steps have also been taken for procuringnecessary drugs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kr-hospital-to-treat-severe-cases/article34202775.ece
31 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Property tax: new commercial category brings no cheer||Even though the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has decided to scrap “super commercial” category and bring marriage choultries, cinemas and hotels under a new commercial category with a revised property tax structure, their owners are far from satisfied. The MCC’s decision to fix a rate of tax higher than the commercial properties for these buildings by bracketing them as “super commercial” in 2007 had long been resented by owners, who had made a series of representations to the authorities. During the last meeting of the MCC council, a decision was taken to scrap the “super commercial” category, but bring the marriage choultries, theatres and hotels under a new’ commercial B’ category distinct from the regular ‘commercial A’ category. “Super commercial category carried a high tax burden. So, we have renamed them as commercial B”, said MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag. While the “factor of multiplication” for other commercial properties was 1.3 per cent, it used to be 2.291 per cent for “super commercial”. The MCC’s Standing Committee will inspect the properties and categorise marriage choultries, cinemas and hotels “beyond a certain geographic dimension” as commercial B properties, she said. However, owners of such properties pointed out that the “factor of multiplication” fixed by the MCC for collecting property tax was 1.7 per cent, which is still higher than the rest of the commercial properties. President of Mysuru Marriage Choultry Owners’ Association K R Sathyanarayan described the changes as an “eye-wash”. The marginal relief extended by the MCC will be inadequate as the basis for calculation of the tax will be the guidance value of 2018-19 against the earlier 2007-08 guidance value. As guidance value trebled between 2007-08 and 2008-19, the relief makes no difference, he argued. A meeting of owners of marriage choultries, cinemas and hotels was held in Mysuru on Monday to chalk out their next course of action. “We are likely to move the court”, Mr. Sathyanarayana said. Mysuru Hotel Owners Association Narayana Gowda said the changes had given only partial relief to the hoteliers. Rajaram from Mysuru Theatre Owners’ Association said the changes effected by the MCC will not help. He also argued that the property tax in Mysuru is calculated on the basis of the property’s capital value, which was at variance with the practice of calculating the same on the basis of units or rental value of the property like in Bengaluru. In view of the ‘faulty’ calculation, a cinema spread across two-and-a-half acres in Majestic area of Bengaluru pays only Rs. 3.5 lakh as annual tax while a cinema on Chamaraja Double Road here spread across 18,000 sq. ft will have to cough up an annual tax of Rs. 4.4 lakh. “The property tax in Mysuru is 300 per cent higher than Bengaluru”, he lamented.  The marginal relief extended by the MCC will be inadequate as the basis for calculation of the tax will be the guidance value of 2018-19 against the earlier 2007-08 guidance value||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/property-tax-new-commercial-category-brings-no-cheer/article34202777.ece
31 March 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC to get tough on plastic ban||Even as Mysuru City Corporation is vying for a top ‘Swachh’ rank for Mysuru this year, urging the citizens to give their feedback with the Swachh Survekshan-2021 ending on March 31, it organised a workshop here on Tuesday which debated sustainable solutions for solid waste management. At a time when Mysuru is facing the challenge of handling rise in collection of solid wastes, the MCC is seriously looking at ending the plastic menace with plans of strict enforcement of plastic ban from April 5. In this connection, a two-day Solid Waste Management Expo-2021 got off to a start here on Tuesday. Mayor Rukmini Made Gowda inaugurated it in the presence of Swachh Bharat Mission State Urban Nodal Officer and IAS officer B.B. Cauvery, MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag, MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj and others. The workshop gains importance since the MCC is making a decisive bid to end the menace with a tough stance on the ban which is not being enforced effectively with plastic bags below the mandated microns used rampantly across the city. Ms. Nag spoke about the strict enforcement of plastic ban from April 5. A series of meetings had taken place in this aspect as one-month time was given ahead of the drive. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri too had spoken about the need for the strict enforcement in one of her meetings. The MCC has been urging the people and traders to use cloth and paper bags and minimise dependence on plastic. Ms. Cauvery spoke about the steps taken for streamlining solid waste management.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-to-get-tough-on-plastic-ban/article34202772.ece

31 March 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Prasanna elected president of MYMUL||Prasanna was on Tuesday elected as the new president of Mysuru District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Societies’ Union Ltd (MYMUL). Sources in MYMUL said Mr. Prasanna, who is the son of K. Mahadev, JD(S) MLA representing Periyapatna Assembly constituency, is scheduled to take charge of his post on Wednesday.He was one of the 15 directors of MYMUL elected in the recent polls. On Tuesday, he was unanimously elected as the president. The polls held earlier this month were seen as a prestige battle between two former Ministers from Mysuru belonging to the JD(S) – G.T. Deve Gowda representing Chamundeshwari Assembly segment and S.R. Mahesh representing K.R. Nagar Assembly constituency. Eventually, the syndicate led by Mr. Gowda, who has been maintaining a distance from the JD(S), bagged as many as 12 of the 15 seats, delivering a blow to Mr .Mahesh. Incidentally, the polls had even seen former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy enter the campaign on behalf of the syndicate led by Mr. Mahesh. Mr. Kumaraswamy had not only opposed the syndicate led by Mr. Gowda, but also expressed dissatisfaction with party MLA K. Mahadev’s son contesting as a representative of Mr. Gowda’s syndicate. The term of the Board of Directors is for 5 years. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru after Mr. Prasanna’s election, Mr. Gowda said he had called upon the newly elected directors and president of MYMUL to run it as a model dairy in the country. He recalled the charges of corruption in MYMUL levelled by Mr. Kumaraswamy and asked the directors to allow no room for any corrupt practices in the body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prasanna-elected-president-of-mymul/article34202780.ece

Gynaecologists of the MMCRI had successfully delivered babies of COVID-19 patients with the help of anaesthesiologists, taking all precautions. They safely performed C-sections in many cases. Surprisingly, none of the babies contracted the infection from their sick mothers and the women returned home with healthy babies after battling the pandemic. With this hospital now under restoration, the maternity and child health (MCH) cases would now be moved to the district hospital with a separate wing being created. Pregnant women catching the infection would be shifted to the designated hospital and deliveries would be performed there with the labour room being established.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/maternity-cases-to-be-moved-to-district-hospital/article34202773.ece

The smoke from the plant has only added to the pollution and made the life of residents difficult. “The entire area is filled with smoke. How can the elderly and those with respiratory issues live? Children have been playing in the open and are getting affected,” said D. Chandran, a resident of the area. This is not the first time a fire has broken out inside the plant. A major fire had gutted parts of the plant in 2016. While residents claim that managers of the plant have set garbage on fire deliberately, BBMP officials claim it was an accidental fire. “There is a two-acre pit in the middle of the plant that is filled with legacy waste from over six years ago. The rising mercury seems to have caused an accidental fire in the pit. The best way to completely put it out is by soil capping, to which KSPCB has taken objection. We are co-ordinating with them,” said Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, BBMP. Mr. Chandran countered Mr. Khan’s claims and alleged that waster was being dumped in the pit even days before the fire. “We had approached the KSPCB. Officials had promised to take criminal action against the plant’s managers. We will approach them again,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fire-at-chikkanagamangala-waste-processing-plant/article34202939.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Rallies galore see COVID-19 protocol thrown to wind||The last day for filing of nomination saw hectic activity in the bypoll-bound constituencies of North Karnataka on Tuesday, with several State-level leaders from the ruling BJP and the Opposition being present. There were several rallies and public meetings, throwing COVID-19 protocol to wind. Even leaders on the dais were often seen without wearing masks or maintaining social distance. At Basavakalyan Assembly constituency in Bidar district, BJP candidate Sharanu Salagar, a Kalaburagi-based Lingayat leader, whose candidature had faced stiff resistance from local party leaders who were denied party tickets, managed to mobilise an estimated 10,000 people to show his local support. He addressed a rally attended by Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, among others. Congress candidate Mallamma Narayan Rao, wife of MLA the late B. Narayan Rao whose death necessitated the byelection, also filed her nomination papers at Basavakalyan. The Congress held a huge public meeting and a rally mobilising thousands. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha M. Mallikarjun Kharge, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar addressed the gathering. At Belagavi, Mangala Angadi, BJP candidate for Lok Sabha bypoll, filed her nomination and addressed a gathering in the presence of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. She likened her late husband, former Union Minister Suresh Angadi, to a “COVID-19 warrior”, at a party meeting. While Ms. Angadi kept her mask on, removing it only to speak, the Chief Minister was seen without it for most part. Ironically, Mr. Yediyurappa, speaking to mediapersons at Belagavi airport, advised people to follow COVID-19 safety protocol. “There will be no State-wide lockdown or closure of schools. People have to follow COVID-19 safety protocol like wearing masks and maintaining social distance. Government officers will strictly enforce the ban on public rallies and processions even in poll-bound areas,” he said. Khuba files nomination Last-minute efforts by BJP leaders to douse dissent and prevent Mallikarjun Khuba, BJP leader who rebelled against the party leadership after he was denied ticket, from filing his nomination papers as an Independent candidate failed. The party leaders are hopeful of convincing him to withdraw. P.G.R. Sindhia joins Cong. Senior politician P.G.R. Sindhia formally joined Congress at a public meeting in Basavakalyan. Mr. Kharge, Mr. Shivakumar and Mr. Siddaramaiah welcomed Mr. Sindhia by handing over the party flag.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rallies-galore-see-covid-19-protocol-thrown-to-wind/article34202787.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Women activists demand High Court-monitored inquiry||Women activists in the State, on Tuesday, demanded a High Court-monitored inquiry into the sex CD scandal. The activists, under the banner of ‘Naveddu Nilladire’ (If we do not rise), an umbrella forum of various women’s organisations, said an unbiased inquiry needs to be done. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, K.S. Vimala, vice-president, All India Democratic Women’s Association, said they could not trust the Special Investigation Team (SIT) and felt that justice would not be done to the woman who filed the complaint against former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. Ms. Vimala said both Mr. Jarkiholi and the woman should be treated as equal before law. “Although we have learnt that the woman finally recorded her statement before the judicial magistrate, she was initially reluctant to do so and she was probably facing threats. So, having a High Court-monitored inquiry will ensure that a proper investigation is done,” she said. While the woman alleged that she was a victim of sexual abuse and filed a complaint against Mr. Jarkiholi, the former Minister said the scandal was an attempt to malign and blackmail him. The activists also demanded that the woman be given protection and the investigation done as per the amended criminal law. On Sudhakar’s remark The activists also slammed Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar who had thrown a “challenge” to all the MLAs of the State to subject themselves to an inquiry to know who among them had extramarital relationships. “None of the elected representatives should use the session to talk about things like this. They should focus on other pressing topics that are of concern to the people of the State. We have demanded Dr. Sudhakar give his attention to improve the facilities for COVID-19 patients as it is his primary duty, rather than safeguard the interest of an accused,” she said. Open letter The women activists wrote an open letter to Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai with these demands. The group also demanded that the Press Council of India take note of the sexist news stories that the media airs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/women-activists-demand-high-court-monitored-inquiry/article34202788.ece

After touching down on a helipad at Cheppad, near Kayamkulam, around 11:45 a.m., Ms. Vadra took out the roadshow sitting atop an open-topped vehicle along with Ms. Babu. Thousands of flag-waving Congress workers and members of the party’s allies poured on to the national highway to greet Ms. Vadra. Braving the scorching sun, she waved at the supporters who lined up on both sides of the road and shook hands with some. The AICC general secretary later visited the home of Ms. Babu at Kamalalayam Junction near Govindamuttom. She was welcomed to the house by a swelling crowd. Youngest candidate At 26, Ms. Babu is one of the youngest Congress candidates in the poll fray in this year’s Assembly elections in the State. Hailing from a humble background, her candidature had earlier made headlines. Before the Congress fielded Ms. Babu from the Kayamkulam Assembly constituency, she was elected to the Alappuzha district panchayat from the Krishnapuram ward at the age of 21 in the 2015 local body elections. A Congress leader said that Ms. Vadra’s visit would boost the morale of the United Democratic Front workers in the constituency, where Ms. Babu is engaged in a pitched battle with the sitting MLA U. Prathibha of the Communist Party of India(Marxist). The National Democratic Alliance has fielded Pradeep Lal of the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena in the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/priyanka-turns-crowd-puller-at-kayamkulam/article34202745.ece

Mr. George reportedly said Mr. Gandhi would visit only women’s colleges and girls should be ‘cautious’ while dealing with the former Congress president. Speaking to mediapersons here on Tuesday, Mr. Chandy said that making such a statement was inappropriate for a person who led a decent political career. “Mr. George has the right to express his political differences with Mr. Gandhi, but it should be expressed within the limits of decency,” Mr. Chandy said.

Even if the party requests him, he is not willing to contest any more in the elections, he said, addressing a press conference to release the electoral manifesto of the Left Democratic Front for the Kannur constituency at the Press Club here on Tuesday. “I am getting older and down with disease. Unlike before, I am unable to work in elections and public service activities due to my declining health,” he said. Mr. Jayarajan said the party had decided that those who had completed two terms should not contest. His term was over and now that he was aged and tired, he would no longer contest any election, he said. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader said that he would convince the party of his stance. When pointed out that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was older than him, he said Mr. Vijayan was a great man with special power, energy and ability. “If I could get any close to him in energy level, I would be a fortunate person. But I cannot and do not have his determination or observation about matters,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ep-jayarajan-to-keep-away-from-electoral-politics/article34202747.ece

At the same time, there is a move to break the Constitution,” he said while addressing a press conference in Kasaragod on Tuesday. “The Congress is not fulfilling its responsibility of opposing the communalism of the RSS and protecting constitutional rights. It is joining hands with the BJP to attack the LDF,” he said.

The tension is palpable among cadres of the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) as Twenty20’s candidate C.N. Prakash, a journalist-cum-lawyer, creates waves across the region even as his party takes baby steps in forming grassroots-level committees. A confident Mr. Prakash, who was till recently the regional news editor of a vernacular news channel, has been leading two-wheeler rallies across the constituency, with cadres clad in white T-shirts bearing the party’s pineapple symbol. “Muvattupuzha is going to create history this election, since our party has found a place in people’s hearts. There is a discernible wave in our favour, among different segments of society,” he said. “I was selected based on an online survey that was conducted by the party among 2,200 people in the constituency, where people expressed the desire to have a new, non-political face as candidate. An interview followed. I was attracted to the party mainly due to its anti-corruption stand and since large sections of people have lost faith in the traditional fronts that ruled Kerala. Examples abound in Muvattupuzha, where the European Economic Community-aided agriculture wholesale market and Nadukkara Agro-Processing Company, which were established using massive public funds and hold tremendous potential, have been remaining shoddily underutilised for decades,” said Mr. Prakash. The sitting MLA and LDF candidate, Eldho Abraham, said substantial progress was made in land acquisition for key road projects in and around Muvattupuzha town during the past five years. Seeking second term The projects could be realised in the coming years if he got a second term, he said, while taking a break from campaigning at the Government Guest House in Kacherithazham. UDF candidate Mathew Kuzhalnadan, who is among the most well-educated candidates in the fray (he holds a Ph.D in international law), said that development came to a standstill in Muvattupuzha during the past five years, be it on the agricultural or the infrastructural front. “I will take up the demand to carve out Muvattupuzha as a district. Much can be done to help out farmers through out-of-the-box solutions such as creating cold-storage facilities to ensure steady price through the year. Farmers’ collectives must be formed to redress their grievances,” he said. The BJP has fielded Jiji Joseph as its candidate in the constituency.

31 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Call to set up NATPAC office in city||With traffic movement restricted at Vyttila and Kundannoor despite the commissioning of six-lane flyovers and dedicated free-left turns absent in most junctions in the city, the public and the traffic police have been demanding that the opinion of traffic and road-engineering experts from National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) and related agencies should be sought, even at the design stage. The demand has intensified in the backdrop of alleged flaws in the construction of traffic islands and roundabouts by the Public Works Department (NH wing) at the two busy junctions on the Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass. NH corridor Interestingly, experts from NATPAC were involved in the design of junctions when the Cherthala-Edappally-Aroor NH corridor was widened as four-lane in the late 1990s, and had an office here, as part of the project management team, until the completion of the Cochin International Airport in 2003 . The NATPAC now has a regional office in Kozhikode, but not in Kochi, despite the city having narrow, unscientifically-designed, congested and accident-prone roads. “The PWD has failed to ensure smooth movement of traffic and pedestrians at Vyttila, even though massive funds were invested on building a six-lane flyover. The junction does not have footpaths, while the traffic lights meant to ensure safe crossing by pedestrians have been switched off. Technical experts from Thiruvananthapuram-based NATPAC should ideally have been involved in the flyover’s design and junction redesign,” said T.N. Pratapan, State general convenor of Janakeeya Anweshana Samithi, a Thammanam-based NGO. The Samithi shot off letters and mails to the City Police Commissioner and the District Collector, but to no avail, said Mr. Pratapan. The State government must rope in experts from agencies such as NATPAC to do an in-depth study of problems encountered by road users at such junctions in the city, at least in this eleventh hour, he added. Meanwhile, NATPAC Director Samson Mathew said the agency was of the firm opinion that there was need for a regional office in Kochi. “A proposal in this regard has been readied. The agency has been conducting studies to improve road safety in the city during the past years (in tandem with Kerala Road Safety Authority and the traffic police). We hope to recruit more personnel in the coming months, including to man regional offices,” he added. Former Director of NATPAC, T. Elankovan, who is at present the Executive Director of the KRSA, said that officials of many government agencies that built and maintained roads and allied infrastructure had little knowledge of junction design. “A metro city like Kochi needs permanent presence of technical experts who have sound knowledge of road and junction design.”  A metro city like Kochi needs permanent presence of technical experts who have sound knowledge of road and junction design T.

31 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Criminal cases against candidates||From cheating to molestation and engaging in unnatural sex and amassing wealth, several candidates who are in the fray for the Assembly elections are facing criminal charges. A cursory look at the election affidavits of candidates reveals that most of them were booked for destruction of public property and causing obstruction in public thoroughfare. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act regarding a “contract entered into for unlawful gain” (SNC-Lavalin case), among other cases. Though he was earlier discharged by a special court, a Special Leave Petition filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation against the discharge is pending before the Supreme Court, says the affidavit. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy faces a case of unnatural offences for voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature (Section 377) and for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property (Section 420), among others. BJP State president K. Surendran, who is contesting from the Konni and Manjeswaram constituencies, has the most number of cases. He has 248 cases booked against him for unlawful assembly, causing obstruction in public way, rash driving and most of them were booked during the Sabarimala protest organised by the Sangh Parivar against the Supreme Court order permitting the entry of women to Sabarimala. K.S. Radhakrishnan, the BJP candidate in Thripunithura, too has 211 such cases against him. Actor Suresh Gopi, the BJP candidate in Thrissur, has been booked for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property (Section 420 of the IPC), forgery for the purpose of cheating (Section 468) and using as genuine, a forged document (Section 471). The case against him is that he gave an address which did not belong to him and purchased an Audi car and obtained temporary registration from Puducherry. The actor thus caused a loss of Rs. 15.85 lakh to the State, according to the case details. Jacob Thomas, former IPS officer, who is contesting from Irinjalakuda as BJP candidate, has been booked under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and for criminal conspiracy. He has moved the Kerala High Court for quashing the first information reports in the cases. Former Minister A.P. Anilkumar, the UDF candidate in Wandoor, has been booked for assault or criminal force against women with the intent to outrage her modesty (Section 354 of the IPC), for voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature (Section 377) and for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property (Section 420).  M.M. Mani, the LDF candidate in Udumbanchola, in his affidavit, has stated that the Kerala High Court has stayed the proceedings against him in a case in which he has sought for discharge. The allegation in the case is that Mr. Mani and others, in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy, decided to kill Anchery Baby and another person and in furtherance of the conspiracy, shot Baby dead on November 13, 1982.  BJP State president K. Surendran has the most number of 248 cases||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/criminal-cases-against-candidates/article34202739.ece
31 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Perumbavoor gears up for a tough poll battle||Eldhose Kunnappilly was watching a young lad dribbling past a defender at the football ground in Okkal on Tuesday morning. Later, the youngsters were eager to share the summary of the match with the sitting MLA. After a few handshakes, Mr. Kunnappilly, the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate in Perumbavoor constituency, moved to the spectators seated in a neat line on the compound wall and sought their help in making it big in the Assembly elections. “I am meeting key sections that include young voters and what better place than a football ground to meet and interact with them,” said Mr. Kunnappilly, as he started the final phase of his campaigning. His campaign manager said electioneering in an open vehicle accompanied by party workers on two-wheelers ended on Monday night. “He had visited laksham veedu colonies in Koovapadi in the morning leg of the campaign,” he said. At Mudakuzha, Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate Babu Joseph of the Kerala Congress (M) got a surprise reception when Omana, a homemaker, gifted him pappadams made by her. Pension “The senior citizens recalled the pension distributed by the Left government. The region, which mostly comprises farming community and unorganised workers, lacked proper roads,” alleged Mr. Joseph. “This will be a close fight going by our assessment from the grassroots-level,” he added. Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DFYI) in Chendakuzhi accompanied their candidate at the key points. T.P. Sindhumol, the candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party, had a whirlwind tour of Vengola panchayat. “I was able to visit all the colonies in the area and interact with the communities there. The visit also helped in identifying the problems being faced by them, especially women,” she said. The vehicle campaign will come to a close on Wednesday. “I plan to have personal interactions in the coming days,” said Ms. Sindhumol. Twenty20, which has fielded Chitra Sukumaran, seems hopeful of making dents in the vote share of the key fronts. The party is riding on the impressive win it earned in Vengola panchayat (eight seats) in the local body elections held in December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/perumbavoor-readies-for-a-tough-battle/article34203110.ece

31 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||When summer showers brought misery to student||Unexpected showers accompanied by gutsy winds lasting just a few minutes last week changed the life of 14-year-old Kathiravan, seemingly irrevocably. Having left his home at Gandhi Nagar with his cousin Arun Pandy last Thursday, the Class 9 student of SRV High School in the city ended up at the Government Medical College Hospital in Kottayam, where he remains admitted with an amputated leg. Near stadium He had gone to meet another cousin Dinesh, who was playing football at the Ambedkar Stadium, when the sudden bout of summer rain sent the three of them scurrying for shelter under a giant tree near the stadium. Little did they know of the lurking danger when the strong wind uprooted the tree. Two of the youngsters were trapped beneath it. Autorickshaw drivers and trade union workers who rushed to the scene could not manage to rescue Kathiravan. An earthmover had to be brought in before the fallen tree could be moved and the youngster was rushed to the General Hospital here, from where he was referred to the Kottayam Medical College Hospital. Doctors found the limb beyond recovery and it was amputated the day after. In COVID ward “Meanwhile, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and now remains admitted in the COVID-19 ward. With one limb lost and the other severely injured, his future seems imperilled. He hails from an impoverished family and we are in the process of mobilising funds to help him,” said Aravindakshan V.K., joint secretary of SRV Old Students’ Association. Hailing from Virudhunagar near Madurai, Ponraj, Kathiravan’s father, migrated with his family to Kerala nearly five years ago. “He continues to be in the COVID-19 ward and it is not known when he will be discharged. He was very fond of football and athletics,” said Mr. Ponraj, struggling to sound calm. Help sought Rani P.V., Maths teacher at the school, said Kathiravan was a calm youngster, who was proficient in Malayalam despite his Tamil origins. “He was very active in the Customs Cadet Corps and was a regular at the parades held on Saturdays,” said Ms. Rani who has been soliciting help from people for her student.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-summer-showers-brought-misery-to-him/article34202666.ece
31 March 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Police bid to stall money laundering case probe: ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday submitted before the Kerala High Court that the police were fabricating evidence against ED officers to stall investigation in the money laundering case, which is at a crucial stage with names of some ‘highly placed persons’ being unearthed. The submission was made when a petition filed by P. Radhakrishnan, Deputy Director, ED, seeking to quash an FIR registered by the Crime Branch against some unnamed ED officials for allegedly forcing Swapna Suresh, prime accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling and the money laundering cases, to give false statements against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was taken up for hearing. The registration of the FIR against ED officials was “a blatant counter-blast” to the investigation being conducted by the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Counsel for the ED sought to stop the investigation by the Crime Branch as the affidavit of the Crime Branch had made it clear that it was going ahead with the investigation and fabricating evidence against it. Meanwhile, in his reply affidavit, Mr. Radhakrishnan submitted that he had filed the petition in his capacity as an investigating officer of the ED and not in his personal capacity. The court adjourned the case to March 31 for hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-bid-to-stall-money-laundering-case-probe-ed/article34202754.ece

31 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Second shows revive Mollywood’s fortunes||The decision to permit second shows seems to have revived the fortunes of the Malayalam film industry that was hit hard by a COVID-19-induced crisis. A gradual return to the good times is round the corner, going by the feedback from cinema theatre owners and producers. “The release of Mammootty’s The Priest , the first movie that reached the screens after authorities reinstated the second shows, has been the turning point. The family audience has come back to the theatres after long,” said M.C. Bobby, former general secretary of the Film Exhibitors' United Organisation of Kerala. The government had permitted only three shows after the cinemas were allowed to resume the operations following the lockdown relaxations. However, the collections failed to touch the expected figures as the Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce pointed out that the footfall would not go up without the permission to screen the second shows. Total collection “We are now getting 50% of the total collections for the three shows in the daytime from the second show. If Rs. 20,000 is the combined revenue from the three shows, a second show is giving us collections to the tune of Rs. 10,000,” said Mr. Bobby. B. Rakesh, treasurer of the Kerala Film Producers’ Association (KFPA), said that The Priest had earned about Rs. 6 crore share for the producer. “It’s success has rekindled hopes in the industry ,” he said. The release of nearly 80 movies was affected as the cinemas had remained shut in view of the health crisis. “Of these, 30 movies had either reached the cinemas or opted for a digital premiere. The collections improved only after the second shows were reinstated," said Mr. Rakesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/second-shows-revive-mollywoods-fortunes/article34202759.ece
31 March 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||When PR agencies run the election campaign||Outsourcing was not a term often associated with electoral politics. But times have changed and political fronts, parties, and even individual candidates are now making a beeline for roping in professional agencies to run their campaigns. However, not all seem impressed. “It is the necessary evil of the technology-driven modern world but lacks the human connection that is so critical to an election campaign. I have contested so many elections and never for once felt the need for any agency to support my campaign,” said K.V. Thomas, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee working president, who is also in charge of the media during this election. However, there seem to be some obvious advantages in bringing aboard a professional agency going by the Left Democratic Front's (LDF) successful association with the agency Maitri Advertising Works during the last Assembly elections. The agency has now been retained for this election as well. Branding “Branding a political front involves as much planning and strategising as any other product. But politics being the domain of those associated with it, there is a definite brief and supervision by the front around which the concept is developed and tweaked to fit their expectations while we bring in external perception. Once the concept is finalised, we are given absolute creative freedom with little interference. This time, the achievements of the LDF government remain the obvious focus,” said a senior official associated with the agency, which has come up with the campaign theme Urappanu LDF (LDF for sure). The changed lifestyle and increased living expenditure have made a dent in the availability of a dedicated cadre for the nitty- gritty of an election campaign. “But the involvement of outside agencies runs the risk of leakage of campaign strategies to rivals,” he said. Senior journalist P. Rajan, who has covered elections for many decades, now said that professional agencies offer a mixed bag. “As in everything else, injecting a dose of professionalism is welcome in running an election campaign as in many other democracies, including the U.S. But there is always a risk of lack of commitment since it is a paid service unlike the work put in by loyal cadres,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-pr-agencies-run-election-campaigns/article34202716.ece

They pointed out that unless these polled postal ballots were kept in a strongroom, the electoral mandate would be manipulated on account of the mischievous actions of returning officers. A sufficiently big canvas bag for keeping the envelopes of polled ballots was given to polling officials who visited the houses of voters above 80 years, differently abled, COVID-19 positives, and those in quarantine. However, many polling officers did not use glue for closing the envelope and some women officers were collecting ballots in their vanity bags. The petitioners pointed out that allowing the returning officers to keep the polled votes in their custody would result in an unfair process of election.

Even a minor shift in the voting pattern of the Ezhava and Nair communities of the Hindu segment and the Muslim and Christian communities has impacted the electoral fortunes of the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Traditional votes The previous Assembly and Lok Sabha polls show that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been able to garner a large chunk of the Nair community from the Congress-led UDF and also moderately from the Ezhava community that traditionally voted for the CPI(M)-led LDF.  Various studies on the vote share of parties and post-poll surveys, including those conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), lend plausibility to the shift in votes of the communities in the elections in the State. The UDF and the LDF have been able to secure the votes of all communities, unlike the BJP, which obviously received votes only from the Hindu community and to a certain extent from the Christians. The studies show that in the past three Assembly polls, the LDF has been getting around 40% to 45% of the Nair votes, 30% to 39% of the Muslim votes and 27% to 35% of the Christian votes. However, the front has been losing votes of the Ezhava community from 65% to 49% when compared to the polls of 2006, 2011 and 2016. Nair votes Its share of votes of the Nair community plummeted to 20% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, possibly linked to the decision of the government to implement the Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all age groups entry into the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala. The Nair community referred in most of the studies includes upper caste Hindus. Similarly, its vote share of the Muslim and Christian communities fell to 30% and 25% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. One of the crucial factors was the minority support that favoured the UDF and also the projection of the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to the post of Prime Minister. For the UDF, it secured 20% of votes of the Nair, 28% of Ezhava, 58% of Muslim and 51% of Christian communities in the 2016 polls. Improved vote share However, it made a massive improvement in its vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls – Nair 35%, Muslim 65%, and Christian 70%. Its share of the Ezhava community remained at 28%. In the 2011 Assembly polls, the UDF vote share of different communities were Nair 43%, Ezhava 26%, Muslim 65% and Christian 67%. In the case of the BJP-led National Development Alliance, it secured 33% of votes of Nair and 17% of Ezhava and 9% of Christian votes in the previous Assembly polls. The party made a jump in its Hindu votes – Nair 43 % and Ezhava 21% in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/big-role-for-religion-caste-in-state-elections/article34202713.ece
31 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Confident fronts turn poll scene electric in Kozhikode North||On a makeshift dais overlooking the Congress local committee office, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran and M.K. Raghavan, MP, along with a few khadi-attired leaders stretched out before the summer sun scorched the small venue at Vengeri. It was barely 8 a.m. on yet another sparkling day in the city. However, Congress candidate in Kozhikode North Assembly seat K.M. Abhijith was nowhere on the scene for his own poll rally. Minutes later, an overgrown boy sporting a beard emerged from the adjacent strip of land beside the busy Kakkodi road. “I was searching for a shawl,” Abhijith sheepishly replied. Are you going to win the elections? “Maybe I will,” he responds with youthful sureness when the KPCC president flagged off his city-tour campaign. At 26 years of age, Abhijith is probably the youngest candidate in the State. Like David of the Biblical tale, his image appears to have suddenly furbished from an anti-regime demonstrator on campus to take the poll battle to hardened veterans — Thottathil Raveendran, two-time Mayor fielded by the CPI(M) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State general secretary M.T. Ramesh — in this urban segment. No wonder his poll managers came up with a filmy-style catchword, ‘Abhi jayikkum’ (Abhi will win). His candidacy has struck a sympathetic chord among the cross-section of the electoral profile. No novice to elections, Abhijith was chairman of the highly-politicised Calicut University Students Union. The assembly poll is a bigger turf for the incumbent KSU State president. He is the boy-next-door type with no big intentions. And of course, he is the poorest of the candidates in the district as well, his poll managers say. Energetic appeal Cut to the electioneering scenario of the Left Democratic Front where Mr. Raveendran is systematically guided in the electoral maze. However, he needs no introduction to Kozhikode. “Raviyettan (as he is fondly called) knows every nook and cranny of the city. He is like a Karanavar for us – irrespective of caste, religion and politics,” P.A. Jaiprakash, a trusted adviser, said. When he approaches voters whether it is at East Hill or Paroppady or a visit a colony at Vellayil, Mr. Raveendran oozes a positive and energetic appeal. “They have known me all these years. My confidence is that they will not fail me,” Mr. Raveendran said. Unprecedented style Never seen before in the election campaigns of the BJP in Kozhikode is the aggressive publicity blitzkrieg of Mr. Ramesh that is shocking both the coalitions. His campaign matches the political machinery of the CPI(M) thus giving a three-pronged contest. Suave and poised, Mr. Ramesh goes along with an entourage of loyal workers in open jeeps from one junction to another. Whizzing past the Kozhikode bypass, he reached Paroppady where a crowd eagerly awaits him. His words give prominence to the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A few passers-by, impressed by his confidence, stop to hear his speech at Ashokapuram. “My focus is on the development of Kozhikode initiated through the Centre,” Mr. Ramesh avers. All three candidates swear by development plans to woo voters. But it will be neutral, apolitical and undecided voters who will decide the legislator of Kozhikode North.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/confident-fronts-turn-poll-scene-electric-in-kozhikode-north/article34202656.ece
31 March 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Graft charge against ex-chairman of City Cooperative Bank||The new administrative panel of the Karuvanthiruthy Service Cooperative Bank has come up with allegations of corruption against C.N. Vijayakrishnan, former chairman of Calicut City Service Cooperative Bank and chairman of MVR Cancer Centre. K.M. Basheer, the new chairman of Karuvanthuruthi Bank, told reporters here on Monday that Mr. Vijayakrishnan had drawn the bank into unnecessary legal issues. He, along with some friends, had filed five petitions against it, which had all been dismissed by the Kerala High Court after a hearing on March 9. Mr. Basheer said that Mr. Vijayakrishnan and his friends had used the cooperative movement as a cover for their unlawful deeds. Based on an audit of the Department of Cooperatives at the Calicut City Cooperative Bank in March 2019, Mr. Basheer said that the bank had given around Rs. 650 crore as loan to MVR Cancer Centre. The Cancer Centre was running at a loss of Rs. 209 crore. Ladder, a construction firm chaired by Mr.Vijayakrishnan, was running at a loss of Rs. 50.84 crore, Mr. Basheer claimed. Ladder was also functioning on a loan from City Cooperative Bank, he said. Bank’s response Meanwhile, the Calicut City Service Cooperative Bank, issued a statement on Tuesday that the bank had given a loan of Rs. 600 crore to MVR Cancer Centre at Chathamangalam with the State government’s permission and that centre, with a value of around Rs. 800 crore and growing popularity among the public, had not defaulted in the repayment of the loan in instalments. Similarly, the bank had given a loan of Rs. 60 crore to Ladder, while it had a value of around Rs. 500 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/graft-charge-against-ex-chairman-of-city-cooperative-bank/article34202661.ece
31 March 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Rs. 5 cr. for modernisation of CU departments||Calicut University approved a surplus budget with an outlay of Rs. 279.93 crore for 2021-22 financial year at a Senate meeting held here on Tuesday. According to sources, Rs. 5 crore has been allocated for the modernisation of departments, including their development as Centres with Potential for Excellence. The amount would also be used for a museum, manuscripts library and a Central Sophisticated Instrumentation Facility. Another Rs. 2 crore would be earmarked for the ongoing renovation works. Institute for Tribal Studies and Research hostel in Wayanad would get Rs. 1 crore. An equal amount has been allocated for the construction of second floor for the plant biotechnology building. A sum of Rs. 50 lakh has been allocated for the ongoing work on the golden jubilee block of academic evaluation. All these are under the State Plan Grant. Energy, water and green audit as well as Knowledge Extension Centre and extension works would get Rs. 2 crore each, which has been included in the non-plan fund.  Objections raised Meanwhile, a group of Senate members affiliated to the United Democratic Front raised objections during the question hour session. According to P. Rasheed Ahammed, Senate member, this followed a wrong answer given to a question on the recruitment of faculty in various departments. Mr. Ahammed said that two reports on faculty recruitment were approved at a Senate meeting held on March 28, 2015. The main report had said that appointments would be made only after clearing the backlog vacancies. Its annexure ad mentioned about backlog vacancies of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and differently abled. Mr. Ahammed alleged that in reply to a question on Tuesday, only partial information from these reports were given. He also alleged that a Left-leaning member made inappropriate remarks which led to a protest. Later, the member is reported to have apologised for his comments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/varsity-earmarks-rs-5-crore-for-modernisation-of-depts/article34202658.ece

Narayanan could not cast his vote as he had been reported deceased by the booth level officer (BLO). Mr.Narayanan, at 88, is weak and resting at his home at Malapparamba in the city, but very much alive. “I could not cast my vote this time. There is nothing more to say about it,” Mr.Narayanan said. However, the district administration stepped in . District Collector S.Sambasiva Rao contacted Mr.Narayanan to know about his whereabouts. Later, he acknowledged the mistake made by the BLO, who filed the report based on rumours on social media. The Collector said arrangements would be made for Mr.Narayanan to cast his vote at the designated polling booth on April 6, as his name had not been removed from the poll rolls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/blo-reports-mgs-dead/article34202743.ece

Chairman of the forum A. Vasu (GROW Vasu) told reporters here on Tuesday that eight revolutionaries were killed by the government through fake encounters in the past five years. The forum also drew attention to several custodial deaths too. “The State government has not made any move to withdraw UAPA cases against several people who have been labelled terrorists for propagating ideas, including human rights activists, social activists, Maoists and Muslim youths. There are over 140 such cases registered in the State,” Mr. Vasu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dharna-against-uapa/article34202652.ece
31 March 2021||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||LDF banks on Kunhalikutty factor in IUML fort||The heat of a high-pitched electoral battle is felt across the 16 constituencies in Malappuram district, the largest in the State. Although the results of more than half of them are predictably one-sided, the fight in some key and potentially ‘flippable’ constituencies such as Nilambur, Perinthalmanna, Mankada, Tanur, Tirur and Thavanur is fierce. Slogans of electioneering heard across the district are of uniform character, but candidates and their banners bring additional variety to some constituencies. Money appears to be playing a significant role in some constituencies where affluent candidates with little political history or experience are seeking the mandate, in spite of a close watch by the Election Commission. While the United Democratic Front is facing the electorate with the conventional party symbols (12 Indian Union Muslim League candidates have ladder and four Congress candidates have hand as their symbol), the Left Democratic Front strategy is different. The CPI(M) has only six candidates seeking the ballot on the party symbol, and the CPI and the NCP on one each. Five LDF candidates, including incumbents P.V. Anvar and K.T. Jaleel in Nilambur and Thavanur respectively and K.P.M. Mustafa in Perinthalmanna, have autorickshaw as their symbols. LS byelection The LDF is passionately whipping up people’s sentiments against the Parliament byelection necessitated in Malappuram following IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty’s resignation from the Lok Sabha. The LDF says the byelection was imposed on the people by Mr. Kunhalikutty. The Congress is putting up a strong fight in Nilambur and Thavanur. It is using the cases being faced by Mr. Anvar and his bluntness in dealing with issues as a poll plank against him in Nilambur. In Thavanur, well known charity organiser Firoz Kunnamparambil’s popularity is put to test against Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel. The allegations of nepotism that Dr. Jaleel faced are echoing in the constituency. Perinthalmanna and Mankada are witnessing a tight fight, especially against the backdrop of narrow margins of victory gained by the UDF in the 2016 election. Manjalamkuzhi Ali has to prove that his personal influence continues in Mankada, where he is facing CPI(M)’s T.K. Rasheedali. In Perinthalmanna, it is a neck-and-neck battle between Mr. Mustafa and Muslim Youth League’s Najeeb Kanthapuram. A former IUML man, Mr. Mustafa is using his business contacts in the constituency. For Mr. Kanthapuram, Perinthalmanna is a new turf. The wrangling rival groups of the IUML there are silent now. If Mr. Ali is a lone businessman within the UDF, in the LDF, Mr. Anvar (Nilambur), Kattuparuthi Sulaiman Haji (Kondotty), Mr. Mustafa (Perinthalmanna), Mr. Rasheedali (Mankada), Paloli Abdurahman (Malappuram), Niyas Pulikkalakath (Tirurangadi), V. Abdurahman (Tanur), Gafoor P. Lillis (Tirur), and N.A. Mohammed Kutty (Kottakkal) are all businessmen. Youth League’s P.K. Firos is hopeful of wresting back Tanur from Mr. Abdurahman. The LDF has hopes in Tirur and Tirurangadi, but it needs to be seen how much it can cash in on the anti-Kunhalikutty sentiment it is stirring across the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-banks-on-kunhalikutty-factor-in-iuml-fort/article34202720.ece
31 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Modi’s surprising quid pro quo to Naseema||Reverentially touching another person’s feet or prostrating before that person is common in Hindu culture, but seldom practised by Muslims. National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) Muslim candidate in Mannarkkad Naseema P. had one of the biggest surprises of her life when she bent down to touch Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s feet at the Bharatiya Janata Party’s mega election rally held at Fort Maidan here on Tuesday. Soon after finishing his 45-minute speech that invigorated the large crowd as well as the NDA candidates on the stage, Mr. Modi was preparing to leave the stage when Ms. Naseema walked up to him and genuflected before him. In an unexpected quid pro quo, Mr. Modi bent down and touched her feet, shared a few words of encouragement with her, and sent her briefly to a world of awe. “It was beyond words for me. I never expected it from a great man like Modiji. It’s still like a dream for me,” said Ms. Naseema. She said she wanted to have his blessings by touching his feet. “But Modiji surprised me by honouring me. It shows how respectfully he treats women,” said Ms. Naseema. Ms. Naseema is the only Muslim woman candidate in the NDA. She is contesting on All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam banner against the Indian Union Muslim League’s incumbent N. Shamsuddin and Communist Party of India’s K.P. Suresh Raj in Mannarkkad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/modis-surprising-quid-pro-quo-to-naseema/article34202753.ece
31 March 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Water remains Chittur’s poll plank||Water, nothing but water, continues to be the sole election plank in Chittur, one of the oldest Assembly segments in Palakkad district, in spite of having been represented 14 times by different political leaders since the formation of Kerala. The incumbent, Minister for Water Resources K. Krishnankutty, represented Chittur four times (in 1980, 1982, 1991 and 2016). Congress leader K. Achuthan represented Chittur four times consecutively for 20 years from 1996. They claim that they did their best for Chittur. Yet, Chittur remains one of the least developed constituencies in the district. When K. Krishnankutty, Sumesh Achuthan, and N. Natesan, the three key contestants of Chittur representing the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the United Democratic Front (UDF), and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) respectively, met face to face at the Press Club here on Tuesday, they had nothing but water to talk about. As incumbent, Mr. Krishnankutty was thorough with the figures of water reaching Kerala from Tamil Nadu and that of water going to Tamil Nadu from Kerala. Yet, he warned that any campaign against the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) would be detrimental for Chittur. River linking “If you oppose KIIFB, it will be tantamount to opposing the development of Chittur. So much has been done for the development of Chittur with KIIFB support in the past five years,” he said. He also warned that river linking projects would ultimately be disastrous for Kerala. Sumesh Achuthan said that there was much to be done for Chittur, including renewal and revision of the Parambikulam-Aliyar water agreement with Tamil Nadu. He said more could be done to help paddy and coconut farmers of Chittur. Agricultural college He also offered to renew the efforts to set up an agricultural college in Chittur. However, Mr. Sumesh agreed that development in Chittur lacked speed because of the unique socio-political atmosphere of the region. Mr. Natesan, in his inimitable Palakkad slang, blamed both the UDF and LDF candidates and their predecessors for the lack of development in Chittur. For tangible changes Quoting verses in Malayalam, Tamil and Sanskrit, Mr. Natesan said that he would bring in tangible changes to Chittur if elected. “And I am sure that I will win this election. People of Chittur are fed up of these two friends. They want a change,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-remains-chitturs-poll-plank/article34203230.ece

SYS volunteers started the drive by cleaning the Bharathapuzha river on Monday. Environmentalist Vanamitra Mohandas Idiyath inaugurated the programme titled ‘water is life’.  SYS district social activities secretary Ashraf Ahsani presided over the function. District general secretary Umer Ongallur presented the subject. The SYS has given shape to a programme to maintain the Bharathapuzha free of pollution and contamination through constant monitoring by squads. It set up boards at different points, including the main bathing ghats in the river. It said it would press civic bodies to take action to convert their respective areas into plastic-free zones. S YS officials said that they would launch a special drive to revive ponds, streams and canals as part of preserving water and environment. Cleaning of rivers and other water sources would involve easing the water flow. SYS officials said that they would bring drinking water in tankers to areas facing acute water shortage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sys-launches-water-conservation-campaign/article34202668.ece
31 March 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||In Aranmula, a photo finish on the cards||On a residential plot close to the banks of the Manimalayar, veteran Congress leader K. Sivadasan Nair is busy canvassing local residents for the upcoming Assembly elections. It's an area where he expects to get support from. The workers of the United Democratic Front (UDF) accords him a rousing welcome by rendering a few lines of the famous vanchipattu (boat song). A resident of Aranmula, Mr. Nair suddenly finds himself in a familiar terrain and joins the performance. He sounds upbeat. “You have all been a great source of strength to me. As an elected representative, I shall be committed to addressing your concerns,” he says, before moving on to the next point. Just as he did in the previous two Assembly elections, Mr. Nair, who is locked in a close race with the Left democratic Front (LDF) candidate and sitting legislator Veena George, once again has the Aranmula seat in his sight. He might have lost the battle when the two faced off in 2016, but the UDF believes that it has regained much of the lost ground post the 2018 floods and the Sabarimala protests. ‘Progressive changes’ Not everyone, however, is buying this argument, as Ms. George remains capable of chipping away the UDF's advantage. Canvassing residents of the Elanthur panchayat, she receives support from a number of them who acknowledge themselves as ardent Left supporters. “The progressive changes the region has witnessed ever since the previous government came to power in 2016 will have to continue. For this, the LDF has to continue,” Ms. George tells them. While post-flood reconstruction holds the focal point in the LDF's election campaign, the coalition also hopes to leverage the momentum it gained during the recent local body polls to pull off a victory. Anti-incumbency wave The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), meanwhile, seeks to reject any suggestion that the battle for the Aranmula constituency is a straight fight between the UDF and LDF. Having recorded a sharp surge in its vote share during the previous Assembly elections, the coalition has relentlessly pushed to expand in the region by riding on the anti-incumbency wave, combined with the Sabarimala issue, to work in its favour. Biju Mathew, a BJP leader contesting as the NDA candidate, is confident about the voters extending their whole-hearted support to the development vision set by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. “I am sure that the people will vote for a change this time and find a way out of the vicious circle involving the UDF-LDF combine,” he says. Holding an edge Of the 13 local bodies in the Assembly segment, the UDF has an edge in five, while the LDF rules six, including the Pathanamthitta municipality. The BJP holds advantage in one local body, the Kulanada panchayat, while the lone remaining panchayat, Thottapuzhassery, has an independent at its helm. Having been in the shadow of an alleged pact between the CPI(M) and the BJP, the Aranmula seat presents one of the most intriguing battle in Pathanamthitta district. Among the key factors expected to affect the final result include the stance of the Orthodox church as well as members of the Hindu upper castes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/in-aranmula-a-photo-finish-on-the-cards/article34202730.ece
31 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Return of LDF is not good for State: Antony||The return of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government to power will not be good for Kerala and democracy as the government will be an autocratic one under CPI(M) leader Pinarayi Vijayan, Congress Working Committee member A.K. Antony has said. “If such a government comes, it will be like a kingly rule. In government, the CPI(M) and the LDF, everything begins and ends with Mr. Vijayan. Even the Polit Bureau has only a namesake control. It will not be good for communism and one should not forget 35 years of CPI(M) rule in West Bengal,” Mr. Antony told The Hindu . Pointing out that corruption and pomp were the hallmarks of the five years of LDF governance, the former Defence Minister says check and balance are missing for the Chief Minister and Ministers. Collective responsibility is lacking. The government is not ready to change decisions that are opposed by the people. CPI(M) votes too The former Chief Minister asserts that the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) will come to power in the State. “Besides the neutral votes, those in the CPI(M) who want to see that the party exists will vote for the UDF.” People look forward to a change of government and the Congress has adapted to the ‘changing times’ and to those below 45 years by going for a ‘generational shift’ by announcing 50 to 60% new candidates. On Cong. Chief Minister In the UDF, Mr. Antony says, a collective leadership is working to oust the LDF. “The Congress Chief Minister will be the leader of all, powerful, answerable to the UDF and the people.” The unfortunate incidents over women entry at the Sabarimala temple could have been avoided if the government had consulted stakeholders as demanded by the Opposition. Mr. Antony says he had taken up the issue only after the Chief Minister’s present stance that the Supreme Court verdict would be implemented in consultation with all. For political gains, Mr. Vijayan divided people in the name of renaissance. Traditional rituals should be respected and the Sabarimala issue is going to reflect in the poll. On the controversial deep-sea fishing, the State, all political parties and organisations of fisherfolk had opposed an earlier move by the Centre in this regard. “It had the blessings of Mr. Vijayan. If the coastal people awakes, no one can prevent them. Right of sea will be assured to sons of the sea if the UDF comes to power.” Development initiatives of the LDF government lacked accountability and transparency. The CAG, Central agencies and even courts are coming under attack from the LDF. BJP’s claims The BJP’s wish of securing 35 seats will not materialise. The BJP cadres will vote for the CPI(M) to keep the Congress out of power, he said. The exit of the Kerala Congress (M) from the UDF is a closed chapter, but Jose K. Mani will regret the decision, he said.  In the CPI(M) and the LDF, everything begins and ends with Pinarayi Vijayan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/return-of-ldf-is-not-good-for-state-antony/article34202749.ece

Addressing a large gathering at Poonthura late Tuesday during the last-leg of her tour to drum up support for United Democratic Front candidates in the district, Ms. Vadra said that the people of the State, particularly the fisherfolk, did not receive proper support from the government during the floods and Cyclone Ockhi. “Shockingly, Rs. 15 crore from the flood relief fund went into the accounts of CPI (M) workers. By now, you must have understood that your interests and livelihood have been sold by this government,” she said. She also attacked the government for allegedly failing to deliver its promises. “They (the LDF) had made several promises before the last elections. They promised you 20 lakh jobs, but they did not provide them. They promised support for the fisherfolk, but they supported corporate industries instead. They also promised to revive the small industries here, but did nothing,” the Congress leader alleged. Drawing parallels Drawing parallels between the LDF government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Uttar Pradesh government at another campaign rally at Venjaramoodu, Ms. Vadra said Kerala was witnessing a politics of fear, fascism, fraud and favouritism. “This State was built by the hard work and toil of the people. No single leader of any political party can single-handedly take credit for what Kerala is today. The people of Kerala are the real gold of the State. Unfortunately, the government does not recognise or respect this gold. It is far too interested in foreign gold and smuggling. What is the point of swearing to a Communist manifesto if you are working for a corporate agenda,” she asked, referring to the gold smuggling scandal. Hitting out at the BJP, she said that Home Minister Amit Shah made a statement condemning the attack by goons from the BJP’s youth wing against nuns in Uttar Pradesh because elections were happening in Kerala. He never opened his mouth in the past when numerous incidents of a similar nature perpetrated by the BJP or its various organisations happened, Ms. Vadra claimed. At another rally at Kattakada, the Congress leader spoke at length about the promises in the Congress’s election manifesto which, she said, were prepared after months of consultations with people from various walks of life. Alleging that the LDF government survived on PR and propaganda, she added that the people of Kerala were aware that the wrong policies of the Centre and the State governments were responsible for their daily struggles.  The people of Kerala are the real gold of the State. Unfortunately, the government is far too interested in foreign gold.

31 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||It’s political power play by rival fronts at Vattiyurkavu||Cacophonous announcements fill the air on a sultry Monday afternoon at the Devaswom Board junction leading to the Cliff House. The scene is symbolic of the intense poll heat being witnessed in the Vattiyurkavu constituency, considered a prestigious seat in the battle for power. Amidst the din, the lead announcer in the CPI(M) campaign vehicle dishes out details about the achievements of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government and makes a fervent appeal to vote for V.K. Prasanth who “deserved five years after managing to initiate works worth Rs. 1,123 crore in the constituency within 500 days”. As if on cue, Mr. Prasanth makes an entry in his personal vehicle and greets the public before delving into his campaign. Former Mayor The former Thiruvananthapuram Mayor, who has carefully cultivated a persona that resonated with the youth since leading the relief measures during the 2018 floods, has made development his prime poll plank. He is fighting to retain the seat that he won in a by-election in 2019. “Despite efforts by the Opposition parties to divert public focus, bread-and-butter issues along with infrastructure development are going to determine the poll outcome. We formulated a development plan for the constituency. During the last 17 months, we could solve the drinking water problem in city to a large extent. Besides renovating numerous roads, we could also initiate the development of the Vattiyurkavu junction,” he said. Choosing a slightly different path to win over the electorate, his opponents have raised faith along with the constituency’s development as their poll issues. Besides, they have banked on caste undercurrents in a segment where the Nair community hold sway. Interacting with local residents in Ambala Nagar, United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate Veena S. Nair points out the raging Sabarimala issue and other matters relating to faith are as important for the local community. Ms. Nair, who is hoping to exploit her ‘native’ tag, adds she held great hopes for the constituency where she grew up. “I hope to find solutions to our long-standing problems including the development of the Vattiyurkavu and Peroorkada junctions, traffic and parking woes of the city, and the lack of trauma and cancer care centres in the constituency,” he said. Not far off, National Democratic Alliance (NDA)’s candidate, BJP district president V.V. Rajesh, is set to commence his campaign near Muttada from the vicinity of the Anchumukku Devi temple and a Nair Service Society (NSS) karayogam office. While claiming that Vattiyurkavu has been a nerve-centre in the ‘Sabarimala movement’, he says there is no dearth in campaign issues owing to the “pitiable plight’’ of the capital city. BJP’s claim “Thiruvananthapuram (of which Vattiyurkavu comprised a major portion) has not developed on par with other State capitals. Despite being a hub of educational and research institutions and home to several intellectuals, the region lacked facilities. The Narendra Modi-led Centre could play a major role in developing the city, provided we opened the doors to such initiatives. For one, the privatisation of the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is expected to usher in much development,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/its-political-power-play-by-rival-fronts-at-vattiyurkavu/article34203223.ece
31 March 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||44 species of odonates spotted in Kole fields||The Kole wetlands, spread over Thrissur and Malappuram, are home to 30 species of dragonflies and 14 species of damselflies. The 44 species of odonates, belonging to 33 genera and eight families, have been documented from the Kole wetlands, a Ramsar site, during an year-long study to document the diversity of odonates and seasonality. Kerala Dartlet ( Agriocnemis keralensis ), a damselfly endemic to the Western Ghats region, Green-eyed Spreadwing ( Platylestes platystylus ), a damselfly only recently recorded from the State, and the rare Dusky Lilysquatter ( Paracercion calamorum ) are the interesting species observed by the study team. The study highlights the importance of the Kole field as an agro-ecosystem supporting other faunal groups in addition to birds. Species richness showed a peak in the post-monsoon season and a dip in the summer as per the study published in the latest edition of the Journal of Threatened Taxa . Thousands of the migratory dragonfly Wandering Glider (Pantala flavescens) fill the skies over the Kole fields in the months of October-November. Role in pest control They feed on small insects and their role in controlling pests in agricultural fields needs to be investigated further, says Subin K. Jose and Vivek Chandran A., researchers at the Department of Geology and Environmental Science, Christ College, Irinjalakuda, and Sujith V. Gopalan, executive member, Society for Odonate Studies. One-fourth (25.14%) of the odonate species known to occur in Kerala have been recorded from the Kole wetlands in the study. Odonates, which depend on freshwater to complete their lifecycle, are excellent indicators of environmental health and can be used for monitoring pollution, habitat degradation and climate change, according to the researchers. The Kole wetlands are low-lying tracts located 0.5 to 1 m below the mean sea level. In the study conducted from February 2019 to February 2020, 30 sampling locations were chosen randomly, intending maximum spatial coverage of the Kole wetland in the Ponnani Kole and Thrissur South Kole.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/44-species-of-odonates-spotted-in-kole-fields/article34202742.ece

31 March 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Congress perks up city to welcome Priyanka||Flex boards announcing Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi’s date with the city lined the road all the way from Poojappura to Killipalam. Campaign vehicles making announcements blared her imminent arrival at Poojappura to campaign with Congress candidate from Nemom K. Muraleedharan in a road show in the run-up to the April 6 Assembly election. Congress flags hung from posts and fences, police personnel were on duty in anticipation of the VIP visit, and Congress workers could be seen putting up paraphernalia. Ms. Gandhi was originally scheduled to reach the Poojappura grounds by helicopter from Kattakada after addressing voters there. She was to take out a road show from Poojappura to Poonthura, but by Tuesday forenoon, the plan had changed to include a visit to the Attukal Bhagavathy temple along with Mr. Muraleedharan and Veena Nair, Congress candidate in the Vattiyurkavu Assembly segment. The Congress poll machinery was in full swing to drum up support for the party candidates by underlining Ms. Gandhi’s political legacy and her family’s contributions to the country. Temple visit At Attukal, a vehicle was fitted up to act as a makeshift stage complete with a lectern, and mic testing was on. There was no crowd to speak of, but a few Congress workers milled about. More than half an hour later, there was no sign of Ms. Gandhi or the Congress candidates. Snatches of conversations overheard revealed the reason. Ms. Gandhi was running late. Her meetings at Venjaramoodu and Kattakada would delay her arrival. Finally, she entered the city not by helicopter but by road. It was after 8.30 p.m. that she reached the Attukal temple. Mr. Muraleedharan and Ms. Veena Nair were present to receive the Congress general secretary along with a huge crowd that jostled to get a glimpse of their leader. Ms. Gandhi then offered prayers at the Attukal Bhagavathy temple before heading for the last leg of the day’s campaign in coastal Poonthura.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-perks-up-city-to-welcome-priyanka/article34203214.ece

31 March 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Elections, Pooram keep the spirits up in State’s cultural capital||Come April and Thrissur, famous for its Pooram, is on a festive high. This time, the festival ardour together with the election spirit has brewed a heady concoction. In the 2016 Assembly polls, the district presented an emphatic victory to the LDF with 12 of the 13 seats. The front lost by just 43 votes in Wadakkanchery to Congress candidate Anil Akkara. In return, the district received three Ministers with key portfolios, besides the post of Chief Whip. Just a week to the 2021 elections, the LDF does not seem to be very sure of a repeat of 2016. The UDF, on the other hand, is on a no-holds-barred campaign to wrest back its bastions. Young and new faces have injected freshness to the UDF’s list of candidates. The thumbing margins Congress’ T.N. Prathapan registered in the Assembly segments in the 2019 Lok Sabha election boost its confidence. However, the district proved unpredictable once again by favouring the LDF in the local body elections last year. Meanwhile, the NDA is all set to consolidate its vote share. A triangular fight is sure at least in Thrissur and Manalur, where it has fielded star candidate Suresh Gopi and State leader A.N. Radhakrishnan respectively.  There are 77 contestants in the district, who include one Minister and a few sitting MLAs. Two Ministers – V.S. Sunil Kumar and Prof. C. Raveendranath – are not in the fray this time. Right from basic amenities such as drinking water and waste management, a host of other issues, including the LIFE Mission project, national highway development, controversial deep-sea fishing deal, unemployment and the recent attack on nuns in U.P. are poll issues here. Five constituencies — Wadakkanchery, Thrissur, Kunnamkulam, Guruvayur and Irinjalakuda — witness tight competition this time. Sitting MLA Anil Akkara of the UDF is facing LDF’s youth leader Xavier Chittilappilly in Wadakkanchery. NDA’s Ullas Babu is an active presence in the constituency. Tight fight At Kunnamkulam, Minister A.C. Moideen is facing a tight fight from UDF’s K. Jayasankar. Thrissur, a traditional UDF stronghold, turned Left in the last election. UDF’s Padmaja Venugopal, who was defeated by Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar last time, however, is quite confident now. But the LDF’s P. Balachandran, is riding high on the development projects implemented by the Agriculture Minister. At Guruvayur, where the NDA has no candidate, both the LDF and the UDF are eyeing the 25,000-odd votes the BJP secured in the last Assembly election. Here, the BJP has decided to back Dileep Nair of the Democratic Social Justice Party. Irinjalakuda, where R. Bindu, Principal in charge of Sree Kerala Varma College and wife of CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan, is contesting against Kerala Congress’s Thomas Unniyadan, is another segment facing a pitched battle. The presence of NDA candidate Jacob Thomas, former Director General of Police, makes the battle interesting here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/elections-pooram-keep-the-spirits-up-in-states-cultural-capital/article34202715.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the Collectors to own up the works under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) by reviewing the implementation of the programme every 4-5 days. Reviewing the progress of the welfare schemes as part of Spandana, with Collectors and SPs on Tuesday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that it was laudable that the State has provided 25.50 crore working days for men and women in rural areas, becoming the third biggest provider of rural employment. The massive increase in working hours meant that a sum of Rs. 5,818 crore has been directly credited into the accounts of the workers. “I am happy that the NREGS has come to the rescue of millions of men and women even during the pandemic. We have time till June and I want the Collectors to monitor the scheme every 4-5 days and Joint Collectors should also spend time on this,’’ said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Construction of RBKs The CM also directed the Collectors to expedite the construction of Rythu Bharosa Kendras and village secretariats and complete all the pending works by May. “We want to launch the Rythu Bharosa Kendras on July 8 marking the birth anniversary of former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. The RBKs should help farmers before the onset of kharif. I also want the Collectors to focus on setting up village clinics and we are launching them on August 15. The village clinics will be playing a major role in vaccine administration,’’ said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. He also reviewed the progress of setting up of Bulk Milk Cooling Units and said that the process has begun at 3,841 points and wanted completion of the works by August 31. He hinted at establishing Food Processing Units in the 25 parliamentary constituencies and asked the Collectors to identify 10-15 acres in every constituency. On house sites, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that 1.69 lakh applications are pending and wanted the Collectors to complete the process within 90 days. Housing for the poor “In the first phase of Navaratnaulu - Pedalandariki Illu, our government is constructing 15.6 lakh houses and every house should have water and power. By April 10, all works relating to mapping, geo-tagging, registration of beneficiary in the AP Housing website and job cards should be complete. Every layout should have a model house and all construction material should be handed over to beneficiaries at subsidised rates,’’ he said. On Nadu-Nedu works, he said that the second phase will begin on April 15 and in the first phase, works were taken up in 15,715 schools. He also wanted the works to be audited by a third party agency. He wanted SOPs to be in place for Goru Mudda, toilet maintenance and regular maintenance. “We are also converting 55,607 anganwadi centres into English Medium schools,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lay-focus-on-job-scheme-works-chief-minister-tells-collectors/article34203173.ece

31 March 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP and YSRCP belied State’s hopes on SCS: Panabaka||A group of persons in the remote Vakadu village patiently waited to hear former Union Minister and TDP candidate for the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat Panabaka Lakshmi as her convey meandered through the dusty lanes at dusk. ‘Modi’s assurance’ After greeting them, mostly farmers, Ms. Lakshmi reminded them of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assurance in 2014 to accord Special Category Status (SCS) to the State for 15 years, a promise to which Lord Venkateswara Swamy was witness to. In the same breath, she recalled Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s promise in 2019 to force the Union Government to give the coveted SCS if his party was given an overwhelming majority of MP seats. “'What has happened to the promise of the YSRCP, which had won 22 Lok Sabha seats?” she asked them, when all of a sudden power supply went off. Switching on the headlights of her sports utility vehicle, Ms. Lakshmi, undeterred by the power-cut, went on with her barrage of questions to the electorate. When she asked whether they were getting minimum support price (MSP) for paddy, the gathering said a big “no.” She went on to explain them that the MSP, not just for paddy but for all major crops, would be thing of the past after the Centre enacted the three farm laws. The unprecedented price rise of all essential commodities was a result of the skyrocketing prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas, said the former Union Minister of State for Petroleum. Asking them to exercise their vote judiciously to teach a lesson to the BJP and the YSRCP, which she alleged had belied their hopes. “The YSRCP has on several occasions backed the anti-people policies of the BJP-led government at the Centre in Parliament,” she alleged, before moving to another village. In the midst of her campaign, she told The Hindu that fearing a defeat in the byelection, the YSRCP was resorting to ‘cheap tactics” such as cutting power supply to the villages she had been visiting as part of the campaign since Sunday. She said the YSCRCP had not expected the kind of overwhelming response that she was receiving. “Out of fear and frustration, power supply has been cut on two consecutive days during her visits to the villages in Gudur and Sullurpeta Assembly segments of the Tirupati LS constituency in Nellore district,” she alleged. Wondering why the YSRCP was creating hurdles for her if it was confident of winning the byelection on welfare poll plank, Ms. Lakshmi said, “Television channels are not allowed to telecast her poll campaign in some localities.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-and-ysrcp-belied-states-hopes-on-scs-panabaka/article34203177.ece

Narasimha Rao. “If elected, the BJP candidate will work for the welfare of ‘Janam’ (the people), but if the YSR Congress Party candidate is elected, he will tirelessly work for the welfare of ‘Jagan’ (meaning Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy),” he said. Speaking to the media here on Tuesday, he said the Tirupati constituency had witnessed phenomenal development with Central funds and challenged the YSRCP and the TDP to prove him wrong. Electronic clusters “It is only with the Central funds that the national institutes, railway tracks, national highways, seaport, industrial zones were developed, but the regional parties continued to blow their trumpet in their favour,” he charged. Citing ‘never before’ allocations, Mr. Narasimha Rao said of the 18 Electronic Manufacturing Clusters allocated across India, three were sanctioned to the Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency alone, located in Srikalahasti and Satyavedu segments. Similarly, the Tirupati and Nellore railway stations had been marked for beautification and development on a different plane, he said. Admitting that the party had failed to some extent in taking the message across to the public, Mr. Rao flayed the erstwhile TDP regime and the present YSRCP dispensation of staking claim over all the projects by trying to hide the Centre’s role. Indicating that the TDP charisma was on the wane, he remarked that the party’s recent foundation day looked like a mourning meet, with gloom writ large all over. He predicted that it would be the last elections for the TDP in the State, as it was moving towards ‘political extinction’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/byelection-will-be-fought-on-jagan-vs-janam-plank-gvl/article34203179.ece

But this is the first time that they got a chance to trek the holy seven hills,” she says. Raparthi Jagadish Babu of Sri Gurudev Charitable Trust was so kind that he even provided them saris as many were economically poor, adds her associate. The trust booked tickets and provided free travel, boarding and lodging for them. “We are going in that bus and waiting for the Swamiji to bless us,” she says pointing at one of the 25 buses lined up at the CV Reddi Charities premises here on Tuesday. Dhimsa dance The environs reverberated with the chants of Govinda nama as the Sarada Peetham Uttaradhikari Swatmanandendra arrived. The tribal women quickly encircled the junior pontiff even as the male members of the group took out their musical instruments such as manjiras and tambourine, and they started performing Dhimsa, a tribal dance. It was a combination of rhythmic movements, bhajan and music praising the deity. Integrating communities Mr. Swatmanandendra said that they were organising the Hindu Dharma Prachara Yatra with the aim of integrating the communities left behind into the mainstream.

Mr. Rao asked whether it was necessary for the people to give another MP to the YSRCP when all its MPs were not able to bring pressure on the Centre and ensure a a fair deal to A.P. The voters should question the YSRCP government for not protecting the interests of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, Kadapa steel plant, Dugarajapatnam port and Ramayapatnam port, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-mps-failed-to-deliver/article34203180.ece

All the Ward/Village Secretariats have now been roped in for the vaccination programme for the households in the ward limits from April 1. According to District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) P. Suryanarayana, each secretariat (sachivalayam) will get to organise vaccination programme once and they will be given a date. The secretariat staff needs to sensitise the 50 households regarding a day before the scheduled programme. In the meantime, they must gather the details of people above 45 years of age in their Ward, who are willing for the vaccination, and submit it to the Health Department officials. According to the instructions, the secretariat staff need to create three counters — spot registration, vaccination and certificate giving counter — to implement the programme. While in one room, vaccination will be conducted, in another room, the person will be asked to take rest for about 30 minutes. It was learnt that sachivalayams which do not have adequate space were asked to take up the programme in the nearest government buildings by creating space. District Immunisation Officer (DIO) Jeevan Rani said that the trial run was successfully conducted.

31 March 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Paediatric cataract must be treated early to prevent blindness, say experts||P. Janakamma, a farm worker, of Bangaruputtu village of G. Madugula mandal in the district, has to single-handedly support her three sons and two daughters. Her husband had deserted her and eloped with another woman. The poor woman’s travails did not end there. All her three sons have been affected by paediatric cataract. The delay in treatment of the problem has now made the boys almost losing their vision. They can barely see an object placed three feet in front of their eyes. The woman used to leave the boys at home and go out to work. During the school screening programme, organised by Sankar Foundation Eye Hospital, Naidu Thota, under Dr. YSR Arogyasri Scheme, in February, 2020, the three boys were screened and their vision was found to be very poor in both the eyes. The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lockdown that followed delayed shifting of the boys to the eye hospital in the city for treatment. Paediatric Ophthalmologist T. Suparna examined them and performed the cataract surgery in one eye for the 11-year-old boy, who is the oldest of the three siblings. The surgery for the other eye will be done after a week. The surgeries for the other two siblings are also being arranged. “Infection of the mother during pregnancy is a major cause of paediatric cataract in children. Hereditary causes and consanguineous marriages are other reasons. Cataract surgery has to be done within three months after birth to prevent blindness,” Dr. Suparna told The Hindu . “These boys are now aged 13, 12 and 8 years and the impulses to their brains are very less. Though total restoration of their eyesight is unlikely, there will definitely be an improvement in their vision after the surgery,” Dr. Suparna says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/paediatric-cataract-must-be-treated-early-to-prevent-blindness-say-experts/article34203304.ece

31 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Hope underpins recovery journey of the mentally ill||A significant part of their lives was spent within closed wards, waging a battle against mental illness and the feelings of despondency and despair. Although recovered now, the 30-odd women inmates of the Institute of Mental Health at Erragadda have nowhere to go. Many of them had been abandoned by their families — the stigma of mental illness is indelible — while some haven’t been able to remember their home address or do not have a living relative or home to return to. However, even amid the gloom, they are inching back into the society and the institute administration is making all-out efforts to ensure that they get to live with dignity. The authorities are helping the women get identity cards such as Aadhaar to apply for social security pension. Under the Telangana government scheme called Aasara, the beneficiaries can expect around Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000 per month. Givin g them confidence IMH Superintendent M. Uma Shankar said the money would help give the women much-needed confidence of financing basic expenses. There is also hope of the families that had deserted the women due to mental illness and cost of treatment would take them back since some of their expenses would be covered by the pension amount. So far, eight of the 30 women have received their Aadhaar card. Of them, one has resumed work as a teacher and another, who holds a master’s degree, is back at a private job. The latter is putting up at the ‘Sayodhya Home for Women In Need’ at Amberpet here. “We are trying to get the Aadhaar card for all the women who have recovered so that they will get monthly pension. We are coordinating with ‘Welfare of Disabled and Senior Citizens’ section to get them pension,” Dr Uma Shankar said. Medico social worker at IMH, R. Padma, who takes care of the inmates, has been struggling to help the women lead a normal life, on their terms. She said that the Telangana State Legal Services Authority played a crucial role in finding a shelter home for the women. “Having money gives them confidence and they can live by themselves,” said Ms Padma.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hope-underpins-recovery-journey-of-the-mentally-ill/article34203062.ece
31 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Veteran Jana Reddy faces two fresh entrants||Contestants from all the major political parties filed their nomination papers for Nagarjuna Sagar by-poll on Tuesday, the last day for filing. Former Minister and seven-time MLA K. Jana Reddy filed his papers as the Congress candidate while Nomula Bhagat, son of deceased MLA Nomula Narsimhaiah, filed the papers as the TRS candidate. BJP candidate Panugothu Ravi Kumar also filed his papers. Unlike the past, there were no big rallies or show of strength due to strict COVID protocols. However, TRS showed its strength with a host of leaders, including Power Minister G. Jagadish Reddy and several MLAs from the district, participating in the nomination process. Mr. Jana Reddy, a veteran in politics, will face two new entrants in the by-poll necessitated by the demise of Nomula Narsimhaiah due to ill-health. The contest is likely to be between the three major parties given the strong influence of personality and caste considerations. The TRS candidate belongs to the numerically strong Yadava community while Congress candidate is from the Reddy community that has been a dominant force in the combined Nalgonda district. BJP candidate Ravi Kumar comes from the Lambada community that has a presence of over 40,000 voters out of the total electorate of over two lakhs. The BJP that polled a poor 2,000 odd votes in the 2018 Assembly elections has since then increased its presence. A senior TRS leader confided that BJP will surely improve its vote share drastically and that would be a worry for both the Congress and TRS candidates. “Whom will it finally benefit in the results remains to be seen,” he said. Mr. Jana Reddy is depending on his ‘clean’ image apart from the sympathy factor that he lost in the 2018 elections. TRS, on the other hand, is completely dependent on Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s image and welfare schemes. It has identified that nearly 1.36 lakh voters are beneficiaries of government schemes in the constituency. By picking up a tribal candidate, BJP seems to be investing in future given its shortcomings like poor party structure. It is banking on first time voters who have been largely voting for the BJP in Telangana in the last few elections. Mr. Jana Reddy gave an impetus to the campaign with a well-attended public meeting in Halia and reeled out the development done by him as an MLA and Minister. He also challenged the ruling TRS that he would sit at home without campaigning and were they willing to do the same if they believed in the development done by them. “Let the voters decide,” he said. However, Mr. Jagadish Reddy ridiculed the offer and said Mr. Jana Reddy was afraid of campaigning as people would pose questions. “He was rejected in 2018 elections and has no right to face the elections now.” Polling will be held on April 17 and counting will take place on May 2, along with counting for elections in other states like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala and Assam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/veteran-jana-reddy-faces-two-fresh-entrants/article34203090.ece
31 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘What care was taken for Golconda Fort?’||Expressing dissatisfaction over the response of the State and the Central governments in preservation of Golconda Fort and Qutub Shahi tombs, Telangana High Court on Tuesday directed them to file detailed reports on the matter within two weeks. The HC also instructed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Director General and the Telangana Tourism Principal Secretary to appear before it during the next hearing. The directions were passed by a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy. The HC had taken up a newspaper article on the inadequate funds for preservation of Golconda Fort which got damaged during rains in September in 2020 as a PIL petition. The bench last year had issued notices to the Central and State governments on the matter and sought to know their respective action plans to protect the historical and world famous Golconda Fort. When the PIL petition came up for hearing on Tuesday, the bench headed by CJ Hima Kohli expressed concern over the preservation of the fort and the tombs, observing that the authorities did not seem to have a specific action plan for the purpose. Lot of tourists, some from abroad, visit the fort and the tombs. But the inadequate lighting arrangements at these places indicated that officials had not taken care to provide basic facilities to the visitors. In the nights, stray dogs were roaming in these areas. The bench sought to know from Assistant Solicitor General of India Namavarapu Rajeshwar Rao how the governments expected to attract tourists to the historical places in the backdrop of such poor conditions prevailing there. The bench noted that despite directions issued by it last year no respondent filed counter affidavit, barring the Golconda Fort superintendent. Even the superintendent had stated that parts of the wall of the fort developed cracks due to incessant rains last year and wrote to the higher-ups seeking funds for restoration of the fort. The bench instructed the Central and the State governments to file reports explaining what steps they were taking to protect the fort and the tombs and how many funds were allotted for the same. The plea was posted to April 15 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/what-care-was-taken-for-golconda-fort/article34203077.ece
31 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Making it easier to inch back||The initiative to help women who have recovered from mental illness get monthly pension from the government has been hailed by members of voluntary organisations that work for the welfare of women and those suffering from mental health problems. They offered a few suggestions for availing the pension without hassles, and to integrate the women into society so that they can make political and cultural choices. Ratnaboli Ray, founder of Anjali-Mental Health Rights Organization in Kolkata, said filling out forms, travelling and dealing with multiple offices can become overwhelming and even difficult for the women who have recovered from mental illness, especially in the absence of any support. Stating how the process of availing pension is operationalised, she said customised supporting mechanisms have to be provided to access the benefits. “Access can be help with transport, language or even help with filling up the forms. It is very important because many of them feel overwhelmed seeing the forms and need to understand the language. These are practical problems,” Ms Ray said. She also suggested that the government should take up the responsibility of making provisions to help out the women in such circumstances. Co-founder of The Banyan Academy of Leadership in Mental Health, Vandana Gopikumar said that people with disabilities in India are mainly confined to the dregs of society — the poorest in society. And the women in this context are even poorer. They experience income insecurity and are usually found working in the unorganised sector. Stating that the correlation between poverty and mental illness, poverty and distress has been established, Ms Vandana said people with mental health issues are by far poorer. Considering this, out of wage pensions is a positive feature. She suggested support in accessing work which ensures participation of women in society. Participation helps brings a sense of agency, and the ability to exercise choice in cultural, social and political decisions, she said, adding that social mixing also helps in self-reliance. Further, she pointed out that access to general health facilities for people with mental illness have to be made easier. Most people with mental illness have co-morbidities, and health services provided by the government are few and far between, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/making-it-easier-to-inch-back/article34203063.ece
31 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CSIR suggests coronavirus surveillance for Parliament||Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has mooted setting up sewage and air surveillance system in the Indian Parliament to find the prevalence of COVID-19 on Tuesday. Director General Shekhar C. Mande made a presentation to this effect to Vice-President and Chairman of Rajya Sabha M. Venkaiah Naidu in the presence of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) Director Rakesh Mishra, IICT Director S. Chandrasekhar, senior scientist Venkata Mohan and Atya Kapley of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Nagpur).  Dr. Mande informed the Vice-President that sewage surveillance provides qualitative as well as quantitative estimate of the number of people infected in a population and could be used to understand the progression of COVID-19 even when mass scale tests for individuals are not possible. It is a measure to comprehensively monitor the prevalence of the disease in communities in real time. Elaborating on the relevance of sewage surveillance, Dr. Mande pointed out that COVID-19 patients shed SAR-CoV- 2 in stools. Apart from symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people also shed the virus in their stools. Presenting data of the sewage surveillance carried out to find the trend of infection in Hyderabad, Prayagraj (Allahabad), Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Nagpur, Puducherry and Chennai, he said it provides an unbiased estimate of numbers since the sampling is not done at individual level. Indispensable tool On the other hand, the numbers obtained by regular testing depend on the number of individuals tested. Hence, sewage surveillance of COVID-19 would be relevant not only to understand the present epidemiology of the disease but would be an indispensable tool for early and easier detection of future COVID-19 outbreaks, the DG maintained. He also suggested setting up air sampling system to monitor viral particles and potential infectivity threat. The Vice-President complimented the scientists for their work and assured the delegation that he would discuss the issue with the Lok Sabha Speaker, Om Birla and also the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/csir-suggests-coronavirus-surveillance-for-parliament/article34203068.ece
31 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Haleem all set to make a comeback to Iftar menu||Haleem will be back on the menu in Hyderabad during this Ramzan. A year after their business plans were wrecked by COVID-induced lockdown, restaurateurs in the city are rolling up their sleeves to create the Hyderabad patented dish that has a geographical indication tag. “We may not have many franchisees as we used to, but we are definitely going to make the dish and sell them from all our locations. We are raising the sanitation game and are getting the staff tested for the SARS-CoV2 virus. We will keep them on the premises so that the risk of them catching the virus is lowered,” said M.A. Majeed of Hyderabad Haleem Makers’ Association. Outside Pista House restaurant in Shalibanda, workers were creating the earthen oven-like structure in which the thick meat-wheat-cereal stew topped with clarified butter is cooked for 12 hours before it is served to customers during Iftar. However, there have been no billboards put up by restaurants about the countdown to the first day of Ramzan when Haleem is served. “People missed Haleem last year. They have been calling and texting and asking for it at our restaurants. We are going ahead with normal plans for haleem at our facility in Gachibowli this time. We are cleaning up the place and will maintain high standards of hygiene,” said Mohammad Rabbani of Shah Ghouse Cafe, one of the bigger haleem makers in the city. ‘Boost to economy’ According to industry watchers, the haleem business is worth a few hundred crores in the city that happens within 30 days of the Islamic calendar month. “The meat comes from different parts of the country, including interior Telangana. The wheat comes from Punjab. We get the best spices from various parts of the country. Though Haleem is locally popular, it helps the economy nationally,” says Mr. Majeed. While the two big haleem makers were gung-ho about their business plans, the smaller restaurant owners were not so confident. “It looks like a gamble. We cannot invest a lot as the police can easily force us to shut down if a large number of people turn up. We haven’t even set up the oven which we used to do around Shab-e-Barat,” said a restaurant owner near Kalapathar. The Telangana government has promulgated GO M.S.no 69 with guidelines to control the spread of COVID-19 infections that are surging again. “Congregations pose considerable threat of rapid transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, it is decided that religious celebrations/observances should not be allowed in the state during upcoming religious events like Shab-e-Barat, Holi, Ugadi, Rama Navami, Mahavir Jayanti, Good Friday, Ramzan etc till April 30,” says the order. With the announcement of Ramzan likely to be announced in under a fortnight based on the sighting of the new moon, it remains to be seen how the Haleem gamble pays off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/haleem-all-set-to-make-a-comeback-to-iftar-menu/article34203071.ece
31 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Ryots need to understand marketing’||The increase in the extent of cultivation and sharp rise in production of a few major crops following implementation of supportive measures by the State government has not only brought joy but also fears as the marketing of such a huge quantity would always pose a major challenge, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy said. Speaking after a meeting with the officials of agriculture and marketing departments on procurement of yasangi (rabi) crops here on Tuesday, the Minister said it was the responsibility of the government to educate the farming community on market conditions and cropping patterns based on market research and analysis. To help the government on suggesting farmers about the market conditions and suggest the crops having demand in the national and international markets, they had appointed Ernst & Young, an agency having expertise in the area. Suggesting more changes in the cropping pattern in the State, the Minister asked farmers to further increase the cultivation of cotton, groundnut and red gram as the present pattern of growing crops could raise serious marketing problems in future. Besides, the Centre was also understood to be planning to shed some responsibilities related to agricultural marketing and procurement, he pointed out. He stated that cotton was cultivated in about 61 lakh acres in the 2020 kharif season following an advise by the government. It could be increased further as the quality of cotton produced in the State was top in the country. Similarly, red gram was also cultivated in a large extent (11 lakh acres) and the farmers got better price than the support price in the open market. He asked farmers to increase the cultivation of superfine varieties of paddy in kharif (vanakalam) season as the production of common grade paddy was much higher than the demand. Of the nearly 54 lakh acres of paddy grown, superfine varieties were taken up in about 20 lakh acres. On the storage capacity, the Minister said it was 65 lakh tonnes now and the government was planning construction of warehousing space for another 40 lakh tonnes with the cooperation of Central Warehousing Corporation. Paddy was cultivated in nearly 53 lakh acres this yasangi (rabi) season and the production was estimated to be 1.32 crore tonnes. As agreed, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) was expected to procure 80 lakh tonnes and another 20 lakh tonnes could be purchased by traders. Another 10 lakh tonnes each would be consumed by people and used as seed. The Minister suggested paddy farmers to get their produce by following the specifications on moisture and chaff content.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ryots-need-to-understand-marketing/article34203084.ece
31 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||BJP’s Anjaiah Yadav joins TRS||The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) scored a political point over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by attracting the latter’s ticket aspirant for the Nagarjuna Sagar by-poll, Kadari Anjaiah Yadav, into its fold. Mr. Anjaiah Yadav joined the TRS in the presence of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday after he was denied ticket by the BJP that chose a tribal candidate. Mr. Anjaiah Yadav contested the 2014 elections on TDP ticket and secured over 27,000 votes. With the TDP weakening after Telangana formation, he joined the BJP in 2019, and was the front-runner for the ticket in the by-poll. Huzurnagar MLA Saidi Reddy, and Deverakonda MLA Ravindra Naik were among the few who convinced Mr. Yadav to join the party assuring him a good political future. He was taken to the Chief Minister where he formally joined the party and assured that he would work for party candidate. Mr. Yadav’s defection is being seen as a moral jolt as well to the BJP that was planning to lure dissident TRS leaders into its fold in the constituency after Mr. Bhagat’s name was announced. However, TRS made the first move thus impacting the BJP’s plans, if it still has any, on defections. Sources said the BJP’s 2018 candidate Niveditha Reddy is also being lured by the TRS after she was denied the ticket. She had filed nomination a few days ago expecting the party nomination. It is said she is severely disappointed with the BJP leadership despite her work for strengthening the party in the constituency over the last two years. Her husband Sridhar Reddy is the party president of the combined Nalgonda district. Ms. Reddy is apparently sulking over the denial despite the fact that she contested in 2018 when the party had no hopes there and since has been investing time and financial resources to strengthen the party. The TRS has been focussing on luring the opposition leaders ever since the by-poll notification was announced. The MLAs have been campaigning in the constituency meeting influential leaders from village to constituency level. Some Congress leaders have already joined the party while several refused to do despite the best efforts of the MLAs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjps-anjaiah-yadav-joins-trs/article34203092.ece

31 March 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Ancient temple a sad case of irreverence towards heritage||The remnants of a 650-year-old Kakatiya-era temple have been turned into a haystack, a garbage dumpyard and truck parking bay in Suryapet town. Known to the locals as Rapollu Gullu, the machined pillars of the temple are still a sight but for the residents of the surrounding area, it is a potential site for encroachment. The result has been a continuous effort to build walls around it and one resident even built a grilled gate with his name on it. “It is sad that this rangamandapa supported by 48 pillars and having a pillared cloister (pradakshinapatha) representing the Kakatiya and post-Kakatiya temple architecture has been left to ruin. The pillars cover an area of 50x100 feet while the superstructure of the sanctum sanctorum is missing,” said E. Sivanagireddy, an archaeologist. According to him, the Vaishnavite temple was built in two stages. “The rangamandapa, which is still intact, shows a style that evolved during Rudramma Devi’s period and can be dateable to the 13th century. The collapsed portions show that it was built during 16th century, perhaps during Krishnadevaraya’s period,” says Mr. Sivanagireddy. He stressed the need to preserve the past. “My goal is that the temple could be made presentable to tourists by clearing away the debris and restoring the architectural members, including the dilapidated portion, under the guidance of heritage conservation experts,” said Mr. Sivanagireddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ancient-temple-a-sad-case-of-irreverence-towards-heritage/article34203073.ece

31 March 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Family businesses empowered response to COVID’||The unique structure of family businesses empowered them to respond to the impact of COVID-19, according to a global study report to which the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise at the Indian School of Business contributed. The study report of the STEP (Successful Transgenerational Entrepreneurship Practices) Project Global Consortium and KPMG Private Enterprise found that the involvement of the family and their long-term mindset enabled the businesses to demonstrate resilience in the face of the pandemic. This approach also placed them in a key role to lead the economic recovery. A release from ISB said Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise was the only member from India that conducted the survey in the country. On the Indian context, Associate Director at the Centre Nupur Pavan Bang said “lower percent of companies in India (29%) took actions to reduce/eliminate labour costs when compared to the global average of 36%.” The emphasis on cost reduction through cutting operating costs, cutting down on investments, restructuring, deferring payments and expenses as well as reducing the top management team's compensation was more in the country compared to family firms globally. The report ‘Mastering a comeback: How family businesses are triumphing over COVID-19’ consists of insights from nearly 2,500 family businesses and over 500 non-family businesses across 75 countries, the release said. Highlighting social responsibility, business transformation and the patience exercised by family businesses, the report said multiple generations working together accelerated business transformation. “Families were able to draw on support from multiple generations, leveraging the past experiences of older generations to help manage critical challenges and utilising the insights of younger members to drive modernisation,” it said. The size, scale and age of the business also contributed to how businesses chose to respond to COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/family-businesses-empowered-response-to-covid/article34203097.ece

Mr. Sravan along with OUJAC leader Dayakar visited NIMS on Tuesday to console the unemployed youth, Sunil, who attempted suicide and currently undergoing treatment at NIMS. Later, he spoke to the media and lamented that it will surely become a government’s murder, if unfortunately Sunil is dead.

He lamented that ruling from Pragathi Bhavan turned a curse to Telangana and killing the spirit of late Prof. Jaya Shankar sir. “They are in a notion that it is fine if Rythu Bandhu and pensions are implemented and nothing else is there to do in the State,” he criticised.

The collectors were also asked to set up sufficient number of paddy procurement centres at the village level. The government has decided to set up paddy procurement centres in view of the rising COVID cases to ensure farmers were not put to inconvenience in moving their produce to market yards. Collectors and Panchayat Raj department officials received appreciation for their efforts in successful construction of Rythu Vedikas through NREGS. Rythu Vedikas, conceived as platforms for farmers to exchange ideas and learn best practices, turned out to be visible and durable assets in villages. Collectors should plan modalities for distribution of six saplings to each household forthwith and special officers concerned should undertake field visits to ensure their survival.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cs-for-strict-enforcement-of-covid-protocols/article34203088.ece

31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Schools to focus on holistic development||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said that the Delhi Board of School Education will bring in the next generation reforms in education and changes in the evaluation process, which will move away from rote learning and encourage a holistic development of a student. Mr. Sisodia who is the president of the Board conducted its first meeting after it was registered under the Society Registration Act, 1860. The meeting was attended by the nominated and ex-officio members of the Board. The government plans to rollout the new Board in select schools from the academic session 2021-2022. Continue the good work He said that the Board aims to continue the work done in the last six years that has changed the perception of government schools in the country. Mr. Sisodia said that the purpose of the Delhi Board of School Education is to move towards giving a holistic picture of each learner, which goes beyond scholastic ability in subjects to include values and skills required in the future such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. “It will emphasise on continuous formative assessments. The main aim of setting up the board is that the assessment system should become a partner of learning and not an authority of testing”. He added that the government wants to encourage a growth mindset among students, which would be strengthened by making it part of regular assessment. “We have to ensure that our children are not only efficient in their subjects but are also deeply connected to their family, society and nation. On the one hand, our goal is that the learner is able to use the knowledge for the purpose of profession/ industry for livelihood, but on the other hand we must ensure that the learner is ready to use his/her knowledge and skills to contribute to the development of his/her family, society and the nation at large with full responsibility,” Mr. Sisodia said. Different curricula Speaking about the growth mindset, he said that after introduction of curricula such as happiness curriculum, entrepreneurship mindset curriculum and Deshbhakti curriculum that help in the building of healthy mindsets in our learners, it becomes important that assessment methods change. “At the end of formal education, just as we ensure knowledge of information and facts, we should also be able to say with certainty that the learner has developed a growth mindset and a problem-solving approach,” he said. Teachers’ feedback The Board, he said will also empower teachers to achieve their full potential by giving them timely feedback on specific actions they take to help every child. It will also use modern technology to ensure a personalised learning experience for students. “Artificial intelligence, game-based assessments will be put to use to create a system where every student is regularly evaluated on the basis of his/her strengths and enters the next phase of their life with a deep understanding of their unique strengths,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/schools-to-focus-on-holistic-development/article34202793.ece

The report by IQ Air stated that the Capital had dropped down to the 10th spot among the most polluted cities in the world. On the other hand, CSE said Delhi’s PM2.5 has decreased at the rate of 25% between 2018 and 2020. The Minister said it was mentioned in the CSE’s report that Delhi was the first State in India to have shut down power plants, which emit harmful gases. It is further stated that Delhi is the first State to have 39 Air Quality Monitoring Systems, he added. “The report also stated that Delhi is the first State to have initiated 13 hotspots, which initiate measures at the micro-level to curb pollution right from dust particles to expansion of the green-belt; the first State to have provided PNG Gas at subsidised rates to its industrial sector,” he added. “According to report IQ Air, among the world’s most polluted cities, Delhi has dropped down to the 10th position. Among the top 10 of this report are seven of Uttar Pradesh’s cities and States, including Lucknow, Kanpur, Noida, and Bulandshahr. The report also reveals that Delhi’s pollution has decreased by 15%,” he said. He said Delhi launched the EV policy to help curb pollution. That the city provides 24x7 electricity to its citizens had also been a helpful measure in controlling pollution. Power cuts, he said, meant that the industries were operating with diesel-oriented generators which were extremely detrimental for pollution. With 24-hour electricity, this had been avoided extensively. The government’s efforts in expanding its green belt have been successful, a report on which the government will be publishing very soon, Mr. Rai said, adding: “Delhi is the first State to have launched the Tree Transplantation Policy, which is inclusive of afforestation measures. Moreover, we have made a policy in which 80% of the plants will be transplanted.” “Neighbouring States play a major role in curtailing pollution in Delhi. If Ghaziabad has a high pollution rate, Delhi will inevitably suffer. Hence, I request the Centre to analyze these two reports and make efforts,” he also said. Mr. Rai on Tuesday also said strict action will be taken against the East Delhi Municipal Corporation for not taking steps to prevent fire at the Ghazipur landfill site. A section of the landfill had caught fire on Sunday, worsening pollution levels in the area, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/measures-to-curb-pollution-have-been-successful-says-gopal-rai/article34202691.ece
31 March 2021||New Delhi,||Set up board to look into plea on abortion, says HC||The Delhi High Court has directed the All India Institute Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to constitute a medical board to examine a woman who wanted medical termination of her 24-week pregnancy as her foetus is suffering from facial haemorrhage and hydrocephalus. Justice Navin Chawla asked the Medical Superintendent of AIIMS here to appoint a Board of Doctors to examine the woman and give a report on the advisability of her undergoing medical termination of pregnancy. In India, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act stipulates a ceiling of 20 weeks for termination of pregnancy beyond which abortion of foetus is statutorily impermissible. The woman in her plea stated that she is in the 24th week of her pregnancy and during medical examinations, it has been reported that the foetus is suffering from facial haemorrhage and hydrocephalus. The plea has also challenged the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the MTP Act. The plea argued that the provision providing for the 20-week ceiling may have been reasonable when the section was enacted in 1971 but has ceased to be reasonable today where technology has advanced and it is perfectly safe for a woman to abort at any point during the entire period of pregnancy. It also contended that determination of foetal abnormality in many cases can only be done after the 20th week and by keeping the ceiling artificially low, women who obtain reports of serious foetal abnormalityhave to suffer excruciating pain and agony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/set-up-board-to-look-into-plea-on-abortion-says-hc/article34202686.ece
31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Look into plea seeking ban on single-use plastic’||Following a plea seeking implementation of the ban on sale of single-use plastic, by stopping inter-State transport of such material between Delhi and Noida, the National Green Tribunal directed the Noida Authority and State Pollution Control Board to look into the plea and take action. A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A.K. Goel said, “While adverse effect of single-use plastic is well acknowledged and once law has been enacted to address such concern, implementation needs to be ensured. However, this is primarily governance issue.” The panel noted that it was primarily an adjudicatory body with powers to issue directions for protection of environment, following principles of natural justice, general directions for enforcement of law which is to be implemented. Stating that the plea did not include specific violators, it said, “... only a formal order can be passed that the Noida Authority and the State Pollution Control Board may look into the grievance of the application as per law.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/look-into-plea-seeking-ban-on-single-use-plastic/article34202687.ece
31 March 2021||New Delhi,||Kejriwal hell-bent on pushing youth of Delhi into alcoholism, claims Gupta||The BJP on Tuesday sought to vehemently criticise the new excise policy proposed by the Delhi government in addition to issuing a warning that the party would not allow Delhi to become “the Capital of alcohol”. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the new policy was only meant to increasing the “political funding of AAP and that of the government”. “In one go, the State government has raised commission on liquor to 10% and this way they have ensured the party gets Rs. 1,000 crore fund in its coffers. At present, there are 639 liquor shops in the Capital that they propose to increase to 850 so to have three such shops in every ward,” Mr. Gupta said. “The Kejriwal government seems to be hell-bent on drowning the youngsters of Delhi into alcoholism and the BJP will oppose it and not allow any new shop to come up,” he added. Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri warned that the BJP would gherao offices of both the Delhi government as well as the Lieutenant Governor if the new excise policy is not withdrawn. “In order to ensure that people get quality liquor there used to be testing and checking by a government agency but now this will go to private hands. In other words, the same people owning these liquor vends will now certify the quality of their own product,” he added. AAP reacts Commenting on the issue, AAP said: “BJP leaders are spearheading the liquor mafia. They are millionaires because of nothing but their involvement in the alcohol business. They know that the recently initiated excise policy will destroy their business, and hence they are fretting upon it against our initiatives. The new policy will act as a deterrent for illicit liquor operations. As under the new policy, no new stores will be opened up, but will allow the improvement of existing shops. This is how the illicit liquor business will come to an end.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/kejriwal-hell-bent-on-pushing-youth-of-delhi-into-alcoholism-claims-gupta/article34202693.ece
31 March 2021||New Delhi,||Plea seeking to stall transfer dismissed||The Delhi High Court has rejected a plea by an Indo-Tibetian Border Police (ITBP) constable seeking to stall his transfer to Ladakh on the ground that his wife was suffering from depression and was a threat to their infant son. A Bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Asha Menon took note of the report of a medical board, which showed that the constable’s wife “is leading a normal healthy life”. The court said there was no doubt that just to stall his transfer, the petitioner had gone to the extent of contending that his wife was suffering from postpartum depression and “is a threat to her infant son”. “The petitioner is directed to join his new place of posting as expeditiously as possible but not later than one week,” the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-seeking-to-stall-transfer-dismissed/article34202685.ece

The district police said the children, all aged between three and six years, were playing in a thatched hut filled with husk. Their family members were harvesting wheat crops in the fields at Kawaiyya village under Palashi police station of Chahatpur panchayat in Araria district. The charred bodies of Mohd. Ashraf, Ali Hassan, Khus Nihar, Dilwar, Gulnaz and Burkas Ali were recovered from the spot and sent for post-mortem by the police. It is unclear how the fire broke out. The villagers told local media persons that eight children were playing in the house. They rushed to the spot to douse the fire, but could not rescue the children.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/six-children-burnt-to-death-in-bihars-araria/article34203045.ece
31 March 2021||SILCHAR/GUWAHATI,||2 mills deepen divide in poll-bound Assam||Two papers mills of the Hindustan Paper Corporation (HPC) had once united Assam’s culturally disparate Brahmaputra and Barak Valleys industrially. The unity continued in the death of these mills since 2017, but Mandate 2021 appears to have deepened the divide between the valleys. The Nagaon Paper Mill, about 70 km east of Guwahati and the Cachar Paper Mill, about 30 km from Barak Valley’s main town Silchar, were not just two of Asia’s largest paper plants. They were the fulcrums around which two towns — Jagiroad in Morigaon district and Panchgram in Hailakandi district — grew and prospered. Jagiroad has been more fortunate because of connectivity; it reaps other benefits of being located on Asian Highway 1. Panchgram has been reduced almost to a ghost town. But the 2,400 employees of both have been suffering equally without pay since January 2017 (Cachar Mill) and March 2017 (Nagaon Mill). So have some 4 lakh people who have been directly and indirectly been dependent on the two mills. More than 80 employees have died too, many of them without money for treatment, some due to starvation. The Joint Action Committee of Recognised Unions (JACRU) of the two mills have been unhappy with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP for failing to live up to their 2016 promise — to infuse fresh life into the two mills. “Contrary to the PM’s call for atmanirbhar, India has been importing paper from China, Indonesia, Bangladesh at high prices. If that were not enough, the government siphoned off Rs. 4,141-crore from 2014-2018 meant for the mills besides Rs. 107 crore of the employees’ provident fund money,” JAKRU president Manobendra Chakraborty told The Hindu.   ‘Didn’t spare the dying’ What has angered the employees of the Cachar Mill is the BJP’s manifesto promising to revive only the Nagaon Mill and clear the arrears of the employees there. “They have not even spared the dying employees of two sick mills by playing on the divide between the two valleys,” he said. The Nagaon Mill employees are not amused too. “The Nagaon and Cachar mills were commissioned in 1985 and 1988 and prospered together. We will not let one unit be revived and the other killed, although we know the BJP does not mean to help the Nagaon Mill,” JACRU’s Nagaon Mill leader Ananda Bordoloi said. The BJP’s Algapur candidate Moon Swarnakar has vowed to fight for the Cachar Mill’s revival if voted. The JACRU says the promise to wrest the seat from the All India United Democratic Front’s Nijam Uddin Choudhury sounds hollow. The BJP’s Jagiroad MLA Pijush Hazarika has also promised the Nagaon Mill’s revival to keep Congress rival Swapan Kumar Mandal at bay. Both constituencies go to the polls in the second phase on April 1.  Letter to Rahul On March 30, the JACRU leaders sent a letter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi pledging their support to the Mahajot or grand alliance, whose constituents include three Left Front parties. The reason: the Kerala government’s step to run the Kottayam Paper Mill of Hindustan Newsprint Limited, a subsidiary of HPC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/2-mills-deepen-divide-in-poll-bound-assam/article34202701.ece

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||China cuts Hong Kong’s elected seats||China’s legislature on Tuesday formally approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system that will see a sharply reduced share of directly elected representatives and a tightening of Beijing’s control in the Special Administrative Region (SAR). The changes, first announced earlier this month at the annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing, were on Tuesday passed by the 167 members of the NPC Standing Committee. President Xi Jinping signed orders to promulgate the amended annexes to Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the constitution that has governed the SAR under the “one country, two systems” model since its return to China in 1997, official media reported. Sweeping change The amendments mark the biggest changes to Hong Kong’s political system since the handover, and reduce the share of directly elected representatives in its Legislative Council (LegCo). While previously 35 of its 70 members were directly elected, that number has been reduced by 15. Now, Hongkongers will only be able to directly vote for 20 representatives while the size of LegCo has been expanded to 90, thereby drastically reducing the share of elected representatives. The 70 others will be broadly chosen from pro-establishment bodies. A 1,200-member Election Committee that chooses Hong Kong’s Chief Executive has been expanded by 300 members, and will include Hong Kong’s representative to the NPC, the Communist Party-controlled legislature in Beijing. It will also choose 40 members of LegCo, while the remaining 30 will be chosen by what are called functional constituencies, representing a range of industry, trade and other interest groups. The other big change is the setting up of a Candidate Eligibility Review Committee “for reviewing and confirming the eligibility of candidates” and a “Committee for Safeguarding National Security” that “will make findings as to whether a candidate for Election Committee member or for the office of Chief Executive meets the legal requirements”. There will be no scope for legally challenging the findings. District councillors, who are directly elected, will no longer have a place either in the Election Committee or in LegCo. In 2019, the pro-democracy opposition swept district elections in Hong Kong, following which they controlled 90% of the seats. Now, the district councillors will only be involved with local-level civic issues without representation in government. Erosion of autonomy Pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong have seen the political changes, as well as last year’s national security law that punishes “subversion” as the most significant changes in the “one country, two systems” model and as dramatically eroding the autonomy enjoyed by the SAR previously. The changes have also all but ended any prospect of realising the demands of the 2019 protest movement for universal suffrage and direct elections to choose the Chief Executive. The 2019 protests were seen by Beijing as a direct challenge to its authority. Zhang Yong, deputy head of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee, told the official Xinhua news agency the changes, including for a candidate review committee, were “to ensure ‘patriots administering Hong Kong' and prevent anti-China, destabilising elements from entering the body of power of the HKSAR.” “It fixes the loopholes in the electoral system and ensures patriots administer Hong Kong,” he said. "Whoever elected to administer must be patriots. This is a fundamental premise of any political system and electoral system in any country and region.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-cuts-hong-kongs-elected-seats/article34202388.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Hefazat-e-Islam, the group behind Bangladesh protests||At least 11 people were killed in Bangladesh over the weekend as protesters clashes with police during demonstrations called by Islamist groups against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Dhaka visit. Mr. Modi was in Bangladesh to attend the country’s Golden Jubilee celebrations of independence. The main group behind the violent protests was Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh that had in the past clashed with the Awami League government. Roots of Hefazat Hefazat-e-Islam, literally ‘protector of Islam’, was formed in 2010 when the country was taking gradual measures to undo the Islamisation of its polity by the military rulers in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 2008, the military-backed caretaker government had proposed the Draft National Women’s Development Policy Bill, promising equal rights to women in property. In the December 2008 election, the secular Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina was brought to power. The secualrists had demanded repealing the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which had made sweeping changes to the country’s original Constitution during the years of military rule (Later in the year the Supreme Court ruled the amendment was illegal). The Islamist groups saw these developments as a threat to their core interests, and came together on one platform to form Hefazat-e-Islam. In February 2010, Hefazat called a demonstration in Chittagong against the Women’s Bill and the bid to cancel the Fifth Amendment. They clashed with police, injuring over a dozen, and announcing the arrival of a new Islamist group in Bangladesh. What do they want? Headquartered in Chittagong, Hefazat is a platform of the Sunni clerics of the country’s vast Quami madrassa network and their students. If in 2010, they demonstrated their street power by staging the anti-Women’s Bill protests, in 2013, they would expand their demands to a 13-point agenda. Their demands included enactment of an anti-blasphemy law with provision for death penalty, cancellation of the women’s development law, a ban on erecting statues in public places, a ban on mixing man and woman in public and declaration of Bangladesh’s Ahmadiyas, a persecuted minority in Islam, as “non-Muslims”. The Awami League government initially ignored the protests. But Hefazat members organised many marches to the capital to push for their demands. When the pressure mounted, the government acted swiftly. In the early hours of May 6, 2013, security forces launched a crackdown on Hefazat activists to oust them from Dhaka. At least 11 people were estimated to have been killed. Pressure group Since the failed “Dhaka siege”, Hefazat was careful not to run into a direct showdown with the government. But it remained an important hardline voice that often put pressure on the government with its Islamist agenda. For example, when the Fifth Amendment was repealed, the government restored secularism and some other articles of the original Constitution but Islam continued to remain the state religion. The government had also made changes in school texts under pressure from Hefazat and other Islamists. In 2017, giving in to Hefazat’s demands, the government removed the statue of the Greek Goddess Themis from the premises of the Supreme Court. In 2018, the Hasina government passed a Bill recognising Dawra–e–Hadith, a top degree of Hefazat-controlled Quami madrassas, as equivalent to a Master’s degree in Islamic studies and Arabic. Ms. Hasina’s government may have found Hefazat a lesser problem than Jamaat e Islami, the militant religious party. The government did not give in to Hefazat’s key demands that would alter the secular character of the state, but offered small concessions to the group to avoid trouble. These concessions, however, appeared to have made them stronger over the years. And the protests they carried out against the visit of the Indian Prime Minister, at a time when both countries are trying to deepen ties, pose a new challenge to both Dhaka and New Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hefazat-e-islam-the-group-behind-bangladesh-protests/article34202379.ece
31 March 2021||Pemba,||IS attack survivors stranded around Mozambique town||Thousands of Palma residents remained stranded on Tuesday, hiding around the besieged northern Mozambique town and scrambling to escape the area overrun by violent jihadist militants last week, sources said. Insurgents affiliated with the Islamic State group (IS) launched a raid on the coastal town last Wednesday, ransacking buildings and murdering and beheading civilians. Dozens have been killed in what witnesses describe as a coordinated attack, just 10 km from a multi-billion dollar gas project led by France’s Total. Shaken survivors have since streamed into the neighbouring town of Mueda and regional capital Pemba. But sources told AFP thousands were still wandering around Palma, desperate to find refuge. Total ferries 1,400 Some trudged days through surrounding forest, walking west towards Mueda and north to reach the Tanzanian border. Hundreds more travelled to the Afungi peninsula, the site of the gas exploration project, where they gathered outside Total’s fortified complex, UN workers said. Total ferried around 1,400 people, including both gas and government workers, to Pemba on Sunday, but has since been accused of turning its back on desperate residents. Only a few dozen other survivors have reached the regional capital, mainly on small fishing boats, raising concern among humanitarians on the ground. “That’s very little compared to the thousands that are reported stranded in Palma,” said one aid worker who did not wish to be named. “We are worried that so far very few are coming,” she said, adding that 5,000 escapees had reportedly assembled close to a lighthouse on the peninsula. “Those are probably not the only ones,” she added. Total said it has organised “emergency support”, including food and water, for people arriving at its site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-attack-survivors-stranded-around-mozambique-town/article34202382.ece
31 March 2021||COLOMBO,||Presidents Xi, Gotabaya speak over phone, reaffirm ties||In his first officially publicised telephonic conversation with a world leader following the UN Human Rights Council’s adoption of a resolution on Sri Lanka last week, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Monday spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping, a statement from his office said. “The Chinese President stated that the government of China will continue to support in achieving sustainable development goals of Sri Lanka and will stand firm with Sri Lanka in the face of the unjust pressure it faces in the multilateral arena,” the statement issued by the Presidential Media Division said on Tuesday, a week after China, along with 10 other member countries, voted against the resolution, backing Sri Lanka. Mega infra projects China’s official Xinhua news agency reported that President Xi suggested that the two countries “steadily push forward” the billions-worth, mega infrastructure projects such as the Colombo Port City, being built reclaimed land by the seafront in the capital, and the southern Hambantota Port, and “promote high-quality collaboration” in jointly building the Belt and Road. “Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, China and Sri Lanka have pulled together and helped each other, writing a new chapter of China-Sri Lanka friendship,” President Xi said. Assuring Sri Lanka of “as much assistance as China’s capacity allows”, in the fight against COVID-19, the Chinese President suggested that the two sides seek to “gradually carry out cooperation” in fields such as aviation and education, while “continuously exploring” new channels and areas of collaboration. Earlier this month, Sri Lanka said Beijing had approved a 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion) currency swap, a move aimed to boost the island nation’s dwindling foreign reserves. AIIB loan Further, the Beijing-headquartered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) cleared Sri Lanka’s request for a $180 million loan. Last year, China sanctioned an emergency $500 million loan to Sri Lanka to cope with the economic impact of the pandemic. So far, Sri Lanka owes China over $5 billion in loans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/presidents-xi-gotabaya-speak-over-phone-reaffirm-ties/article34202389.ece

Leaders from 25 countries, the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO) sought to get the ground rules down in writing to streamline and speed up the reaction to future global outbreaks. The treaty would aim to ensure that information, virus pathogens, technology to tackle the pandemic and products such as vaccines are shared swiftly and equitably among nations. “The time to act is now. The world cannot afford to wait until the pandemic is over to start planning for the next one,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference. Without an internationally-coordinated pandemic response plan, “we remain vulnerable”, he warned.

The promise came a day after the refloating of the giant container vessel MV Ever Given , which hit the eastern bank of the narrow shipping lane last Tuesday and became wedged diagonally across its span for nearly a week. “We will acquire all the necessary equipment for the canal,” to avoid similar incidents, Mr. Sisi declared during his visit to Ismailia, home to the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). Egyptian authorities have presented the freeing of the mega-ship on Monday as a vindication of the country’s engineeringcapabilities. Mr. Sisi claimed “success” in the operation after the stern was freed, several hours before the bow of the ship was finally dislodged. Traffic on the canal, a conduit for over 10% of world trade, began moving again on Monday evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sisi-promises-funding-to-avoid-suez-closure-repeat/article34202381.ece
31 March 2021||Yangon,||Myanmar crackdown death toll crosses 500||The death toll in the Myanmar military’s crackdown on protesters has passed 500, as armed rebel groups on Tuesday threatened the junta with retaliation if the bloodshed does not stop. World powers have ramped up their condemnation of the military’s campaign against the anti-coup movement that is demanding the restoration of the elected government and the release of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Washington suspended a trade pact with Myanmar and UN chief Antonio Guterres called for a united global front to pressure the junta after more than 100 protesters were killed in a bloody weekend. Adding to that pressure campaign, a trio of ethnic rebel groups on Tuesday condemned the crackdown and threatened to fight alongside protesters unless the military reined in its violence. Daily rallies across Myanmar by unarmed demonstrators have been met with tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said it had confirmed a total of 510 civilian deaths but warned the true toll was probably significantly higher. On Tuesday, protesters in Yangon emptied rubbish bags in the streets as part of the latest action, while in the town of Muse in Shan state a 35-year-old protester was shot dead. There was also another fatality at Myitkyina, Kachin State, rescue workers confirmed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/myanmar-crackdown-death-toll-crosses-500/article34202383.ece

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||India does not shine when only some gleam||Several lucky Indians have taken their vaccine shots and flown abroad. With relief, they are getting back to their own normal lives. A year ago, all Indians were startled to be locked in. And shocked too that millions had to break out of the Lakshman Rekha for shelter, food, and even water to drink. The novel coronavirus pandemic had exposed the precariousness of their lives. Relief was rushed for them, and vows taken that when the pandemic passes, we must “build back better”, and create a new, more resilient, and more just economy. Global indices In the country’s march to a $5 trillion economy, the Indian government and its advisers are keen to recover the many lost quarters of GDP growth. Have they lost sight of how poorly India’s economic growth has been serving its citizens? A Union Minister pooh-poohed the Global Hunger Index which places India 94 amongst 107 countries (https://bit.ly/2Pil6NO). International observers are wrong, he said, because Indians are very kind people, who even give sweets to a dog when she delivers her puppies, and such kind people would never ever allow a human being to go hungry. The WHR20 Happiness Report released in March 2021 (https://bit.ly/3u6N6ml) by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network compares citizens’ own perceptions of their well-being in 153  countries. According to the report, Indian citizens are amongst the least happy in the world: India ranks a very low 144th. Perhaps the Minister will say that Indian citizens themselves do not know what is happening in India. Inequities have widened Like aerodynamic stress-tests reveal structural weaknesses in the designs of aircraft, the pandemic has revealed structural flaws in countries’ economies. According to a report released by the World Bank, while India’s stock markets rose during the pandemic and the very rich became even richer, the number of people who are poor in India (with incomes of $2 or less a day) is estimated to have increased by 75 million. This accounts for nearly 60% of the global increase in poverty, the report says. While the rich are beginning to buzz around their global world again, a new architecture of economic growth is required to create better lives for the majority in India. The old global economy was very good for migrant capital, which could move around the world at will, its life made easier by countries vying to attract foreign capital, even bending their environmental and labour regulations to make it easier to do business. The pandemic has revealed that the old economy was not good for migrant workers, however. Their “ease of living” was often sacrificed for capital’s “ease of doing business”. The Indian economy must grow to create more incomes for its billion-plus citizens. Until the incomes of all rise, India will be a poor country from the perspective of the majority of its citizens, no matter how large its GDP. Moreover, economic growth must no longer be at the cost of the environment. According to global assessments, India ranks 120 out of 122 countries in water quality, and 179 out of 180 in air quality. Think of new frameworks India urgently needs a new strategy for growth, founded on new pillars. One is broader progress measures. GDP does not account for vital environmental and social conditions that contribute to human well-being and the sustainability of the planet. These factors are ignored as externalities by economists; they are trampled upon in a rush to grow the economy. Several frameworks are being developed now to measure what really matters including the health of the environment, and the condition of societies (public services, equal access to opportunities, etc.). Most of these frameworks seek to define universally applicable scorecards. The items measured are given the same weightages in all countries to arrive at a single overall number for each country. This ‘scientific’ approach does enable objective rankings of countries. However, as the Happiness Report explains, this ‘objective’ approach misses the point that happiness and well-being are always ‘subjective’. What matters to people depends also on the conditions of others around them. Wealthy people can be unhappy when they have less wealth than other wealthy people. Moreover, everywhere, fairness, and trust in others and in institutions, contribute greatly to well-being. Therefore, countries in which the spirit of community is high, such as the ‘socialist’ countries of Northern Europe, come on top of well-being rankings even when their per capita incomes are not the highest. The analysis of sources of well-being leads to the conclusion that the universal solution for improving well-being is for local communities to work together to find their own solutions within their countries, and in their villages and towns. Leo Tolstoy begins Anna Karenina with the observation that all unhappy families are unhappy in their own ways. Locals know which factors in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals matter the most to them. Therefore, standard global solutions will neither make their conditions better nor make them happier. Lapsing to the old ways New ways must be adopted to create a new post-pandemic normal. Sadly, the old ways are returning. The government is back to chasing its $5 trillion GDP target. Wealth creators (large companies and wealthy individuals) are being touted as the solution for growth. Power is being centralised. Governance of the many by a few politically and economically powerful persons may work for a few, stroke-of-the-pen, bold reforms. However, like insufficiently tested vaccines and medicines, the side-effects of these bold solutions can cause great harm to the overall health of the system. The best medical treatments are those that help the system to heal itself. Therefore, communities must be allowed to, and assisted to, find their own solutions to complex problems. What India and the world need to create a better world, post-pandemic, is a vaccine against indifference to the conditions of those less well off. The backwardness of backward classes is their god-given lot according to the religion of India’s majority. The purpose of their lives is to do the dirty work necessary to keep the upper castes clean. The philosopher Michael J. Sandel says in The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good? that the ideology of ‘individualism’ — which believes that a person’s successes and failures are entirely that person’s own responsibility — is a disease that has infected societies in the West. It justifies indifference to the conditions of those less well off. It denies that societal conditions are responsible for the difficulties poor people have. It also conveniently hides that societal conditions have contributed substantially to the wealth of those well-off. When only some shine, India does not shine. The government of India has begun a massive “India@75” campaign to celebrate, in 2022, the 75th anniversary of India’s independence. What is the scorecard of progress against which it will report whether India has reached the ‘tryst with destiny’ that it set out to achieve in 1947? The size of its GDP, the numbers of billionaires, the numbers of Indian multinationals, and the reach of its rockets in space? Or the condition of our holy Mother Earth ravaged by economic progress, and the conditions of hundreds of millions of citizens left behind?

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Of police and political quagmires||What is currently happening in the Mumbai Police, a premier force with a manpower of around 50,000, cannot be brushed off as it raises questions about the very integrity of the police force. On March 17, a duly appointed Commissioner of Police, Param Bir Singh, was shifted from his prestigious post after a tenure of just 13 months, though he was to serve a mandated two years. The move was seemingly for reasons other than incompetence or misconduct, but government sources cite mishandling of the Ambani explosives case by him, as a retaliation against Mr. Singh, who had gone to town with many charges against the State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. An enraged Mr. Singh approached the Supreme Court seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Mr. Deshmukh and getting the transfer order quashed. The court, however, declined to intervene and asked him to go to the Bombay High Court. Extraordinary situation Why has this chain of events received such adverse publicity nationally? Perhaps because the dimensions of the incident are too large to ignore, both by the government and the public. What also makes it different from other murky episodes in the past is that a senior officer chose to rattle the establishment. We do not yet know enough about Mr. Singh’s reputation or his motive. Whatever be the case, it is likely that he received support from the Opposition in Maharashtra to carry the struggle into higher forums. Even if he had been provided a plan charted out by the adversaries of the present State government, it required extraordinary fibre to go against the government. Some may look upon his conduct as unpardonable indiscipline; others could endorse it on the ground that an “unethical” government deserved such treatment. Coming down to brass tacks, it has been alleged that the State Home Minister had fixed up a quota for the police to collect money from restaurants and similar joints. Apart from this, Mr. Singh accused the Minister of systematic interference in day-to-day police administration, especially in postings of lower functionaries. The Minister is also said to have supported an infamous low-ranked police officer, Sachin Vaze, who has now been arrested in the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case. Mr. Vaze had been under suspension for over a decade, which was revoked under the current government. He is said to have had access to the highest levels in the State hierarchy, which he abused to his own advantage. The kid-glove treatment for such issues raises questions about the police administration in Maharashtra. Some charges against Mr. Deshmukh can be proved only partially, while others may remain disputed. One can also expect the State government to launch an offensive against Mr. Singh, who may have some influential friends in Delhi and the Opposition in the State Assembly. The episode, hence, naturally, has acquired huge political overtones. We can expect some fireworks for the next few weeks in the form of mutual trading of charges. And in such an environment, the common man’s trust in the police administration is irretrievably eroded. The cynical truth is that perhaps none of the 30-odd police forces in India can claim that it is corruption-free or that its personnel policies are so transparent that they cannot be tinkered with by the political bosses. The difference between States in degrees of maladministration is, hence, only marginal. The point, however, is that the fair name of the Maharashtra Police has been besmirched beyond repair by the mudslinging. A Supreme Court-monitored investigation may reasonably be expected to clear the air. The question is, how can such an investigation be fair with the accused Home Minister still in the saddle? The Maharashtra Chief Minister cannot shirk his responsibility in the matter. He needs to ask his Home Minister to step aside till he is cleared by an impartial high-level enquiry. SC’s intervention Although the Supreme Court has declined to intervene, public interest may soon demand that the court takesuo motucognisance of what has been going on in the Mumbai Police. This is because the episode has serious implications for the police nationally. It will be ideal if the court orders a probe by a team comprising primarily officers from outside Maharashtra. The model prescribed by the court in 2008 in the 2002 Gujarat riots cases should work in Maharashtra as well. Anything short of this will not seem credible and may not be able to ferret out the truth. Complex questions It may be remembered that in 2006, inPrakash Singh vs Union of India, the top court led by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal went quite far in issuing specific instructions, including a fixed two-year tenure for the Director-General of Police (DGP) to ensure the independence of police from the executive. It is an entirely different matter that many States were slow to act on these directives. It is again debatable whether a rigid procedure for the appointment of a DGP and a fixed tenure of two years have helped make the latter a fearless entity, who would dare to ignore illegal directions from the executive. Furthermore, even if the DGP is firm and honest, an unscrupulous political executive can just circumvent him and operate directly through the District Superintendent of Police (SP) or police station staff, who are highly vulnerable to threats. There is no remedy for this yet. Ultimately, one may be inclined to believe that public expectations of police autonomy are hard to reach. Operating in a highly politicised atmosphere, where, at the drop of a hat, the ruling party can pressure the police to foist cases against those in the opposition, how can the force be completely insulated? There is, however, no point in lambasting the political class without talking about the lack of integrity within the police forces themselves. India has often seen shocking episodes of individual policemen, including those in the coveted Indian Police Service (IPS), indulging unabashedly in large-scale corruption. This is despite the fact that police salaries have improved considerably, along with other welfare measures like healthcare and housing. Even more striking is the fact that the IPS has many bright and dedicated officers with commendable idealism and high professional standards. If these young men and women themselves have not been able to give us honest policing, the future is indeed bleak. Mere finger-pointing at politicians will not salvage the Indian police from its current sorry plight.

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Remoteness is no hindrance to academic excellence||How many Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) should India have, and what should these institutes try to achieve? In their article, “Too many IITs, unrealistic expectations” (The Hindu , February 20), Philip G. Altbach and Eldho Mathews (https://bit.ly/3ubAri5) suggest that there should be between 10 to 12 IITs, that these institutes ought to be situated in big urban areas, and that they should focus on being “crown jewels”. Excellence in education depends on the quality of mentorship; not on the size or location of campuses. To improve, faculties should be made bigger, and recruitment yardsticks should focus on quality and not quantity. Core functions The core functions of an engineering school are to: guide students along as they inquire and discover their interests in science and engineering; engage students with the interactions between technology, society, economics and the environment; prepare students for working careers as designers and gadget-makers, but also as entrepreneurs; invent new gadgets and discover new science, and enmesh all of these activities with local developmental needs. Overall, education at the higher secondary and college levels is really a nourishment that society produces to meet and bless the intense energies of young adults. A lack of language and study skills causes some students to falter. Anecdotally, about a quarter of the incoming undergraduates need extra training and confidence-building measures in using the English language. Because the admission system is a testocracy, almost all the incoming students need to be dissuaded away from a mindset that focuses on strategic maximisation of points on multiple choice questions, and instead need to be goaded toward free inquiry and whole-problem tackling. A key problem in most engineering colleges is that the students should not only become skilled engineers but should also train to speak and write clearly. Helping the new The solution at many IITs has been to set aside time and resources towards initiating incoming students into college level education. At IIT Mandi in Himachal Pradesh for example, a five-week induction programme gently welcomes them into the academic setting and helps them feel at home. This phase also breaks the ice between students and faculty, making it easy for the students to get in touch with their teachers. This useful programme requires time and mentorship effort from faculty members. The curriculum at IIT Mandi includes courses from a design and innovation stream, which includes a mandatory socio-technical practicum (https://bit.ly/2PbJpNy). This particular course has seen significant enrolment of visiting international students. A substantial final year project can be nourishing and fulfilling for anyone completing an academic degree, because it presents an opportunity for focused work bringing together different strands of knowledge and skills on a concrete problem. Sadly, at many IITs, including the “crown jewels”, this final project is no longer mandatory. One of the key reasons for this regression is that the student strength has been increased without an accompanying, proportionate increase in faculty strength. For all these reasons, and because our faculty salaries are lower than the international norms, it makes sense to hire many more faculty members than we do now. In a labour-surplus country like India, just as Arun Maira has suggested for the economy at large, we should readily use all the skilled labour that we can muster. Recruitment and retention Prof. Altbach and Prof. Mathews claim that faculty recruitment is such a big problem; that only around a dozen IITs can be comfortably staffed with world-class faculty. If faculty recruitment was indeed such a big problem, then why would sensible organisations dare to invest in private institutions such as Jio University, Mahindra Ecole Centrale, Shiv Nadar University, Krea University, and SRM University to name a few? There are two existing problems with recruiting and retaining faculty members; both are self-made, and both can be solved. The first problem is that not enough faculty members are hired, and that those hired are burdened with additional tasks such as running the canteen, etc. If there is indeed a scarcity of qualified faculty applicants, then would it be reasonable to burden the hired researchers with non-academic responsibilities such as: running the canteen, managing the placement cell, and managing tenders for various campus building works? The second problem is that of inconsistency and group think in the hiring committees. Typically, recruitment has two stages: shortlisting by the hiring institute, and an interview in front on a panel that consists of mostly professors from outside the hiring institute. If at the first stage, the shortlisting is done mechanically, then good and sometimes even excellent candidates can be weeded out. In specific, if shortlisting is done on the basis of the number of papers, size of grants won and the like, then those hired may be mediocre, paper-manufacturing mills. A better alternative is possible by reversing the existing two stages in recruitment, and explicitly flagging quality as a merit. First, the external experts should prepare a short shortlist, and then the local hiring committees should attempt hiring from within this shortlist. The applicants should be required to submit information demonstrating the best aspects of their work. Each applicant should be asked to provide, in addition to their full curriculum vitae, their two best research publications, and their two best pedagogic materials such as a homework assignment or examination. At the first stage, the external professors could prepare a shortlist based solely on the two best publications and sample pedagogic materials. The statistics of outcomes of the external expert assessments can also supply clearer indications, of whether or not there is really a shortage of qualified applicants. A waning fantasy is that only large companies and organisations can invent new technologies. This belief has been demolished by so many start-ups in the past few decades, that nowadays, even Prime Ministers preach the virtues of a start-up culture. So, why would anyone have low expectations from the smaller IITs, or from small but well-funded private colleges? According to the Times Higher Education ranking for the last year, the IITs at Ropar (Punjab) and Indore (Madhya Pradesh) are within the top 100 young universities of the world. But even ignoring such superficial rankings, the details are promising — the growth of IIT Mandi for example (https://bit.ly/3dbybAg). This IIT has as international a resident faculty body as any other IIT. In the last year, this IIT was seventh in the Atal innovativeness ranking (https://bit.ly/3m5i6jQ); an IIT Mandi project that developed a landslide warning system won the SKOCH award (https://bit.ly/39rcxa9). Examples abroad Remoteness is not a hindrance to excellence. Cornell University is located in the heart of rural New England, and has been excellent from even before the Internet age. And Cornell has a thriving start-up scene, even though the campus is not surrounded by industries. Japan’s newest world class University, the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, is in the most remote corner within its territory, Okinawa island. In the coming post-COVID-19 future, remoteness that is hand-in-hand with connectedness may even attract start-ups. Maben Rabi is a Professor at the Østfold University College, Norway. He received a B.Tech. degree from IIT Madras, and has worked as an Assistant Professor at IIT Mandi||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/remoteness-is-no-hindrance-to-academic-excellence/article34202367.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||The fine print in Hindutva||Modern democracies are erected upon the twin pillars of rights and representation. While rights define the minimum due of individuals and communities vis-à-vis the state, representation enables the diverse voices in a polity to be heard. However, most critiques interrogate Hindutva through the limited lens of representation, arguing that it essentially represents interests of upper-caste Hindus. This is a misleading claim. A case in point is West Bengal, where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 18 seats in the last Lok Sabha election and secured 40.3% of votes, including five out of 10 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and both the seats reserved for the Scheduled Tribes. This is not an exception. Earlier, the BJP registered victories in Tripura and Uttar Pradesh and has continually dominated Madhya Pradesh and Bihar on the back of widespread subaltern support. Even then, academia is in denial about the ideological resonance of Hindutva among the subaltern sections because of a flawed understanding of the Hindutva project and its relationship with the politics of representation. A tool for mobilisation The claim that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) aspires to revive an old, ritually sanctioned, caste-based social order is incorrect. Often, examples like the introduction of policies like reservations for Economically Weaker Sections are advanced to bolster this claim, ignoring the fact that parties like the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, and the Janata Dal (United), which were catapulted to power by the Mandal agitation, put up only a tokenistic opposition to it. The ambition of Hindutva is not restricted to pushing a certain policy — it is to convert Hinduism into an ethnic order and reconstitute it as a race, a term repeatedly employed by Savarkar. This entails the process of simultaneous inclusion of the marginalised within Hinduism and the exclusion of the Muslim and Christian ‘other’. As a result, Hindutva has always nurtured a disdain for rituals. They are only a means of political mobilisation and reinforcing the Hindu identity, bereft of any innate sanctity. This is apparent in the party’s duplicitous stance on eating beef, a practice it opposes in the Hindi belt but condones in the northeast. In India, the imposition of a modern state on a traditional society under colonialism destabilised the Hindu social order and gave rise to the politics of Hindutva and social justice. Modernity provided the hitherto unavailable language of rights and mechanisms of representation. Marginalised communities used these resources for ensuring upward mobility through representation and complemented it with struggles for moral and spiritual self-determination. The latter primarily included demands for inclusion within the Hindu fold via renegotiation of tradition. It was only when these demands of renegotiation remained unfulfilled that a section of subaltern communities rejected Hinduism and embraced Buddhism. In the post-Independence era, while the JP movement presented an ideological critique of the excesses of the state and foregrounded the safeguarding of the rights of citizens, the parties born out of the movement gradually embraced the politics of ‘impoverished representation’, wherein who was being represented became the sole concern, while what values were being represented ceased to matter. It is this model of ideologically unanchored identity politics, based solely on representation, which paved the way for Hindutva’s rise. The project has cracked the code of such representational politics and successfully mobilised subaltern communities, producing a string of subaltern leaders like Narendra Modi, Uma Bharti, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Keshav Prasad Maurya, Renu Devi, Tarkishore Prasad, Sarbananda Sonowal, Dilip Ghosh, etc. It must be emphasised that while the BJP has left the representational matrix untouched, it has clamped down on the domain of rights, as is evident by wanton invocation of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the introduction of laws against ‘love jihad’, steamrolling Bills through Parliament, enabling opaque political funding through electoral bonds, facilitating the corporate takeover of the economy and destabilising elected State governments. The present model of the politics of representation is incapable of addressing these issues that confront our democracy. Democratisation has increased the thrust towards ritualistic inclusion within Hinduism, and hence, it seems unlikely that mere representational rejigging will dent Hindutva’s hegemony. A challenge to Hindutva requires a complete reorientation of politics from demographic imperatives to democratic ones, for which the opposition needs to foreground issues of rights and transparency along with representation.

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||A road to progress||The achievements of women dairy farmers in contributing to India’s ‘White Revolution’ are perhaps the greatest cause for celebrating the Women’s History Month in March. That this has happened despite around a majority of dairy farmers owning only small landholdings — typically households with two to five cows — is also a testament to the success of the dairy cooperatives models that were at the heart of Operation Flood. The approach made it possible to enhance backward and forward linkages in the dairy value chain, paving the way for freeing small farmers from the clutches of middlemen, and guaranteed minimum procurement price for milk. A study by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) indicates that 93% of women farmers who receive training alongside financial support succeed in their ventures, compared to the 57% success rate of those who receive financial aid alone. Institutionalising such inputs, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) now organises farmer’s orientation programmes across the country, under which women farmers are trained in scientific best practices on animal health, fodder quality, clean milk production, and accounts management. Enhanced incomes According to latest data, there are more than 1,90,000 dairy cooperative societies across the country, with approximately 6 million women members. A study conducted on Women Dairy Cooperative Society (WDCS) members across Rajasthan showed that with the income generated through dairying, 31% of the women had converted their mud houses to cement structures, while 39% had constructed concrete sheds for their cattle. Importantly, women-led cooperatives also provide fertile ground for grooming women from rural areas for leadership positions. In many instances, this becomes the first step for women in breaking free from traditional practices. This was amply demonstrated through the testimonials of women dairy farmers highlighted by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying on the International Women’s Day earlier this month. Among the many stories that stood out, it was heartening to hear the account of Prem Bai from Rajasthan who never had access to education or formal employment but experienced a life transformation after she became a member of the Bhilwara Milk Union. She is now the main breadwinner in her family and recently bought 25 acres of land with the income she earned through dairy farming. Another major challenge in this sector is information asymmetry among farmers. Statistics indicate that small and marginal farmers have access to only 50-70% of the resources that large and medium farmers have. Once again, the presence of collectives in the form of cooperatives and milk unions plays a significant role in enhancing the knowledge and bargaining power of women. Women-led companies Recent years have seen the rise of women-led dairy unions and companies. To this end, the NDDB has played a proactive role in setting up women-led producer enterprises like Shreeja Mahila Milk Producer Company, which was started with 24 women and now has more than 90,000 members, with an annual turnover of approximately Rs. 450 crore. Last year, Amul Dairy released a list of 10 women dairy farmers who became millionaires by selling milk to the company. For instance, Navalben Dalsangbhai Chaudhary from Vadgam earned almost Rs. 88 lakh by selling 2,21,595 kg of milk in 2019-20, and Malvi Kanuben from Dhanera earned about Rs. 74 lakh by selling 2,50,745 kg of milk. Innovation in organisational structures has also spurred consistent growth in this sector. These testimonials of individual women dairy farmers are all the more remarkable for the fact that many of them have not had a formal education, but through the process of dairying and working with larger collectives, such as milk unions and cooperatives, they have mastered the nuances of finance and marketing.

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Territorial battle||A month after the Congress government in Puducherry was brought down through engineered resignations of its legislators, the Union Territory is preparing for an Assembly election that could transform its political landscape. It is a battle that would primarily test a wounded Congress’s ability to woo the electorate by playing the victim card and the BJP’s strength on the ground. A political non-entity till then, the BJP had only token political representation through three nominated MLAs. Five years ago, 29 of its 30 candidates forfeited their deposit. Now, it is contesting in nine seats in an alliance led by the All India N.R. Congress (16 seats); the AIADMK gets five seats. The Congress has ceded ground to its allies, allotting 13 seats to the DMK and one each to the CPI and the VCK. It is contesting only in 14 of its 15 constituencies — seven fewer than in 2016. In Yanam, the second seat from where AINRC leader and former CM N. Rangasamy is contesting, it has skipped fielding anyone. In an election season where perceptions somewhat influence public reception, the Congress has done itself little good by not fielding former CM V. Narayanasamy. The BJP has gone to town claiming he is scared to face the people. The battle is essentially between these two alliances. The BJP with its insatiable political appetite is not merely fancying its chances on the strength it draws from the Central government. Irrespective of the outcome, it is in mission mode hoping to make electoral inroads. The manner in which its leaders, parachuted from Karnataka, camped for months to not only wean away Congress and DMK MLAs but also engage with voters through its ‘page pramukhs ’, points to its determination. It has allegedly begun directly contacting voters using phone numbers linked to Aadhaar cards, which the Madras High Court has directed the UIDAI to probe. Projecting the erstwhile Congress government as being incapable of delivering on its promises, the BJP is pushing the development agenda. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to make Puducherry the ‘BEST’ — a Business hub, Education hub, Spiritual hub and Tourist hub. Though Mr. Rangasamy has declared himself the CM candidate, the BJP is stubborn that legislators will elect the head of government. Given this political game plan, the Congress cannot hope to win sympathy by merely screaming about the “murder of democracy” and the governance hurdles posed by former Lt. Gov. Kiran Bedi. It will have to work with the DMK, leaving behind the bitterness over conceding more seats, if it wants to earnestly challenge the BJP. For the people, the attraction of the BJP is the access it provides to central funds. But the tenure of Ms. Bedi was not the best advertisement for what the ruling party at the Centre can do.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/territorial-battle/article34202358.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Good neighbours||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the war of liberation and the centenary year of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and his meetings with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina showcased the deep history the two nations share, their future plans and the challenges ahead. At the events, which included an emotive ceremony in Dhaka, a cultural programme, India’s conferring of the Gandhi Peace Prize posthumously on Mujib, and a visit by Mr. Modi to the Bangabandhu (Mujib) memorial at his hometown in Tungipara, the leaders paid homage to the nation’s founders, millions massacred by the Pakistani military regime in 1971, and those who died fighting for Bangladeshi freedom, including nearly 4,000 Indian soldiers. India’s role in the creation of Bangladesh was highlighted by Ms. Hasina as she thanked India for its aid, and later, for providing her shelter when members of her family, including her father Mujib, were assassinated. Mr. Modi wrote in an editorial of the hope for a Shonali Adhyaya (Golden Chapter) in South Asia that Bangabandhu may have brought about had he not been killed. The two leaders built on their December 2020 (virtual) meet by bolstering plans for connectivity and infrastructure projects with a framework for cooperation on trade, along with other MoUs on sports, education and disaster management. India-Bangladesh ties in the past 15 years, since Ms. Hasina was elected, have been marked by new areas of cooperation and an ability to resolve specific differences. Ms. Hasina’s decision, beginning 2009, to shut down anti-India terror camps and to hand over nearly two dozen of India’s “most wanted”, reversed mistrust. Mr. Modi’s push to conclude the long-pending Land Boundary Agreement in 2015, and to accept an international tribunal verdict in favour of Bangladesh that resolved a 40-year-old maritime dispute, built confidence as well. Other issues, if unresolved, could pose challenges. The joint statement noted the need to resolve the dispute over Teesta water sharing, and six other rivers. The problem of Bangladeshi civilians being killed at the border has dented relations. The Modi government’s concerns over the treatment of Hindus, an impetus for the CAA, were highlighted as the PM performed two temple poojas and addressed a rally of minority Matua Hindus. The visits raised eyebrows in India as they took place even as West Bengal went to vote, but it became clear they will have repercussions in Bangladesh as well: protests against Mr. Modi’s visit turned violent, with at least 11 members of the Hefazat-e-Islam shot dead by police, and reprisal violence against the Hindu minority by Islamist mobs. The events only underline the need for a deeper understanding on both sides of the sensitivities of the India-Bangladesh relationship, even as its many successes are counted and celebrated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/good-neighbours/article34202357.ece

31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Inflation at worrisome levels, oil prices will keep up pressure’||Inflation has breached comfort levels and assumed ‘worrisome’ proportions in India, Moody’s Analytics on Tuesday said in a note on Asia’s inflation worries driven by rising oil prices. Stressing that India’s retail inflation has been breaching the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) 4% inflation target for the past eight months, the financial intelligence firm said India and Philippines are the two notable exceptions — in Asia — where inflation is beyond the comfort level. “Volatile food prices and rising oil prices led India’s CPI (consumer price inflation) to exceed the upper band of 6% several times in 2020, inhibiting the RBI’s ability to keep accommodative monetary settings in place during the height of the pandemic. Higher fuel prices will keep upward pressure on headline CPI and keep the RBI from offering further rate cuts,” said the firm, which operates independently of Moody’s Investors Service, the credit rating agency. The firm said that India is expected to retain its current retail inflation targeting framework for monetary policy, with a target of 4% and a margin of 2% above and below that.

Mistry on Tuesday signalled he was bringing the curtain down on the four-year-long legal battle with the Tata Group over his abrupt ouster in October 2016 as he expressed ‘personal disappointment’ with the Supreme Court’s verdict in the case while adding he and his family would “take the knocks on our chins”. The court last week ruled in favour of Tata Sons and set aside a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) decision to reinstate Mr. Mistry as its Executive Chairman. “Every member of society looks to institutions such as courts to validate and endorse the appropriateness of his or her actions and beliefs,” Mr. Mistry said in a statement. “As a minority shareholder of Tata Sons, I am personally disappointed by the outcome of the judgment with respect to our case. Although I will no longer be able to influence the direction of governance of the Tata Group directly, I hope that the issues I have raised, will cause deeper reflection and influence individuals concerned to catalyse change. I sleep with a clear conscience,” he added.  ‘Board driven system’ Expressing gratitude for the opportunity to lead the Tata group, he said, “My aim at Tata... was to ensure a robust board driven system of decision making and governance that is larger than any one individual. “A key focus was to enable the directors on various boards to discharge their fiduciary duties without fear or favour, while still ensuring that shareholders views were reflected in strategy and actions,” he said. “It continues to be my belief that it is by such a model, that one would protect value for all stakeholders in Tata Sons and its various Group companies,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mistry-signals-end-to-tussle/article34202335.ece

31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Passenger vehicle segment may post 25% growth in FY22’||The passenger vehicle (PV) segment in India is expected to grow up to 25% in 2021-22, even as shortage of semiconductors will continue to remain a key challenge for the industry, ratings agency ICRA said on Tuesday. “The Indian passenger vehicle (PV) industry is expected to post an impressive growth of 22-25% for FY2022, after a 2-4% de-growth in FY2021,” the agency said, adding that the growth would be on a lower base of Q1 FY2021, primarily due to industry slowdown and the pandemic impact. “Demand has remained strong post the festive seasons as both retail and wholesale dispatches witnessed recovery,” said Ashish Modani, VP, ICRA. “The industry clocked the best-ever volume during H2 FY2021, primarily driven by inventory restocking and pent-up demand,” he added. “Also, as demand sentiments improved, discounts offered during the lean phase eased substantially,” Mr. Modani said. In case the growth momentum sustained, the industry could surpass earlier peak volume of FY2019 in FY2022, ICRA said in a statement. The agency added that the semiconductor shortage was a key challenge in Q1 FY2022 as the automotive industry accounted for 12% of the global semiconductor demand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/passenger-vehicle-segment-may-post-25-growth-in-fy22/article34202346.ece

The 22-year-old, unseeded here, provided yet another glimpse of his growing stature by shocking fourth-seeded Frenchman Sebastien Bonmalais 11-7, 11-7, 11-8 to progress to the quarterfinals in the PSA Challenger Tour squash tournament here on Tuesday. Against Bonmalais, ranked 87 places higher than him, Abhay played a largely error-free game. “I was playing my best squash before the lockdown and I feel like I’ve just picked up from there,” he said after the match.

31 March 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pant appointed DC skipper||Star India batsman Rishabh Pant was on Tuesday named captain of Delhi Capitals in place of an injured Shreyas Iyer for the IPL beginning on April 9. “Under Shreyas’ captaincy, our team reached newer heights, and he is going to be missed immensely. In his absence, the franchise has collectively picked Rishabh to lead the team this year,” DC chairman and co-owner Kiran Kumar Gandhi said in a release. This will be the 23-year-old Pant’s debut as IPL captain. The wicketkeeper-batsman has captained Delhi’s State team in the past. “Delhi is where I grew up, and where my IPL journey began six years ago. To lead this team one day is a dream I’ve always harboured. And today, as that dream comes true, I feel humbled,” Pant said. Shreyas described Pant as the best player to lead the Delhi side. “When I sustained the shoulder injury, and Delhi Capitals needed a leader for this edition of the IPL, I had no doubt that Rishabh would be the best man for the job,” he said. Head coach Ricky Ponting said Pant’s success in the series against Australia and England will give him the confidence needed to take on the new role. “This is a tremendous opportunity for young Rishabh, who is coming off successful stints against Australia and England which will no doubt give him the confidence needed to take on a new role that comes with a lot more responsibility,” the former Australian captain said. Co-owner Parth Jindal said Pant embodies DC’s passionate and fearless brand of cricket. “Delhi Capitals as a team plays a passionate and fearless brand of cricket, and Rishabh Pant embodies that best. The Delhi team has played an important role in his growth as a cricketer.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pant-appointed-dc-skipper/article34202469.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Time for a rotation policy as another full year looms for India||England’s policy of rotating their players is one that India should follow. In the two important series recently, in Australia and at home against England, rotation was forced upon India by injuries. Only Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane played all eight Tests. The IPL is set to commence on April 9 and before the next round in 2022, India are scheduled to play 14 Tests (six away), 12 ODIs and 22 T20Is. These, besides World T20 in India in October. If the Asia Cup is held in Sri Lanka in June, India might send a second string team which is as capable of winning as their first as the recent matches have shown. All that is a lot of cricket. It is particularly harsh if quarantines and secure bio bubbles remain. Managing players’ workloads will have to be priority. Skipper Virat Kohli has suggested that players need to be spoken to and consulted before tours are finalised. “Otherwise,” he has been quoted as saying, “it will be a case of who can last through difficult times like these.” Through a combination of well-planned bubbles, player discipline, and good fortune, India played through the pandemic year without casualties, and without, so far as we know, significant mental issues. But the pressures of playing in such conditions cannot be exaggerated. India discovered some fabulous performers in this period, and whatever the format, a newcomer did enough to leave the management with the comfortable feeling that the conveyor belt is moving smoothly. Back on the comeback trail Already some heroes of recent seasons — Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav — have had to move on to the comeback trail from the clear path they had made for themselves. Wriddhiman Saha, till recently the No. 1 wicketkeeper, has had to stand behind Rishabh Pant in the queue as both ’keeper and batsman. So well have the newcomers from Axar Patel to Mohammed Siraj and Shubman Gill to Ishan Kishan performed that it is difficult to decide which is the country’s first eleven in any format. That regulars like Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja were hardly missed is a tribute to the Indian system which seems to be training specialists in the manner of a superior professional college. Yet, it is when things are looking their best that we tend to get complacent and believe that the conveyor belt will never stop. As Kohli has hinted, good things do not happen by accident. They have to be planned for. The fact that replacements are readily available means that players will be reluctant to take a break mid-series. The think tank, consisting of the coaches, captain and selectors will have to chart out a rest-and-recuperation plan and communicate this to the players to win their support for the scheme. India have been playing as a team for a while now, but some individuals — as has been traditionally the case — are more equal than others. You only have to imagine a Test match (or any match) without Virat Kohli. Television and sponsors (and later, spectators) will actively discourage that. And if India don’t win, there will be hell to pay. When Ed Smith, the England selector, first proposed rotating the players (although other have talked about it but given it up when it came to the crunch), there were misgivings. As I am sure there will be should India decide to take that route. But players need to be looked after. Jimmy Anderson is convinced that the system has extended his career. From ‘Anderson and (Stuart) Broad’, England are a team of ‘Anderson or Broad’. Crucial In times of pandemic and uncertainty, the rotation policy is especially crucial. As England’s head coach Chris Silverwood said, “We have to look after our players. I don’t think it’s acceptable to push somebody until they break and then try and pick them up.” Jonny Bairstow was probably speaking for the players when he said, “The benefit is that you get to go home, sleep in your own bed, cook your own food, be with your family, and have a complete mental refresh. You know how tough it is not being able to leave the hotel, dining at separate tables…” Indian players have traditionally been wary of missing a match, sometimes even hiding injury in case the chance never came again. A system of rotation ensures a bigger pool of players to choose from, greater care for those chosen and longer careers. It is acknowledgement that cricket is a team game, and individual records are not as important as team performances. It is useful to remember that none of the bowlers who won India the final Test in Australia (Brisbane), and maybe a couple of batsmen too might have played had the full team been fit and available. You can’t know these things till you know.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/time-for-a-rotation-policy-as-another-full-year-looms-for-india/article34202350.ece
31 March 2021||Sarajevo,||Edin Dzeko — rising from the rubble of war-torn Sarajevo to stardom||At 35, Edin Dzeko is both the star and old man of a Bosnia team he will lead against France in 2022 World Cup qualifying on Wednesday, but he owes his long career to the time his mother would not let him play football. One day, during the bloody siege of Sarajevo, the young Dzeko asked his mother if he could go outside to play football. She said no. A bomb exploded on the pitch, killing several children. Dzeko is in the autumn of a career in which he has won league titles in Germany and England. He has scored just seven league goals in 20 Serie A matches for Roma this season and none since he hit the winner against Sampdoria in early January. The future Wolfsburg, Manchester City and Roma forward was only six years old in 1992 when the war broke out. Soulless neighbourhood Dzeko spent most of his childhood in Otoka, a soulless neighbourhood on the outskirts of Sarajevo, whose 30-storey brutalist skyscrapers offered some shelter from Serbian snipers lurking in the hills above. His father, who was in the Bosnian army, recalls that local children waited for the gunfire to die down before heading downstairs to hit the ball around. “It was risky, but the children had to play somewhere,” Dzeko’s father Midhad, 66, told AFP. The skinny blonde-haired lad quickly outgrew the concrete football pitch nested between the skyscrapers, and enrolled in the academy of Zeljeznicar, one of two major Bosnian clubs. On the frontline Since its stadium was on the frontline and ploughed with trenches, children trained in a school gym. His coach Jusuf Sehovic, who died of coronavirus last year, told AFP in 2018 that he remembered a kid who “was only interested in advancing towards the goal”. Iso Ahmetovic, who is still a coach in Zeljeznicar, recalls a passing drill involving seven boys including Dzeko. Some pensioners were gawking at the exercise from behind a fence. “At that time, Andriy Shevchenko was the best player in the world. I turned around and said, ‘Look at him, he’s the new Shevchenko’,” Ahmetovic told AFP. When Dzeko broke into the Zeljeznicar senior team, he was “the same height he is now (1.93m), with probably 25 kilos less”, Amar Osim, the manager who guided Zeljeznicar to five national titles told AFP. “But he had exceptional qualities and an incredible ability to score goals,” he explained. He was “obsessed” and “wanted to become a real player”, Osim recalled. Osim was one of the few to spot his potential. Dzeko, who often played as a midfielder, scored only five goals in some 40 appearances for “Zeljo”, and was criticised for being too slow and having poor technique. Jiri Plisek, a coach who had worked briefly in Zeljeznicar, persuaded the towering youngster to follow him to Czech side Teplice. After shipping Dzeko out for peanuts, former Zeljeznicar chairman was quoted saying he thought the club had “won the lottery” by selling Dzeko. Determined youngster But the lanky youngster was determined. His teammate at Teplice, Samir Merzic, recalls a player of “incredible self-confidence”. “He was 19 years old when we played against Sparta Prague. He was facing Tomas Repka, who had just returned from England, a gladiator. But Edin faced him without fear”, Merzic told AFP. “It’s all in the head,” Dzeko’s father Midhad said. “Edin is solid, strong, stable. He has been through a lot in life and in football. He knew how to deal with pressure and how to cope,” he added. Despite living abroad for 16 years, Dzeko keeps close ties with Bosnia.  He does humanitarian work with his wife Amra, focusing on sick children in the poor Balkan country. In 2012, he was at Manchester City when someone reported that a seriously ill Bosnian teenager was being treated in Manchester. “I was dozing in bed ... At one point I saw Dzeko, him, his mother and his father. At first I thought I was dreaming,” Aner Zelic, who is now 24, told AFP. Dzeko took care of the boy’s family financially, but above all, provided “moral support”. “Whenever he had time, he came to spend time with me in the hospital. “We played board games, PlayStation, cards. We didn’t talk about my illness, but about other things, especially sports, to make me forget all that,” the young man recalled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/edin-dzeko-rising-from-the-rubble-of-war-torn-sarajevo-to-stardom/article34202708.ece

Impressive CV Within a matter of a few months, he has been able to transform Gokulam into a champion side. He has had coaching stints in countries like Italy, Ghana, Latvia, Armenia, Estonia and Palestine. His CV reads even more impressive after leading Gokulam to the I-League title. “This is my greatest moment as a coach,” Annese told The Hindu here on Saturday. “For a coach, there is nothing like winning the league.” He said he believed his team could do it, even before the league kicked off, but he decided the strategy had to be changed. “I had done my research on Gokulam and Indian football in general before I came here,” he said. “I felt there is too much focus on defence and cleansheets in Indian football.” Focus on attack He said he wanted to change that. “Here most teams prefer the 4-4-2 system, but I have adopted 4-3-3 for Gokulam,” Annese said. “I ask my boys to think of attacking all the time, but I also ensure that my defenders are ready for counterattacks from our rivals.” He said he was confident Gokulam could comeback even when the team was trailing against TRAU with just 20 minutes left in the decider. “I had faith in my boys,” he said. “Of course I was delighted that we won the game 4-1; I love to see more goals.” Gokulam ended up scoring 31 goals, the most in the 11-team league. Eleven of those goals scored by Ghanain striker Denny Antwi, who proved a great pick by Annese. “He was superb and I thought striker Philip Adjah and defender Mohamed Awal (who are also from Ghana) too did very well,” he said. “And, of course, Sharif Mukhammad (from Afghanistan) was brilliant in the midfield.” Annese is also mighty impressed with the 20-year-old midfielder Emil Benny, who was named the Player-of-the-Match against Churchill and Best Emerging Player. “He has a great future,” said the coach. Annese, who had been tracking the ISL and the I-League even before his arrival here, said there was talent in Indian football. “But Indian football needs better coaches,” he said. He certainly showed what a good coach to do a club that is only four years old.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/how-annese-turned-gokulam-into-a-champion-side/article34202508.ece

31 March 2021||London,||‘Glass found inside Archer’s finger’||An accident while cleaning his fish tank was the cause of Jofra Archer’s hand injury that troubled him during the series against India. Apart from an elbow issue, a glass fragment was found lodged in the England pacer’s right middle finger that had to be operated upon. England’s director of cricket Ashley Giles made this revelation while giving an update on Archer, who underwent the surgery on Monday. The elbow problem has ruled him out of the initial part of this year’s IPL. “They (surgeons) have operated and I think they found a small fragment of glass still in attendance. It obviously healed but there was part of the fish tank still in his finger,” Giles said on BBC’s Tuffers and Vaughan show, as reported by ESPNcricinfo . “This is going to sound like an awful conspiracy ... but it’s true. But, yeah, he was cleaning at home. He dropped the fish tank, cut his hand, and he’s been in surgery...”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/glass-found-inside-archers-finger/article34202458.ece

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Nirguna and Saguna||Sastras face an inherent paradox when guiding those engaged in the quest for Eternal Truth. The fact is that none can claim to know fully the Infinite and the Indescribable Brahman. It is not possible to explain an abstract truth not bound by place, time, space, form, or qualities, etc. But from the Upanishads, it is also evident that many seers steeped in meditation have had revelations that they have tried to record. At best, these are glimpses into the Eternal Truth. That is why in the spiritual tradition, the theoretical perception of Nirguna Brahman is balanced with the easily accessible concept of Saguna Brahman with infinite forms, countless names and auspicious attributes, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. This is a sure way to enable people to grasp the essence of this truth as well as engage in worship that will ultimately lead to enlightenment. For instance, in the Saundarya Lahari, Adi Sankara teaches the way to worship the very Brahman as Mother Goddess. The basic teaching in the sastras exhorts all of us to honour one’s parents and preceptor on a par with God. Reference to the mother is primary and it indicates the close relationship that each one has with the mother. Conversely, when the perception of the Eternal Truth as Mother Goddess is advocated, it engenders an easy and natural form of worship by all in everyday life. What better way to adore the Divine Mother, who is always full of compassion to all beings though She is ever the Supreme One in all ways? As a caring mother, She is ever ready to grant all the wishes of Her children during their lifetime while taking responsibility for the welfare of their atma. She guides them to tread the path of righteousness by revealing the evil effects of sin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nirguna-and-saguna/article34202441.ece

31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Shridhar Venkataramana||Like Rahul, the one thing that helped Shridhar Venkataramana to stay afloat during the quarantine were virtual shows. “Most of the known comedians from the industry got on a call to figure out how virtual shows must be done. Something as basic as putting out your payment link or scheduling shows was discussed so that everyone could have a better understanding of how things work. Some comedians also hosted open mics so that others could perform along with them. The Indian comedy circuit stuck together in those times and that is what has helped all of us sail through,” says Shridhar. But long before the pandemic, Shridhar had realised that he did not need shows and tours for people to hear his jokes. Social media was enough. “During the lockdown, the engagement on my accounts increased as my frequency of putting out jokes was more and people were online a lot, he says. However, being in isolation and not being able to perform was taking a toll, admits Shridhar. “A set develops when the comedian tries his jokes several times in front of an audience and tweaks it depending on their reaction. But with the lockdown, that process halted,” he says. But Shridhar believes that virtual shows are here to stay. “Virtual shows break down the geographical barriers and take you to people and places across the globe. Though the virtual shows may not be an ideal way to perform, they are the most convenient ones and the pandemic gave us that,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/shridhar-venkataramana/article34202672.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Strenuous craft and the laidback craftsman||Biju Menon has time and again surprised audiences with his choice of roles. But the actor himself was taken aback when cinematographer Sanu John Varughese chose to cast him as a 73-year-old in his directorial début, Aarkkariyam .The movie, also starring Parvathy Thiruvothu and Sharafudheen, is scheduled for release on April 1. In an interview with MetroPlus , Biju talks about the challenges involved in playing the character and looks back at his choice of roles. Edited excerpts: On taking up the role inAarkkariyam... I had acted in [Shyamaprasad’s] Elektra (2010) in which Sanu was the cinematographer. We haven’t interacted much after that. One day he called me up to discuss the project. Once I went through the script, he asked me ‘Which role would you like to do?’. I didn’t understand what he meant as I had placed myself in the role of a character in his forties. But Sanu had planned otherwise. The character is Ittiyavera, a retired Maths teacher, and widower living alone in his house at Pala in Kottayam district. He has a daughter, Shirley, settled in Mumbai with her family. Were you comfortable with the idea? Not at all. I could manage playing a 60-year-old but definitely not 73! I thought it would look awkward with make-up and other things. However, Sanu finally convinced me and I agreed to do some sketches although I knew it would be a tightrope walk. Talk us through the transformation... I had to work a lot on the character’s body language, the way he walks, speaks and what not. It was sync sound, which made it all the more difficult. My voice had to match my age. But when I got it right, something would go wrong with the dialect. It took three to four days for me to get a hold on the character. I have never gone through such strain for any other role in my career. We have tried to keep it real and I must thank the cast and crew for the support and encouragement. How would you compare your role Ayyappan Nair in Ayyappanum Koshiyum with Ittiyavera? Age-wise, Ayyappan Nair was not a difficult role. He is in his late 50s and due to retire; I am 50 as well although I don’t look the age! (laughs) You have completed 25 years in the industry. How has your approach to films changed? In the initial days, I just enjoyed the fame that came with the roles. I didn’t go into the nuances of a role. In fact, I rarely got such characters. But films such as Mazha and Meghamalhar made me understand that I should take a serious approach to acting. That is when I started taking better offers out of the lot that came my way. In between, I tried my hand at humour and succeeded to some extent. Even then I never made conscious efforts to land a good role. Actor Prithviraj once remarked that you are one of the most contented persons around. On the other hand, people also call you laidback for not pushing yourself as an actor… I have always gone with the flow. That has been the case with everything in my life including my studies. It is not that I don’t want to try new things. But then I start doubting my abilities and wonder how I would look in that role. That is when I opt for a comfort zone. In fact, after we finished Ayyappanum Koshiyum , [director] Sachy told me, ‘Now don’t look back and do only good roles.’ That was his wish for me before he left us all of a sudden. But unfortunately some big projects had to be postponed due to lockdown. What next? I have completed Lalitham Sundaram with Manju Warrier and will be doing the début project of a director duo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/strenuous-craft-and-the-laidback-craftsman/article34202675.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Playing it my way||Actor Joe John Chacko, who recently starred in Chiri which premièred on Prime Reels, has an optimistic take on the film’s OTT release. “The cinema theatre experience comes first, but OTT platforms offer opportunities to smaller films without a huge star cast. The reach of the medium is wider.”  Chiri was his first film in a lead role, although he has acted in films such as Matchbox and Pranaya Meenukaludey Kadal . “I don’t know if it is anxiety, but now that I have had the time to think about how I played the character, I feel I could have done it differently,” says the 30 year-old actor. The film was shot in 2019, and was due to release in April last year. Films have always been of interest to this mechanical engineer from Thrissur. His family, however, wanted him to complete his education and work before taking the plunge into films. Finally, in 2017, his first film, Matchbox was released and, in 2019 Pranaya Meenukaludey Kadal directed by Kamal.  Chiri , Joe says, is a feel-good film about three friends. The two other leads are played by Kevin Jose and Aneesh Gopal. “It is about what happens to my character, Mathew, when he is about to get married. How his past comes in between the present and so on.” It’s in the blood Getting into films was not easy, despite his famous actor-brother, Shine Tom Chacko. “I don’t like to use his name. I would rather make it on my own.” Does his brother help him with acting tips, or how to navigate the industry?“No, he doesn’t. He lets me do my thing and has asked me to be good on the sets. He doesn’t give me acting tips. That is left to me.” There is more to Joe than acting; he is also scripting a film to be directed by Lal Jose later this year. “I used to write even while in school. And the script I am working on with my friend Yadu is along the lines of a detective thriller.” This project took off, thanks to Shine, “When I mentioned this story to him, he suggested that I could pitch it as a film. That is how I met Lal sir, who liked it and will begin to direct later this year.”  Joe hopes to strike a balance between writing and acting, “I don’t want to separate one from the other, I want both.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/playing-it-my-way/article34202679.ece
31 March 2021||March 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Around India with an easel||On March 28, artist Prasanth KP set off from Kochi on a solo ride across the country on his Royal Enfield. Eighty per cent of the luggage, piled on the back of the bike, comprised art material — easel, canvas, tripod, paint and brushes wrapped in a water-proof bag. He would be painting his way through 16 states or more over 60 days. A rider and traveller, who has undertaken solo trips across South India and travelled up to Gujarat, this is the first time he is combining art with travel. Prasanth plans to complete 100 paintings while on the journey, which would be exhibited in Bengaluru and Kochi after he completes the trip. Instead of the safe confines of a studio, Prasanth as an artist prefers the outdoors. Part of the Kochi chapter of Urban Sketchers, a global community of artists that practises drawing on location in cities, towns or villages that they live in or travel to, Prasanth has painted several parts of the city on site. An advocate of on-location painting, he wishes more artists would get into it. “It is an entirely different experience. You don’t have the comforts of your studio. It is not easy, but it is empowering,” he says. Prasanth is also part of a plein-air watercolour group, a Kochi collective of artists, who paint on location. While on the ride, he will be doing water colours on A3 paper. “It is a challenge, but I have been wanting to do this,” he says. He plans to ride through the hinterlands of the country, meet people, stop whenever he feels like, savour the sights and get to know life as it is. Visiting villages and heritage sites are part of the plan. The paintings would include landscapes, cityscapes and portraits. His first stop would be Pune along the Konkan route and from there, he plans to head to Aurangabad and later to Agra and Delhi. He will be covering Dharamshala, Leh, Srinagar, Kullu-Manali, Varanasi, Gaya, Kolkata and return down the East coast. “If possible, I will visit Nepal and Bhutan as well,” he adds. He will be largely relying on GPS, but would not hesitate to stop and ask for directions. “It is not just the vast expanses and picturesque locations that move me. Inspiration often comes from the interactions I have with people. For me, this journey will be one of self discovery,” he says. He will be meeting urban sketchers in the cities he visits as well. A vlogger, Prasanth would be documenting his journey visually on his YouTube channel. He will publish an art journal as well, of the works he does. Organising a trip such as this is an expensive affair, considering the equipment needed, the fuel and maintenance of the bike, and accommodation. He would be mostly looking at tents and hostels to stay the nights. Those who wish to support him on this journey, however, can buy any of the paintings he does while travelling. He will be post pictures of all the paintings he would do on his instagram handle (@riderstraveldiary). The paintings would be delivered to the buyer after the exhibition, after his return.  Follow Prasanth’s journey on the Riders Travel Diary YouTube channel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/around-india-with-an-easel/article34202677.ece
31 March 2021||JAIPUR,||Cong., BJP candidates file papers for bypolls||The candidates of both the ruling Congress and the Opposition BJP filed their nominations for by-elections to the Rajasthan Assembly at Sujangarh, Sahara and Rajsamand on Saturday, which was the last day for filing of papers. The polling in the three constituencies will be held on April 17. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, travelling with senior Congress leaders in a helicopter, addressed public meetings in the three towns. Mr. Gehlot sought the voters’ support for strengthening his government during its remaining tenure of two-and-a-half years. AICC general secretary Ajay Maken, Pradesh Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra and Tonk MLA and former Deputy CM Sachin Pilot accompanied Mr. Gehlot. All the leaders launched a scathing attack on the BJP and accused the party of creating an “intolerant atmosphere” in the country and ignoring the plight of farmers who were agitating against the Centre's agriculture sector laws. BJP State president Satish Poonia, accompanied by Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shaktawat, Leader of the Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria and Lok Sabha member Diya Kumari, also addressed a public meeting in Rajsamand. Former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje was conspicuous by her absence in the rally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-bjp-candidates-file-papers-for-bypolls/article34202502.ece
